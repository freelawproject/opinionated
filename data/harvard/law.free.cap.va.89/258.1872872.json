Also upon the ground of undue influence exercised upon the grantor, and because the deed was not a fair provision for the children of the grantor. And, moreover, that the grantor in the deed aforesaid had made a will in 1872, which he never had revoked, which will was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">\u201c I, Adam Collup, of Smyth county, Yirginia, being of sound mind and disposing memory, mindful of the uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of life and the certainty of death, do make this, my last will and testament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201c Clause 1st. I will that all my just debts, funeral expenses, and expenses of administration be paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201c Clause 2d. It -is my will that my beloved wife, Sarah, shall have, absolutely, one third of all the estate, (remaining after making proper allowance for the execution of clause first,) both real and personal, of which I may die seized\u2014that is to say, one third in value of my personal property and one third in value of my real estate, including and adjoining the mansion-house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Clause 3d. I devise, will, and bequeath to Thomas J. Smith and his wife, my beloved daughter, Minerva Jane, and heirs, forever, one third of the remaining portion .of the land and one third of the remaining portion, of my personal property, after executing the foregoing provisions made in clauses first and second. \u25a0 . \u2022 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Clause 4th. It is my will that my beloved daughter, \u00ab Frances Collup, shall-he made equal in real estate and personal property to Thomas J. Smith and wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">\u201c Clause 5th. It is my will,that my beloved son, Ezra Sheffey Collup, shall be made equal in real and personal property with my daughter, Frances Collup ; it being my intention to divide equally between my three children the two thirds of my estate remaining after the allotment hereinbefore made to my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Clause 6th. To forever put to rest .any question that may arise as to the legitimacy of my said , children, I hereby acknowledge .and declare-that-my said .daughters, Minerva Jane Smith and Frances Collup, and my son, Ezra Sheffey Collup, though born before my marriage to their mother, who is now my. lawful wife, are truly my children ; and I hereby provide, out.of abundant caution, that any property of mine remaining at my death, and not hereby otherwise disposed of by me, shall be equally divided between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cClause 7th. It is my will that my personal property be appraised by three competent appraisers, to be appointed by Smyth county court or circuit court, and if my wife, or either of my children, including my son-in-law, the said Thomas &lt;7. Smith, should desire to have any of the personal property in kind, that the one so desiring may be permitted to take it at its appraised value as so much upon his or her share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201c Clause 8th. It is my will that the residue of my personal property be sold, and the debts due me,*if-any, collected, and the proceeds divided according to the provisions of this will; and that the division of the lands directed be made by the appraisers, one of whom should be a good surveyor, by metes and bounds, having in view quantity, quality, and value, and be recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of Smyth county court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201c Clause 9th. The children, or legal representative of such of the persons named in the will as may not survive me, are to succeed to their rights under this will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The defendants demurred to the bill, and answered the same, and set forth that Adam Collup departed this life on the 5th day of August, 1889; that in 1872\u2014seventeen years before his death\u2014he did prepare his will, and that he did afterwards, and before his death, and, therefore, before his will became effectual, make the deed in question, signed, sealed, and delivered to the clerk for recordation ; but denying any undue influence in its procurement, and denying that grantees therein had never accepted it; that it was duly and completely delivered to the grantees, and by them accepted as an absolute conveyance. The beneficiary under the deed is the wife of the grantor, and when the deed was executed the grantor was in as good condition as he ever was. That the object of the deed was to put the wife in control of the property, to protect her against a son-in-law, the plaintiff Smith, who had told his father-in-law that, in case of his death, he would give the widow no rest, as he had given the father-in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>law no rest during his life. That this plaintiff, Smith, had harassed his father-in-law, the said grantor, with vexations law-suits and security debts. That shortly before the grantor\u2019s death the said Smith had asserted claim to and sued the father-in-law for a large part of his land, and the father-in-law had been compelled to pay off debts and costs which the said Smith had incurred. In short, that said Smith had been a recreant and worthless son-in-law, and had lived and had been a pensioner on his father-in-law, and was now living, as he had long been doing, on his land, and had refused to pay any rent for the same, and had brought a suit against his father-in-law in his lifetime, seeking to set aside this very deed, and seeking to compel the father-in-law to make a deed to the said Smith to a part of his land, upon the ground of an alleged parol gift; which suit the father-in-law had successfully resisted, replying that .there had been no gift, and no claim until then of a gift, but that the plaintiffs had occupied th\u00e9 land as rentees, and had been made to pay rent for the same; and that the said plaintiffs had been shiftless and peevish and disagreeable* and had abandoned the premises and moved to another county; setting forth that the conveyance had been a voluntary conveyance of his own property, in accordance with his own rights, and in fraud of nobody else\u2019s rights, and that he had made the deed in question to provide for his wife in her old age, and to protect her against this very son-in-law; and denying that the plaintiffs had made any improvements on the said land; and alleging, further, that the said Adam Collup had sold other land during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Depositions were taken on both sides, the plaintiffs seeking to show undue influence brought to bear on Adam Collup to induce the execution of the deed, and by the defendants establishing his competency. The circuit court set aside the deed as incompetent in the lifetime of the grantor, and annulled the same, and enforced the will of Adam Collup, and made dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tribution of the real estate under the same; whereupon the case is here upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\"We are of opinion that the-circuit court erred in setting aside the deed at the suit of the plaintiffs. The deed was duly executed and acknowledged and-delivered by the grantor to the grantee, during his life, as a valid and- binding deed, and is effectually completed as such. It was not actually recorded-until after the death of the grantor,-but there are no creditors or lienors whose rig\u2019hts have intervened, or which, are now asserted; and, as between the beneficiaries under, the will, the will was inoperative as to such property as' was parted with .during, the life of the testator. It was competent for the testator during his life to revoke any part of his will; but the deed was a valid deed, not revocable by the grantor, by his will nor otherwise. As 'a valid gift by deed it was irrevocable, and -was not affected by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The decree complained of must, therefore, be.reversed and annulled; and this court, proceeding to render such decree as the circuit court ought to have rendered, will dismiss the bill of the plaintiffs, with costs, without prejudice to.any suit which may be necessary to duly administer such estate of the said Adam Collup as may not be affected by said deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
