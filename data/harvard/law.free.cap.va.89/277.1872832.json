The decree here appears to have been an affirmance of the'said decree appealed from in general terms, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>court saying \u201c that there are no errors in said decree' to the prejudice of the appellant. It is therefore decreed and ordered that the said decree be affirmed, and that the appellants pay to the appellees $30, and- also their, costs.\u201d There were no errors assigned by the appellees, and, all the errors assigned by the appellants having been overruled, the decree was affirmed in general terms; and the alleged error having existed, if at all, before the decree of affirmance here, it cannot now be reheard by the said corporation court, nor any other court, and must stand as <em>res judicata. </em>The said corporation court of Bristol did not, therefore, err in refusing to rehear the said decree, and the said decree must be affirmed. <em>Insurance Co. v.
