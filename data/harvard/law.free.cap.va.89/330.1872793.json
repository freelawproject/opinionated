Criminal Proceedings\u2014Jury.\u2014Where a <em>venire facias </em>was issued for a jury for the trial, during the term, of each of three felony cases, including that of the defendant, and defendant was tried by a jury composed of persons thus summoned\u2014</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-9\">Held :</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-10\">Such proceeding sufficiently complies with Code, \u00a7 4018.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-11\">2. Idem\u2014Challenge.\u2014A juror\u2019s residing at place of alleged commission of the offense charged cannot be availed of by challenge to the array, but by objection to the individual juror.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-13\">Error.to judgment of the circuit court of Wythe county, rendered March 10, 1892, affirming a judgment of the county court of that county, sentencing the prisoner, in accordance with the verdict of the jury, to nine years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary, for maliciously shooting one Edward Galloway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADqT\">Argued at Wytheville.

It appears from the record that there were two felony cases, besides the prisoner\u2019s case, to be tried at the same term at which he was tried; that a <em>venire </em>was duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>issued for a jury in each of those cases, and that the jury that tried the prisoner was composed of persons who had thus been summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The statute provides that \u201cif more than two cases are to he tried at one term of the court, only two juries shall he summoned, unless the court or judge otherwise direct; and \u201d that \u201c the juries so summoned may be used for the trial of all the cases.\u201d Code, sec. 4018.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This statute, the meaning and effect of which is unmistakeable, is decisive of the point just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The next and last error assigned is that two of the jurors resided at the place where the offense was alleged to have been committed\u2014viz., at Rural Retreat, a station on the Norfolk and Western railroad, in Wythe county. As to this, it is enough to say that there was no objection to the individual jurors on that ground in the trial court. A similar point was-overruled in <em>Craft's </em>Case, 24 Gratt. 602, on the ground that the objection, if valid at all, could have been made, not to-the array of jurors, hut to the individual juror only; and to the same effect is <em>Lawrence's Case, </em>81 Va. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
