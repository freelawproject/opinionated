The bond was issued pursuant to the Improvement Act of 1911. Action to foreclose the bond was filed on May 23, 1935. A commissioner\u2019s sale after judgment rendered in the foreclosure action was held November 30, 1936, and a commissioner\u2019s deed was executed and delivered to plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in interest December 6, 1937. Plaintiff thereafter acquired title by mesne conveyances of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Taxes became delinquent on the property for the fiscal year 1933-1934, and because of such delinquency the property was sold to the state in the year 1934 and was deeded to the state July 1, 1939. On August 18, 1947, the state, by its deed and pursuant to chapter 7, part 6, division 1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, conveyed the property to defendant Neal Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Defendant contends that the court erred in giving judgment to plaintiff for a partition for the reasons that: (a) de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>fendant\u2019s title is clear to the property; (b) there was no evidence before the court to show any right of a taxing agency existent on a parity with the title of the state before the property was conveyed to defendant; (c) the foreclosure of the bond lien was complete; and (d) the state was guilty of inexcusable delay in asserting its rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">All contentions of defendant have been answered adversely to his position in <em>Monheit </em>v. <em>Cigna, </em>28 Cal.2d 19, 20 et seq. [168 P.2d 965, 167 A.L.R. 995]; and <em>Elbert, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>32 Cal.2d 610, 611 et seq. [197 P.2d 537].</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">A mere reading of these cases demonstrates the fallacy of defendant\u2019s contentions and it would serve no useful purpose to here reiterate the reasoning of the cited decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Moore, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 7, 1952, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 14, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
