Counsel for defendant vigorously, persistently, and at length, opposed the motion and contended he was entitled to a trial by jury. The motion was taken under submission and a jury empaneled. Prior to the taking of any evidence the motion was granted and the jury discharged. The relevant proceedings which took place with respect to the motion are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Defendant first contends the court erred in denying him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a trial by jury. Plaintiffs say defendant did not except to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ruling, therefore the point is not available to him on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant answers that his conduct was equivalent to the taking of an exception and that is all the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Section 646 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines an exception as \u201can objection upon a matter of law to a decision made\u201d and provides \u201cThe exception must be taken at the time the decision is made, except as provided in section six hundred and forty-seven.\u201d Section 647 enumerates various matters which are deemed excepted to.  An order denying a trial by jury is not among them, and an exception was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The first enactment on the subject of exceptions was the Statute of Westminster II,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provided that a litigant might except to the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial, embody his exceptions in a bill of exceptions, and have the bill of exceptions made part of the record for purposes of review. The practice had real merit when its primary purpose was the preparation of a bill of exceptions for an appeal and there were no stenographic reporters or the record in the trial court was sketchy and incomplete. Now that we have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>complete record of the proceedings in the trial court, the necessity for an exception in order properly to prepare a record on appeal has disappeared.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Its use now makes form a fetish. The necessity of .an exception has been dispensed with in the federal courts and in a number of states.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Our statute which lists a great many matters that are deemed excepted to and omits a few to which an exception must be taken is a snare for the unwary. The distinction between those matters deemed excepted to and those not is purely fanciful and arbitrary. Everything accomplished by an exception is achieved by the requirement that the grounds of an objection be stated. An objection or opposition to proposed action indicates a party\u2019s dissatisfaction with what is proposed. If, after an objection or opposition to proposed action is overruled, a party takes an exception, he is merely repeating his dissatisfaction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The courts have stated the functions of an exception as: (1) to make the ruling a matter of record so that it may be reexamined by the court on a motion for a new trial or be reviewed by an appellate court;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) to apprise the trial court that its ruling is challenged, and thereby enable it to reconsider its ruling and correct the error if it be such.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The purpose of an exception is not ritualistic; it is real. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   It \u201cis only a formal type of objection.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>It does not. have to he in any particular form.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\n                   It is sufficient if it points out clearly the error complained of<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\n                   The test of its sufficiency is whether it fairly directs the attention of the court to the claimed error.  It is sufficient if it apprises the court in some way that the party does not acquiesce in the ruling or action of the court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A liberal rule of construction should be applied in determining whether an exception was taken.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Courts exist to do justice. Litigants should be saved from the consequences of an oversight by counsel where it can be done in furtherance of justice and consistent with established rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In <em>Horstmcm </em>v. <em>Krumgold, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 296 [130 P.2d 721], the court, referring to the amendment of 1907 to section 647 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provided that certain enumerated rulings were deemed excepted to, said, page 299: \u201cThe amendment to section 647 of the Code of Civil Procedure has met with much favor and has resulted in improvement in the manner of conducting trials. The old custom of audibly noting exceptions is not generally followed at the present time. The amendment should be liberally construed in order that the rights of litigants be not lost by the failure of counsel to keep fresh in mind those rulings of the court which are enumerated in the amendment. The record before us discloses that plaintiff vigorously opposed the order requiring her to make an election as to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>count and after the noon recess she requested the court to reconsider its ruling. There is much force in counsel\u2019s argument that plaintiff\u2019s conduct at the trial was equivalent to the notation of an exception to the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>San Joaquin L. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>43 Cal.App. 241 [184 P. 899], a witness for the plaintiff, qualified as an expert, testified that charges made for electric current were reasonable. The further proceedings appear in the opinion, page 243: \u201cOn' cross-examination of Simpson, after some questions had been asked and answered, relating to the conditions under which the service was to be rendered, and for the stated purpose of reaching the question of what was a reasonable rate, counsel for plaintiff objected that defendant could not go into these matters, on the ground that defendant, by entering into the contract, was estopped to question the reasonableness of the rate. After discussion, the court announced that \u2018the only issue here is of them furnishing the amount for which they are charging.\u2019 Mr. Doherty: \u2018You mean no further testimony allowed on the proposition of whether or not the rate fixed by them was a reasonable rate under the issue of their pleadings?\u2019 The Court: \u2018I don\u2019t see that there is any open question there.\u2019 On the ruling thus made, defendant\u2019s counsel refrained from further cross-examination on the reasonableness of the rate. To the statement made by the court, and without any direct exception, counsel responded, \u2018Well, on the ruling of the court, then, I will not ask any further questions on cross-examination as to the reasonableness of the rate.\u2019 Although no question was formally propounded, with a ruling thereon from which under the statute an exception would be implied, the record made, as above stated, was equivalent to such formal ruling and exception. <em>(Pastene </em>v. <em>Pardini, </em>135 Cal. 431 [67 P. 681].) \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Regardless of the theory upon which an exception is required, defendant\u2019s conduct was the equivalent of an exception. After the court had granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion \u201cthat the jury be dissolved,\u201d defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cAnd may the record show, your Honor, that we are again demanding a jury trial of this matter, and we would ask your Honor to rule on that motion at this time.\u201d The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Defendant made it perfectly clear to the trial court that he did not assent to or acquiesce in the ruling, but, on the contrary, that he considered it erroneous; with the court\u2019s knowledge he made what attempt he could in the time allowed him to obtain a writ of prohibition; the court had ample opportunity to reconsider and correct the ruling if it deemed it erroneous; defendant unequivocally indicated, and it appears clear that the court fully understood, he intended to make the ruling the subject of appellate review if judgment went against him. There is no mode by which defendant could have more distinctly manifested his dissent from the ruling than the one he followed. It would have been an idle and useless formality to have said \u201cnote an exception\u201d or \u201cI except.\u201d It would be a reproach to any legal system to hold that defendant did not except to the ruling sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">We must, therefore, consider the merits of defendant\u2019s assignment that the court erred in denying him a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The principles governing the right of trial by jury have been stated recently by the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe, </em>37 Cal.2d 283 [231 P.2d 832], and need not be repeated at length.  The test which deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>mines the right to a trial hy jury is whether the gist of the action is legal. It is not, as plaintiffs argue, and as the trial judge mistakenly assumed, whether there existed a right of action at common law identical with that given by the Housing and Rent Act of 1947.  As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet </em>Coupe, supra, page 299: \"If the action has to deal with ordinary common-law rights cognizable in courts of law, it is to that extent an action at law. In determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law, the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular ease\u2014the gist of the action. A jury trial must be granted where the gist of the action is legal, where the action is in reality cognizable at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Defendant argues that although the action involves recovery of a penalty under a statute, it is, in reality, one for debt, which at common law was triable by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The action (writ) of debt was the general remedy at common law for the recovery of all sums certain, or sums readily reducible to a certainty, whether the legal liability arose from contract or was created by statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>\n                   Statutory penalties existed at common law, and debt was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>appropriate action for the recovery thereof where no other remedy was specified, because the money due under such statute gave rise to a debt, the underlying theory being an implied promise which the law annexed to the liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Obviously, a statute such as the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, placing a ceiling on rents and permitting the recovery of treble the amount of any rental overcharges, did not exist at common law. While such a statute was unknown to the common law, the liability is one created by statute.  The treble damages recoverable under the act are in the nature of penalties.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>\n                   The issues involved in the claim for treble damages are legal; they grow out of a claim for moneys due and owing\u2014in the nature of a suit at common law\u2014and the court which determines this issue sits as a court of law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>A jury trial was a matter of right in the common-law action of debt, and consequently it exists in all civil actions under modern practice which formerly would have fallen within this form of action. (31 Am.Jur. 566, \u00a7 17.) Although the claim for damages arises out of and is based upon statute, it is a claim grounded in debt.  \u201c. . . [W]hen a federal statute embraces a common-law form of' action, that action does not lose its identity merely because it finds itself enmeshed in a statute.  The right of trial by jury in an action for debt still prevails whatever modern name may be applied to the action. To hold otherwise would be to open the way for Congress to nullify the Constitutional right of trial by jury by mere statutory enactments. It is by such methods that courts lose their power to enforce the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Jepson, </em>90 F.Supp. 983, 986.)  A trial by jury of the issues raised by a claim for treble damages under the act is a matter of right.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The cause was tried on an amended complaint and the answer thereto. Defendant contends that the amended complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. We have considered the point, and although the amended complaint is not a model pleading, we think the point is without merit. However, in view of the necessity of a retrial, plaintiffs should be permitted to amend if they be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The judgment was entered on October 5, 1950. On December 20, 1950, the Housing Expediter, acting under the authority of section 204(j) (3) of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> decontrolled rents in the city of Los Angeles where the property involved is located.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Defendant contends that decontrol \u201cvoids the judgment.\u201d He relies on the principle that repeal of a statute creating a penalty at any time before final judgment extinguishes the right to recover the penalty.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He argues: section 204(j) (3) authorizing the Housing Expediter to decontrol contained no saving clause; section 204(f), providing for termination of rent control (1) on automatic expiration of the act, (2) by proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>lamation of the President, or (3) by resolution of both Houses of Congress, contained a saving clause that as to rights and liabilities incurred prior to the termination date the act would remain in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action with respect to any such right or liability; therefore, Congress intended that when a city is decontrolled by the Expediter under section 204(j)(3), existing causes of action fall with the decontrol order. The argument is unfounded. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the saving clause contained in section 204(f) is applicable to section 204(j) (3) and that an action of this character may be maintained after decontrol by the Expediter.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Other errors assigned by defendant are not likely to occur on a retrial and need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Shinn, P. J., and Wood (Parker), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 14, 1952, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 25, 1952.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> 61 Stats. 193; 50 U.S.C.A.

App. \u00a7 1895.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\">\u201cThe Court: The objection of the plaintiffs to proceed to trial with a jury in this ease was previously submitted for decision by the Court . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">\u201cThe Court has been researching this subject almost continuously since the matter was argued, and I have about come to the conclusion, gentlemen, that a jury cannot be had as a matter of right in this type of action. ... I think we must conclude that no such cause of action or form of action existed at common law because of the right to fix prices and fix rents by governmental action did not exist in common law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>it is only through a violation of such a statute that any right o\u00ed action exists in this present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cSo regarding the substance of the action rather than the form of it, I think it is one that did not exist at common law and, therefore, under the authorities, a trial by jury is not a matter of right. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201cMe. Cohen [Attorney for defendant]: ... If the Court feels disposed to grant the plaintiffs \u2019 motion, depriving the defendants of a jury, I will ask the Court to give me an opportunity to prepare a writ of prohibition to submit to the District Court of Appeal so that we can obtain an alternative writ there, if the Court deems it proper and will not require us to go to trial without a jury. Could the Court do that? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201cExcuse me, your Honor. I am trying to protect my record, and I don\u2019t know whether I should make this request now or after the Court rules. The Court indicated prior to the noon recess that the Court felt that we were not entitled to a jury as a matter of right, and the Court also said it was within the Court\u2019s discretion to grant a'jury. And at this time I am asking your Honor to exercise that discretion and grant Mr. Wright, the defendant in this case, a trial by jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u201cThe Cotjbt: ... I think that the law, as I have attempted to outline it here, requires this Court to hold that in California at least the precedents are to the effect that a jury may not be had as a matter of right in this proceeding, and that is the holding of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u201cMb. Cohen: I will ask your Honor, in the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion, if the Court will grant us the privilege of a jury trial in this case? ... so at this time I will ask your Honor to give me the opportunity to prepare the necessary papers to submit to the District Court of Appeal and request that a writ of prohibition issue, because I feel that if we should go to trial and your Honor should find against us, that under the law, the authorities, an appeal from this judgment would not be a speedy remedy at law. So I will ask the Court to give us the opportunity to do that. ... It may be that when we submit the papers to the District Court of Appeal the court may agree that we don\u2019t have the right to trial by jury, and then we will proceed to trial. But a writ of prohibition is proper if your Honor is wrong and we are right in the ease. ... I am not at all convinced in my own mind that the ruling is proper, and I feel I owe a duty to my client to pursue the remedy, and I feel it is a proper remedy to seek. . . . and I am simply asking that I be given an opportunity, even until Monday morning. I will work over the week-end, although I was going fishing, and I will prepare a writ and submit it to the Presiding Justice of the District Court of Appeal and, if he sees fit to sign an alternative writ, all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u201cIn connection with the case of Grossblatt against Wright, this morning after having spent a total of 24 hours preparing the petition for writ of prohibition that we discussed in your Honor\u2019s chambers last Friday, I went to the office of the clerk of the District Court of Appeal and was informed by the clerk this morning at 9:15 that in the ordinary course of events the court will not issue an alternative writ until five days have elapsed, during which time the respondent has the right of filing an answer to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">\u201cI explained to the clerk the circumstances here, that is, that your Honor had continued this matter for trial to 10:00 a.m. this morning, and he said that under such circumstances it is possible, but not at all a certainty, that the District Court of Appeal might waive the five-day period for the answer to be filed and decide that matter today, but that he couldn\u2019t guarantee it, so that now we are in a position, your Honor, where because of the exigencies of the situation, if I filed a petition up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>there, if this trial proceeds today and we conclude it, say, tomorrow afternoon or some time Wednesday, the matter of the petition for writ of prohibition will become moot, and so I have no alternative but to ask your Honor to continue this case to a time far enough away so as to enable the District Court of Appeal to act on our petition, or to set it off calendar subject to being reset after the District Court of Appeal does act. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u201cThe'Court: . . . the cases are numerous to the effect that where money is all that is involved that an appeal is an adequate remedy and, of course, execution would be stayed pending appeal, so that the defendant wouldn\u2019t even be out his money during that time. ... I am satisfied by independent research I have made also since our last discussion of the matter that this is not a proper ease for the issuance of a writ, and I don\u2019t believe it would issue, so the request for continuance is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u201cMe. Cohen: Then in that event, your Honor, I shall not file the writ of prohibition because I think we are agreed it would become a moot question because this ease will have been determined by that time, that is, by the time the Appellate Court had an opportunity to act on the writ, and I assume by your Honor\u2019s statement that we are now required to proceed with the trial; is that true?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u201cMb. Cohen: And may the record show, your Honor, that we are again demanding a jury trial of this matter, and we would ask your Honor to rule on that motion at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u201cThe Court: The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">\u201cMb.

Bank, </em>1 Cal.2d 541 [36 P.2d 649], the plaintiff, after issue joined, made demand for a jury, which was successfully resisted by the defendants. The plaintiff refused to proceed to trial without a jury and the court granted a motion for judgment of dismissal. On appeal the defendants contended that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to except to the ruling striking the plaintiff\u2019s demand for a jury was a waiver of her objection and an acquiescence in such ruling. The District Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to a trial by jury, reversed the judgment, and with respect to the contention that the ruling could not be reviewed because no exception had been taken, said (23 P.2d 1036, 1041) : \u201cThe motion to strike was based solely on the ground that the case is in equity and not triable by a jury, and on plaintiff\u2019s refusal to proceed without a jury the judgment of dismissal was entered. All of such facts are shown in the judgment and appear in the judgment roll, and consequently so appear in the record before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Sichler </em>v. <em>Look, </em>93 Cal. 600 [29 P. 220].

Section <em>7, </em>art. 1, Const, of California. If, as we think, the instant case is a civil action, appellant\u2019s constitutional right was denied and finally determined by the order which the court made. Such order was an \u2018interlocutory order . . . finally determining the rights\u2019 of appellant, and under section 647 of the Code of Civil Procedure is deemed to have been excepted to. Being a constitutional right, it is to be presumed that prejudice resulted from the denial. \u2019 \u2019 The Supreme Court granted a hearing and held (1 Cal.2d 541) that the plaintiff was entitled to a trial by jury and reversed the judgment without mentioning the point that no exception had been taken, evidently thinking, although the point was argued extensively in the briefs and in the petition for hearing and the answer thereto, that it was not of sufficient importance to warrant mention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\"><em> State </em>v. <em>Poulterer, </em>16 Cal. 514, 525; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>(1 Mason 482) 26 Fed.Cas.

Of this nature are, first, such as are necessarily implied by the fundamental constitution of government, to which every man is a contracting party. And thus it is that every person is bound and has virtually agreed to pay such particular sums of money as are charged on him by the sentence, or assessed by interpretation of the law. For it is a part of the original contract, entered into by all mankind who partake of the benefits of society, to submit in all points to the municipal constitutions and local ordinances of the state, of which each individual is a member.
