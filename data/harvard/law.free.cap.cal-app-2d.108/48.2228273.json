The claim that petitioner\u2019s heart trouble resulted from his employment was denied by the board. Thereafter petitioner sought a writ of mandate from the superior court directing the board to pay him a retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>Questions: </em>First: <em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the board\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s heart trouble did- not result from his employment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\"><em>Yes. </em> On an application for a writ of mandate to review an order of a local quasi-judicial body such as the board in the present case the trial court does not have a right to judge of the intrinsic value of evidence nor to weigh it. The power of the court is confined to determining whether there was substantial evidence before the board to support its findings. (Ni<em>shkian </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 749, 751 [230 P.2d 156]; <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>87 Cal.App.2d 471, 475 [197 P.2d 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">In the present case three doctors stated that petitioner\u2019s heart trouble was not service connected. It is true that two of them had previously expressed the opinion that defendant\u2019s heart trouble was service connected but upon its being brought to their attention that petitioner had been suspended because of intoxication they withdrew their opinion that petitioner\u2019s heart condition arose from the performance of his duties and expressed the view that it did not arise therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">The most that can be said for such testimony is that it raised a conflict in the evidence whose determination was for the trier of fact, which, being supported by the evidence, was binding upon the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Second: <em>Was there substantial evidence to overcome the presumption of section 32353 of the Government Code, \u201cIf a member who has served 15 years or more develops </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>heart trouble, it shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, in any proceeding under this chapter by the board and by the court, that such heart trouble is am injury or disease occurring in and arising out of his employment ?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Yes. </em> In rebuttal of a presumption it is not necessary to produce preponderant evidence to overcome it. A presumption is overcome if sufficient evidence is introduced to balance the presumption. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>129 Cal.App. 206, 213 [18 P.2d 703] ; <em>Estate of Eakle, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 379, 387 [91 P.2d 954].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In the instant case there was substantial evidence introduced before the board that petitioner had been discharged for repeated drunkenness, and that the doctors had examined petitioner. This evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption of the above mentioned code section that petitioner\u2019s disability was service connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter a judgment denying petitioner\u2019s application for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Moore, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 26, 1951, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 31, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
