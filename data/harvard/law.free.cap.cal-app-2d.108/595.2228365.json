On January 5, 1942, an order was made reducing the amount to be paid to $65 a month. On October 24, 1950, plaintiff filed an affidavit in which she averred that defendant was $909.39 in arrears. On November 6, 1950, without notice to defendant, a writ of execution issued. All the installments for which execution issued accrued within five years of the date of the ex parte application. On November 13, 1950, defendant filed a notice of motion that the order of January 5, 1942, \u201cbe modified to require the payment of only $50 per month commencing August 15, 1943, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and ending September 30, 1950,\u201d and the writ of execution be recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On November 13, 1950, want of notice of defendant\u2019s motion having been waived, the court found, that defendant owed plaintiff $949.39, and made an order which in pertinent part reads: \u2018 \u2018 defendant is ordered to pay the same at $10.00 per month to plaintiff on the same dates as heretofore ordered ; the writ of execution is recalled.\u201d The trial judge acted on the erroneous view that a writ of execution could not issue except on notice \u201cwhere the order was made over five years ago.\u201d Plaintiff appeals from the quoted portions of the order of November 13, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Plaintiff had an absolute right to have the writ of execution issued and levied.  A judgment for alimony is final and cannot be modified as to accrued installments. <em>(Keck </em>v. <em>Keck, </em>219 Cal. 316, 320 [26 P.2d 300].)  A party to.a divorce action is entitled to execution as to unpaid installments of a support award that have accrued within five years of the date of the application on an ex parte application although it be made more than five years after entry of the decree or order making the award. <em>(Wolfe </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>30 Cal.2d 1, 4 [180 P.2d 345]; <em>Di Corpo </em>v. <em>Di Corpo, </em>33 Cal.2d 195, 201 [200 P.2d 529]; <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Millard, </em>102 Cal.App.2d 249, 250 [227 P.2d 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The part of the order of November 13, 1950, which reads \u201cdefendant is ordered to pay the same at $10.00 per month to plaintiff on the same dates as heretofore ordered; the writ of execution is recalled\u201d is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Shinn, P.
