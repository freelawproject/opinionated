Trial by jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>waived. He was adjudged guilty. His motion for a new trial was denied. Probation was granted and execution of sentence was suspended. The notice of appeal recites that he appeals from the judgment, verdict, sentence and the \u201cdenial\u201d of his motion for a new trial.  Since an appeal from a verdict or sentence is not authorized, the purported appeals therefrom will be dismissed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>D\u2019Elia, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 764, 766 [167 P.2d 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to justify the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">By stipulation the People\u2019s case was submitted upon the transcript of the preliminary examination and the exhibits referred to therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">On February 15, 1951, at 12:05 p.m., when a police officer entered a restaurant which was operated by defendant, there were numerous customers therein and the defendant was waiting on them. The officer testified that he sat at the counter beside an unidentified man who said to the defendant, \u201cLet me see your sheet\u201d; the defendant took a scratch sheet from his pocket and handed it to the man; the man looked at the sheet, engaged in conversation with another man next to him, and handed the sheet to the defendant; shortly after that another man, who was sitting about four seats from the officer, stopped the defendant and they looked at a slip of paper, which was on the counter, on which there were pencil notations; they had a conversation, which the witness could not hear, and when the defendant left the man he stated that \u201che was in the first race\u201d; the defendant then walked to the rear of the restaurant and gave the scratch sheet to another man; that man looked at the sheet for a few minutes and gave it to the defendant; about 12:20 p.m., a man entered the restaurant and the defendant went to the cash register which was about 10 feet from the officer, and the man who had just entered the restaurant said to the defendant, \u201cPoor Idea in the fifth\u201d; the defendant said, \u201cO.K.,\u201d picked up the racing section of the newspaper, which was on the counter near the cash register, looked at it, and then stated, \u201cThat is Poor Idea. O.K. How do you want it!\u201d and the man replied, \u201cTo win\u201d; the man extended his hand with two one dollar bills in it; the defendant accepted the bills and placed them in his pocket; the man left the restaurant; he did not eat in the restaurant at that time; about 12:27 p.m., the defendant turned on the radio and in a few minutes the race results were broadcast; defendant opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the scratch sheet and made notations thereon with a pencil. Then the officer arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">It was stipulated that the officer was qualified as an expert regarding the manner in which bookmaking is conducted in Los Angeles County. The witness testified that in his opinion the conversation, between the defendant and the man who paid the $2.00, regarding \u201cPoor Idea\u201d related to a wager on a horse purportedly running in the fifth race at the Santa Anita track on the day defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The defendant testified that he had been in the restaurant business about 12 years, and that no one assisted him in operating this restaurant; there were about ten persons in his restaurant when the officer came in; defendant had a scratch sheet in his possession; when he went to serve one of the customers, the customer said he wanted defendant\u2019s scratch sheet and the defendant showed it to him and walked away; defendant had no conversation with a man concerning a horse named \u201cPoor Idea\u201d; a customer came in and said, \u201cHere is the two dollars that I owe you,\u201d and he gave the defendant two single dollars and 47 cents; the customer owed defendant the $2.00 for four lunches, and he gave defendant the 47 cents \u201cfor [lunch]] that day\u201d; after he had paid the defendant the customer said, \u201cI got a hot tip in the First at Santa Anita\u201d; the newspaper happened to be there, and the defendant said, \u201cIs that the one?\u201d and the customer replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and he walked out; then the officer arrested the defendant. He testified further that some of his customers go to the races and sometimes they look at scratch sheets; he accepted no bets in his restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">A witness, called by the defendant, testified that he works at a place across the street from defendant\u2019s restaurant; shortly after 12 o\u2019clock on said February 15th, he was in the restaurant and paid defendant $2.47 which he owed him for meals including lunch that day; he had no conversation with defendant about a horse named \u201cPoor Idea\u201d and he did not give defendant a bet on that horse or any other horse on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Appellant argues that there was no testimony that defendant\u2019s handwriting was on any of the exhibits, and there was no betting marker. The charge herein is that defendant violated subdivision 3 of section 337a of the Penal Code by receiving money as a wager upon a horse race. It is not a requirement, under said subdivision, that the defendant\u2019s handwriting appear on any paper used in connee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>tion with a wager on a horse race or that the defendant be in possession of a betting marker or any other paper used in connection with a wager on a horse race. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 379, 382 [210 P.2d 885].) \u201cThe only requirement is that he receive money [Citation] as a wager on a race or a purported race. ...\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Appellant also argues to the effect that the only evidence regarding a specific horse in a specific race was snatches of a conversation between defendant and the man; and that nothing was said about placing a bet or about any specific amount of money. The evidence shows, with respect to the name of a horse and a race, that the words \u201cPoor Idea in the fifth\u201d referred to a horse by the name of \u201cPoor Idea\u201d which was listed on the scratch sheet as being in the fifth race at the Santa Anita race track. The evidence shows, with respect to betting a specific sum, that the defendant, after referring to the racing section of the newspaper, said to the man, \u201cThat is Poor Idea. O.K. How do you want it?\u201d and that the man replied, \u201cTo win\u201d and then handed $2.00 to the defendant. The court could have inferred from all the evidence that the defendant received the $2.00 as a wager on the result of a horse race.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The purported appeals from a verdict and sentence are dismissed. The judgment and the order denying the motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Shinn, P. J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
