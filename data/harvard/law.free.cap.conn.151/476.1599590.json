The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, which sustained the action of the commission. This appeal has been taken from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The plaintiffs are two individual owners of nearby property and the Lake Garda Improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Association. The improvement association is a specially chartered corporation consisting of the owners of real estate around Lake Carda as defined by a map. See <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Co., </em>135 Conn. 240, 241, 63 A.2d 145. It functions in a quasi-municipal capacity and also owns property and maintains for its members certain beaches on the lake near the area in dispute. The defendant commission consists of sis members elected from the two districts in the town. The chairman of the commission is Joseph Iskra, who resides at Lake Carda on property which is within the area regulated by the improvement association. Prior to and at the start of the public hearing on the application of the Lake Carda Company, the plaintiffs requested Iskra to disqualify himself from acting as a member of the commission in this matter, but he refused to do so. His refusal was assigned as one of the reasons for invalidating the action of the commission, but the court, after hearing evidence on the question, decided adversely to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">With such corrections as the plaintiffs are entitled to in the limited finding on the matter of disqualification, the following facts appear: Iskra has resided at Lake Carda for ten years. Prior to April, 1960, he served as president and was the agent for service of process of the Lake Carda Association, a rival of the improvement association. Harry Battistoni was also active in the Lake Carda Association and at times conducted its meetings. Battistoni is the president of the applicant. He and his wife and daughter are the sole owners of its stock. The application was dated May 1, 1962. While it was pending, Iskra purchased a lot adjoining his house from the applicant. He negotiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the sale with Battistoni, who executed the deed as president of the applicant. The deed is dated August 22, 1962, but it was not recorded until October 10, 1962, two days after the public hearing on the application. Iskra, a member of the improvement association by reason of the location of his property, has refused to pay taxes to that association, and it has been obliged to place a tax lien on his property. He and two other members of the improvement association challenge the legality of its charter and its power to tax and have pending in court an action for a declaratory judgment to determine these questions. <em>Iskra </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn., </em>Superior Court, Hartford County, No. 117933. Xskra\u2019s attorney in that action is the attorney who represented Battistoni in this matter both at the hearing before the commission and on the appeal. Battistonhs daughter was recognized as surety for Iskra in the declaratory judgment action. During the spring of 1962, prior to the public hearing, Battistoni called a meeting of Lake Garda residents to organize a recreational association. He asked Iskra to attend. Iskra presided over part of the meeting, and a new association was formed. The applicant has on its property a clubhouse which is a nonconforming use. The clubhouse is rented out to various groups and organizations for dinners, picnics, outings and similar activities. Iskra is a beer salesman and sells the beer for these occasions when proper permits are obtained. He is the sole representative of the Lake Garda area on the defendant commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Since 1951, when what is now \u00a7 8-11 of the General Statutes was originally enacted following <em>Low </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>135 Conn. 1, 60 A.2d 774; Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 382d; the participation of members of zon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ing bodies in matters in which the question of their disqualification was raised has been reviewed in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>144 Conn. 493, 134 A.2d 250; <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>146 Conn. 531, 153 A.2d 415; <em>Lage </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>148 Conn. 597, 172 A.2d 911; <em>Luery </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>150 Conn. 136, 187 A.2d 247, and <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>150 Conn. 495, 191 A.2d 250. In all of these cases, except <em>Senior, </em>the criticism of the members of the boards and commissions was held to be justified. Neutrality and impartiality of members are essential to the fair and proper operation of these authorities. Section 8-11 forbids any member of a zoning authority from acting in any matter before the authority if he is directly or indirectly interested in it \u201cin a personal or financial sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The record in this case and the transcript of the public hearing recite a history of antagonistic action and litigation between the residents of Lake Garda who have banded together in the improvement association and Battistoni, the dominating figure in the ownership and operation of the applicant. Iskra\u2019s legal action against the improvement association and his reiteration in court of his continued opposition to it would in and of itself be sufficient to warrant his disqualification in a matter in which it was vitally interested. When these facts are coupled with the evidence of his friendship and association with Battistoni, and the necessary inferences which must be drawn therefrom, Iskra\u2019s insistence in sitting in this matter creates a situation the evil of which \u00a7 8-11 and our decisions seek to avoid. See <em>Zell </em>v. <em>Roseland, </em>42 N.J. Super. 75, 81, 125 A.2d 890. Iskra\u2019s refusal to withdraw from the commission in the present case renders the action of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mission invalid. The trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
