Each driver claimed to have sustained personal injury and property damage. The plaintiff brought this action to recover damages from the defendant. The defendant denied negligence on his part, pleaded the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tiff\u2019s contributory negligence and filed a counterclaim seeking damages from the plaintiff. The plaintiff answered the counterclaim, denying his own negligence and pleading the defendant\u2019s contributory negligence. The jury found the issues for the defendant on the complaint and for the plaintiff on the counterclaim. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The clear import of the verdict is that the jury found the collision to be the result of the negligence of both parties. In the special defense to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the defendant set forth ten allegations of contributory negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s part. One of these allegations was that the plaintiff was negligent in failing to yield the right of way at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The facts pertinent to the issue which we consider decisive of the appeal are not in dispute and can be briefly stated. The plaintiff was driving north, and the defendant was driving south, on Windsor Street. Canton Street intersects Windsor Street from the west but does not cross it. Stop signs on Windsor Street require a southbound vehicle, such as the defendant\u2019s, to stop before entering the intersection. There are no stop signs for northbound vehicles on Windsor Street. The defendant, as he approached the intersection, saw the stop sign facing him but did not stop before entering the intersection. After entering the intersection, the defendant\u2019s automobile collided with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, which was then in motion and had made, or was in the act of making, a left turn into Canton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The court charged the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to stop in obedience to a stop sign, using, substantially, the language of Public Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>1959, No. 163, which amended General Statutes \u00a714-301 (e). The 1959 amendment was, of course, nonexistent on the date of this collision and consequently was not applicable. This inaccuracy in the charge is of no material significance since the charge on the subject, as far as it went, covered the essential substance of the applicable statute in force at the time, that is, \u00a7 14-301 (c) prior to its amendment in 1959.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court told the jury, in effect, that it was the legal duty of the defendant, before entering the intersection, to bring his car to a full stop in obedience to the stop sign, and that failure on his part to do so would be negligence unless the failure was due to a circumstance beyond his control and to which no voluntary act on Ms part contributed. The defendant, in Ms claims of proof, asserted no extenuating circumstance. He claimed only that he saw the stop sign and applied his brakes, that Ms vehicle did not stop and that he removed Ms foot from the brake pedal and entered the intersection without stopping. The court failed to make any mention of the language of the portion of the statute wMch provides that \u201csuch driver, having so yielded, may proceed and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection shall yield the right of way to the veMcle so proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">Following tMs discussion of the stop sign statute, the court quoted General Statutes \u00a7 14-246, concerning the duty of a driver contemplating a left turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>within an intersection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In applying the statute to the facts of this case, the court said: \u201cYou will note that this statute applies only after the car intending to make the left turn is within the intersection. ... If at that time any part of an approaching ear, which would be . . . [the defendant\u2019s] car here, is within the intersection, then under the statute such approaching car has the statutory right of way.\u201d The court then continued: \u201cSuch approaching ear also has the statutory right of way if at such time it is so close to the intersection, even though no part of it is actually within the intersection, as to constitute an immediate hazard.\u201d In neither situation did the court indicate to the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s duty to yield the right of way under \u00a7 14-246, as described, did not come into play unless the driver approaching the stop sign \u2014 in this case the defendant \u2014 had first yielded the right of way by stopping in obedience to the stop sign as required by \u00a7 14-301 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The effect of these instructions was to convey to the minds of the jury the legal proposition that they might find the plaintiff negligent in failing to yield the right of way to the defendant in spite of the fact that the latter had admittedly failed to stop in obedience to the stop sign. Such a proposition runs counter to express language in \u00a7 14-301 (c) which dates from 1955. Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 1404d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Even before that date, the wording of the statute uniformly required the driver approaching a stop sign to stop before asserting any right accorded him with respect to other vehicles in or approaching the intersection. Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2520 (c); Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 123e (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Because the verdict was a general one, we cannot know which of the ten specifications of negligence alleged against the plaintiff the jury found established. Since the court\u2019s charge would have permitted the jury to base their verdict on the claim that the plaintiff failed to grant the right of way to the defendant, even though the defendant proceeded into the intersection without stopping, the charge must be considered erroneous and harmful. In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">There is error in part; the judgment on the counterclaim is affirmed; the judgment on the complaint is set aside and a new trial is ordered, limited to the issues on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> \u201cSee. 14-301. through ways. . . .
