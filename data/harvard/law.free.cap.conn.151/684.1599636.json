At the time, Morris carried a manufacturers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 liability policy with the defendant. The plaintiff is subrogated to the rights of Morris under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175 and brought this action to recover on the policy. From a judgment for the defendant, the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The parties are in substantial agreement on the facts, and only a minor immaterial change in the finding is warranted. The policy is in two parts. Part 1 is the standard printed form, and part 2 is the declarations sheet. Each part has to be read in conjunction with the other in order to determine the coverage under the policy. <em>Leathermode Sportswear, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>150 Conn. 63, 66, 186 A.2d 79; <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>146 Conn. 490, 495, 152 A.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Part 1, coverage B, insures against liability for property damage \u201ccaused by accident and arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined.\u201d Hazards under four different classifications or \u201cdivisions\u201d are then defined. The definition under division 1 is \u201c[t]he ownership, maintenance or use of premises, and all operations.\u201d Part 2 states: \u201cThe insurance afforded is only with respect to such and so many of the following coverages and divisions thereunder as are indicated by specific premium charge or charges shown below or in the attached General Liability Schedule.\u201d Under division 1 of part 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>premium charges were made for operations listed in the \u201cDescription of Hazards\u201d as \u201cExcavation\u2014 for cellars or foundations of buildings, bridges or retaining walls including borrowing, filling or back-filling (excavation in connection with street or road construction or tunneling to be separately rated).\u201d Part 2 also states: \u201cEntries in the Description of Hazards, except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Policy, do not modify the exclusions or other terms of this Policy.\u201d The exclusions appear in part 1. They recite that \u201c[t]his Policy does not apply: . . . under Coverage B [property damage], with respect to division 1 of the Definition of Hazards, to injury to or destruction of any property arising out of . . . the collapse of or structural injury to any building or structure due ... to excavation, including borrowing, filling or back-filling in connection therewith.\u201d It is further provided that this exclusion does not apply to such operations as were stated in the declarations or in the company\u2019s manual as not being subject to the exclusion. There is, however, no provision in the declarations sheet of this policy or in the manual which would eliminate this exclusion. Therefore, the exclusion applies to the property damage suffered by the plaintiff as a result of Morris\u2019 operations. <em>D\u2019Agostino Excavators, Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Indemnity Co., 7 </em>App. Div. 2d 483, 485, 184 N.Y.S.2d 378. The terms of the policy are not ambiguous. Given their natural and ordinary meaning, they express the intent of the parties. <em>Plunkett </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>150 Conn. 203, 207, 187 A.2d 754, and cases cited. Furthermore, in the ascertainment of that intent, it seems significant that the policy contains several endorsements, covering blasting operations, for which additional premiums were charged. Blasting opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tions are excluded from coverage in the same paragraph of the policy as operations involving structural damage through backfilling. A proper endorsement would have been necessary to furnish coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
