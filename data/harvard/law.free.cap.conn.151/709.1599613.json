The plaintiffs claim that certain legal conclusions on which the court based its decision were, as applied to the facts of this ease, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The plaintiffs did not file either a request for a finding or a draft finding. Consequently no finding was made. A finding is neeessary where error is claimed in conclusions of law or fact that do not appear on the face of the record. Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7609; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7126. As there is no finding, we are limited in our review to the facts which appear on the record. <em>Gitlitz </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>146 Conn. 280, 281, 150 A.2d 213; <em>Mendrochowicz </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>139 Conn. 506, 509, 95 A.2d 260. The only facts of record in the present case are those which are admitted in the pleadings and which appear in the judgment. <em>Burma Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>149 Conn. 414, 416, 180 A.2d 631. The memorandum of decision establishes no facts, and it cannot take the place of a finding. <em>Tuite </em>v. <em>Tuite, </em>150 Conn. 345, 346, 189 A.2d 394; <em>Gitlitz </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">As we cannot review the conclusions of the court on the basis of the facts which appear on the record, they must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
