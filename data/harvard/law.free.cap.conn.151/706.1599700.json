In this zone, no junk yards or motor vehicle junk yards are permitted. Norwalk Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7\u00a7 5 (37), 6 (17) (1929, as amended). A zoning board of appeals, in acting on an application for a certificate of approval of a location for a motor vehicle junk yard, must first certify that the proposed location is not within a district restricted against motor vehicle junk yards before it can consider the suitability of the location for the proposed use. General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 21-16. As the premises in the instant case are within a district restricted against motor vehicle junk yards, the zoning board of appeals could not have granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for a certificate of approval. <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>147 Conn. 469, 472, 162 A.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"A64q\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
