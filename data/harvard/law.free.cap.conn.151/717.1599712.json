The defendant pleaded, as a special defense, that it was a charitable corporation without capital stock whose members derived no financial benefit from its operation. The plaintiff demurred, claiming that the defendant had failed to state a proper defense, and the demurrer was overruled. The plaintiff failed to plead further, and the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The trial court did not err in overruling the demurrer. We adhere to our previous holdings that \u201ca charitable corporation is not liable for injuries sustained by a beneficiary as a result of the negligent conduct of agents or servants of the corporation whom it has selected with due care.\u201d <em>Bader </em>v. <em>United Orthodox Synagogue, </em>148 Conn. 449, 452, 172 A.2d 192; <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Corporation, </em>144 Conn. 417, 422, 133 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> During oral argument counsel stipulated that the demurrer had been argued and decided in the trial court as though the complaint had alleged that the plaintiff fell while leaving the church immediately after attending mass. Counsel requested that this appeal be decided on the same basis since the plaintiff\u2019s objective is not to claim recovery under the rule of cases such as <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>General Hospital Society, </em>113 Conn. 188, 199, 154 A. 435, but to overthrow the defense of charitable immunity as it is now recognized in this state. We have decided to comply with the request and treat the case as it was treated by the parties and the court below. <em>Anselmo </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>135 Conn. 78, 79, 60 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 335 U.S. 859, 69 S.
