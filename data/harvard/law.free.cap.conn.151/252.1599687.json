J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6O\">The plaintiffs sued to recover damages for personal injuries claimed to have been sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>by them in tbe late forenoon of October 10, 1956, when a motor car operated by the plaintiff Angelina Sealora, in which the plaintiff Joseph Sealora, Jr. was a passenger, collided with an automobile operated by the defendant John J. Shaughnessy. Recovery was also sought against Edward I. Bartenstein and Sam Bartenstein, doing business under the name of B and B Auto Sales. The jury returned a verdict for each plaintiff against all defendants. Only the defendants Bartenstein, doing business as B and B Auto Sales, hereinafter referred to as the defendants, have appealed, and their appeal does not call into question Shaughnessy\u2019s liability. It raises only the question of their liability for the acts of Shaughnessy.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The defendants denied that they owned the car operated by Shaughnessy and also that he was their agent at the time of the accident. The plaintiffs relied on the statutory presumption of agency created by General Statutes \u00a7 52-183.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute, however, would apply only if the plaintiffs proved that the Shaughnessy car was owned by the defendants. See <em>Preferred Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>186 F.2d 987, 990 (2d Cir.). Thus, we first consider the question of ownership of the automobile driven by Shaughnessy, which bore dealer\u2019s number plates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>issued to the defendants. In the case of a privately owned motor vehicle the registration refers to a particular identified car. Such a registration is prima facie evidence \u2014 that is, it warrants, although it does not compel, a finding \u2014 of ownership of the vehicle described in the certificate of registration. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a714-1 (26), (36), 14-12, 14-13, 14-18; <em>Burakowski </em>v. <em>Grustas, </em>134 Conn. 205, 209, 56 A.2d 461; <em>Denos </em>v. <em>Giovanelli, </em>124 Conn. 464, 467, 200 A. 573; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Santamauro, </em>119 Conn. 307, 308, 175 A. 913; <em>Chouinard </em>v. <em>Wooldridge, </em>102 Conn. 66, 70, 127 A. 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the case of a dealer\u2019s registration, no particular motor vehicle is referred to or identified. Indeed, the motor vehicle need not, in all instances, be actually owned by the dealer whose number plates are displayed on it. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>86 Conn. 409, 412, 85 A. 536; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-60, 14-12, 14-58, 14-18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Baptist </em>v. <em>Shanen, </em>145 Conn. 605, 606, 145 A.2d 592, we raised, but did not resolve, the question whether the rule as stated in \u201ccases such as <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Santamauro, </em>119 Conn. 307, 308, 175 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>A. 913 \u2014 that a certificate of registration is prima facie evidence of ownership \u2014 is applicable in its full extent in the case of a registration issued to a dealer which, under certain circumstances, may be properly used in the operation of cars not owned by the dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We now must decide the matter left undetermined in <em>Baptist </em>v. <em>Shanen, </em>supra. Clearly, the defendants, as dealers and the persons to whom the number plates were issued, rather than the plaintiffs, had, or had the means of having, peculiar knowledge of the reasons for the presence of the plates on the car being operated by Shaughnessy. Public policy, as the present case well illustrates, demands that if a dealer\u2019s plates are affixed to a motor vehicle, they constitute prima facie evidence of the ownership of that vehicle by the dealer to whom those plates were issued. The jury thus were privileged to find ownership by the defendants of the car operated by Shaughnessy, on which the defendants\u2019 number plates were being displayed. Note, 27 A.L.R.2d 167, 175; 9B Blashfield, Cyclopedia of Automobile Law and Practice (Perm. Ed., Bandy) \u00a76061; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>also <em>Voegeli </em>v. <em>Waterbury Yellow Cab Co., </em>111 Conn. 407, 409, 150 A. 303; <em>DeMarey </em>v. <em>Brugas, </em>103 Conn. 667, 670, 131 A. 392. Of course, the jury were not required to credit the evidence of the defendants to the effect that (1) Shaughnessy owned the vehicle at the time of the accident; and (2) the defendants had no knowledge as to how it was that their number plates came to be displayed on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Since the jury were privileged to, and obviously did, find ownership in the defendants, \u00a7 52-183 of the General Statutes became applicable. Under this statute, a presumption arose that Shaughnessy was operating the ear as the defendants\u2019 agent. When the presumption applies, it avails \u201cthe plaintiff until such time as the trier finds proven the circumstances of the situation with reference to the use made of the car and the authority of the person operating it to drive it, leaving the burden then upon the plaintiff to establish [i.e. prove], in view of the facts so found, that the ear was being operated\u201d by the driver as the defendants\u2019 agent. <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>Amodeo, </em>118 Conn. 58, 65, 170 A. 486; <em>Leitzes </em>v. <em>F. L. Caulkins Auto Co., </em>123 Conn. 459, 462, 196 A. 145; <em>Koops </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>130 Conn. 185, 188, 32 A.2d 653. Especially in view of the highly improbable testimony of Shaughnessy and the defendants, the jury were amply justified in finding that the statutory presumption of agency had not been rebutted by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The defendants complain of the refusal of the court to include in its instructions a request to charge to the effect that dealer plates may under certain circumstances be properly used in the operation of cars not owned by the dealer. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-58,14-12,14-60. There were, however, no claims of proof that the display of number plates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>on a car not owned by the defendants came within any of the exceptions in the foregoing statutes permitting such use of dealer\u2019s plates. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Curtis, 147 </em>Conn. 311, 316, 160 A.2d 742. To have given such an instruction would have been erroneous since it would have injected into the case an issue unsupported by the claims of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Another request to charge was to the effect that if the operator at the time was on his own business, then there would be no relationship of agency between him and the defendants. The defendants\u2019 claims of proof as to Shaughnessy\u2019s business at the time of the accident came from Shaughnessy himself and were that he was working for \u201cThe Hartford Times\u201d on the day of the accident; that his working hours were from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.; and that at the time of the accident, about 11:30 in the forenoon, he was going to Colt\u2019s Park to eat. If the jury found these claims to be true, then the statutory presumption of agency would be rebutted, and the court so instructed them. See e.g. <em>Neville </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>123 Conn. 395, 400, 195 A. 613; <em>Leitzes </em>v. <em>F. L. Caulkins Auto Co., </em>supra, 463; <em>Amento </em>v. <em>Mortensen, </em>130 Conn. 682, 686, 37 A.2d 231. This charge sufficiently covered the subject matter of the request, as well as that of two other requests to charge along the same lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The plaintiffs attempted to have Shaughnessy identify a paper which gave information as to the ownership and registration of the car he was operating and which they contended he had handed to them at the scene of the accident. Shaughnessy steadfastly disclaimed all knowledge of the paper. The defendants objected to what they claimed was a cross-examination of Shaughnessy on a document not in evidence. The court was entitled to accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the plaintiffs reasonable opportunity to attempt to have Shanghnessy identify the writing. The questions addressed to Shanghnessy did not amount to a cross-examination as to the contents of the writing. The distinction is brought out in cases such as <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Shulman, </em>150 Conn. 651, 658, 193 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The other assignments of error do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\"> \u201cSee. 52-183. presumption op agency in motor vehicle operation.

This method can properly be employed since the statutes in effect at the date of the accident appear in the 1958 Revision without change material to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> \u201cSee. 14-60. use oe dealers\u2019 and repairers\u2019 plates. ...
