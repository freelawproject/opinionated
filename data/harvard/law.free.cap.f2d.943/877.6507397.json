We agree that the trustee did indeed have standing, but deny the petition for rehearing because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364, on which appellant relies and which provides for notice and hearing before debtor can contract post-petition debts, has no application to this case: The new security interest did not involve the extension of new credit by appellee or the acquisition of new debt by debtors and thus the statute is inapplicable on its face. Even if under applicable state law a pre-existing debt could not provide adequate consideration for a security interest, the trustee could not avoid the security interest because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549(a)(2)(B) insulates from avoidance any \u201ctransfer of property\u201d that was \u201cauthorized ... by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">The petition for rehearing will therefore be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
