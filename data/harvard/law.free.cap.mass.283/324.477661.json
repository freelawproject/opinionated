The motion was denied and the plaintiff excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The only testimony having any bearing on the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of waiver is the following, taken verbatim from the transcript of the testimony. It deals with a statement alleged to have been made by the plaintiff to the defendant and is testified to only by the defendant. The plaintiff denied making it. The testimony is that given by the defendant on direct examination: \u201cHe (meaning the plaintiff) said, 'I am only going to bother you once more. I want you to show me the registration of this car.\u2019 So I pulled out the registration and showed it to him. He said, \u2018The son of a gun, he (meaning Danisch) is a crook. He (meaning Danisch) gave me the wrong number.\u2019 He (meaning plaintiff) said, \u2018Well, go ahead and keep on paying him (meaning Danisch) just the same. Don\u2019t even tell him (meaning Danisch) that you saw me, because it is liable to make him mad and he won\u2019t pay me any more.\u2019 He (meaning plaintiff) said, \u2018It is funny business. He (meaning Danisch) pays me $55 a month and you only pay him forty.\u2019 He (meaning plaintiff) said, \u2018Keep on paying him (meaning Danisch). Don\u2019t even tell him you have seen me; it is liable to make him mad and he (meaning Danisch) won\u2019t pay me any more.\u2019\u201d Following this testimony the defendant was asked immediately by his counsel two questions: (1) \u201cFor the purpose of refreshing your recollection, did he say to you that \u2018I won\u2019t bother you any more\u2019? \u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes\u201d; (2) \u201cAbout what?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cAbout that payment, about that car. \u2018I won\u2019t bother you no more\u2019 he (meaning the plaintiff) said.\u201d The jury, by its finding for the defendant upon the issue submitted, must have found that the statement alleged to have been made by the plaintiff was in fact made by him to the defendant. The question for decision here is, assuming the statement was made by the plaintiff to the defendant, Did the statement discharge the defendant from his debt upon the note?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">There is nothing of \u201cwaiver\u201d on this record. The .defendant makes no contention that he kept on paying Danisch nor that he did not tell Danisch that he saw the plaintiff. There is no element of promissory estoppel in the statement \u201cI won\u2019t bother you no more,\u201d for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>son, if no other, that the defendant was not induced thereby to act otherwise than he would have acted if the statement had not been made. There is no evidence that the plaintiff intended by the words <em>\u201c1 </em>won\u2019t bother you any more\u201d to make an oral gift of the defendant\u2019s note to the defendant, nor that the defendant understood by those words that such was the purpose of the plaintiff and accepted the gift. Indeed, an oral gift of a promissory note, like the gift of any personal property which has physical existence, is incomplete and revocable by the donor until there is such delivery of possession as the nature of the property permits. Here there was no evidence of delivery of the note or of intent to give the note which evidenced the debt of the defendant, due and payable to the plaintiff. <em>Cardoza </em>v. <em>Leveroni, </em>233 Mass. 310. <em>Millett </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>280 Mass. 543, 549, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On the evidence a verdict should have been directed for the plaintiff in the sum of $621. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are sustained and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $621, and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
