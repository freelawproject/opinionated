The question of law for decision here is: Does St. 1933, c. 76, fall within the matters excluded from the operation of the referendum because it is a law the operation of which is restricted to particular districts or localities of the Commonwealth? Art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution,, The Referendum, Part III, provides in \u00a7 1: <em>\u201cContents. </em>\u2014 A referendum petition may ask for a referendum to the people upon any law enacted by the general court which is not herein expressly excluded.\u201d Section 2 so far as pertinent to the issue here presented provides: <em>\u201cExcluded Matters. </em>\u2014 No law . . . the operation of which is restricted to a particular town, city or other political division or to particular districts or localities of the commonwealth . . . shall be the subject of a referendum petition.\u201d Section 1 of this act repeals G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 12C-12F, inclusive. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 12C, creates in the department of public utilities a division of smoke inspection and provides for an advisory council with powers defined in \u00a7 12F. Section 12D defines the functions of division inspectors and assistants. Section 12E provides that the salaries and expenses of the director and employees of the division shall be apportioned among certain cities and. towns named in St. 1910, c. 651, as amended, and shall be added to their proportion of the State tax. Section 12F provides that the advisory council (referred to in 12C) shall consist of five unpaid members appointed by the Governor, and that it shall meet regularly \u201cfor the consideration of problems and matters relating to the abatement of smoke.\u201d The said division of smoke inspection in the department of public utilities was established by St. 1930, c. 380, \u00a7 1, (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 12C-12F, inclusive). St. 1910, c. 651, is entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for the abatement of smoke in the city of Boston and vicinity.\u201d By St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 1, it is provided: \u201cIn this act unless the context otherwise requires: \u2018Board\u2019 means the board of gas and electric light commissioners. \u2018District\u2019 means the district to which the provisions of this act shall apply, to wit: \u2014 That part of Boston harbor lying westerly of a line drawn from the southeastern point of Deer island to the northeastern point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of Long island and the territory comprised within the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Everett and Chelsea and the town of Brookline.\u201d St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 1, was amended by St. 1928, c. 301, \u00a7 1, by striking out the third paragraph of \u00a7 1 and inserting in place thereof the following: \u201c \u2018District\u2019 means the district to which the provisions of this act shall apply, to wit: \u2014 That part of Boston harbor lying westerly of aline drawn from the southeastern point of Deer Island to the northeastern point of Long Island and the territory comprised within the cities and towns of Arlington, Belmont, Boston, Braintree, Brookline, Cambridge, Canton, Chelsea, Dedham, Everett, Lynn, Malden, Medford, Mel-rose, Milton, Needham, Newton, Quincy, Revere, Saugus, Somerville, Stoneham, Wakefield, Waltham, Watertown, Weymouth, Winchester, Winthrop and Woburn.\u201d St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 3, provides that the board shall appoint a smoke inspector who shall not engage in any other business, and such deputy inspectors as it may think proper, who shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duties and shall hold office during the pleasure of the board. The remaining sections of St. 1910, c. 651, require that the board, i.e., the board of gas and electric light commissioners, shall enforce the provisions of the act and investigate all complaints made with reference to any violations thereof, make annual reports to the General Court, make rules and regulations with the approval of the Governor and council \u201cfor its own government, for the government of its employees and assistants, for the observation of smoke by the inspector or his duly authorized agents at reasonable intervals, and for keeping proper records of all observations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">The petitioners invoke the cardinal rule of interpretation \u201cthat \u2018. . . where a provision, general in its language and objects, is followed by a proviso, the rule applicable to such cases occurring in statutes has been applied to constitutions, viz.; that the proviso is to be strictly construed, as taking no case out of the provision that does not fairly fall within the terms of the proviso, the latter being understood as carving- out of the provision only specified exception, within the words as well as within the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>of the former.\u2019 Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes, 742,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>254 Mass. 617, 620, and, applying the rule, contend that St. 1933, c. 76, does not fall within the \u201cExcluded Matters.\u201d This contention is based upon the argument that St. 1933, c. 76, \u201cabolishes a division in the department of public utilities . . . transfers the powers and duties of that division to the commission itself, and provides that the commission may appoint a smoke inspector, with assistants, with the obvious object of having the commission assign all (or practically all) of the duties relative to smoke inspection to that inspector,\u201d and that the act puts the business of smoke inspection and the enforcement of the smoke abatement back where it was before the division of smoke inspection was created in 1930. They further contend that St. 1933, c. 76, \u00a7 5, which repealed St. 1930, c. 412, was passed for reasons of economy, in that St. 1930, c. 412, had \u201clargely increased the duties of the division, and so probably its expenses, and abolishes the office of director (the full-time, experienced engineer), and thus saves his salary.\u201d Compare St. 1930, c. 380, \u00a7 1, St. 1933, c. 76, \u00a7 3, St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 3. The petitioners recognize that there is good reason for the exclusion of the operation of referendum laws when applied to legislation relating to religion, religious practices, religious institutions or to the appointment, qualification, removal or compensation of judges, but contend that the exclusion of the right to a referendum petition when the law relates to particular towns, cities, districts and localities requires that the \u201coperation\u201d of such law must be \u201crestricted\u201d to said particular cities, towns, districts or localities; that the intent was to prevent the people' of the Commonwealth as \u00e1 whole from passing upon purely local matters. They further contend that St. 1933, c. 76, is not strictly restricted in its operation to a particular district or locality, in that it abolishes a division in a State department as an economy measure and also abolishes an advisory council on smoke abatement. They concede that the ultimate operation of the law touches primarily those who live-and work in part of Boston Harbor, all of the city of Boston, and twenty-eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>other cities and towns in the neighborhood of Boston; and they admit that those cities and towns are called in St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 1, and in various statutes cited above, a \u201cdistrict.\u201d Inferentially they contend that the word \u201cdistrict\u201d is a misnomer when applied, as here, to an area containing about three hundred square miles, which includes the capital of the Commonwealth and has a population of one million eight hundred thousand. They point out that they \u201ccan easily conceive of the inhabitants of the State as a whole being much interested in the efficient abatement of the smoke nuisance in their State capital and the neighboring vicinity\u201d; that the citizens of the Commonwealth as a whole might well be interested in having an experienced engineer and an advisory council appointed by the Governor administer the anti-smoke laws rather than have the entire work delegated to a smoke inspector appointed by the public utilities commission. They contend that the \u201coperation\u201d of this law in no genuine sense is restricted to a \u201cparticular district or locality\u201d named in St. 1928, c. 301, \u00a7 1, and in support of this contention they point out that it is a matter of common knowledge \u201cthat smoke, with its poisonous and deleterious contents, drifts for long distances from the point of origin of the smoke itself,\u201d and that the towns adjacent to the area or district benefit from the abatement of smoke in towns and cities within the \u201cdistrict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">The petitioners recognize that the particular language of the \u201cExcluded Matters\u201d now under consideration by this court was considered in the debates -in the Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 and that the debates are reported in Debates in Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, vol. II, page 703. It is not controverted by the petitioners that \u201cIt is permissible to examine the debates of the Constitutional Convention for the purpose of ascertaining the views presented to the Convention and the understanding of its members, although the plain 'meaning of the words used in the Amendment cannot be thereby controlled.\u201d <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365, 369. Applying the rule quoted from <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>the petitioners contend that \"the reasons set forth in Mr. Walker\u2019s explanation [respecting Excluded Matters] do not reach to the law now before this court\u201d; that simply calling a group of cities and towns, with part of a harbor, a \"district\u201d (St. 1910, c. 651, \u00a7 1, and St. 1928, c. 301, \u00a7 1) does not make the area described a \u201cdistrict\u201d within the proper use of that word in the section in \"Excluded Matters\u201d nor is the operation of the law \"restricted\u201d to that \"district.\u201d An examination of the Debates in the Constitutional Convention, vol. II, page 677, discloses that the original resolution reported to the Constitutional Convention with respect to excluded matters under the referendum read as follows: \u201cNo law . . . the operation of which is restricted to a town, city or other political division of the Commonwealth, shall be the subject of such referendum petition.\u201d Amendments were offered by Mr. Joseph Walker, of Brookline, to so much of the resolution quoted above, by inserting after the word \u201cdivision\u201d the words \u201cor to a particular district or locality,\u201d and by inserting before the word \"town\u201d the word \u201cparticular.\u201d Pages 702-703. Before the adoption of these amendments, in answer to an inquiry Mr. Walker said: \"The whole purpose of this \u2018Excluded Matters\u2019 is to exclude matters that are not of State wide interest, those that relate merely to a particular town or city. There is no sense in having a State wide referendum or a State wide initiative petition upon it. It has been pointed out to me that by simply saying \u2018town or city\u2019 I was permitting a State wide referendum or a State wide initiative petition on a matter affecting, for instance, the metropolitan district or a group of cities or any locality which could not be defined by the words \u2018a town or city.\u2019 Therefore I am inserting these words so that a provision which relates to a particular district like the metropolitan district would not be the subject of a State wide initiative or referendum.\u201d As respects the words \"or to particular districts or localities\u201d used in art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 2, \"Excluded Matters,\u201d Mr. Walker, in explaining an amendment adding the words \"or to a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ticular district or locality\u201d said: \u201cI think I should have made, perhaps, an exception in regard to that amendment, because that is not purely verbal. Under the heading \u2018Excluded Matters,\u2019 in the resolution, page 5, the intention was to exclude purely local matters, matters that were not State wide matters. A matter relating to a city or town should be dealt with by the Legislature or by that city or town, or by the Legislature referred to that city or town. It is clear that a matter referring to a particular city is not a matter of State wide interest that should be dealt with by the State wide initiative and referendum. At least that is the view of your committee. It was called to my attention that there are groups of towns, such as, for instance, the metropolitan water and sewerage district, the metropolitan park district, and perhaps other districts of that kind, and here is where these words are applicable, \u2018or to a particular district or locality.\u2019 Laws that relate to a particular district or locality as opposed to the Commonwealth as a whole were supposed to be described by those words. That was the purpose of putting them in. It was not intended to change the meaning of that exclusion at all, but to make it clear that it was simply a little wider than a single city or town. It might apply to a group of cities or towns.\u201d Page 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">In the light afforded by the record of the Debates in the Constitutional Convention above quoted, and in view of the <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>254 Mass. 617, and the <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 523, 553-554, we are of opinion that the provisions of St. 1933, c. 76, are restricted in operation to \u201cparticular districts or localities\u201d as this phrase is used in art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution, and that consequently the provisions of St. 1933, c. 76, fall within matters which are excluded from a referendum, and that the petitioners cannot rightly demand from the respondent additional blanks to be signed by other petitioners. It results that the petition is. to be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
