It contained also a covenant by the defendant that he \u201cwill not engage in the business or employment contemplated by this agreement or any similar thereto either as principal, agent or servant, within the territory of the City of Boston and the Newtons, Counties of Suffolk [sic], State of Massachusetts, for one year after any termination of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">After three or four years the defendant was made an assistant route foreman, which took him out on different routes with different drivers to check up on the drivers, solicit new business, adjust complaints of customers and generally to do what was necessary to keep the business in good order and obtain new business. When the man in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>charge announced his intention to make the promotion, he told the defendant that he wanted him to agree never to solicit customers if he left the plaintiff\u2019s employ, and referred to some one who had tried such solicitation in violation of an agreement. The defendant said he \u201cwould not do such a thing.\u201d No new writing was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">The defendant left plaintiff\u2019s employment October 11, 1932. Immediately he began soliciting business from customers on the Belmont and Watertown route of the plaintiff. He had, at times while at work for the plaintiff, operated the route either by himself or in assisting the route driver. He solicited and intended to continue to solicit business from customers whose names he learned while in the plaintiff\u2019s employ, in Belmont, Watertown and elsewhere except in Boston and the Newtons. While working for the plaintiff he received each day a list of customers to be called on- and each week a list of all the customers on the route. These lists he had turned in at the end of the day or the week. He retained none when he ceased work for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">This bill was filed October 18, 1932. It prayed permanent injunction against soliciting or collecting laundry from any customer served by the defendant while employed by the plaintiff or knowledge of whom had been gained while in that employ, or from any of the plaintiff\u2019s employees. It prayed also permanent injunction against disclosing the names or addresses of customers of the plaintiff of which the defendant obtained knowledge while employed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The foregoing facts are shown by the report of a master to which no exception was claimed by either party. The judge ruled that apart from the agreement nothing appeared which would support a decree; that the written agreement had been terminated when the employment as assistant route foreman was entered upon; that the conversation with the manager was too indefinite to constitute a contract not to solicit, and, if sufficiently definite, the contract was unenforceable because unreasonable in time. He ordered decrees confirming the master\u2019s report and dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>No error appears. Even if the written agreement remained in force until October 11, 1932, which we do not mean to imply, the defendant has done nothing in violation of it. The express provision excluding the defendant from solicitation in Boston and the Newtons controls and explains any ambiguity in the earlier provision with reference to the disclosure of names. There was no other limitation on solicitation. The defendant is free to use knowledge honestly acquired. <em>May </em>v. <em>Angoff, </em>272 Mass. 317. <em>Padover </em>v. <em>Axelson, </em>268 Mass. 148. The situation differs essentially from that in <em>Boston &amp; Suburban Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Reilly, </em>253 Mass. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The conversation with the manager is fully as consistent with an assurance that if the defendant made a promise such as that made by the person referred to, he would never do such a thing as to break it, as with a promise, binding beyond the period of employment, never to solicit customers. We cannot properly say the judge was wrong in thinking the plaintiff had failed to show that a binding contract suitably limited as to time had been made. See <em>Becker College of Business Administration &amp; Secretarial Science </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>281 Mass. 355, 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">There are no circumstances of confidential or fiduciary relationship which will sustain an injunction. See <em>Club Aluminum Co. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>263 Mass. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
