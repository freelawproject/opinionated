In lieu of a provision in the contract requiring a bond of $5,000 as security for payment to the defendant for all goods delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s customers, it was orally agreed that twenty-five per cent of the plaintiff\u2019s share of the profits should be retained by the defendant as security for such payment. The relations of the parties under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>contract ceased about August 1, 1928, and on January 8, 1931, this action of contract was brought to recover $2,082.25 alleged to have been retained by the defendant as such security, with interest, the plaintiff alleging that all the debts from customers had been collected. The defendant answered, denying generally and setting up payment, and also filed a declaration in set-off, alleging that the bad debts exceeded the amount retained by $632.60. Subject to exceptions of the defendant, the trial judge refused to direct a verdict in its favor upon the plaintiff\u2019s declaration or upon its own declaration in set-off. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff upon his declaration in the sum of $926.68, and a verdict for the plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s declaration in set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The only question is whether there was evidence to support the verdicts. The only evidence of the amount retained by the defendant as- security is its admission that it retained $2,021.71. The debts due at the time of the trial from the plaintiff\u2019s customers to the defendant, after the lapse of some years, amounted to considerably more than that sum, even according to the \u201ccontentions\u201d of the plaintiff. He endeavors to divide those debts into \u201cbad\u201d and \u201ccollectible\u201d debts, and to deprive the defendant of the benefit of the fund as security for the debts that he considers \u201ccollectible.\u201d But it is clear that the bond required by the written contract was to stand as security for payment to the defendant for \u201call goods sold\u201d by the plaintiff, and the substituted fund, according to the evidence, was to secure the defendant for \u201cdebts which were uncollectible or which were past due.\u201d There was no evidence that the defendant failed to take reasonable measures to collect the debts. We find no evidence to support, the verdicts. Upon. the obscure bill of exceptions, \u2022 however, we think it better not to order judgment under G. L. (Ter. - Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 122, 123 <em>(Libby </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>277 Mass. 1, 5; <em>Vallavanti </em>v. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>264 Mass. 337, 341), but to let the entry be</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
