G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1. The relation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>employer and employee is the same ^elation that is familiar throughout the law under the name of master and servant, except that to be an employee, as distinguished from a servant generally <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>219 Mass. 160), one must serve under a contract of hire. <em>Humphrey\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 166. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>State Theatre Co. </em>256 Mass. 466. <em>Labatte </em>v. <em>Lavallee, 258 </em>Mass. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The exact point at issue is whether the claimant was a servant or employee, or an independent contractor. The essence of the distinction is the right of control. If the person doing the work is responsible only for the performance of what he agrees to do, in the way in which he agrees to do it, and is not subject to direction and control as to every detail of the work, he is an independent contractor. On the other hand, if at every moment, with respect to every detail, he is bound to obedience and subject to direction and control, as distinguished from a right of inspection and insistence that the contract be performed <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Texas Co. </em>262 Mass. 425, and cases cited; <em>Kettleman </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>229 Mass. 89; <em>Pribulo </em>v. <em>Chiarelli, </em>114 Conn. 32; Note 20 Am. L. R. 684) or a right to designate the work to be done under the contract <em>(Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>181 Mass. 416; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>204 Mass. 110; <em>Eckert\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. 577; <em>Gallagher\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 455; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Pallotta, </em>274 Mass. 110, 114; <em>Strong\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 243), then he is a servant or employee. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412. <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co. </em>265 Mass. 236, 238. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Coleman Bros. Inc. </em>277 Mass. 319, 321, 322. Other considerations and tests are important only as they bear upon the right of control. <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>56 Fed. Rep. (2d) 67. <em>Howard W. Luff Co. </em>v. <em>Capece, </em>61 Fed. Rep. (2d) 635. <em>Clark\u2019s Case, </em>124 Maine, 47. If payment for the work is made, the method of payment, whether by the job, the piece, cost plus a percentage, commission, day, hour, or not expressly determined, is not controlling, although it may be important. <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Amesbury National Bank, </em>181 Mass. 154. <em>Corliss </em>v. <em>Keown, </em>207 Mass. 149, 152. <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>211 Mass. 590. <em>McAllis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>ter\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 193. <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 399. <em>Wescott </em>v. <em>Henshaw Motor Co. </em>275 Mass. 82, 88. <em>Strong\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 243. <em>Hawker\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 335. <em>Glielmi </em>v. <em>Netherland Dairy Co. Inc. </em>254 N. Y. 60. One may be a servant though far away from the master, or so much more skilled than the master that actual direction and control would be folly, for it is the right to control rather than the exercise of it that is the test. It has been' held that one may be a servant though he furnish the labor of others whom he hires. <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>137 Mass. 123. <em>Murray\u2019s Case, </em>130 Maine, 181. Compare <em>Dane </em>v. <em>Cochrane Chemical Co. </em>164 Mass. 453, 455, 456; <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Amesbury National Bank, </em>181 Mass. 154; <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Newfell, </em>275 Mass. 279. While engaged in the same general work, one may be at certain times and for certain purposes the servant of a party, and at other times or for other purposes an independent contractor or the servant of another. <em>Cain </em>v. <em>Hugh Nawn Contracting Co. </em>202 Mass. 237. <em>Centrello\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 456. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>240 Mass. 8. <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 399. <em>Pelletier\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 490. <em>Wescott </em>v. <em>Henshaw Motor Co. </em>275 Mass. 82. <em>Manley\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the present case the claimant was a journeyman steamfitter, a member of the union, who had worked at times for contractors and at times for the Rome Realty Corporation. While working for the Rome Realty Corporation he had received the union rate of $1.25 an hour. On February 20, 1931, the agent of the Rome Realty Corporation found him in a plumbing shop where he had sometimes been employed and hired him to repair a frozen sprinkler system in one of its buildings. Nothing was said about pay, but it could be inferred that the customary rate was understood. The claimant testified that the agent gave him his orders and told him \u201cjust what to do\u201d before he started the work; but in another passage in the record the claimant testified that the only instructions given were \u201cto replace the sprinklers that were frozen.\u201d The next day after he began work the claimant was hurt by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>fall of a wrench upon him. The Industrial Accident Board found that he was an employee of the Rome Realty Corporation, not an independent contractor, and awarded him compensation. The Superior Court entered a decree accordingly, and the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">This case is not like <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Amesbury National Bank, </em>181 Mass. 154, where the defendant was held not liable for the negligence of the servants of one Sawyer, who had a regular place of business, in trying to stop a flow of water under a general employment without stated price to do whatever was necessary to that end. It resembles more an illustration used by Knowlton, J., in his dissenting opinion. In the present case the claimant was a journeyman, not conducting an independent business, but accustomed to work as a servant for contractors. As to compensation the terms of his employment with the Rome Realty Corporation did not differ from the terms of his employment with contractors, and it may be inferred that the same relationship was created. The Industrial Accident Board could find that he was an employee. <em>McAllister\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 193. <em>Churchill\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 117. <em>Hill\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 491. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>281 Mass. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The decree recites that \u201cit is impracticable to compute the \u2018average weekly wages\u2019\u201d of the claimant, and there being no evidence that any person was employed at the same work by the same employer, resort was had to \u201cthe average weekly amount which, during the twelve months previous to the injury, was being earned ... by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1). <em>Snow\u2019s Case, 252 </em>Mass. 426; <em>S. C. </em>259 Mass. 376. <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 137. Such \u201caverage weekly amount\u201d was fixed at $55 a week because that was the union rate of wages for a full week, and under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34, the maximum weekly compensation of $18 a week was allowed. But an examination of the record fails to show any evidence that a steamfitter in the same district actually did earn or could have earned so much. <em>Snow\u2019s Case, 252 </em>Mass. 426. For this reason the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>must be reversed and the case recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board for further hearing on the question of average weekly wages under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), at which hearing either party may offer additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
