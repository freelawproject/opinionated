There was testimony that \u201cThe room was too cold to work in without heat\u201d and that \u201cIt was absolutely necessary to have these pipes installed in order to run the plant.\u201d The claimant was to work eight hours a day and to receive ninety cents an hour. The superintendent of the factory testified that he gave the claimant his orders, and that if any dispute had arisen as to how the work should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>be done, the directions of the superintendent would have governed, although the claimant had technical knowledge which the superintendent lacked. While pushing pipes into place the claimant injured his shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">At first the reviewing board of the Industrial Accident Board, reversing the decision of the single member, decided that the claimant was not an employee but an independent contractor; that the employment in which he was engaged was not in the usual course of the business of Garrett, the subscriber; and that the claimant was not entitled to compensation. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4). One of the members of the reviewing board did not join in the decision. After the decision of the reviewing board, an opinion of this court indicated that the claimant might be held to have been engaged in the usual course of Garrett\u2019s business when he was hurt. <em>Shannon\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 92. We need not consider whether these circumstances of disagreement among the members of the board as to the status of the claimant as an employee, and of uncertainty at least as to whether the decision of the other question was consistent with <em>Shannon\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 92, justified the Superior Court in recommitting the case to the Industrial Accident Board for further hearing (see <em>Devine\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 588, 595; <em>Sciola\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 407; <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 495; <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 581, 585-588, and cases cited), for even if there was error in the interlocutory decree of recommittal, the error related to procedural matter and not to either the merits or the sufficiency of the pleadings, and consequently is not open on appeal from the final decree on the theory that the final decree was \u201cerroneously affected thereby,\u201d there having been no appeal from the interlocutory decree.

That finding was warranted. <em>McDermott\u2019s Case, ante, </em>74. The board found also that the claimant was not within the exception excluding from the benefit of the act a workman \u201cwhose employment is not in the usual course of the trade, business, profession or occupation of his employer.\u201d G.
