L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25, to collect a balance of $18.89 alleged to be withheld over his protest from $566.66 due the plaintiff as salary for February, 1932, as clerk of the Superior Court for civil business for the county of Suffolk. The defendant filed a jury claim and affidavit that there was an issue of fact requiring trial, and the case was thereupon removed to the Superior Court. The defendant then filed, specifications to the effect that this \u201cclaim being for salary the fact to be determined is, whether or not the same has been paid or is still owing. The defendant says that the plaintiff, has been paid in full and that the defendant owes him nothing.\u201d No further pleadings were required by the court. The case was tried to a jury upon agreement that if finding was made for the plaintiff $18.89 was one day\u2019s pay for the plaintiff and that the verdict might be for that sum. It was admitted by the defendant that that sum was deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s salary for February, 1932, under direction of the mayor of the defendant. The plaintiff testified with respect to payment of the February salary that he was handed the payroll sheet showing $566.66 as due him by the paymaster at the city hall; that he signed it and handed it back to the paymaster, who then paid him $547.77, saying that a day\u2019s pay had been deducted; that the plaintiff protested; that there was nothing else on the payroll when he signed except the statement showing $566.66 due him; that on the payroll sheet as produced in evidence there had been added above his signature, but subsequently to his signing it, two statements which he specified and which were embodied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the questions to the jury hereafter quoted. It appeared that on the payroll and above the signature of the plaintiff was this: \"Received the amount set against our names respectively being in full for services for the time stated.\u201d From exhibits in evidence it appeared that the deduction from the payroll was made pursuant to direction of the mayor as part of a general plan to raise a large fund for unemployment relief in the city of Boston. The plaintiff further testified that he immediately wrote and sent a letter of protest directed to the mayor, the city auditor and the city treasurer, asserting a right to his full salary and the privilege of making contributions for such relief in his own way. The only witness called by the defendant was a clerk in its auditing department, who testified concerning the payroll sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The only facts in controversy as developed at the trial were whether the two statements which appeared on the payroll as produced at the trial, and which the plaintiff testified were not on it when he signed it, were then in truth on it. The trial judge submitted two questions to the jury. The first question was: \"Did the payroll sheet, Exhibit 1 . . . contain the following words and figures: \u2018Amount 566.66, Unemployment Relief Fund 18.89, Net Amount 547.77/ when the plaintiff signed the payroll?\u201d The second question was: \"Did the payroll sheet, Exhibit 1, contain the following words: \u2018The Unemployment Relief Fund deduction is made by the Auditor of the County of Suffolk upon order of the Mayor of the City of Boston\u2019 when the plaintiff signed the payroll? \u201d The jury answered each question in the negative. Verdict was thereupon ordered in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant excepted to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict in its favor and to the verdict ordered. The concluding sentence of the exceptions is: \"This bill is intended to raise two questions,\u2014 First as to whether or not the entire question should have been submitted to the jury for a finding, and not limited to questions, and, \u2014 Second, if upon the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff he is entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Plainly, a verdict could not rightly have been directed in favor of the defendant. The payroll with its formal general receipt in full was not a technical release, <em>Gold Medal Sewing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>124 Mass. 206, 208, but merely a receipt which was open to explanation. <em>Lubin </em>v. <em>Hedtler, </em>251 Mass. 422, 424. <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Holstein Rubber Co. </em>281 Mass. 297, 301. As confessedly the full amount of his salary was not received by the plaintiff, such receipt did not bar the plaintiff. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Odd Fellows\u2019 Mutual Relief Association, </em>145 Mass. 134, 137. Moreover, the subsequent alteration of the payroll sheet after the signature by the plaintiff without his consent would deprive it of legal force. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>12 Cush. 61, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">It was proper for the trial judge to submit the questions to the jury, both under our general practice and under statute. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Brierley, </em>189 Mass. 598, 604. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>211 Mass. 156. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>245 Mass. 1, 6. <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>275 Mass. 455, 459. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 124. The questions were adequate in form, covered decisive issues of fact, and tended to simplify and expedite the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In view of the answers of the jury to the questions submitted to them, in the light of all the evidence there was no question of fact open for further consideration. There was no basis for finding a release by the plaintiff upon any valuable consideration, or any relinquishment by him of the full amount due him. The rule of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Grow, </em>249 Mass. 495, was inapplicable. There was no controversy as to the amount due the plaintiff for salary for the month in question. In view of the answers of the jury, there was nothing in the record to raise a question of fact. The plaintiff was entitled to his full salary as matter of law. Therefore verdict in his favor was directed rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">It has not been argued that the action was not properly brought against the defendant. <em>Hibbard </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>163 Mass. 34, 39. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>212 Mass. 127, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
