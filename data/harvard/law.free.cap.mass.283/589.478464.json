The accident Occurred on the morning of February 14, 1928, on Main Street, Walpole, Massachusetts, near the corner of Guild Street, and is alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 declarations to have been caused by reason of the gross negligence of the defendant. The answers were a general denial and contributory negligence. The cases were tried together in the Superior Court to a jury. It was agreed by counsel that the testimony of each plaintiff would be admissible for and in behalf of the several plaintiffs. All the evidence material to the question here presented is contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant filed motions that verdicts for the defendant be ordered in each case. The judge denied the motion and submitted the cases to the jury on the counts for gross negligence, with leave reserved in accordance with the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 120, to order verdicts entered for the defendant, if, upon the exceptions taken or question of law reserved, the trial judge or the Supreme Judicial Court should decide that such verdicts for the defendant should have been entered. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case. Later, in accordance with leave reserved, the judge ordered the entry of verdicts for the defendant.. The plaintiffs duly excepted to such orders and the cases are before this court on their bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The brief for the plaintiffs contains the statement: \u201cThe only issue presented by these exceptions for determination by the Supreme Judicial Court is \u2014 I. Was there evidence for the jury of gross negligence on the part of the defendant in the operation by the defendant of his automobile at the time of the occurrence of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The rule governing the action of the trial judge in ordering a verdict for the defendant after statutory leave has been reserved is the same as obtains where the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s action is questioned in ordering a verdict for the defendant at the close of all the evidence in a case without submitting the case to the jury. In either situation \u201cIt is only when \u2018the court can find no evidence which, in its deliberate and ultimate judgment, is entitled to be weighed\u2019 that \u2018the jury should be instructed in terms that there is no evidence to support the burden of proof which rests upon the party.\u2019\u201d <em>Le Baron </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 289, 291-292. \u201cWe are sensible of the danger of drawing the line too near to due care, and of finding gross negligence where only ordinary negligence exists,\u201d and realize that \u201cEach case . . . must be decided according to its peculiar features.\u201d <em>Evensen </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>187 Mass. 77, 79. Gross negligence, as defined without the exactness of a mathematical demonstration in <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591-593, see <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>269 Mass. 554, 560-562, <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>273 Mass. 557, 561, is distinguished from ordinary negligence in that it is different in degree and not in kind. It is a heedless and palpable violation of legal duty respecting the rights of others which amounts to indifference to present legal duty and to utter forgetfulness of legal obligation so far as other persons may be affected; the element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is magnified to a high degree, as compared with that present in ordinary negligence, and is a manifestly smaller amount of watchfulness and circumspection than the circumstances require of a person of ordinary prudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The facts which the jury could warrantably find upon the testimony of the plaintiffs and the defendant are in substance as follows: On the day of the accident the plaintiffs and the defendant were employed as mechanics engaged in the erection of a high school building in East Walpole. On that morning the defendant by prearrangement met the several plaintiffs at various points on the road en route from the defendant\u2019s home to Walpole, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>fendant having undertaken to transport them as guests to the place of their common job. Including the defendant, who did the driving, there were six men in the automobile. They left Forest Hills station, which is distant from Walpole about fifteen miles, shortly after-7 a.m. and proceeded along the State Road toward Walpole at a speed of about thirty miles an hour. When they got to Norwood they stopped at a restaurant and had some coffee. After leaving Norwood the defendant drove the automobile for about two miles'at the rate of about forty miles an hour. As they proceeded on' Main Street on the outskirts, they came up with a large closed-in moving van which was going in the same direction. Main Street, near the corner of Guild Street where the accident is alleged to have occurred, is a road of white concrete twenty feet wide with macadam shoulders 'On-each side, making a total width of twenty-five or twenty-six: feet. At the scene of the accident there was a slight in- '\u2022 Cline in the road which curved to the right so that a driver of an automobile in passing around a truck or automobile \u201ccould not see whether there was any one coming over the brow of the incline beyond.\u201d In these conditions, which inferentially could be properly found to have been known to the defendant, when his automobile came within twenty to fifty feet of the large truck or van ahead of him, the automobile was moving at the rate of forty to forty-five miles an hour and the truck was going about thirty-five miles an hour. The defendant then increased the speed of his automobile and started to turn out from the rear of the truck and to pass to its left. As the defendant got to the left of the center of the road he increased the speed and \u201cwent a little faster to pass it and get ahead of it.\u201d As he \u2022turned to pass the truck he did not see any vehicle coming from the opposite direction because the curve in the road and the furniture van ahead of him obstructed his vision. When his automobile came alongside the left of the truck he was endeavoring to pass, he saw a truck coming from the opposite direction about two or three hundred feet away; Seeing this truck coming toward him he gave the matter no concern because he figured he could clear it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>One of the plaintiffs said to the defendant \u201cthat he could not make it,\u201d and the defendant replied \u201cthat it was his car and he could do as he pleased with it.\u201d As he saw the oncoming car another of the plaintiffs said: \u201cFrank, don\u2019t be foolish; you can\u2019t make it,\u201d and the defendant replied \u201cTo h \u2014 11 I can\u2019t, \u2014 if I can\u2019t make it, I will take a wheel off.\u201d Others in the automobile also told the defendant \u201cnot to be 'foolish because he couldn\u2019t make it.\u2019\u201d In disregard of these protests \u201cthe defendant gave the car all the gas he had,\u201d and put \u201chis foot . . . right down hard on the board or gas pedal.\u201d The automobile proceeded on the left of the truck they were passing and just missed it. The defendant\u2019s automobile swerved to the right and hit the truck which was coming from the opposite direction, skidded and tipped over on its right side, causing the injuries to the plaintiffs for which they seek damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">On all the evidence we think the jury were warranted in finding the defendant guilty of gross negligence, as that term is defined in <em>Altman </em>v. Aronson, 231 Mass. 588, and applied in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>261 Mass. 494, <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>269 Mass. 554, <em>McCarron </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>270 Mass. 39, <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>271 Mass. 390, <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>274 Mass. 83, <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>274 Mass. 100, <em>Dzura </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>275 Mass. 283, <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>277 Mass. 273, and <em>Schusterman </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>280 Mass. 582. In each action the exceptions are sustained, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
