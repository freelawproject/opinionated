P. Federico and Susi Company. It was not disputed that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and that his average weekly wages before the injury were $40 a week. The claimant for a time was awarded the maximum weekly compensation of $18 a week for total disability. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34. After April 17, 1930, it was determined by the Industrial Accident Board that the average weekly wages which he was able to earn in his injured condition amounted to $25 a week, and he was accordingly awarded compensation for partial incapacity of $10 a week, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 35. The insurer, at some time between March 25, 1931, and September 14, 1931, applied for a discontinuance of this compensation, and on September 24, 1932, the Industrial Accident Board denied its application. The Superior Court entered a decree for payment of the compensation awarded by the board, and the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Under the statute, partial incapacity for work resulting from an injury is compensated by payment of two thirds the difference between the average weekly wages before the injury and \u201cthe average weekly wages which he [The claimant] is able to earn thereafter,\u201d with an immaterial limitation. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 35. The point in the present case is, that after the injury the claimant\u2019s father died, and the claimant succeeded him as one of two equal partners in the partnership known as L. P. Federico and Susi Company. The claimant\u2019s capital investment in the business was $5,000, but the profits of the business have caused the value of his share greatly to exceed that sum. He draws $25 a week regularly, and profits have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>divided at various times. His injury is permanent and impairs his ability to work. The claimant\u2019s average weekly income from the business is in excess of his average weekly wages before the injury, and the insurer contends that he is no longer entitled to compensation. The Industrial Accident Board found, however, that his earning capacity and the value of his personal services to the partnership do not exceed $25 a week;</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Apart from compensation for the injuries specified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 37, compensation to an employee under the workmen\u2019s compensation act is awarded solely for impairment of earning capacity. The \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d which a claimant \u201cis able to earn\u201d after the injury are not limited to those which he could earn in the same employment. <em>Sensk\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 232, 234. Compare <em>Gagnon\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 334, and <em>Quebec\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 80, which relate to a different provision of the statute. The words quoted include the whole monetary result of a reasonable use of all his powers, mental and physical, whether working for others or for himself, and whether his earnings are called \u201cwages\u201d in common speech or not. See <em>Sensk\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 232, 234; <em>Powers\u2019s Case, 275 </em>Mass. 515. Talents previously undiscovered or undeveloped may produce an earning capacity greater than that enjoyed prior to a permanent injury which made a continuance of the earlier work impossible. In such a case there is no ground for compensation under the act, except for specified injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">But one may have income other than earnings, and such income does not affect his right to compensation. In <em>Sensk\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 232, income obtained by soliciting . alms was held immaterial upon the question of the amount which a claimant was \u201cable to earn\u201d after being permanently crippled. The income from a claimant\u2019s \u201csavings\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 38), or from other capital, does not arise from his ability to earn. The income of the present claimant as a partner in a contracting firm results from a combination of factors of which his labor, skill and judgment constitute only one. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Railway, </em>221 Mass. 116. <em>Hendler </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>278 Mass. 339, 342. <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>268 Mass. 440. See also <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Sharaffa, </em>281 Mass. 329; <em>Calico Printers\u2019 Association, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Higham, </em>[1912] 1 K. B. 93, 102. In some partnerships, the total disability of one partner would make little or no difference in his income or that of the partnership. There is no evidence that the claimant is skilled as a business manager. The appraisal made by the Industrial Accident Board of the ability of the claimant, since the injury, to earn \u201cwages\u201d or money by whatever name his earnings may be described, was supported by the evidence. The broader construction given to the word \u201cearnings\u201d in the statute relating to recording assignments of \u201cfuture earnings\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 154, \u00a7 6) is not controlling. <em>Jenks </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>102 Mass. 235. <em>Chester </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>185 Mass. 54. <em>William Gilligan Co. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>205 Mass. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
