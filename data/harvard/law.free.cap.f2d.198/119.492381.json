Prior to his discharge by appellant, appellee was employed as the superintendent on an electrical subcontracting job to be performed by appellant near Fairbanks, Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The facts, which are undisputed in their material aspects, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Appellee (called Neill) is a superintendent of electrical work and the appellant corporation (called Morgan) is engaged in the business of electrical contracting. Prior to the execution of the contract of employment here involved, appellant had been the successful bidder on two electrical sub-contracts to be performed at Ladd Field, near Fairbanks, Alaska. After negotiations' during the month of May, 1949, and continuing into early June of the same year, which negotiations were conducted by mail, telegram, and by oral discussion, appellant and appellee entered into a contract of employment under which appellee was to act as superintendent in charge of appellant\u2019s operations under the aforementioned two sub-contracts. The final agreement between the parties was formulated in a letter, dated June 1, 1949, setting forth some of the terms of the agreement between the parties. A copy thereof, marked Exhibit \u201cA\u201d in the trial court, is set out below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Appellee commenced work on June 6, 1949. On June 25, 1949, while returning<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a visit to the home of a friend and a project of appellant, appellee had an accident with appellant\u2019s truck and suffered a. broken leg. Appellee did not return to his-job at any time following his injury, although he testified that it was not so serious as to require him to remain in bed. Shortly before July 10th, Neill was discharged from his employment and was later given, at his own request, a letter explaining in writing that the reason for appel-lee\u2019s discharge was his \u201cfailure to carry out the necessary functions of the position you accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">Appellant specifies as error the rulings, of the trial court in sustaining appellee\u2019smotion to strike the second defense in the original answer, and in sustaining appellee\u2019s motion to strike the third and fourth defenses in appellant\u2019s amended answer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All of the stricken allegations pertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to certain acts of negligence and disobedience on the part of Neill which appellant urged as justification for Neill\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Although the record does not indicate the grounds upon which the trial court granted the motions to strike, appellant, in its brief, states that the \u201c* * * trial court\u2019s ruling * * * was predicated upon the erroneous conclusion that it was necessary that appellant allege an undertaking by the appellee to do those things which it was alleged he had failed to do, before such failure would constitute a defense to his action.\u201d The record shows that thereupon appellant filed an amended answer wherein it was specifically alleged that appellee had failed to follow the oral instructions of appellant in each of the derelictions of duty upon which appellant relied. The trial court again granted appellant\u2019s motion to strike, deleting from appellant\u2019s amended answer the third and fourth defenses (see Footnote 2). Here again, the record is silent as to the reasons for granting appellee\u2019s motions, but appellant\u2019s brief points out that \u201c* * * the trial court stated that it felt that the burden was on appellant to allege that ap-pellee had <em>expressly agreed </em>to follow appellant\u2019s instructions to do those things which appellant alleged he had failed to do, before such failure could constitute a defense to his action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Appellee is quick to point out that there is nothing in \u2019the record to support these allegations, but a comparison of the original answer and the amended answer with the second amended answer (which was finally approved by the trial court) makes it evident that the appellant\u2019s explanation of the trial court\u2019s reasons is correct. In other words, only when appellant alleged express promises on the part of appellee to do those things which appellant contends he thereafter failed to do, was appellant\u2019s second amended pleading permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">We agree with appellant that the effect of these rulings was to place on appellant the burden of proving not only that appellee had failed to follow appellant\u2019s instructions, but of further proving that Neill had \u201cexpressly agreed\u201d to follow these instructions as part of his contract of employment. The theory behind such a ruling is unrealistic and without substance in law. It overlooks the universally recognized law of implied promises. It is aptly summarized in 24 L.R.A.,N.S., 814:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">\u201cThe duty of a servant to comply with all lawful and reasonable orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>given by his master with respect to the performance of such functions as fall within the scope of the employment is one of those fundamental obligations which are deemed to be impliedly undertaken as an incident of every contract of hiring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">If it be true, as the stricken matter alleges, that Neill failed to follow instructions as therein particularly specified, then the rulings of the trial court in granting appellee\u2019s motions to strike imposed upon appellant an added burden of proof which the law does not impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Appellee contends, however, that any error committed by the trial court in striking appellant\u2019s defenses, has been waived hy appellant\u2019s failure to assign those rulings as error in its motion for a new trial, under the provisions of A.C.L.A. 1949, \u00a7 55-7-132. The Alaska statutory authority cited by appellee is, of course, inapplicable, since the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are here controlling. The court had granted the motions to strike over the protest of appellant. Its objections were voiced in the argument on the motions and reference thereto appears in the record. See Rule 46, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S. C.A. Rule 59 dealing with motions for a new trial does not add force to appellee\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">On a motion for a new trial the losing party should not be compelled (as the price of maintaining his objections to court rulings on a later appeal) to again present all of his previous objections to motions to strike his pleadings. The previous orders of the court, if legally objectionable, may be reviewed on appeal if properly presented. They are covered in appellant\u2019s specification of errors and in its points to be relied upon on appeal. The rulings complained of deprived appellant of an important element in its defense and this deprivation is reviewable in this court. We regard it as prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Appellant urges that the contract of employment is unenforceable under the provisions of the Alaska Statute of Frauds, A.C.L. 58-2-2, pertaining to an \u201cagreement that by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making thereof\u201d. To support its theory that the instant contract falls within the quoted provisions of that statute, appellant refers to appellee\u2019s supplemental complaint, where, surprisingly, appellee himself states that \u201csaid contract would require more than one (1) year to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Even if appellant\u2019s contention in this regard be a valid one, as an original proposition, (which we do not here decide) it is not properly before this court on this appeal. Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enumerates certain matters that a party must plead affirmatively, among which matters is the defense of the Statute of Frauds. Failure to plead this defense results in waiver of it under Rule 12(b), (h). Oedekerk v. Muncie Gear Works, Inc., 7 Cir., 179 F.2d 821. Since appellant did not plead the statute affirmatively or raise it as a defense in its points to be relied upon on appeal, we do not consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Because the matter may again arise in subsequent proceedings in this case, we examine briefly Instructions 2(a) and 2(b), the giving of which appellant specifies as error. There, in instructing the jury on the obligation of an employee to perform the expressed reasonable orders of his employer, the court conditioned such instruction on the \u201cabsence of a contrary provision in the contract of hiring.\u201d It is this last clause, in substance, against which appellant\u2019s attack is directed. The particular argument is that since there was no evidence, whatsoever, of any \u201ccontrary provision\u201d in the contract of hiring, the instruction was not applicable to the issues and serves only to confuse or mislead the jury. We feel obliged to share appellant\u2019s view in this regard; such an instruction serves no worthwhile purpose and it was error to present it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">It is unnecessary to consider other errors assigned by appellant, inasmuch as we have previously pointed out errors which necessitate a new trial. The cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. \u201cMr. Henry Neill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYL\">\u201cMorgan Electric Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">\u201cP.O.
