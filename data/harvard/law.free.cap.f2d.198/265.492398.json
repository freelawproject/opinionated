This has been the uniform ruling of the Tax Court in similar cases and, so far as we are aware, of such District Courts as have considered the question. Decisions to the same effect have recently been announced by two Courts of Appeals. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Weis-man, 1 Cir., 197 F.2d 221; Hofferbert v. Anderson Oldsmobile Company, 4 Cir., 197 F.2d 504. These two decisions lessen our labor and shorten our opinion, for we generally approve the reasoning and result pronounced in them. Upon their authority, the decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b314-12\">STRUM, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACi\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">With deference to the able judges, in this circuit and elsewhere, who have taken the opposite view, I am opposed to an interpretation of the tax laws which will enable a taxpayer to gain a tax advantage \u2022by violating the price stabilization laws, thus placing himself in a better position than had he obeyed the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">The taxing authorities should not be compelled to recognize a merchandise \u201ccost,\u201d the payment of which is expressly proscribed and denounced as a crime by federal law. \u201cCost,\u201d as used in Treasury Regulation 111, Sec. 29.22(a)-5, means \u201clawful cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
