The pertinent sections of the complaint may be summarized thus: The defendants, directors of the Farnsworth Company, published false statements of material facts concerning the financial condition of the company. This the defendants did to induce purchases of shares of stock in that company owned by them. Soon after defendants had sold all their shares of stock, the plaintiffs, misled by the false statements, purchased some Farnsworth shares on the stock exchange where Farnsworth stock was listed. When, later, the true facts about the company\u2019s financial condition were disclosed, the price of the stock fell. Plaintiffs sold at the lower price, with resultant damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On motion by the defendants, the trial judge dismissed the complaint. Plis basic reason was the absence of any \u201csemblance of privity\u201d between plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-26\">2. His decision has been excellently discussed and criticized in a Comment in 4 Stanford Law Review (1952) 308, from which I quote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-27\">\u201cRule X10B-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, passed pursuant to \u00a7 78j(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides: It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>any national securities exchange, (a) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">\u201cThe Farnsworth case raises the question of what class of persons may recover in an action for fraud under the Statute and the Rule. The court held that the plaintiffs were outside the class of persons entitled to recover. The reason given by the court, lack of \u2018privity,\u2019 is not satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">\u201cOne purpose of the Act is to extend common-law liability or fraud in security transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even at common law, there was no requirement of privity of contract in an action for fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If privity of contract was not required at common law, a fortiori, privity of contract is not required under the statute and the rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-7\">\u201cThe common law, however, did require that the person relying upon a misrepresentation be within the ambit of persons whom the defendant actually intended to defraud. In Peek v. Gurney <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant directors issued a prospectus containing.misrepresentations and nondisclosures of material facts to induce persons to buy stock directly from the defendant company. The plaintiff, relying on the prospectus, bought stock, not from the defendant, but from another on the market. The House of Lords denied recovery for fraud since defendants did not intend to induce the plaintiff to enter the particular transaction which occasioned plaintiff\u2019s loss. The Restatement of Torts has adopted this limitation : * * * the maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability * * * only to those persons to whom it is made with the intent to cause them to act in reliance upon it and to such persons only for the pecuniary harm suffered by them by relying upon it in the transaction or type of transaction in which the maker intended to influence their conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-12\">\u201cThis rule would support the result in the principal case, and may well have been what the' court meant by \u2018some semblance of privity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-13\">\u201cBut the modern tendency is to depart from the limitation of Peek v. Gurney.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Liability has been imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>where plaintiffs have relied on intentional misrepresentations though the defendant had no intent to influence the particular person or class of persons. This relaxation of the Peek v. Gurney limitation has occurred primarily in cases where false statements were embodied in negotiable instruments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It has not, as yet, been extended to stock transactions such as those in the principal case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The extension of liability is predicated upon reasonable anticipation by the defendant that one in the plaintiff\u2019s position would rely. In the principal case, there were intentional misrepresentations and nondisclosures calculated to portray the financial stability of .the Corporation. It does not tax credulity to say that the defendants might have foreseen and anticipated reliance by such persons as the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">\u201cIn spite of the recent trend to the contrary, Peek v. Gurney may still be the weight of authority.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The crucial question then is, should this common-law limitation he applied under the Statute and the Rule? Or, does the Statute command a broader interpretation concurrent with the modern tendency away from the Peek v. Gurney limitation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-9\">\u201cThe language of Rule X10B-S is broad. It speaks of \u2018 * * * any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon <em>any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. </em>[Emphasis added.] <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, House and Senate Reports of the Securities and Exchange Act support the conclusion that the class of persons entitled to actionably rely on false statements is not the narrow or restricted class of Peek v. Gurney.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-11\">\u201cThe language and legislative history of the Statute and Rule, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>decline of the Peek v. Gurney limitation at common law, impels a conclusion that the limitation should be rejected under Rule X10B-5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Loss, Securities Regulation (1951) 1064 (and note 404), refers to the trial judge\u2019s opinion in the case at bar, and says that the absence of privity should not be a proper barrier to a claim like plaintiffs\u2019.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">3. Loss does, however, question whether a suit under Rule X10B-5 is free of the restrictions that would govern a suit under \u00a7 9(e), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78i(e), a section which would also apparently apply here. But he raised the same sort of question (pp. 1061-1062) concerning our decision in Fischman v. Raytheon Manufacturing Co., 2 Cir., 188 F.2d 783, where we disregarded the kind of doubt which Loss has suggested as to Rule X10B-5. We have, then, already rejected Loss\u2019 only question here. Moreover, that question seems to stem from the fact that that Rule, as construed in the Fischman case and as I would construe it here, overlaps other specific sections which carry restrictions that do not attach to Rule X10B-5. But that Rule was issued pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act which makes it unlawful to \u201cuse or employ * * * any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations <em>as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of </em>investors.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This left \u00a7 10 (b) inoperative unless the Commission issued a rule. When the Commission promulgated Rule X10B-5, it did not deem it \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d for the public interest that the restrictions elsewhere imposed should be required in suits under that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">4. My colleagues quote from our opinion in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 461, 464, the statement \u201cthat Rule X-10B-5 extended protection only to the defrauded purchaser or seller.\u201d But that statement lacks relevance here since it was made in the context of that case\u2014 where the plaintiffs were neither buyers nor sellers. Moreover, the question for decision in the instant case is whether the plaintiff-purchasers were \u201cdefrauded.\u201d I think they were. \u201cFraud,\u201d under this statute, is not limited to common-law fraud.
