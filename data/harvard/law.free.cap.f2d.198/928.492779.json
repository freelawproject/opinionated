In its motion the appellant asserts reasons for its delay which we find none too convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-18\">We accept the excuses offered on this occasion by the appellant but we point out that the injuries for which the appellee, a seaman, brought suit were suffered by him on December 29, 1949; nearly three years ago. We reiterate that seamen are wards of the admiralty and for this reason, if there was no other, counsel engaged in litigations in which seamen are concerned, must proceed promptly in preparing and prosecuting appeals to this court. We shall view unnecessary delays with little tolerance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
