In June, 1943, and again in November, 1943, Henry, while in the armed services, entered into contracts-of National Service Life Insurance with the United States, each in. the amount of $5,000. Catherine Wills Trathen, Henry\u2019smother, was designated beneficiary of both-policies. No contingent beneficiary was-named. On April 12, 1945, Henry was killed in action in Germany. No children! were born of the marriage between Henry and Mary Trathen. On May 26,1945, Mary-Trathen was married to Martin Kerrigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">After Henry\u2019s death the Veterans\u2019 Administration paid monthly installments under the policies to Catherine Wills Trathen, until she died on May 25, 1949. Thereafter, installments were paid to Mary Trathen Kerrigan, the person determined by the Veterans\u2019 Administration to be entitled to-the balance of the proceeds in the absence-of a named contingent beneficiary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-22\">The plaintiff, Stephen Trathen, was the-father of the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He commenced the-present action against the United States on, March 28, 1950, claiming that he was entitled to the proceeds of the policies from and'. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>after the death of Catherine Wills Trathen, the sole designated beneficiary. The United States joined Mary Trathen Kerrigan as an additional defendant under Rules 13(h) and 22 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. At the close of all the pleadings, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment under Rule 56; similarly, the United States moved for summary judgment in favor of Mary Trathen Kerrigan. The District Judge, in an opinion reported at 96 F.Supp. 809, ruled that Mary Trathen Kerrigan was not entitled to the proceeds of the policies because of her remarriage during the lifetime of the designated beneficiary. Accordingly, the judgment was entered in favor of Stephen Trathen against the United States for all installments due since the date of death of Catherine Wills Trathen. Both the United States and Mary Trathen Kerri-gan appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We are of the opinion that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Section 602(h) (3) of the National Service Life Insurance Act provides that any installments of insurance remaining unpaid at the date of death of the beneficiary named in the policy are to be paid as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">\" * * * to the person or persons then in being within the classes hereinafter specified and in the order named, unless designated by the insured in a different order\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">\u201c(A) to the widow or widower of the insured, if living;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">\u201c(B) if no widow or widower, to the child or children of the insured, if living, in equal shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">\u201c(C) if no widow, widower, or child, to the parent or parents of the insured who last bore that relationship, if living, in equal shares;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The learned District Judge interpreted the phrase \u201cthen in being\u201d in Section 602 (h) (3) as requiring the surviving spouse of an insured to remain unremarried in order to be eligible under this section; and, accordingly, held that Mary Trathen lost her status as Henry Trathen\u2019s \u201cwidow\u201d by virtue of her remarriage shortly after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">We are in agreement with the District Judge that \u201cthen\u201d refers to the date of death of the named beneficiary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, we do not subscribe to the view that a surviving spouse who has remarried prior to that date is no longer \u201cin being\u201d within the meaning of Section 602(h) (3). The requirement that a claimant be \u201cthen in being\u201d means only that the claimant must be alive in order to take under the section; it has no reference to marital status. In our view, a surviving spouse qualifies under Section 602(h) (3) as the \u201cwidow\u201d of an insured if she was his lawful wife on the date of his death, without regard to whether she subsequently remarries.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-18\">While it is true that the ordinary dictionary definition of \u201cwidow\u201d is an <em>unmarried </em>woman whose husband is dead,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the legal consequences arising from the use of a term in legislation are not necessarily determined by its dictionary definition. The term \u201cwidow\u201d, as used in statutes, has been held repeatedly to refer to the <em>person </em>of the surviving spouse rather than to marital state or condition. Thus, in Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v. Garr, 1876, 57 Ga. 277, applying the term as used in the Georgia Wrongful Death Act, the Supreme Court of Georgia stated that \u201cthe word \u2018widow\u2019 indicates the person, not the state, and is used as synonymous with wife.\u201d Likewise, in Mathews v. Marsden, 1924, 71 Mont. 502, 230 P. 775, 778, the Montana Supreme Court, speaking with reference to the \u201cwidow\u2019s\u201d statutory election in lieu of dower, held that \" * * * the word \u2018widow,\u2019 * * * refers to the person and not to her state or condition, <em>whether she remains a widow or marries again.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) See also In re Rhead\u2019s Estate, 1939, 288 Mich. 220, 284 N.W. 706; Duckett v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Kansas Soldiers\u2019 Compensation Board, 1937, 145 Kan. 520, 66 P.2d 410; Hansen v. Brann <em>&amp; </em>Stewart Co., 1917, 90 N.J.L. 444, 103 A. 696; Davis v. Neal, 1911, 100 Ark. 399, 140 S.W. 278, L.R.A.1916A, 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">There are no appellate decisions under the National Service Life Insurance Act which define \u201cwidow\u201d as used in Section 602(h) (3). However, there are numerous cases under Section 602(g) of the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which hold that the \u201cwidow\u201d of an insured is the person who was \u201cvalidly married to him at the time of his death\u201d. United States v. Snyder, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 177 F.2d 44, 46.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There are also two District Court cases under Section 602(h) (3) which allowed recovery by a surviving spouse who had in fact remarried during the lifetime of the named beneficiary. See Angle v. Baker, D.C., E.D. Tenn. 1948, 94 F.Supp. 386, and Blanchard v. United States, D.C.N.H.1950, 91 F.Supp. 889. While the issue of remarriage was not specifically discussed in either of these cases, both opinions referred to the remarried spouse as the insured\u2019s \u201cwidow\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Our interpretation of Section 602 (h) (3) is in accord with established principles of statutory construction. The meaning of any given word in a statute is properly determined by reading the language in question together with other sections of the act. White v. United States, 1938, 305 U.S. 281, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. 172. In this respect, it is significant that Section 602(d) (2) of the National Service Life Insurance Act, in granting automatic insurance to servicemen who had died in service prior to a certain date, provides for payment to \u201cthe widow * * * of the insured, <em>if living and while unremarried </em>* * * \u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus, Congress used the phrase \u201cwhile unremarried\u201d when it meant to require the surviving spouse of an insured to remain single. It follows that, in Section 602(h) (3), when Congress used the word \u201cwidow\u201d alone, without the modifying words, it did not intend for her to remain unmarried in order to be eligible for benefits after the death of a named beneficiary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">For the reason stated, the judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the United States and Mary Trathen Kerrigan.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. 38 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 801 et sea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\">.

Stephen Trathen has died since the entry of judgment in his favor by the court below. In view of our disposition <em>it </em>has not been necessary to resolve the question as to whether his personal representative can succeed to his asserted rights under the policies.
