Davis-Bournonville Co., 270 U.S. 390, 46 S.Ct. 324, 70 L.Ed. 651, applies to an application for the same in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>vention filed in a foreign country. We failed to take into consideration \u00a7 72 of Title 35, U.S.C.A. which provided that it should not \u201cvoid\u201d a patent that \u201cthe invention or discovery\u201d had been previously \u201cknown or used in a foreign country, * * * if it had not been patented or described in a printed publication.\u201d It is reasonable to assume that Holmes, J., had \u00a7 72 in mind in Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bourn-onville Co., supra, 270 U.S. at page 402, 46 S.Ct. 324, 325, when he said that \u201cThe policy of the statute as to foreign inventions obviously stands on its own footing and cannot be applied to domestic affairs.\u201d It is not evident as an original proposition why, although an earlier application, viewed as anticipation, must appear in a printed publication, it need not so appear, viewed as evidence that the patentee is not the first inventor, but may be proved by an \u201cunpublished\u201d application for a patent upon it. We had attempted to distinguish the two situations by saying that the \u201cinvention\u201d lay in the claims, and that the earlier applicant was not \u201can original and first inventor or discoverer,\u201d unless he had claimed what the patentee claimed. This the Supreme Court rejected, treating the application as an invention of all claims that could be drawn upon the disclosure. Section 72, Title 35, U.S.C.A. provides that use or knowledge of the invention in a foreign country shall not invalidate a patent; and obviously the invention is \u201cknown\u201d to the applicant. Thus the question appears to come down to whether \u201cknown\u201d in \u00a7 72 is to be interpreted as including the foreign .applicant and such officials as receive the application; or whether it only means \u201cknown\u201d to outsiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">It is not necessary to decide the point and we leave it open, because we remain of opinion that any new elements Van der Horst may have disclosed were not enough to support a patent in the face of what was concededly old in the art, and of the short period between his earliest date and May, 1939, when Stokes\u2019s patent was accepted, and June, 1939, when Granger and Cleveland appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
