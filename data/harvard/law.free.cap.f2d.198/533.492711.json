Kirkpatrick, after being in government employment without competitive civil service status, was transferred in May 1948 to a position as Legal Examiner, Veterans\u2019 Administration, \u201cSubject to check of records and such investigation as is necessary.\u201d This transfer was described as \u201cconversion to competitive status.\u201d Because he was a veteran with past government service he was credited with \u201cProbational period of one year completed\u201d in accordance with a regulation of the Civil Service Commission, 5 C.F.R. 2.113 (b). In December 1948 he was reassigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>as an Organization and Methods Examiner. Though this reassignment was marked \u201cPermanent\u201d it was also marked: \u201cSubject to loyalty check and such investigation as may be necessary.\u201d In February 1949 he was dismissed by direction of the Civil Service Commission because an investigation by the Commission discovered a \u201cfraudulent\u201d statement in his application for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Appellee Priestly passed a competitive examination in August 1948 and was given, subject to investigation, a probational appointment as a substitute clerk carrier in the New York Post Office. In October 1949 he was dismissed by direction of the Civil Service Commission because an investigation by the Commission discovered \u201capparently intentional false statements\u201d in his application for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">A Civil Service Regulation, 5 C.F.R. 2.113, provides that \u201c(a) A person selected for other than temporary appointment shall be given a probational appointment. The first year of service under this appointment shall be a probationary period. The agency shall utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of each employee and shall terminate his services during such period if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued Federal employment.\u201d Section 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, 58 Stat. 390, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 863, provides that \u201cNo permanent or indefinite preference eligible, who has completed a probationary or trial period employed in the civil service, or in any establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, or department * * shall be discharged * * * \u201d except under conditions that were not met in the present cases. The question is whether, because Kirkpatrick and Priestly were \u201cpreference eligibles\u201d and had \u201ccompleted a probationary or trial period\u201d, their discharges violated \u00a7 14. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">Since all preference eligibility created by the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act is without limit of time, it is \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d. It follows that those words in \u00a7 14 of the Act cannot be intended to distinguish some kinds of preference eligibility from other kinds. They must, therefore, be intended to distinguish some kinds of appointment or tenure from other kinds. Accordingly a \u201cpermanent or indefinite preference eligible, who has completed a probationary or trial period employed in the civil service\u201d is a preference eligible who (1) has a permanent or indefinite appointment or tenure (2) in the civil service and (3) has completed a probationary or trial period. Since the appointments of these men were subject to the results of investigations to be made within a limited time, they were not permanent or indefinite. Accordingly the men were not \u201cpermanent or indefinite preference eligi-bles\u201d and their completion of probationary or trial periods did not entitle them to the benefits of \u00a7 14. By limiting \u00a7 14 to those preference eligibles who besides having completed a probationary or trial period are \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d, Congress directly recognized that those who have completed a probationary or trial period are not necessarily permanent or indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The public interest appears to require that many appointments be made without waiting for necessary investigations to be-completed. It plainly requires that appointments so made be conditional on the-results of the investigations. Section 11' of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, 58 Stat. 390, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 860, provides that \u201cThe-Civil Service Commission is hereby authorized to promulgate appropriate rules and-, regulations for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Act.\u201d\" Section 19 of the Act, 58 Stat. 391, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 868, provides that \u201cIt shall be the authority and duty of the Civil Service.Commission in all cases under the classified civil service to make and enforce appropriate rules and regulations to carry into full effect the provisions, intent, and purpose of this Act * * A regulation of the Commission, 5 C.F.R. 2.112, provides that <em>\u201cAppointments may be subject to investigation, </em>(a) In the following types of appointments investigation designed to further establish the individual\u2019s. qualifications may be made at any time within eighteen months of the personnel': <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>action and removal may be ordered by the Commission if such investigation discloses that the individual is disqualified for Federal employment, and all such appointments shall be considered as subject to this condition: (1) Original probational. . (7) Conversions from excepted, war service indefinite, or temporary indefinite appointments to competitive appointments, (b) The condition \u2018subject to investigation\u2019 shall expire automatically at the end of eighteen months . . .\u201d Another regulation, 5 C.F.R. 2.104, includes among reasons for denial of appointment \u201cIntentional false statements or deception or fraud in examination or appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">We need not consider the government\u2019s contention that Kirkpatrick and Priestly were not \u201cemployed in the civil service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14, or its contention that this section applies only to discharges for cause by the agency concerned and not to discharges required by the Civil Service Commission by reason of a disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">-No. 11144 affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">No. 11216 reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
