Even so, this case appears to set a record of its own. For the question of classification for the purpose of payment of the milk product here in issue, at first 'blush apparently simple, has baffled even the experts and the trade for several years. The milk product, as manufactured by plaintiff at its Binghamton plant during the period involved, 1943-1948, was a \u201cmix\u201d of whole milk, cream, skimmed milk solids, sugar and a stabilizer, all of which were homogenized. There seems accord, therefore, that in its physical aspects it was an \u201chomogenized mixture.\u201d But the <em>question </em>comes as to whether it is to be treated as \u201cin the form of frozen desserts or in the form of homogenized mixtures used in frozen desserts\u201d or even as \u201ccream,\u201d to carry the lower rate of payment granted these products in the controlling milk order, or whether it must be paid for as whole milk of the highest grade for want of another and applicable classification. A portion of the product sold by plaintiff was eventually frozen by the purchaser, and payment for that has been assessed and paid at the lower rate. No question is raised as to this. The dispute concerns that portion of the product (the greater amount, in fact) sold to a purchaser who used it in making a product known as \u201cInstant Whip.\u201d Instant Whip is made 'by putting the mix into a patented tubelike container, and adding thereto nitrous oxide gas under pressure. When the valve on the container is opened the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>emerges in a form similar to whipped cream and is ready for immediate use. It is distributed to drug stores, ice cream par-' lors and similar establishments, and serves the same purposes as whipped cream, including topping on frozen desserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">So much of the manufacture and distribution of plaintiff\u2019s mix product is undisputed. But just how much payment is due from it as handler has been a matter of varying views over the years. After a discussion with an auditor for the Market Administrator, plaintiff reported the mix as cream from 1943 until August, 1945. But for the months of October, 1943, to July, 1945, its reported designation as cream was changed by the Market Administrator to that of \u201chomogenized mixture\u201d \u2014 a change which did not affect the amount of the required payments. This new designation and the resulting classification was not questioned, and the payments so made during that period are not in issue here. After a conference with members of the Market Administrator\u2019s staff, plaintiff, commencing in August, 1945, reported the mix as \u201chomogenized mixture\u201d in accordance with the previous designation of the Market Administrator. The Market Administrator, as authorized by the Order, issued rules and regulations \u2014temporarily effective August 1, 1945, and made permanent as of November 1, 1945\u2014 which contained definitions, <em>inter alia, </em>of cream, frozen dessert, and homogenized mixture. In the latter part of 1947, it was discovered that a purchaser was using the product for Instant Whip and not for ice cream or a comparable frozen dessert. So plaintiff\u2019s monthly reports were re-audited, this part of the product was reclassified as Class I-A fluid or milk not otherwise classified, and plaintiff was required to pay over $51,000 additional to the producer-settlement fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Thereupon plaintiff sought relief within the agency and a full hearing was had before a Hearing Examiner, who recommended that the classification be changed to that of cream under Class II-A. Both parties filed exceptions, and a hearing of arguments on the full record was had before the Judicial Officer of the Department who (as usual in these cases) was designated to act for the Secretary. The Judicial Officer made lengthy findings and, concluding that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief, dismissed the petition. Plaintiff thereupon sought in the district court below the relief afforded it under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(15) (B). In a careful opinion Judge Brennan held the order of the Judicial Officer not in accordance with law and directed defendant and his representatives to classify plaintiff\u2019s product as an \u201chomogenized mixture\u201d and to make the resulting refund to the plaintiff. This appeal 'by the Secretary followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Much of the legislative background, the governing statute, and the controlling Milk Order appear not only in Judge Brennan\u2019s complete opinion, but also in the many decisions of this court in the field, including the majority and minority opinions in Kass v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 196 F.2d 791, and the opinion in Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Ass\u2019n v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 57, cer-tiorari denied 338 U.S. 825, 70 S.Ct. 73, 94 L.Ed. 501. We shall not repeat this material <em>in extenso </em>here. The issue of classification comes down essentially to a decision between defendant\u2019s contention that ultimate actual use of the product controls and plaintiff\u2019s contention that its form as it leaves the handler\u2019s plant is decisive. In addition are of course the usual queries as to the extent of our power of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">This latter question, never easy, has not been rendered less difficult by the Congressional trend toward greater judicial powers of review of agency action, as upheld and interpreted by the Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. Despite this prodding it would seem that in a field so dependent on supervision by experts, with a milk order not only so complicated, but also so interrelated in all its parts, judicial interference must still be hesitant and cautious. But our doubts as to the extent of our power are somewhat softened by the obvious difficulty the agency officials have found in construing their own order, a difficulty not shown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>be the less by the fact that in 1949, after this controversy arose, the Secretary amended his order to place butterfat as here used in the same classification with butterfat used in frozen desserts. 14 F.R. 7755, and see 7 CFR 927.101 (bb) now defining \u201cwhipped topping mixture.\u201d Plaintiff, indeed, contends that the Judicial Officer accorded it too limited a hearing in restricting his determination to the issue whether the previous agency action was lawful; it says that, since by the statute it is the Secretary to whom is given the final power of ruling upon a handler\u2019s petition for review, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(15) (A), he cannot thus be circumscribed in what he may do. We do not feel called upon to pass upon this question, for the power given the courts under id. (15) (B) to determine whether the Secretary\u2019s ruling is \u201cin accordance with law\u201d seems to us ample for a final disposition of the case. An order requiring a most substantial additional payment, as here, cannot be considered in accordance with law if it is based upon an unreasonable interpretation of even the Secretary\u2019s own order and regulations. Barron Cooperative Creamery v. Wickard, 7 Cir., 140 F.2d 485, 488, per Minton, J. And we believe with the court below that under all the circumstances here disclosed, the reading of the order made in the agency was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The Act itself authorizes a classification of the milk in accordance with either \u201cthe form in which or the purpose for which it is used.\u201d 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(5) (A). But, as we have had occasion to point out, classification as of the form in which it is held at, or moved from, the plant of the handler where the milk is received from dairy farmers is the basic plan of the order. Queensboro Farm Products v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 969, 976, 979, 980; Waddington Milk Co. v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 97, 101; Order 27, 7 CFR 927.4(a) (3). So much is conceded; argument starts because of exceptions which do exist. Plaintiff contends that each one is clearly and explicitly stated and depends upon some perceivable reason, among which geography (or variations made because of the territorial area covered) looms large. It argues, therefore, that in effect the exceptions prove the rule. With the first part of this contention defendant substantially agrees, but he urges that an exception for use is clearly stated here. The classifications which plaintiff claims for its mix are Classes II-D, II-E, and II-F, the significant language of each being that \u201call milk the butterfat from which leaves or is on hand at a plant * * * jn ^he form 0f frozen desserts or in the form of homogenized mixtures used in frozen desserts\u201d shall be in one of these classes, depending on the geographical area in which \u201cdelivery\u201d is made and also depending on whether the milk product is subsequently moved to or delivered to a \u201cpurchaser\u201d in New York City. 7 CFR 1945 Supp. 927.4(c) (7) (8) (9). The accompanying Rules and Regulations also contain the following definition: \u201c \u2018Homogenized mixture\u2019 means the product which results from homogenizing a mixture * * * and which is prepared for use in the manufacture of frozen desserts.\u201d 7 CFR 101 (x). These are the crucial words to be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In defendant\u2019s view this language amounts to a flat requirement that the product must be more than fitted for or usable as a frozen dessert, but must also always be frozen. This seems to us an unjustified literalism. The provisions appear to emphasize the nature of the product as it \u201cleaves or is on hand at a plant,\u201d in perfect accord with the basic standard of the order. The <em>form </em>is stressed; that word is repeated many times throughout the categorizations in question, while the <em>fact </em>of freezing is nowhere stated forthrightly as a requirement. And the expression \u201cwhich is prepared for use\u201d is, after all, substantially different from the expression \u201cwhich is used,\u201d which could so easily have been employed, had that been the drafting intent. When this language is viewed in the light of the circumstances, its reference to the form of the product at the plant, rather than its ultimate use in some final purchaser\u2019s hand, seems strongly indicated. After all, this was a \u201cmix\u201d of various kinds of milk products which surely ought not to be assessed as of the value of Class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>I-A fluid milk, as is now clear from the latest amendments of the order. The Milk Administrator\u2019s own ruling to like effect during the period of 1943-1945, while it may not estop the Government, Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Ass\u2019n v. Bran-nan, supra, certainly suggests an interpretation which seemed to the parties reasonable at the time. The findings of the Judicial Officer showed also that before August 1, 1945, unfrozen mixtures prepared and used for eggnog and charlotte russe were allowed the homogenized mixture classification by the Market Administrator\u2019s Office and that Instant Whip itself had been so classified under New York State Order No. 127 in the Niagara Frontier Milk Marketing Area and had been ruled a \u201cfrozen desserts mix\u201d under a New York statute giving the regulation thereof to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, rather than the Health Commissioner. Aerated Products Co. of Buffalo v. Godfrey, 290 N.Y. 92, 48 N.E.2d 275. Finally the obvious administrative difficulties involved in rejecting the simpler test of form at or leaving the handler\u2019s plant, making different rates apply to the same product, and requiring a search for ultimate use which (on defendant\u2019s line of argument) ought logically to go beyond the Instant Whip distributors to the very consumers themselves, persuade against defendant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Hence, in our view, the construction urged by the plaintiff is a natural and to-'be-' expected one, while that asserted by defendant is novel and unreasonable. The district court therefore properly sustained plaintiff\u2019s claims of review of defendant\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b913-7\">FRANK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">I am on record as emphatically believing that courts should not rubber-stamp administrative actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But there are areas of administration as to which judges must humbly acknowledge that they are unusually knowledgeless; in any such area judges should be singularly wary of interfering with the administrative discretion of officials specializing in that area and advised by experts. <em>Vis \u00e1 ms </em>milk regulation, precisely that has been the previous attitude of this court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (and others). I think that unwisely and erroneously my colleagues have here sharply deviated from that attitude. On that account, and because with rather scant explanations they have brushed aside arguments of the Secretary of Agriculture which I think deserve more serious consideration, I am stating at some length my reasons for dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">1. The problem here is entirely one of interpreting a milk order. To illuminate the differing interpretations, I must first briefly summarize the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">This milk order No. 27, for the New York metropolitan marketing area, was initially issued in September, 1938, but was changed by extensive amendments, effective August 1, 1945, which, as we recently said in Kass v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 196 F.2d 791, 793, \u201cestablished a new plan of regulating the marketing of milk in the New York area.\u201d The present controversy concerns milk sold after August 1, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">By the terms of the amended order (pertinent portions.of which are printed in the Appendix to this opinion), the rate to be paid by handlers for Class I milk is higher than for milk in Classes II-D or II-E or II-F. My colleagues, I think, agree as I do with the Secretary\u2019s view that the milk sold by plaintiff, and involved in this suit, was covered by I-A, unless it came within II-D, II-E or II-F. Now each of those three last-named classes includes milk which leaves or is on hand at the handler\u2019s plant either (1) \u201cin the form of frozen desserts\u201d or (2) \u201cin the form of homoge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>nized mixtures <em>used in frozen </em>desserts\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (provided the mixtures or the frozen desserts produced therefrom are not delivered to a plant or purchaser in certain desig-. nated areas and are not marketed in New York City).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The order, before the 1945 amendment, did not require that any regulation be issued officially, defining the terms contained in the order. But the amended order did so require. Accordingly, a regulation issued August 1, 1945, and approved by the Secretary, included this definition: \u201c\u2018Homogenized mixture\u2019 means the product which results from homogenizing a mixture containing milk solids, moisture and sugar (or other sweetening agent) or other ingredients, <em>and which is prepared for use in the manufacture of frozen desserts.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That definition, be it noted, has two parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">(1) A statement of ingredients necessary to constitute such a mixture, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">(2) a statement that (to come within the definition) the mixture must also be \u201cprepared for use\u201d in making \u201cfrozen desserts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The milk in question satisfied (1). The sole question is whether it satisfied (2). If not, then the milk came under I-A. The undisputed pertinent facts are these: That milk did not leave plaintiff\u2019s plant (nor was it there on hand) in any frozen form. It did leave in the form of a mixture composed of the ingredients required by the <em>definition </em>\u2014 i. <em>e. </em>what I have labelled part (1). But the mixture was sold and delivered by plaintiff to a purchaser \u2014 another handler \u2014 -who, as plaintiff well knew in advance of the sale and each delivery, never \u201cused (it) in frozen desserts\u201d nor ever had the slightest intention of so using it or of using it for making anything frozen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the examiner found from the evidence that plaintiff carefully \u201cprepared\u201d the mixture so that it \u201cwould work satisfactorily for\u201d use in \u201cthe manufacture of \u2018Instant Whip.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And Instant Whip is not a frozen dessert.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Plaintiff contends that the actual use and the actual intended use are utterly irrelevant, and that the words \u201cused in frozen desserts\u201d and \u201cprepared for use in the manufacture of frozen desserts\u201d can reasonably mean this and this only: \u201csuitable for use in making frozen desserts\u201d (or \u201cadaptable\u201d for such use). In short, the plaintiff argues that reasonably those words can relate solely to potential use \u2014 as distinguished from the actual use or the actual intended use for which the mixture was \u201cprepared.\u201d My colleagues agree with plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">The Secretary contends that the words may reasonably mean that the homogenized mixture must actually be used, by a subsequent handler,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in making a frozen dessert, or that it was sold by the initial handler on the understanding that it would actually be so used. Plaintiff\u2019s milk, says the Secretary, was not \u201cused in,\u201d intended to be \u201cused in,\u201d or \u201cprepared for use in,\u201d a frozen dessert, but, as plaintiff knew, was specially \u201cprepared for use\u201d in something else; therefore it came within Class I-A. I agree with the Secretary\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">2. My colleagues do not deny the validity of this order if it is correctly interpreted as the Secretary interprets it. For the Act authorizes the Secretary to classify milk according to either (a) \u201cthe form in which\u201d the milk is used at or moved from the initial handler\u2019s plant, or (b) \u201cthe purpose for which it is used\u201d by a subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>quent purchaser from the initial handler.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to such a \u201cpurpose\u201d classification, we said in Queensboro Farm Products v. Wickard, 137 F.2d 969, 976-977: \u201c * * * we take \u2018purpose\u2019 to mean that the handler\u2019s use may, in the sole discretion of the Secretary, be determined by reference to the use made by the handler\u2019s purchaser or by some subsequent purchaser. * * * [H]e (the Secretary) had unlimited discretion * * * to make any classification whatever on the basis of the \u2018purpose for which\u2019 the milk is used, <em>i. e., </em>its use by someone other than the handler.\u201d We were careful to point out in that case how such a \u201cpurpose\u201d classification fitted into the over-all plan of the Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the handler\u2019s use and not the ultimate consumer\u2019s use would be the determinant of price classification. So that \u2014 although the basic plan of the order here is to classify milk by the \u201cform\u201d in which it was held at or left the initial handler\u2019s plant \u2014 it does not invalidate the order if the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is correct and the order accordingly contains exceptional provisions establishing a proper \u201cpurpose\u201d classification as to homogenized mixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Therefore, the sole issue here is whether the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is reasonable; if not, then it did not bind plaintiff, and all other matters my colleagues discuss become irrelevant. If it is reasonable, then it did bind plaintiff, regardless of all those matters, which thus, again, become irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">3. It may be worthwhile, nevertheless, to clear the air of the plaintiff\u2019s estoppel argument (especially as the facts on which it ' rests are relied on by my colleagues in reaching their interpretation of the order),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Let it be assumed that a citizen may properly rely on the informal advice of the Secretary as to the meaning of such an order. Here, however, the Secretary gave no such advice. Therefore it is no defense that the plaintiff relied (if he did) on the Market Administrator\u2019s construction of the order. In the Queensboro case, we so held: \u201cAppellant asserts that * * * for many months, the Market Administrator acquiesced in appellant\u2019s interpretation of the orders. But even if the uncontradicted evidence so showed, that fact would be irrelevant; nothing in the Act or in the orders confers on the Market Administrator, the Secretary\u2019s subordinate, the power to bind the Secretary by his own unauthorized interpretations.\u201d 137 F.2d at 981-982. We specifically adhered to that ruling in two later milk order cases, Wetmiller v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 149 F.2d 330, and Waddington Milk Co. v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 97.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> What is more, the record contains no evidence that had plaintiff been advised in advance of the Secretary\u2019s present interpretation, plaintiff would have done its business differently. See Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Association v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 57, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Furthermore, nothing is in issue here except the proper classification of milk sold by plaintiff from August 1, 1945 through January 1948; and plaintiff, after August 1, 1945 and during the period in question, had no special advice, concerning the proper classification from any official, not even from a subordinate of the Market Administrator. August 1, 1945 is a significant date. For on that date there went into effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>in accord with the requirements of the amended order, the published regulations setting forth specific definitions of products. Before August 1, 1945, there had been no published definitions of the divers products named in the order, and no accounting procedure for classifying milk. Until then, the terms had received their definitions only in informal case-to-case determinations by the Administrator or (as here before August 1, 1945) by his subordinates. The formal definitions in the regulation constituted part of a \u201cnew plan,\u201d as we described it in Kass v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 196 F.2d 791, 793. In the public hearings held by the Market Administrator to discuss the new regulations, while they were still in tentative form, it was announced that they would create new standards superseding earlier informal interpretations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">4. In order to sustain plaintiff\u2019s contention, my colleagues have to conclude, as they do, that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, although literally correct, is \u201cunnatural,\u201d \u201cnovel,\u201d \u201cnot-to-be-expected,\u201d even \u201carbitrary.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But to my mind, his interpretation is entirely sensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The dictionary tells us that \u201cused\u201d is the past participle of the verb \u201cto use,\u201d which means \u201cto make use of, employ.\u201d It also tells us that the word \u201cusable\u201d \u2014 not \u201cused\u201d \u2014is the proper (\u201cnatural\u201d) term to express mere potentiality of use, <em>i. e., </em>\u201ccan be employed or made use of.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> So that, if the Secretary meant by his order what my colleagues say he meant, he would normally (\u201cnaturally\u201d) have spoken of \u201chomogenized mixtures <em>usable </em>in frozen desserts.\u201d If you ask a housewife for the ingredients \u201cused in\u201d her favorite cake, she will report what she uses, not what she might have used but didn\u2019t. And the decisional material shows that the courts have regarded it as a strained and unusual construction to treat \u201cused\u201d as meaning \u201cusable\u201d or \u201csuitable for use.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Indeed, my colleagues at one point acknowledge in effect that \u201cused in\u201d means \u201cactually used in\u201d: In discussing the phrase \u201cwhich is prepared for use,\u201d my colleagues say that it cannot reasonably be interpreted as \u201cwhich is prepared for actual use,\u201d since (they assert) had such been the intention, the wording should have been \u201cwhich is used.\u201d That is to say, \u201cused\u201d normally refers to \u201cactual use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">I do not, however, at all agree with my colleagues that \u201cprepared for use,\u201d in the definition of \u201chomogenized mixture,\u201d does not indicate intended use but merely \u201csuitable for use.\u201d For, were my colleagues\u2019 construction correct, the words \u201cprepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>for use\u201d would become superfluous, since it is a fact that every mixture which meets merely the ingredient requirements of the definition is \u201csuitable for use\u201d in making frozen desserts. The words, \u201cprepared for use,\u201d added something important, <em>i. e., </em>the controlling factor is the intended actual use and not simply the potential use. In the instant case, the mixture sold by plaintiff was \u201cprepared for use\u201d not in the manufacture of frozen desserts but prepared by plaintiff deliberately for use in the manufacture of an unfrozen product. The phrase \u201cprepared for use\u201d points to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the user; and (as noted above) in the Queensboro Farm Products case, we said that the phrase, found in the Act itself, \u201c \u2018the purpose for which\u2019 it is used\u201d, means that, in the Secretary\u2019s sole discretion, the use may be determined by reference to the \u201cuse\u201d by some subsequent purchaser.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">II-F of the order makes peculiarly clear the unreasonableness of my colleagues\u2019 \u201cmere potentiality\u201d interpretation. It covers milk \u201cin the form of frozen desserts or in the form of homogenized mixtures used in frozen desserts\u201d; these words are immediately followed by this proviso: \u201cprovided that the <em>frozen desserts, m both instances, were moved to a plant or delivered to a purchaser </em>outside New York City and remained outside New York City.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plainly the phrase \u201cin both instances\u201d includes mixtures \u201cused in frozen desserts.\u201d And, as the classification applies to mixtures used in frozen desserts only when those desserts themselves \u201cwere moved\u201d or \u201cdelivered,\u201d clearly II-F demands actual freezing and necessarily excludes mixtures knowingly prepared (as here) for the manufacture of an unfrozen article. The same is true of II-D and II-E; for, as plaintiff\u2019s brief concedes, the provisions of II-D, II-E and II-F \u201care identical in intent except as to the geographical areas of disposition.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">There was a good practical reason for a \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cuse\u201d exception relative to frozen desserts: In some localities (and notably in New York City), municipal regulations require that actual freezing of frozen products must take place within a stated radius; milk shipped to \u201ccountry plants\u201d may there be converted into the mixture, but may not there be frozen; instead the mixture must be shipped to a city plant for freezing. The Secretary wanted to give handlers so situated the advantage of the cheaper rates of II-D, II-E and II-F. This he accomplished by providing, in respect of those classes, that homogenized mixtures destined for subsequent freezing should be treated on the same basis as deserts already frozen when they left the handler\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">5. My colleagues specify the following items to show the arbitrariness of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation:</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">(a) The Market Administrater, say my colleagues, at one time made a \u201cruling\u201d in accord with plaintiff\u2019s interpretation. My colleagues, calling this an interpretation \u201cby the parties,\u201d say that, as it disagrees with the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, the latter is presumably unreasonable. But neither the Administrator nor any of his subordinates ever agreed with plaintiff\u2019s interpretation after the inauguration on August 1, 1945 of the \u201cnew plan\u201d which first set forth a definition of \u201chomogenized mixtures.\u201d Moreover, we have several times rejected the contention that views or \u201crulings,\u201d informally expressed by the Administrator, are evidence of a correct interpretation of a milk order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>(b) The unreasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation appears, say my colleagues, from the fact that in 1949 \u2014 after the period here in controversy \u2014 the Secretary amended the order to put butterfat as used by plaintiff\u2019s purchaser in the same classification with butterfat used in frozen desserts. But surely that mere change in 1949 is not evidence of \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in the order as it had stood in the crucial period, which was before 1949: For all we know, the Secretary made this change entirely for policy reasons. See Waddington Milk Co. v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 97, 100. If my colleagues\u2019 reasoning, based on this change, were applied to changes in Treasury Regulations under the income tax law, it would revolutionize decisions in the tax field: Every time the Treasury amended a Regulation, the previous provision (in the unamended Regulation) would become invalid because unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">(c) Perhaps my colleagues\u2019 most remarkable argument is that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation would compel a reference to \u201cultimate use in some final purchaser\u2019s hand\u201d and would require \u201ca search for ultimate use which (on defendant\u2019s line of argument) ought logically to go * * * to the consumers themselves.\u201d I call that argument remarkable because the defendant, the Secretary, has most emphatically disavowed such an interpretation. He has maintained that \u201cused\u201d means used by a handler only; that it is the first conversion by a handler of an' homogenized mixture into another product which determines what the mixture was \u201cused in\u201d; and that use thereafter, in some subsequent product manufactured from the mixture, is of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">It may be that the Act forbids the Secretary to make consumers\u2019 use a 'basis of classification;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> if, then, the Secretary\u2019s language did include, <em>inter alia, </em>a consumers\u2019 use test, to that extent it might be invalid; but plaintiff could not complain of that partial invalidity since it would not affect plaintiff, for the Secretary has classified plaintiff\u2019s milk on the basis of its use by the immediate purchaser from plaintiff, and that purchaser is a handler. See the Queensboro Farm Products case, 137 F.2d at pages 977-978.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The \u201csearch\u201d for \u201cuse\u201d was especially easy here, because plaintiff had full knowledge, in advance of the sales, that its purchaser intended not to use the mixture in a frozen dessert.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">(d) My colleagues argue further that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable in \u201cmaking different rates apply to the same product.\u201d But that result follows from any provision making the rate vary with either the use or the place of delivery,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and we have held such a provision valid. Plaintiff\u2019s brief so recognizes in saying: \u201cDestination is important because the order in certain instances prices the same product differently for competitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>reasons, depending upon the market into which the product is sold.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">(e) My colleagues also rely on Aero Products Co. of Buffalo v. Godfrey, 290 N.Y. 92, 48 N.E.2d 275, interpreting a New York Public Health Law, McK. Consol. Laws, c. 45, as inapplicable to Instant Whip because that product was already being regulated under the New York Agriculture and Markets Law, McK.Consol.Laws, c. 69, as a \u201cfrozen dessert mix.\u201d That decision ruled only that the burden of complying with the New York Public Health Law would be so onerous in its effect on Instant Whip as to be constitutionally arbitrary and unlawful, considering the small dangers of contamination involved in manufacturing and marketing the product. The case has no applicability whatsoever here; there only the constitutionality and interpretation of a New York Health statute were at stake; no federal price regulatory measures at all were involved. See New York State Guernsey Breeders\u2019 Co-op. v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 805, 810, 153 A. L.R. 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">6. I do not see how the Secretary could have made his meaning any clearer. True, he might, perhaps, have put the adverb \u201cactually\u201d in front of \u201cused\u201d in the order and \u201cuse\u201d in the regulation. But common sense tells us administrative orders are not written that way. (I am reminded of the old story about the man, ejected from a theatre because of his failure to obey a \u201cNo Smoking\u201d sign, who defended himself indignantly on the ground that the sign did not say \u201cAbsolutely No Smoking.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">7. I believe (as I\u2019ve said) that the Secretary\u2019s is the only reasonable interpretation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But let us assume that the plaintiff\u2019s is also reasonable. On that assumption, this problem arises: An official empowered by statute to issue an order or regulation, in the course of administering or enforcing it, reasonably interprets it. Is that reasonable interpretation subject to challenge by a person who puts forward a different interpretation which is also reasonable? I think that both authority and common sense call for the answer No. A Yes answer would often yield administrative chaos, since unambiguous language can seldom be found. Often it is all but impossible (and especially so in respect of so complicated a subject as milk regulation) <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to use words capable of one and only one reasonable meaning. This fact of life should be obvious to legislators when they consider what has happened to their statutes in the courts; it should be still more obvious to judges, who recurrently, and surprisingly, are surprised by the way their words are misunderstood by commentators, and even by other judges. As Corbin recently said:<footnotemark>25a</footnotemark> \u201cIt is true that when a judge reads the words of a contract he may jump to the instant and confident opinion that they have but one reasonable meaning and that he knows what it is. A greater familiarity with dictionaries and the usages of words, a better understanding of the uncertainties \u00f3f language, and a comparative study of more cases in the field of interpretation, will make one beware of holding such an opinion so recklessly arrived at.\u201d \u201cIt is not true,\u201d said Holmes,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cthat in practice (and I know no reason why theory should disagree with the facts) a given word or even a given collocation of words has one meaning and no other.\u201d It follows that an official -often cannot avoid issuing an order or regulation free of alternative rational interpretations, although he: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>then perceives only one. Consequently, in order to prevent administrative anarchy, the \u2022courts should usually accept any reasonable construction of an order by the official who issued that order, despite the existence of another possible rational meaning asserted by the affected citizen. And so our court has held.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">8. Barron Co-op. Creamery v. Wickard, 7 Cir., 140 F.2d 485, cited by my colleagues, has no bearing here. In that case (as appears from the fact stated in the footnote<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>), the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of a milk order was hopelessly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">9. I do not understand why my colleagues, to support their decision, cite Universal Camera Co. v. National Labor R. Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, since it had to do solely with the scope of judicial review of administrative findings of fact, and here there is no dispute whatever as to such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">But the opinion in Universal Camera does interest me here, since it stresses the strict limits on court review of administrative action in so far as such action involves the element of so-called expertise.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Particularly in respect of milk orders has our court heretofore underscored that element. Thus in Queensboro Farm Products Co. v. Wickard, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 969, 974, 980, we said: \u201cExperience * * * has disclosed that the \u2018milk problem\u2019 is' exquisitely complicated. The city-dweller or poet who regards the cow as a symbol of bucolic serenity is indeed naive. From the udders of that placid animal flows a bland liquid indispensable to human health but often provoking as much human strife and nastiness as strong alcoohlic beverages * * *. The resultant intricacies * * * have given rise to much legislation and are reflected in many judicial decisions. * * * The milk problem is so vast that fully to comprehend it would require an almost universal knowledge ranging from geology, biology, chemistry and medicine to the niceties of the legislative, judicial and administrative processes of government. It affects an industry immense in scope, for dairying is said to be the largest single branch of agriculture in this country with the exception of that of raising livestock for slaughter, the annual money value of dairy products running to billions of dollars. * * * Considering the complexities of administration * * * and the plain intention of Congress to give the Secretary wide discretion in devising regional milk plans (and the classifications incident thereto), the courts must be slow to intrude on his exercise of that discretion, if for no other reason than that, being inadequately staffed, they are incompetent to undertake the task of constructing and supervising milk marketing programs.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">My colleagues in the instant case give lip service to that idea. (They speak of milk regulation as \u201cmystifying.\u201d) Yet, without any new first-hand study on their part of the actual workings of this industry and the intricacies of its regulation, my colleagues here blithely tell the Secretary how to exercise his regulatory discretion. In the Queensboro Farm Products case,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we noted that there the Secretary had made an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ceptional classification because experience had shown that some handlers had manipulated distributions of milk so as to pay lower rates unfairly, and we said: \u201cThe Secretary cannot, of course, deviate from the requirements of the statute merely to avoid difficulties of administration or to facilitate enforcement of the Act; but when * * * he exercises his discretion in granting an exception he may properly take that factor into account.\u201d But here my colleagues dismantle an important part of a milk order on the ground that they will thereby eliminate \u201cobvious administrative difficulties\u201d which the Secretary failed to take into account. I wonder why my colleagues now feel so sure they know more than the Secretary about such difficulties.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">I.

Plaintiff also complains because before August 1, 1945, the Administrator\u2019s office allowed other persons to classify non-frozen dessert ingredients as \u201chomogenized mixture.\u201d But in Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Association v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 57, 66, we said that as long as the Market Administrator \u201ccorrectly interpreted his powers\u201d in dealing with the plaintiff, those dealings would not be challenged because of the wayward or vacillating way in which he administered the data generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">.

The plaintiff (appellant) in that case argued that a classification in the milk order was invalid because too broad. After showing that the broad classification included a narrower one which was valid and which alone applied to the plaintiff, we said, 137 F.2d at pages 977-978: \u201cIt follows that those broader aspects of the order need not here be considered. <em>For, so </em>far as appellant is concerned, the issue of their validity is hypothetical. \u2018Vicarious complaints will not serve.\u2019 * * * 'Consequently, the possible injury to others than appellant which might result from the Secretary\u2019s order is a matter we shall not consider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b918-12\">.

Anomalous results flow from my colleagues\u2019 interpretation: Sections I-A through 1-0 set up special classifications for certain flavored drinks, including eggnog. Yet eggnog meets the ingredient test of the definition of \u201chomogenized mixtures\u201d; and since eggnog is \u201csuitable for use in\u201d the manufacture of eggnog ice cream, it comes, according to my colleagues\u2019 interpretation, within II-D through II \u2014 F, which call for lower rates than I-A to I-O. So my colleagues\u2019' ruling seriously disturbs the special flavored drink classifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b919-13\">. Queensboro Farm Products v.

The court of course held that the wording of the order (i. e., \u201cdisposed of\u201d) did not require the handler to look beyond his own disposition of the milk or to pursue it to see what ultimately became of it, and if the handler did not dispose of it as ice cream, Glass II did not apply.
