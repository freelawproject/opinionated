S. Herber and Maurine Herber, husband and wife, were engaged in the business of buying and selling used cars. They purchased used cars for the purpose of resale and admittedly paid therefor amounts in excess of the maximum ceiling prices then in effect under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq. In computing their gross income for the years in question the taxpayers deducted as part of the cost of the automobiles the full amount of the price paid. The Commissioner levied deficiencies in the tax for those years by disregarding that portion of the purchase price which exceeded the lawful ceiling price. The taxpayers paid the deficiencies and brought this suit in the Western District of Oklahoma to recover the same. Relying principally upon Sullenger v. Commissioner, 11 T.C. 1076, and subsequent Tax Court decisions, the trial court held that under the terms of the statute and the regulations the entire purchase price was part of the cost of the automobiles and therefore was allowable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">The sole question presented in this appeal is whether the taxpayers were, for income tax purposes, entitled to include as part of the cost of their automobiles the amounts paid in excess of lawful ceiling, prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The identical question was recently before the Fourth Circuit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where it was held that Congress intended to tax the income on such sales \u201conly the difference between the sales price and the actual cost of the goods sold, even though a part of this cost was paid unlawfully in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.\u201d It was then stated that, \u201cNowhere in the Internal Revenue Act or in the Treasury Regulations is there any intimation that the word \u2018cost,\u2019 as used in the Act and in those Regulations, is to be denied its actual, economic and ordinary meaning, and is to include only costs that are legally paid, so as to exclude costs actually paid in excess of those prescribed by the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.\u201d We agree with the reasoning and the conclusion reached in that case, and further discussion of the question is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">In a similar case the First Circuit reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. \u201cSec. 22.
