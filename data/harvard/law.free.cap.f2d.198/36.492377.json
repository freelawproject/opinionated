Both Consolidated and Shawnee are engaged in the manufacture and sale of high-grade family flour and other wheat products. Each competes with the other in the sale of its products throughout the Southern states of the United States, and particularly in Alabama. Consolidated charges that its common-law rights in the trade-mark \u201cMother\u2019s Best\u201d have been infringed by Shawnee\u2019s use of the trade-mark \u201cMother\u2019s Pride\u201d on identical goods and that Shawnee has engaged in unfair competition in that the use by it of the trade-mark \"Mother\u2019s Pride\u201d' on flour and related products is calculated to deceive and does deceive the purchasing public by inducing members thereof to believe that Shawnee\u2019s products are Consolidated\u2019s products. From an adverse judgment, Consolidated has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Neither \u201cMother\u2019s Best\u201d nor \u201cMother\u2019s Pride\u201d is a registered trade-mark. Consolidated only asserts common-law rights in its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">The label employed by Consolidated on its flour containers may be thus described: In the upper portion of the label on the upper side of the sack, are the words \"Mother\u2019s Best\u201d in blue letters on a white background. While the words are in hand lettering, the letters closely resemble Gothic type (sans-serif). Below the words \u201cMother\u2019s Best\u201d is a design with a circular blue border and an inner blue circle. Between such circle and the border is an area with a white background and the words \u201cAbsolutely Guaranteed for Every Baking Need\u201d in blue letters. Inside the blue circle is an area with a white background and wheat heads of the color of ripe wheat. Superimposed on such design are rectangular areas with blue borders and white backgrounds. The word \u201cEnriched\u201d is in one of such areas and the word \u201cFlour\u201d in the other of such areas, both in 'red letters. To the left of the design is the name and address of the manufacturer in blue letters. To the right of the design are the words \u201cPhosphated White Flour With Vitamins\u201d' in blue letters. In a line across the label below the design is the weight of the package in blue letters, the words \u201cFor Delicious Cake \u2014 Pastry\u2014 Bread\u201d in red letters and the word \u201cBleached\u201d in blue letters. The butt label is composed of the words \u201cMother\u2019s Best\u201d in type resembling Gothic (sans-serif) and the words \u201cEnriched Phosphated Flour,\u201d all in blue letters. On the left of such label is the weight in red letters and figures and on the right the word \u201cprice\u201d' in red letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">The label employed by Shawnee may be thus described: On the upper side of the sack, against a background of blue, white, and yellow, is a picture of a mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>child, a loaf of bread, and cupcakes. Above the picture of the mother, in hand lettering, and in type that is a modified Roman, are the words \u201cMother\u2019s Pride\u201d in Ted letters with blue borders. On the sides of the label are the words \u201cSelf-Rising\u201d in red letters and below the label are the words \u201cSelf-Rising Flour Bleached\u201d in red letters. Below the latter words is the name of the milling company, with its address, in blue letters. The butt label is rectangular in form with a white background and blue border. It contains in the center the words \u201cMother\u2019s Pride\u201d in modified Roman type, in red letters with blue borders. On the left side of the rectangular butt label are the words \u201cExtra Fancy Patent\u201d in blue letters and on the right side the weight of the package and the words \u201cSelf-Rising Flour Bleached\u201d in red.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The trial court, among others, made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c22. The brand name Mother\u2019s Pride is not sufficiently similar to the brand name Mother\u2019s Best to be likely to deceive an ordinary buyer exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aq-dedup-0\">\u201c23. A comparison of the designs and labels on the bags, containers and packages in which the Defendant\u2019s flour Mother\u2019s Pride and the Plaintiff\u2019s flour Mother\u2019s Best are packed and sold shows that same are so markedly different in appearance that there is no similarity which would certainly or probably deceive an ordinary buyer exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In Ph. Schneider Brewing Co. v. Century Distilling Co., 10 Cir., 107 F.2d 699, 704, we stated the test for determining whether confusion of goods is likely to result, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201cThe test is whether the similitude in the labels would probably deceive a purchaser who exercises ordinary prudence, not the careless buyer who makes no examination.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Both parties agree that the law of Oklahoma is controlling. In Stillwater Milling Co. v. Eddie, 188 Okl. 234, 108 P.2d 126, 128, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">\u201cThe principles by which it may be determined whether or not simulation of an established trade-mark or trade-name constitutes unfair competition and thus justifies injunctive relief have been recently reiterated by this court. In the case of Coalgate Abstract Co. v. Coal County Abstract Co., 180 Okl. 8, 67 P.2d 37, it was held: \u2018Under the law of unfair competition, in order to enjoin the use of a trade-name there must be such a similarity to one formerly used or employed that the ordinary buyer, exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters, will certainly or probably be deceived. Mere possibility of deception and confusion is not sufficient\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\">In Brotherhood of Painters, etc., v. United Home Industrial Union of Okmulgee, 184 Okl. 20, 84 P.2d 1101, 1103, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">\u201cWhether one emblem resembles another is to be determined by an inspection of the points of difference and resemblance, as a whole, and not merely of points of resemblance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The only similarity in the two labels is the word \u201cMother\u2019s.\u201d In the type employed, in the colors, in the design and background, and in their general appearance the labels are distinctly different. Except for the word \u201cMother\u2019s\u201d' the label employed by Shawnee in nowise resembles the label employed by Consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">We are convinced, as was the trial court, that there is not such a similarity in the two labels that the ordinary buyer, exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters, would be deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">It is urged that in the self service stores, the buyer would observe only the butt portion of the label. It is a matter of common knowledge, of which this court may take judicial notice, that sacks of flour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and other heavy articles are displayed in self service stores on the lower counters, well below the eye level of customers, and that the entire label on flour containers, both the upper and butt portions, can be readily seen by prospective purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">However, we are convinced that even if the purchaser observed only the butt labels, the differences pointed out above are such that a purchaser, exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters, would not be deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We deem it unnecessary to consider the other grounds on which the trial court based its decision. The findings set out above are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous and those findings alone warrant an affirmance of the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\">. Hereinafter called Consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-20\">. Hereinafter called Shawnee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-17\">.
