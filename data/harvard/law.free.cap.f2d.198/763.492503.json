Sabbs was duly executed. The trial judge thought there was \u201cno doubt that she was not in a condition to execute a serious document, such as a will or deed or contract, with judgment and understanding\u201d when she went through the motions of executing a will. The judge nevertheless directed a verdict sustaining the will because the decedent was able to \u201cperform the physical act of signing her name\u201d and because the will had been written for her, and she had orally expressed to one witness her approval of it, before she became mentally incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 19-101 provides: \u201cNo will, testament, or codicil shall be good and effectual for any purpose whatever unless the person making the same * * * be at the time of executing or acknowledging it * * * of sound and disposing mind and capable of executing a valid deed or \u2022contract.\u201d The judgment is therefore reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
