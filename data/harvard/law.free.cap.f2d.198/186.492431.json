The objection as to value is directed to the jury\u2019s verdicts and the sentences imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-26\">We are of the opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was adequate, and that the convictions and sentences should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The goods involved in this case were part of a shipment of women\u2019s clothing which was en route from New York to certain department stores in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and nearby points. The goods had been transported in a trailer owned by Helm\u2019s New York Pittsburgh Motor Express. When the trailer reached its Pittsburgh terminal, some 168 cartons were loaded onto one of Helm\u2019s local trucks for delivery to Joseph Horne Company, one of the consignees. Shortly thereafter, this truck was stolen from in front of a restaurant while the driver was inside having a cup of coffee. The abandoned truck and part of the load were found later the same day. Two days later about 100 cartons marked with Joseph Horne Company\u2019s name were found in a garage on Western Avenue in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Defendant\u2019s connection with the crime was established by Vincent Empiri, an accomplice. He testified that he and the defendant, together with one DiPippa, were riding in the latter\u2019s car when they saw the unattended Helm\u2019s truck; that he drove the truck away, the others preceding him in the car; that they unloaded about half the packages in the Western Avenue garage and then abandoned the truck and the remaining packages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant did not take the stand, but offered the testimony of three local law officers to establish that he was in the Allegheny County Courthouse at the time of the events described by Empiri.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Defendant concedes that a conviction can be sustained Upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, but contends that the overwhelming weight of the testimony of three disinterested witnesses should so discredit Empiri\u2019s testimony that no conviction -should be allowed to rest thereon. We cannot agree. Whatever the explanation for the apparent conflict in testimony, the credibility of the witnesses was for the jury. Defendant did not complain of the instructions under which the issue was submitted. He cannot now be heard to say that the jury should have believed some witnesses and disbelieved others. United States v. Dewinsky, D.C.N.J.1941, 41 F.Supp. 149, 154. Opinion by Goodrich, Circuit Judge, sitting by assignment. Furthermore, Empiri\u2019s testimony was corroborated by that of other prosecution witnesses, who testified to having seen the defendant and DiPippa in the vicinity of the Western Avenue garage on the day of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Defendant also contends that the government failed to prove one of the elements of the crime, viz. \u2014 the interstate character of the shipment. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cTo establish the interstate or foreign commerce character of any shipment in any prosecution under this section the waybill or other shipping document of such shipment shall be prima facie evidence of the place from which and to which such shipment was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In this case, however the government attempted to actually trace the shipment by producing the testimony of everyone who handled it from its point of origin in New York until the theft in Pittsburgh. It is defendant\u2019s position that the prosecution could have introduced the pertinent shipping documents and rested on the presumption created by the statute, but that, having attempted to establish the interstate nature of the goods by positive testimony, the government itself rebutted the' statutory pre^ sumption. In support of this contention, defendant points to the testimony of Sherman, the Helm\u2019s driver who drove from New York to Harrisburg, where another driver took over. Sherman was asked by government counsel whether he picked up the trailer in question at Helm\u2019s New York termin\u00e1l, to which he replied: \u201cYes, I did. I didn\u2019t pick up no freight. I just picked up a trailer.\u201d Defendant contends that this answer meant that Sherman picked up only an empty trailer, and that therefore the jury had no basis for a finding that the goods were moving in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\"> The answer to this contention is twofold. First, there was ample evidence to bolster the statutory presumption. The government proved specifically that the goods were loaded in New York and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>trailer sealed; and further, that the seal was intact when the trailer arrived in Pittsburgh. This alone would have been adequate. Cf. United States v. Cordo, 2 Cir., 1951, 186 F.2d 144, 146. Second, the jury\u2019s verdict resolved any possible ambiguity in Sherman\u2019s testimony. In the Federal courts, evidence offered to rehut a presumption must be credited by the jury to be effective. Tot v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 463, 470, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contention is that the government failed to prove the value of the stolen goods. This contention has two aspects; defendant maintains that the sentences were illegal, since it was not proven that the goods were worth more than $100,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, moreover, the guilty verdicts themselves should not be allowed to stand, since it was not shown that the goods had <em>any </em>value. We do not agree with either proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">While the government did not attempt to fix in dollars and cents the total value of the stolen goods, the evidence was clear that they were worth far in excess of $100. The shipping documents showed that the entire shipment consisted of approximately 400 cartons with a total weight of 9043 pounds. These goods were carried by Helm\u2019s at a \u201creleased value\u201d of $0.50 per pound, which meant that the carrier\u2019s liability alone exceeded $4500. The testimony showed that almost one-half of the shipment was stolen. Moreover, the freight charges alone on the goods consigned to Joseph Horne Company exceeded $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The jury returned a general verdict of guilty on both indictments, indicating that the defendant was \u201c \u2018guilty in manner and form as charged * * *.\u2019 \u201d Chesavior v. United States, 1929, 59 App.D.C. 49, 32 F.2d 945, 946. The sentence of one year\u2019s imprisonment imposed under Indictment No. 13295 was necessarily based upon a value of $100 or less, since the indictment did not allege value. The sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment imposed under Indietment No. 13296 was amply supported hy the evidence above discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">For the reasons stated the judgments of conviction and the sentences imposed thereon by the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\">. \u201cWhoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes * * * from any railroad2 car-, wagon, motortruck, or other vehicle, * * * with intent to convert to his own. use any goods or chattels moving as or which are a part of * * * an interstate or foreign shipment of freight or \u25a0express; or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayf\">\u201cWhoever buys or receives or has in his possession any such goods or chattels, knowing the same to have been embezzled or stolen * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-28\">\u201cShall in each case be fined not more than .$5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the amount or value of such * * * goods or chattels does not exceed $100, he shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">. There was testimony that some of the goods were lateq sold, but this was ruled inadmissible against this defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">. The maximum penalty under the statute, where the goods are of a value of $100 or less, is $1000 fine or a year\u2019s imprisonment, or both; upwards of a value of $100, the maximum penalty is $5000 fine or ten years imprisonment, or both.
