The services were performed at the request of one Fred Friedeberg, a dealer in surplus Government property, who was negotiating the purchase in the name of \u201cFred Friedeberg, doing business as D &amp; F Ventures.\u201d Friedeberg died not long after the suit was commenced. Recovery was sought from appellant Dulien on the asserted ground that the services were rendered to D &amp; F Ventures as purchaser, and that D &amp; F Ventures was a partnership or joint venture composed of appellant and Friede-berg. Dulien denied that he was a partner in the enterprise and hence that he was obligated to pay appellee for his services. The District Court, sitting without a jury, gave judgment for appellee, after finding explicitly that \u201calthough the evidence with respect to ownership and membership of D &amp; F Ventures is conflicting and supports different inferences, the Court holds the plaintiff has sustained the burden of proof that said joint adventure was composed of Fred Friedeberg and Louis Dulien, defendants herein named, and as such are liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-22\">The evidence introduced at the trial does not provide a legally sufficient basis for this finding. Direct proof as to the composition of D &amp; F Ventures was submitted by appellant, in the form of a copy of a joint-venture agreement listing \u201cRuth J. Friedeberg (wife of Fred Friedeberg), and Dulien Steel Products, Inc., a Washington corporation,\u201d as the members of the venture,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and designating Fred Friedeberg as his wife\u2019s agent. This document is silent as to personal membership on the part of Dulien and personal liability on his part for the debts of the firm; indeed, it raises an inference against both. In correspondence with appellee (all after the services in question were performed), appellant consistently signed himself as \u201cLouis Dulien, President, Dulien Steel Products, Inc.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee addressed him in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Appellee testified that Friedeberg often referred to Dulien as his partner, in conversations with appellee. But Friedeberg\u2019s reported statements were inadmissible against Dulien to show that the two of them ware partners and liable jointly for debts incurred by Friedeberg \u2014 at least in the absence of a prima facie showing of partnership established by other evidence. The trial judge so ruled, and correctly. Pleasants v. Fant, 89 U.S. 116, 22 Wall. 116, 22 L.Ed. 780; 40 Am.Jur. 187. Such other evidence was lacking. It is not to be found either in the documentary exhibits or in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Appellee emphasizes a telephone conversation he had with Dulien shortly after Friedeberg\u2019s request to appellee for assistance in connection with the surplus equipment sale. Concerning this, the first communication between the parties to this appeal, appellee testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cThat day [January 23] I had a long distance telephone call from a Louis Dulien asking me what had been done. I told him over the telephone that I had not concluded the matter yet and I wouldn\u2019t know until the following Monday, and that I was advising Friedeberg. (App. 15)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c * * * I did have a conversation with Louis Dulien when he called me on January 23, and asked if I was to be paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cNow, whether that was the source of his complaint then, I don\u2019t know. But Louis Dulien assured me that I would be paid.\u201d (App. 18)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">At no point in the report of this conversation is the nature of appellant\u2019s interest in the transaction stated \u2014 whether as a friend of Friedeberg\u2019s, as President of Dulien Steel Products, Inc., or in some other capacity. The assurance to appellee that he \u201cwould be paid\u201d does not imply that appellant, rather than Fri#leberg or the partnership or appellant\u2019s corporation, would provide the payment. At most it implies that Dulien would act as surety. The conversation, as reported by appellee, does not justify a finding that appellant was interested in the sale individually, as a partner of Friedeberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">It was Friedeberg who negotiated the purchase from the War Assets Administration and Friedeberg who retained appellee. What, then, was appellant\u2019s connection with the transaction ? The evidence discloses in substance that a corporation of which appellant was president and active head was a partner or co-adventurer in the firm making the purchase. The record tells us nothing concerning his stockholding in this corporation or the extent of his control over its affairs. There is no showing that he directly or personally benefited from the transaction, or that circumstances existed which would justify the court in disregarding the corporate form and depriving appellant of the protection against personal liability which he sought and which corporate organization normally provides.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 1 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations (Perm.Ed.) \u00a7 41 et seq. Nor was any attempt made to show that Dulien induced appellee to believe, prior to the doing of the work, that he would be personally obligated to pay for appellee\u2019s services. Appellee did not plead or seek to prove estoppel. See Mechem, Partnership \u00a7\u00a7 102-08; Thompson v. First Nat. Bank, 111 U.S. 529, 4 S.Ct. 689, 28 L.Ed. 507; Uniform Partnership Act \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Finding no basis for holding appellant personally liable, we reverse the judgment without reaching the other questions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-19\">. Appellant\u2019s testimony on deposition, taken at his own instance, was to like effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-20\">. For example, Dulien so signed himself in a letter of May 6, 1948, wherein he expressed Ms \u201cearnest desire to see tMs [fee] matter amicaMy settled.\u201d TMs letter mentions certain decisions wMch \u201cwe\u201d had made, evidently referring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Friedeberg and bimself \u2014 but -without stating in what capacity he had acted. The letter also speaks of \u201cour\u201d attorney, <em>but </em>adds: \u201cwhen I say \u2018our attorney\u2019 I refer to the attorney for the D &amp; F Ventures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-20\">. It is suggested that a corporation cannot legally become a member of a partnership or joint venture. But see TJni-form Partnership Act \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6; Remington\u2019s Rev.Wask.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9975-41, 9975-45 (Supp.1945). And even if the eorporation could not be a partner, it does not follow that Dulien is to be substituted in the place of the corporation and made subject to personal liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
