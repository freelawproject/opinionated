Irwin, D.C., 43 F.Supp. 212, and Wells v. American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 132 F.2d 316, and to the cases holding that a state may not by statute or decision destroy or impair substantial rights secured under a contract made in another state and valid where made.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">So pointing, it insists that, all its other defenses aside, this defense was impregnable and for the failure of the district judge to sustain it, the judgment must be reversed and the cause dismissed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">Of the opinion that the \u201cno action\u201d clause in the policy and the circumstances of its writing are in no substantial way different from those in the appeal of Fisher v. Home Indemnity Co., No. 13810, on the docket of this court, 198 F.2d 218, and that as appellee, Home Indemnity, was not there subject to direct action, so appellant, Employers Mutual, is not so subject, we will not further labor the matter here. We will content ourselves with announcing that, for the reasons and upon the considerations set out in our opinion in Fisher\u2019s case, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>June 30, 1952, the judgment in this case will be reversed and the cause dismissed, without prejudice therefrom, to plaintiff\u2019s right to sue LaDew, to the merits of its claim, or to LaDew\u2019s or its right to proceed against appellant as provided in the policy-appellant issued to LaDew.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Judgment reversed and cause dismissed without prejudice as above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-20\">. \u201cAll of our work is to be subject to the approval of the Louisiana Rating &amp; Fire Prevention Bureau.

LaDew in the State of Texas; that said policy among other things, contained an endorsement or rider, dated March 24,1949, which provides: \u2018it is agreed that the insurance afforded by this policy applies only to operations performed in the State of Louisiana;\u2019 that the law of Texas does not authorize a direct action against in-surors, nor does it require that such a provision be contained in its insurance policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-21\">. \u201cNo action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured\u2019s obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the company.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-22\">\u201cAny person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy.

Home Indemnity Company, No. 13810, 5 Cir., 198 F.2d 218, upon which the majority rest their opinion in the present case, and yet dissent herein, it may be well to indicate wherein this case differs from that one. It will be observed that in the present case the policy of insurance, by express endorsement, applied \u201conly to operations performed in the State of Louisiana.\u201d That State was the only place where the insurance contract was to be in force. The policy was written in the State of Texas, but the essential coverage was restricted to the State of Louisiana. The insurer is authorized to, and does, conduct business in Louisiana. In such contract, and its enforcement, the State has a direct and natural interest on behalf of its creature, which seeks recovery because of an alleged injury inflicted by the insured in Louisiana. This interest has been manifested by the Louisiana direct action statute. In writing the policy now involved and restricting its coverage only to operations performed in the State of Louisiana, the insurer must be held to have contracted with a view to subjection to the provisions of Louisiana law. Having done so, it is not in position to successfully maintain that the statutes and jurisprudence of that State unconstitutionally seek to impinge upon its contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Under the opinion of the controlling majority, there should have been, and can be, in this suit, no trial at all. Therefore, the appellant\u2019s alternative claims of error subsisting in the attempt are effectively mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Rehearing denied; RUSSELL, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
