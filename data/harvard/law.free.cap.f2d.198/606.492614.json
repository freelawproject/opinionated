The issues formed by the pleadings and pretrial order involved alleged noncompliance by plaintiffs with certain conditions of the insurance policy. The case was tried without a jury. The court found in favor of defendant and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-21\">We think there was ample evidence to support the court\u2019s findings and that its conclusions were correct. We find no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
