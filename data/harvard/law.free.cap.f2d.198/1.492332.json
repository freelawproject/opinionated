Johns in settlement of Johns\u2019 suit against Reed and Bay JBtate Abrasive Products Company (Bay State) in the United States District Court of Maryland. The settlement was made after the Maryland District Court had granted a motion to dismiss as to Bay State and had overruled such a motion as to Reed pursuant to an opinion reported in Johns v. Bay State Abrasive Products Co., D.C., 89 F.Supp. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-21\">In the Maryland suit Johns sought to recover the sum of $100,000.00 in damages from Reed and Bay State for injuries which he received when an abrasive wheel manufactured by Bay State (a company in no way connected with Reed) disintegrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>and flew apart while such wheel was being used by Johns on a pneumatic grinding machine manufactured .by Reed. The declaration of Johns in the Maryland suit charged Reed and Bay State with several different acts of negligence including a charge that a salesman of Reed\u2019s in the course of his employment negligently represented to Johns and to Johns\u2019 employer, Patterson, that the Bay State abrasive wheel was fit for use upon Reed\u2019s grinding machine and was not dangerous to use, when as a matter of fact such wheel was dangerous and not safe to use on Reed\u2019s machine. Johns\u2019 declaration alleges that his employer, Patterson, \u201crelying upon these representations * * * ordered through a local distributor of the Bay State Abrasive Products Company several of these wheels.\u201d One of the grounds of negligence charged against Reed by Johns was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-3\">\u201c * * * jn the representations of its agent, servant and employee that the entire unit, including the wheel model A-24 J 16 F was safe to use for the purpose that it was being used at the time of the accident when as a matter of fact, the machine and its component parts were not safe for said purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">On this appeal Reed contends that by reason of such allegations of negligence the Insurance Company became bound and obligated under the terms of the insurance policy issued to Reed to defend Reed in the Maryland suit and to pay any damages recovered or paid in a good faith settlement within the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">We quote in the footnote<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the parts of the insurance policy most pertinent to the question presented for decision. Of the five hazards that could have been covered to-witj (1) Premises \u2014 Operations (2) Elevators (3) Independent Contractors (4) Products and (5) Contractual, only (1) Premises \u2014 Operations was covered, that being the only one for which a premium charge was paid. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">On the motion of the Insurance Company to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the District Court wrote an opinion in which it concluded that, \u201c * <em>*\u25a0 </em>the negligence charged with respect to- the shattering of the abrasive wheel and the injury of Johns is not covered by the hazard insured against, i. e., \u2018Premises \u2014 Operations\u2019, but perhaps by the hazard \u2018Products\u2019, which is not insured against.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u201cAnd the negligence charged with respect to the statements made by Reed\u2019s Agent about such machine are not covered by the Hazard insured against, i e., \u2018Premises\u2014 Operations\u2019, when the definition thereof is read in the light of the above quoted Paragraph (d) from \u2018Exclusions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The question for decision is whether the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazard insured against or the \u201cProducts\u201d hazard not insured against would have afforded insurance for the liability of Reed upon the allegations in Johns\u2019 declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The language used in the definition of the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazard has been construed to mean that it covers all operations whether on the premises or elsewhere which are necessary or incidental to the declared use of the premises. Lloyds Casualty Insurer v. McCrary, Tex., 229 S.W.2d 605, Hardware Mutual Casualty Company v. Schantz, 5 Cir., 186 F. 868. We think that the District Court was in error in concluding that the negligence charged against Reed was with respect to one of its products and, as we read Johns\u2019 declaration, the negligence charged against Reed was with respect to the acts and representations of Reed\u2019s agent and salesman regarding the product of another, Bay State, when used on Reed\u2019s machine. It seems to us that that negligence was within the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazard unless excluded therefrom by paragraph (d) of the \u201cExclusions\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The appellee argues with much force that the representations of Reed\u2019s salesman were \u201ccompleted\u201d when made and, that the accident occurring thereafter, such representations and Reed\u2019s liability therefor could have been insured under the second clause of the \u201cProducts\u201d hazard, and hence under Exclusion (d) were excluded from the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazard; that completed operations are excluded from the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d coverage under the policy. Considering the alleged representations of Reed\u2019s Agent to be \u201coperations\u201d were they operations which had been completed before the accident occurred such as would come within the coverage under \u201cProducts\u201d and be excluded from the coverage under \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d? To answer in the affirmative would result in relieving the Insurance Company from any liability for negligent representations of the agents or salesmen of the insured because, of course, no person could be injured as a result of acting upon a negligent representation until after the representation had been made to him. We hold that an operation consisting of a negligent representation made for the purpose of or reasonably calculated to induce action is not completed until the person to whom the representation is made acts in reliance upon that representation. The result follows that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, and that the judgment of the District Court dismissing said complaint is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-4\">. \u201cPacific Employer Insurance Company</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">A California Corporation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">(Herein Called the Company)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cDoes Hereby <em>Agree </em>with the assured, named in <em>tie </em>declarations made a part hereof, in consideration of the premium and of the statements contained in the declarations and subject to the limits of liability and other terms of this policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u2022 \u201cInsuring Agreements</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201c1.
