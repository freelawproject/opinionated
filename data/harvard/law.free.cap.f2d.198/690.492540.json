See Securities Exchange Act Release 4694. Those findings include the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b739-20\">\u201cR. H. Johnson &amp; Company (\u2018applicant\u2019), a partnership registered as a broker and dealer under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u2018the Act\u2019), has sought review pursuant to Section 15 A(g) of the Act [15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 780, 780-3] of an order of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\u2018NASD\u2019) entered on January 15, 1951, expelling applicant from membership in the NASD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b739-21\">\u201cA complaint dated November 16, 1949, was issued by the District Business Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Committee of District 14 of the NASD charging violations of Sections 1 and 2 of Article III of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice by applicant, by two of its partners, Roland H. Boardman and John D. Freeman, and by a salesman, Caswell Sharpe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Committee, after hearing, found that applicant and the others had violated these rules in that, for the purpose of obtaining profits for themselves, they had induced trading activity in a customers\u2019 account during the period from May 25, 1943, to March 3, 1949, which, in view of the financial resources and character of the account, was excessive in volume and in frequency. It ordered the expulsion of applicant from membership in the association and revocation of registration with the association of the others as registered representatives of applicant. Upon review by the NASD Board of Governors, applicant\u2019s expulsion and the revocation of Sharpe\u2019s registration were affirmed, and the disciplinary \u2022 action with respect to Boardman and Freeman was reduced to suspension from registration for one year. In addition, the Board found that Rupert H. Johnson, applicant\u2019s principal partner, and Boardman, Freeman, and Sharpe were causes of the order expelling applicant from membership in the NASD. Applicant has sought review of the action taken against it, and a request for review has been filed by Johnson in so far as such action and the NASD\u2019s finding affect him individually. * * * The * * * over-trading was effected in a joint account of an elderly widow and her daughter, neither of whom had any financial or business background.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The widow\u2019s investments had previously been handled by a relative, and after his death Sharpe, who at that time was a securities salesman for another firm, successfully solicited her account and gained her trust and confidence. He became a salesman in applicant\u2019s Boston office in 1942, bringing the account with him, and from May 25, 1943, when the account became a joint one, until March 3, 1949, the customers placed with Sharpe for investment a net of $57,776 in cash and securities. With these assets Sharpe effected a total of 648 transactions consisting of 348 purchases and 300 sales, in a gross amount of $1,011,678. The securities acquired in 208 of. the purchase transactions were sold within six months of acquisition, while those acquired in 68 other purchase transactions were sold within a year. Thus, more than 79% of the purchases were reversed within one year. Only the securities acquired in 35 purchases, of which 20 were effected as recently as 1948 and 1949, remained unsold at the end of the six-year period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\"

that almost one-third of the purchases were made between a dividend declaration date and the ex-dividend date. The customers believed they were receiving extra income, but the dividends were in effect merely a return of capital which had been purchased with the attendant expense of commissions and other costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b741-5\">\u201cAt March 3, 1949, when the customers closed their account, securities worth $31,-700 remained of the $57,776 in cash and securities invested, indicating a loss of $26,-076, of which $8,733 had been realized. * * * Had these customers, instead of placing their account with applicant, simply continued holding the securities they originally owned, their account on the date it was closed would have shown an increased market value of about $2,663.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b741-7\">\u201cApplicant realized commissions and profits on this account totalling $23,354. Although almost all of the transactions were in listed securities, only $1,852 represented commissions on agency transactions while $21,502 were profits derived from sales to the customers by applicant as principal. Sharpe received 50% of these commissions and profits realized by applicant. Over the six-year period, 33% of Sharpe\u2019s income was derived front this one account, and in one year it provided over 47% of his income.

However, applicant contends that responsibility for the overtrading cannot be attributed to it. It argues that primary responsibility lies with Sharpe while any derivative responsibility goes only as far as Boardman and Freeman who, as resident partners in the Boston office, assertedly had complete control over Sharpe\u2019s trading in the account. The NASD, on the other hand, has argued that Boardman and Freeman were not actually partners but only supervisory employees, and that while it is immaterial, as far as applicant\u2019s responsibility is concerned, whether Boardman and Freeman were partners or not, their subordinate status in the firm is significant with respect to Johnson\u2019s duty, as the dominant partner, to supervise the Boston office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-4\">\u201cJohnson, as the dominant partner, must have known that Boardman and Freeman would have little time to devote to supervision of the activities of the salesmen in the Boston office, who, as noted above, serviced about two to four thousand accounts. Boardman and Freeman were permitted to handle their own accounts, receiving a commission of 50% thereon like the other salesmen, and they were frequently away from the office on firm business. Boardman normally was in his office about 15 hours out of a work week of 39 hours, spending three days a week at other sales offices of applicant, while Freeman was in his office about 25 hours a week.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-5\">\u201cMoreover, the record shows that supervision of the salesmen in the Boston office was primarily the function of the New York office where Johnson maintained his headquarters. The accounting system of the firm was such that the only permanent records were in the New York office. The daily sales sheets were prepared in New York showing all transactions for the day in all of the offices, and the customers\u2019 ledger was kept in New York. Whenever accurate and complete information as to an account was required by the Boston office, a transcript taken from the customers\u2019 ledger in New York would be supplied. To the extent that there was compliance with Section 27(a) of Article III of the NASD\u2019s rules which requires supervision of salesmen including review and approval of all sales by a partner, executive of branch manager evidenced by written endorsement of sales memoranda, it was carried out in New York. However, such endorsement in applicant\u2019s case, in the form of initialing of the sales memoranda frequently was done by employees rather than a partner or executive and merely purported to indicate that the transactions were accurately set down and that the spread was reasonable. But the endorsement did not purport to signify that the transactions had been approved as being suitable for the customer. It is clear, therefore, that although the New York office was responsible for revising securities transactions, such limited check as was actually made was not designed and was ineffective to detect excessive trading.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b742-7\">Judd &amp; Gurfein, New York City (Orrin G.

For the first year, the year-end balance was used in place of an average. The record does not contain a computation of the rate turnover in terms of the average value of the securities held in the account. If the turnover were computed on such basis, it appears that although the rate might be lower than indicated for the earlier years of the table, it would probably be higher for 1947 and 1948. The latter conclusion is indicated by the fact that while the balance of cash invested in the account increased from $39,274 at the end of 1943 to an average of $58,133 in 1948, the value of the securities held in the account had fallen to $31,700 by March 3, 1949.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-33\">.

However, this increase in market prices would not of course affect the validity of any finding that the account was mishandled during the period involved in this proceeding. And of course, the market rise would have similarly affected the value of the securities held originally so that, if they had merely been retained, their value in October 1951 would have been approximately $83,000, representing a gain of $26,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b742-11\">FRANK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">1. The petitioners argue that, in. addition to reviewing the Commission\u2019s order, we must review the conduct and opinion of the NASD. We think not. For Section 25(a) of the Securities Exchange. Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78y, which affords the sole basis of any judicial review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>refers to a Commission order only. Moreover, Section (h)(1) of the so-called Ma-loney <em>Act </em>\u2014 i. <em>e.j </em>Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 provides as follows: The Commission shall review disciplinary action taken by a \u201cregistered securities association\u201d; in doing so, the Commission shall conduct a hearing of its own and shall consider not only \u201cthe record before the association\u201d but also \u201csuch other evidence as it may deem relevant\u201d; it shall make its own finding as to whether the disciplined member has done or omitted such acts \u201cas the association has found him to have engaged in or omitted\u201d; the Commission shall then determine for itself whether the act or omission violated such rules of the association \u201cas have been designated in the determination of the association\u201d; the Commission must also determine and declare whether the act or omission constitutes \u201cconduct inconsistent with just and equiable principles of trade, and shall so declare\u201d; and the Commission shall find whether the penalty imposed by the association is \u201cexcessive or oppressive, having due regard to the public interest,\u201d and, if so, it shall, by order, \u201ccancel, reduce, or require the remission of such penalty.\u201d We think that those provisions call for (1) <em>de novo </em>findings by the Commission, (2) the hearing (as here) by the Commission of further evidence if necessary, and (3) an independent decision by the Commission as to the charges and penalty; these matters alone are subject to our review. We conclude that we may consider any errors in the proceedings of the association only if and to the extent that they infected the Commission\u2019s action by leading to errors on its part.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">2. We perceive no such errors. Having considered the record as a whole, we hold that there is ample substantial evidence to sustain the Commission\u2019s findings, which, in turn, fully justify the conclusion that the firm was guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Petitioners, however, contend that the association\u2019s opinion contains references to matters not relevant to those charges. The Commission suggests that those references be regarded as dicta. Much can be said for that suggestion: Many court opinions abound with similar \u201casides\u201d, not pertinent to the accompanying decisions, yet no one supposes that the decisions are therefore invalid; it would be strange, then, were a court to invalidate an order by a body of non-lawyers because the order is accompanied by an opinion which imitates the verbal habits of the judiciary. But far more important, the Commission, in its own independent findings, ignored such irrelevant matters. True, lack of supervision and violation of the association\u2019s Rule 27 (a) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were not charged. But the Commission properly took them into account in their 'bearing on the specific charges brought against the firm and on the duties of the Commission in the circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">3. In the light of the statutory provisions concerning (a) the Commission\u2019s power, according to reasonably fixed statutory standards,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to approve or disapprove of the association\u2019s Rules, and (b) the Commission\u2019s review of any disciplinary action, we see no merit in the contention that the Act unconstitutionally delegates power to the association.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">4. Johnson petitioned the Commission to review the action of the association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201cinsofar as said action or the findings\u201d related to him individually. The Commission did so. It found that he was \u201ca cause\u201d of the order expelling the firm. He now urges that the association filed no charges against him. But, as he did not make this point until he reached this court, we may not deal with it; for Section 25 provides, \u201cNo objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">5. Johnson argues that the record contains no substantial evidence to support the finding that his conduct was a \u201ccause\u201d of the firm\u2019s expulsion within the meaning of Section 15A(b)(4)(C).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree. There is ample evidence (1) that he had complete control of all persons in the organization including the other partners (who were such in little more than name) and (2) that he signally failed to provide any adequate supervision although his extensive control put upon him that responsibility. He contends, however, that such failure does not make him a \u201ccause,\u201d because, he says, \u201ccause\u201d must always be interpreted to mean \u201can immediate or inducing cause,\u201d with the result here that a \u201ccause\u201d cannot consist of anything \u201cback of the employee or associate who was guilty of the violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">We reject that interpretation. It involves the \u201cfamiliar one-word-one-mcaning (or \u2018pigs is pigs\u2019) fallacy\u201d,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> grounded on reasoning which \u201cwould compel the conclusion that a clotheshorse is an animal of the equine species, and make it impossible to speak of drinking a toast.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It overlooks the context<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in which the word \u201ccause\u201d is used, <em>i. </em>&lt;?., a statute explicitly concerned with adherence to \u201cjust and equitable principles of trade.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Johnson\u2019s interpretation would encourage ethical ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>responsibility by those who should be primarily responsible for such adherence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If Johnson\u2019s contention were sound, then, in order to circumvent those principles, a person controlling a firm would merely have to arrange to leave wholly unsupervised its employees who deal with customers. We think Johnson\u2019s irresponsible behavior with respect to supervision amounted to such recklessness as to justify the finding that he was a \u201ccause\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the firm\u2019s \u25a0expulsion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">6. We think that, in passing upon the penalty, the Commission properly considered previous disciplinary action taken against the firm by the association and by the New York Stock Exchange. We think the Commission did not abuse its discretion in not setting aside the penalty fixed by the association. Assuming, <em>argu-yendo, </em>that we may go further and decide whether or not the penalty was excessive, \u25a0we hold that the penalty was not incorrect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-4\">. 15 \u00dc.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-5\">.
