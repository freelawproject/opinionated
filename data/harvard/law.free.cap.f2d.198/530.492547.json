C.Code 1940, Supp. VII, \u00a7 47-801a, as \u201c(h) Buildings belonging to and operated by institutions which are not organized or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>operated for private gain, which are used for purposes of public charity principally in the District of Columbia\u201d and grounds required and used for such purposes. Respondent\u2019s sole activity is the operation of a residential settlement house, including classes and social activities for adults and children and day care of children. The moderate fees it charges for its services are based on the individual\u2019s ability to pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority pay but a portion of the cost of the services they receive, and those who can pay nothing are served free.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s income is derived largely from the Community Chest and other charitable sources. Respondent\u2019s officers receive no salary. The compensation of those of respondent\u2019s workers who are not volunteers is very modest. In numerous instances it includes board and lodging which is supplied at less than cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We think the Board of Tax Appeals was clearly right in finding that respondent\u2019s real property is exempt from taxation. Petitioner points out that most of respondent\u2019s beneficiaries are not impoverished. But as the Board said, \u201cIt is not necessary, in order to qualify as a charity, that an organization confine its activities to the furnishing of the bare necessities of life, namely, food, shelter and clothing. An activity is equally a charity when, as in the case of petitioner, it affords some of the amenities of a decent life to those who are unable to pay anything at all, or the full price thereof * * * \u201d Cf. International Reform Federation v. District Unemployment Compensation Board, 76 U. S.App.D.C. 282, 284, 131 F.2d 337, 339. It is likewise immaterial that respondent receives fees from those who can afford to pay, Catholic Home for Aged Ladies v. District of Columbia, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 195, 161 F.2d 901,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that a few of the beneficiaries could perhaps pay more than they do for the services they get. We need not consider whether respondent\u2019s tax status would be different if most of its beneficiaries were well-to-do.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Government Services, Inc., v. District of Columbia, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 189 F.2d 662, does not support petitioner\u2019s contention that only organizations \u201cfor the relief of the poor\u201d are charitable in a tax sense. Government Services, Inc. \u201cmakes profits in that its receipts are in excess of its costs. * * * It has an accumulated earned surplus of about $1,500,000 largely invested in equipment.\u201d 88 U.S.App.D.C. at page 361, 189 F.2d at page 663. It sold meals and other services to the public at moderate prices but not below <em>cost </em>There is small resemblance between that organization and one like respondent which must and does serve, for the most part, below cost, and depends on public benevolence to meet expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\">. Petitioner\u2019s analysis of the financial status of 121 families having children in respondent\u2019s full-day child care program shows 54 single-income families with an average annual gross income of $3,119.-60 and 67 double-income families with an average total annual gross income of $4,712.85. Roughly one-third of the families had incomes below $5,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">. For example: The cost of full-day care per child is estimated at $2 per full day. Fees, where charged, range from $3.50 to $12.50 per five-day week per child. The operating expenses of the day care program totaled approximately $32,250 during 1930 as compared with total fees of about $18,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-13\">. The Board observed that \u201cThe United Community Services organization [The Community Chest] expected its member agencies to collect fees from recipients of their service to the extent of the ability of the recipients to pay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
