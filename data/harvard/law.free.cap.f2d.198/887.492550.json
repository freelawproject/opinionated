The district court found that the failure of the DB 1845 to carry a light was a contributing cause of the collision; we have differed and have found that the sole fault for the collision rests on the Douglas Victory.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-20\">Libellant\u2019s statutory fault afforded substantial basis for the claim of mutual fault. It was not overly diligent in bringing the case to trial. Under\" all of the circumstances, we think it a just exercise of the court\u2019s <em>discretion</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to fix the date for the-running of interest as April 25, 1951, the day on which the libellant was originally entitled to judgment, and the motion of the appellant for further amendment of the opinion and judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-14\">.
