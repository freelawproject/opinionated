(Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amount of a pension is based in part on the earnings of the retiree during a selected three-year period or one-year period prior to retirement. In Ventura County the one-year period is used in calculating pensions. We are asked to decide whether various payments by the county over and above the basic salary paid to all employees in the same job classification are \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the statute which defines compensation (\u00a7 31460), and, if so, whether those payments are also \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d (\u00a7 31461) and thus part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation\u201d (\u00a7 31462 or 31462.1) for purposes of calculating the amount of a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Plaintiffs, an employee association and three retired employees, contend that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that only those bonuses, incentives, and other forms of compensation that are paid uniformly to all employees in a job classification are \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d Defendant retirement board and real party in interest Ventura County (hereafter referred to jointly as the county) disagree and also contend that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the county\u2019s contribution to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan is \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">After considering the language and legislative history of the pertinent CERL provisions, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to require that a county include its contributions to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan in \u201ccompensation\u201d as defined in CERL. We also conclude, however, that the other disputed premiums are \u201ccompensation.\u201d With the exception of overtime pay, items of \u201ccompensation\u201d paid in cash, even if not earned by all employees in the same grade or class, must be included in the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which an employee\u2019s pension is based.</p>\n<p id=\"A-n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>We shall, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Pursuant to a 1992 memorandum of agreement with plaintiff association, from July 19, 1992, to July 15, 1995, the relevant time period, the county paid qualifying members of the association, in cash, bilingual premium <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a uniform maintenance allowance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> educational incentive pay,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> additional compensation for scheduled meal periods for designated employees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pay in lieu of annual leave accrual,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> holiday pay,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a motorcycle bonus,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a field training officer bonus.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the same period, the three individual plaintiffs were subject to a resolution fixing the wages, hours, and terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>employment of management, confidential clerical, and other unrepresented employees. As such they were entitled to cash payments for a uniform maintenance allowance,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a longevity incentive,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> pay in lieu of annual leave accrual,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and matching deferred compensation payments.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">When the county refused to include the cash payments agreed to in the memorandum of agreement and the resolution in computing employees\u2019 \u201cfinal compensation\u201d upon which their pensions were based, plaintiffs initiated this mandamus proceeding (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) by which they sought to compel recalculation of their pension rights based on a computation of \u201ccompensation,\u201d \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d which did include these cash payments. The superior court denied the petition without a statement of decision, none having been requested, and plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Court of Appeal, relying in part on <em>Guelfi </em>v. <em>Marin County Employees\u2019 Retirement Assn. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 297 [193 Cal.Rptr. 343] <em>(Guelfi), </em>agreed with the implicit conclusion of the trial court that none of the premiums identified by the association constituted compensation that had to be included in calculating pensions, but held that the county\u2019s matching deferred compensation payments were includable compensation. It therefore \u201caffirmed\u201d the judgment of the superior court and \u201cremanded\u201d the matter to the retirement board for recalculation of the retirement benefits of the three individual plaintiffs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">This court granted petitions for review by both plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The county argues that the Court of Appeal erred in reading a 1995 amendment of section 31461 which provided that deferred compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>was to be deemed \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in the year earned rather than the year paid as recognition that matching contributions to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan constituted \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d The parties had agreed that the amendment did not change the law, but the county contends that matching funds were never \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under section 31461.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Plaintiffs contend that both the <em>Guelfi </em>court and the Court of Appeal in this case erred in their construction of sections 31460 and 31461, and in doing so ignored legislative history which reflects intent that all of the claimed cash payments be included in the \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which county employee pensions are calculated under CERL.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\n<em>Statutory Definitions and the Guelfi Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The payments required by CERL to be included in the calculation of the pension of an employee whose county employer has elected to establish a retirement system governed by CERL presents a question of statutory construction, and thus legislative intent. Under CERL an employee\u2019s pension is a combination of a retirement annuity based on the employee\u2019s accumulated contributions supplemented by a pension established with county contributions sufficient to equal a specified fraction of the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 31664, 31676.1.) Other provisions of CERL limit the amount of employee pensions to a percentage of (see, e.g., \u00a7 31664.5), or not more than (see, e.g., \u00a7 31676.1), the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Which payments to a county employee other than base pay must be included when determining an employee\u2019s final compensation is a question crucial to the proper administration of a CERL pension system, including the ability of the county to anticipate and meet its funding obligation. We necessarily begin our analysis with the definitions in CERL, as those definitions govern construction of CERL unless the context otherwise requires. (\u00a7 31455.)  Any ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of pension legislation must be resolved in favor of the pensioner, but such construction must be consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute. (Guelfi, <em>supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 303; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 926, 940 [179 Cal.Rptr. 287]; <em>Neeley </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 815, 822 [111 Cal.Rptr. 841].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">A. \u201cCompensation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Section 31460 defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds, plus any amount deducted from a member\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan . . . but does not include the monetary value of board, lodging, fuel, laundry, or other advantages furnished to a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">B. <em>\u201cCompensation </em>earnable\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Under section 31461, \u201c \u2018[compensation earnable\u2019 by a member means the average compensation as determined by the board, for the period under consideration upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay. The computation for any absence shall be based on the compensation of the position held by the member at the beginning of the absence. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Amendments to section 31461 in 1993 and 1995, which the parties agree were not intended to make any substantive change in that definition added: \u201cCompensation, as defined in Section 31460, that has been deferred shall be deemed \u2018compensation earnable\u2019 when earned, rather than when paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">C. <em>\u201cFinal </em>compensation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Section 31462.1, which applies in Ventura County, defines \u201cfinal compensation\u201d as \u201cthe average annual compensation earnable by a member during any year elected by a member at or before the time he files an application for retirement, or, if he fails to elect, during the year immediately preceding his retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">These definitions were construed and applied by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi, </em>in which two retired peace officers claimed that their disability retirement pensions should be calculated on the basis of preretirement earnings including overtime, educational incentive pay, and a uniform allowance. Pursuant to section 31727.4, the amount of a peace officer\u2019s service-connected disability retirement, like a longevity retirement, is based on the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">The <em>Guelfi </em>court first concluded that a uniform allowance is among the \u201cother advantages furnished to a member\u201d which are excluded from \u201ccompensation\u201d by section 31460. (145 Cal.App.3d at p. 304.) The court noted that a uniform allowance had been held to fall within the term \u201cother advantages\u201d as used in section 20022, a part of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law (\u00a7 20000 et seq.) because the uniform was a substitute for other personal attire which an employee must normally furnish at the employee\u2019s own expense. (Guelfi, <em>supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 304, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward, supra, 126 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 943.) Educational incentive pay, by contrast, was remuneration for training that benefited the employer and thus did constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d within the definition of section 31460. (145 Cal.App.3d at p. 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The Court of Appeal then considered whether the payment was \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d within the meaning of section 31461, since, under section 31462.1, only \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d is part of the \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which a pension is calculated, and held that it was not. The court reasoned that not all employees in the same grade or class of positions qualified for educational incentive pay. Therefore, if that pay were to be included in \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d not all employees in a class could be said to receive the same rate of pay and section 31461 provided that \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d was to be based on \u201c \u2018the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the <em>same grade or class of positions </em>. . . and at the <em>same rate of pay. . . </em>.\u2019\u201d <em>(Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 304, italics added.) Similar reasoning led the court to conclude that overtime pay was not \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court concluded that the Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201cdays\u201d ordinarily worked by other employees in the same class, rather than \u201chours\u201d suggested that \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d contemplated the average standard work week of employees in the class, and not additional overtime hours. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 306.) The retirement board was free to include those benefits in its retirement calculation if it elected to do so, but CERL did not require that they be included. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u201cCompensation\u201d <em>and \u201cCompensation Eamable\" in CERL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The function of the court in construing a statute \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; and where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u2018then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lennane </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].) Therefore, if a statute is unambiguous, it must be applied according to its terms. Judicial construction is neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>necessary nor permitted. When statutory construction is necessary, the court\u2019s primary responsibility is to carry out the intent of the Legislature to the extent possible. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 979, 985 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 911 P.2d 1374]; <em>Parris </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 839, 845 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 911 P.2d 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As this case and <em>Guelfi </em>reflect, both section 31460 and section 31461, the proper construction of which is at the heart of this dispute, are ambiguous in some respects. Section 31460 specifies that \u201cremuneration paid in cash\u201d is \u201ccompensation\u201d while the monetary value of board, lodging, fuel, and laundry is not to be considered \u201ccompensation.\u201d It does not specify whether remuneration not ordinarily paid in cash, such as accrued vacation, becomes \u201ccompensation\u201d when the employee elects to receive cash in lieu of the in-kind remuneration, and does not identify or define the other in-kind \u201cadvantages\u201d that are to be excluded from \u201ccompensation.\u201d Finally, section 31460 specifies that deferred compensation deducted from an employee\u2019s wages is \u201ccompensation,\u201d but neither section 31460 nor any other statute indicates whether a county\u2019s matching contributions to a deferred compensation plan are \u201ccompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Section 31461, in turn, fails to specify whether, assuming cash payments for advantages ordinarily furnished in kind are \u201cremuneration paid in cash\u201d within the meaning of section 31460, they and employer contributions to employees\u2019 deferred compensation plans are to be considered in determining the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d of a retiring employee. It also fails to specify if \u201caverage compensation . . . [computed] upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay\u201d contemplates inclusion of only the base pay for those positions or requires either that all \u201ccompensation\u201d to all employees in the same grade or class of positions is to be included in determining the employee\u2019s \u201caverage compensation\u201d or if the \u201caverage compensation\u201d is that of the individual retiring employee, including all nonexcluded cash payments, but computed over the average number of days worked by all employees in the employee\u2019s grade or class for the period on which the individual employee\u2019s retirement pay is based. We therefore disagree with the <em>Guelfi </em>court and the Court of Appeal here that the meaning of sections 31460 and 31461 is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We agree with <em>Guelfi </em>that there is a logical progression in the statutory framework under which a pension is calculated. Application of section 31460 is the first step, since an item must meet its broad definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d if it is also to fall within the narrower category of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d defined in section 31461 and thus form the basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>calculation of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which the pension is based pursuant to section 31462 or 31462.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A. <em>\u201cCompensation\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Before any payment qualifies as \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d the payment must be \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of section 31460. To constitute \u201ccompensation,\u201d a payment must be \u201cremuneration\u201d which is not excluded from \u201ccompensation\u201d by that section. The Legislature has specified that \u201c\u2018[compensation\u2019 means the remuneration paid in cash [and] any amount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">1. <em>County contributions to deferred compensation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Section 53213 permits a county to establish a deferred compensation plan for its employees. Under such a plan, which postpones payment of income taxes until the funds are received, a portion of the current wages of a participating employee is deducted, invested and paid at the time of retirement. Section 53214 provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, a participant in a deferred compensation plan may also participate in a public retirement system, and, in ascertaining the amount of compensation of such participant for purposes of computing the amount of his contributions or benefits under a public retirement system, any amount deducted from his wages pursuant to this article shall be included.\u201d Section 31460 provides in turn that the \u201camount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan\u201d is to be treated as part of the employee\u2019s \u201cremuneration paid in cash,\u201d and section 31461 provides that \u201c[c]ompensation as defined in Section 31460, that has been deferred shall be deemed \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 when earned, rather than when paid.\u201d None of these statutes address the status of the county\u2019s contribution to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan. Moreover, insofar as deferred compensation is concerned, the Legislature has adopted a restrictive definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d in section 31460. That section provides that an \u201camount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan\u201d is \u201ccompensation.\u201d That definition leaves no room for inclusion of any contributions to a deferred compensation plan that are not deducted from a member\u2019s wages. Section 31460 recognizes that but for the employee election to defer payment of those wages, they would be \u201cremuneration paid in cash\u201d as part of the employee\u2019s regular wages. That cannot be said of a county contribution to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The Legislature added reference to deferred compensation to the predecessor of section 31460 and enacted section 53214 in 1972 as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>legislation which permitted counties to create a deferred compensation program. (Former \u00a7 18310, added by Stats. 1972, ch. 1370, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 10, 11, pp. 2734-2736.) Section 53214 makes it clear that the Legislature had in mind the computation of county employee pensions when reference to deferred compensation was added to section 31460 in 1972. It again had the subject in mind when reference to deferred compensation was added to section 31461 in 1993. Yet none of these sections provide that any funds added to a deferred compensation plan other than funds deducted from the employee\u2019s wages are to be considered in computing a pension. The references to deferred compensation in sections 31460 and 31461 make it clear that the deferred funds, which clearly would have been \u201ccompensation\u201d if paid in the normal course, do not lose that status for pension purposes even though they had not been received by the employee at the time the pension was calculated. The omission of any reference to county contributions to employees\u2019 deferred compensation plans compels a conclusion that the Legislature did not consider those contributions to be \u201ccompensation\u201d and did not intend to mandate inclusion of any county contribution to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan in the \u201ccompensation\u201d on which the employee\u2019s pension is computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">2. <em>Other cash payments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">When section 31460 was enacted in 1947, it provided: \u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 means the remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds . . . plus the monetary value ... of board, lodging, fuel, laundry, and other advantages furnished to a member in payment for his services.\u201d (Stats. 1947, ch. 424, \u00a7 1, p. 1264.) It appears from this that the Legislature considered the type of in-kind advantages identified in section 31460 to be \u201cremuneration\u201d if they were provided to an employee in payment or partial payment for the employee\u2019s services. Since both cash wages and the value of in-kind \u201cadvantages\u201d such as room, board, laundry and fuel were remuneration, both were to be included in \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of determining pension benefits. In 1951, however, section 31460 was amended to provide that the monetary value of those items and other advantages was not to be included in \u201ccompensation\u201d for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Plaintiffs argue that section 31460 now permits exclusion only of the monetary value of advantages furnished in kind and that the exclusion for the monetary value of in-kind advantages is not applicable to cash payments even when the payments are made in lieu of providing the advantages described in that section in kind. The county argues that the uniform allowance is not \u201ccompensation,\u201d relying on <em>Guelfi </em>for that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The parties in <em>Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 297, agreed that the Marin County uniform allowance in issue there was \u201cremuneration\u201d and the Court of Appeal impliedly agreed. The court held, however, that the uniform allowance was not \u201ccompensation.\u201d In so doing it relied on <em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d at page 943.  <em>Rose </em>construed former section 20022, a provision of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law (PERL) (\u00a7 20000 et seq.),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which at that time defined \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of that retirement system as \u201cremuneration paid in cash\u201d and, like the original version of section 31460, added \u201cplus the monetary value . . . of living quarters, board, lodging, fuel, laundry, and other advantages of any nature\u201d with the additional qualification \u201cfurnished [to] a member by his employer in payment for his services.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The <em>Rose </em>court did not attempt a comprehensive construction of \u201cother advantages\u201d as used in former section 20022, but reasoned that provision of a uniform or uniform allowance that substituted for clothing the employee would normally be expected to provide was among the other advantages that were to be included in compensation under the controlling PERL statute. The court rejected an argument that the uniform allowance was not compensation because the uniform was for the convenience of the employer. \u201cTo say that the uniform allowance benefits the employer . . . begs the question. The issue is whether or not the allowance provides an \u2018advantage\u2019 to the <em>employee. </em>While it is accurate to say that uniformity of attire provides a benefit to the employer in that it makes these civil servants readily identifiable to the public, it is at the same time accurate to say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the uniform allowance provides a benefit to the employee in that the uniform substitutes for personal attire which the employee would otherwise be forced to acquire with personal resources. Therefore, the uniform allowance must be included in the computation of pension benefits.\u201d <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d at p. 943, fn. omitted.) In distinguishing some work-related attire such as specially designed asbestos uniforms, which would not constitute \u201ccompensation,\u201d the court equated provision of work-related attire and cash in lieu of such attire for pension computation purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">CERL differs from the PERL legislation under consideration in that it excludes, rather than includes, the monetary value of an advantage provided in kind. It does not follow, however, that when the advantage is one received by the employee in cash, the section 31460 exclusion for the \u201cmonetary value\u201d of the advantage is applicable. Under the distinction the statute makes for in-kind advantages, even though a noncash \u201cadvantage\u201d may be \u201cremuneration\u201d for the employee\u2019s services, the Legislature has relieved CERL counties of the obligation to assign a cash value to in-kind advantages provided to employees and of including that amount in \u201ccompensation\u201d for pension purposes. The Legislature has recognized that some employees receive remuneration other than wages or salary but has concluded that if those \u201cadvantages\u201d are not paid in cash, their value need not be included in \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of computing a pension. It has not done so for cash payments made in lieu of providing the same advantages in kind. When paid in cash, the payment is remuneration and, as it is not excluded, it is \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Here, the Court of Appeal held, without analysis other than a citation to a portion of <em>Guelfi </em>which discusses section 31461 rather than section 31460, that annual leave redemption and the county\u2019s longevity incentive were \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460. We agree that both the longevity bonus and cashed-out accrued vacation are remuneration under section 31460 and, since neither is an excluded \u201cadvantage,\u201d both are \u201ccompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Plaintiffs concede that when annual leave is received as time off, it does not meet the statutory definitions of \u201ccompensation\u201d or \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d When annual leave is taken as time off, the employee simply continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services. Receipt of that pay is part of the employee\u2019s \u201cremuneration\u201d for past services and is \u201ccompensation.\u201d When an employee elects to receive cash in lieu of accrued vacation and the wages or salary the employee would receive during the vacation period, the cash, like the vacation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>pay the employee would otherwise receive, is part of the employee\u2019s \u201cremuneration\u201d for past services. The same analysis applies to the county\u2019s \u201clongevity incentive\u201d since that item simply grants additional vacation hours to be accrued or cashed out to those employees with five years or more service who are covered by the resolution. Payment to longtime employees, whether in salary for vacation days on which no work is performed or in additional cash, is equivalent to increased pay that often accompanies seniority. It, too, is \u201cremuneration\u201d and \u201ccompensation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The other items plaintiffs claim should be recognized as \u201ccompensation\u201d also are so closely related to services performed by employees that they must be considered remuneration for services. Bilingual premium pay is available only to employees in positions requiring bilingual skills. The amount of the pay is based in part on the number of hours in which the employee fills the position and in part on the level of the employee\u2019s ability to use the second language. Thus, the premium is paid for services in which these skills are used by the employee. For similar reasons, pay for acting as a field training officer and for motorcycle duty appears to be remuneration for services, as are overtime pay, holiday pay, and specified payments in lieu thereof. \u201cEducational incentive pay\u201d is remuneration for services presumably performed at the higher level of competence expected or required of employees holding POST or pilot certification. These methods of paying employees for services that are expected to be performed with special skills or at a higher level of competence cannot be distinguished for this purpose from classification schemes which create separate job categories or levels within employment categories to reflect special skills required or additional duties performed by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\"><em>Guelfi, supra, </em>on whose reasoning the Court of Appeal also relied in concluding that educational incentive pay is \u201ccompensation,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> held that Marin County educational incentive pay, similar to that allowed by Ventura County, was not an excluded \u201cadvantage\u201d and is \u201cremuneration\u201d that is to be included in \u201ccompensation.\u201d (145 Cal.App.3d at p. 304.) The <em>Guelfi </em>court reasoned that the education and training which qualified the employee for the pay was for the benefit of the employer, and recognized that the amount of pay and the extent of education and training varied with the employee\u2019s certification. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As the foregoing discussion reflects, we agree. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>items are remuneration for special skills or qualifications. The remuneration is paid in cash. It is, therefore, compensation within the meaning of section 31460.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">B. <em>\u201cCompensation earnable\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The principal dispute between the parties is over the meaning of \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d as that term is used in section 31461. The meaning of the term is crucial to the outcome of this case because, as noted earlier, the \u201cfinal compensation\u201d upon which an employee\u2019s pension is based is his or her \u201caverage annual compensation earnable\u201d over the applicable three-year (\u00a7 31462) or one-year (\u00a7 31462.1) period.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Pursuant to section 31461 the county determines a retiring employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d for the selected period \u201cupon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay. The computation for any absence shall be based on the compensation of the position held by the member at the beginning of the absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The county argues that under this formula only that pay which is received by all employees in the grade or class in which the retiring employee worked must be considered and that neither overtime nor any premiums paid for special skills or certification need be included in determining \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d It relies on <em>Guelfi </em>where the Court of Appeal held that overtime, educational incentive pay, and a uniform allowance were excludable in computing \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d The <em>Guelfi </em>court first reasoned that section 31461 would have been unnecessary if all items of \u201ccompensation\u201d received by a retiring employee not specifically excludable under section 31460 were to be included in \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d Therefore, section 31461 contemplated something more than a calculation of the retiring employee\u2019s average pay during the selected year. It was necessarily a narrowing definition. <em>(Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 304-305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The <em>Guelfi, supra, </em>court then considered educational incentive pay, and held that, because section 31461 defines \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d as a figure \u201cbased on the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in \u2018the <em>same grade or class of positions </em>. . . , and at the <em>same rate of </em>pay,\u2019 \u201d educational incentive pay was not includable. (145 Cal.App.3d at p. 305.) Not all persons in the same grade or class of positions qualified for educational incentive pay and those who did qualify might not hold the same certificates. Employees who were in similarly graded or classified positions were not compensated at the same rate of pay. Therefore, \u201csection 31461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>does not contemplate inclusion of such compensation in its definition of \u2018compensation eamable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>CERL created a \u201cfixed\u201d rather than a \u201cfluctuating\u201d retirement plan. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As to overtime pay, \u201c[t]wo obstacles in the definition prevent an interpretation which would include overtime pay. First, the Board must make its determination upon the basis of the number of \u2018days\u2019 ordinarily worked. The choice of the word \u2018days\u2019 rather than \u2018hours\u2019 or some other temporal measure suggests reference to a standard work week (or month) and not to any extra hours put in as overtime. Appellants themselves view that language as clearly indicating an intent that the Board use the <em>day </em>as a unit of measure. Second, the Board is to base its determination on the number of days \u2018ordinarily\u2019 worked by others of the same rank. In common usage, \u2018ordinarily\u2019 means \u2018in the ordinary course of events\u2019 or \u2018usually.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1965) p. 1589.) <em>Omission </em>of the word \u2018ordinarily\u2019 might suggest calculation based upon the <em>actual </em>number of days worked by others (assuming for the sake of argument that whole days of overtime are worked), and even then, the basis would be the number of days worked by <em>others, </em>not the number of days personally worked by the retired or retiring member. However, the word is specifically inserted and must be read as qualifying the phrase which it precedes so as to give it meaning. We therefore conclude . . . that overtime pay is not \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 and thus is not to be included in computing appellant\u2019s \u2018final compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 306-307, original italics.) The same reasoning led the court to conclude that uniform allowances and educational incentive pay were excluded from \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>Guelfi </em>thus held that an item of compensation must be received by all employees in the applicable grade or class of position if it is to be part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d The Court of Appeal here relied on <em>Guelfi, </em>holding that because \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d means the \u201caverage ordinary pay of workers in a class; not the actual pay of any individual,\u201d none of the items sought to be included by plaintiffs (except contribution of matching funds to a deferred compensation plan) qualified. Were these incentives and premiums included in the computation, the average pay for all workers in the class would be unjustifiably increased. While plaintiffs accept the <em>Guelfi </em>construction of section 31461 insofar as it applies to overtime pay, they argue that the exclusion of the premiums in dispute here from \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d is not supported by the statutory language or the legislative history of section 31461. They contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Court of Appeal in this case erred in directing that the <em>Guelfi </em>formulation of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d be applied to those items in the computation of their pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As noted earlier, section 31461 defines \u201c[c]ompensation eamable\u201d as \u201cthe average compensation as determined by the board, for the period under consideration upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay.\u201d The purpose of this definition, plaintiffs argue, is simply to ensure that overtime is omitted from the calculation and to ensure that if an absence resulted in an employee working fewer days than those ordinarily worked by comparable employees, the employee would nonetheless be deemed to have been compensated for the difference at the same rate attached to the position at the time the absence commenced. Nothing in the wording of section 31461 requires that the amount of pay included in \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d be only that received by all employees in the same job category. The reference to persons \u201cat the same rate of pay\u201d simply identifies the category of employees who must be considered in determining the average number of days ordinarily worked and provides the reference for determining the compensation to be considered for a period of absence. If, as the Court of Appeal and the <em>Guelfi </em>court held, only those items of \u201ccompensation\u201d received uniformly by all persons in the pay grade are to be included, there would be no need to find the \u201caverage\u201d compensation of persons in that pay grade. The Court of Appeal formulation, they argue, renders the term \u201caverage\u201d surplusage. The only construction which gives meaning to the command that \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d be based on the \u201caverage compensation\u201d of persons in the pay grade is one which anticipates that the individual compensation of persons in the pay grade- is not uniform so that there is something to \u201caverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In plaintiffs\u2019 view, section 31461 in directing that \u201caverage compensation for the period under consideration\u201d be calculated \u201cupon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period and at the same rate of pay\u201d does no more than ensure that a retiring employee\u2019s average compensation be determined in relation to what the employee would have earned if he worked the average number of days ordinarily worked by employees in the same grade or class and at the same rate of pay. This is consistent with the penultimate sentence of section 31461 which provides that \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d for any period of absence is to be based on \u201cthe compensation of the position held\u201d at the beginning of the absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Plaintiffs also argue that the history of section 31461 supports their construction. They rely on the wording of the predecessor to section 31461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>in the 1937 version of CERL and legislative history which indicates that while the present wording of section 31461 differs from that found in CERL when enacted in 1937, the rewording of the provision was not intended to make any substantive change. First they note that section 31461, adopted in 1947 (Stats. 1947, ch. 424, \u00a7 1, p. 1264),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is simply a codification of the 1937 law. (Stats. 1937, ch. 677, \u00a7 1, p. 1898.) The 1947 statute was enacted as part of Senate Bill No. 1117 (1947 Reg. Sess.) which codified and consolidated laws related to counties. A Legislative Counsel\u2019s report on Senate Bill No. 1117 advised that the bill \u201cmakes no substantive changes in existing law, but rearranges and restates in simplified language the substance of existing laws, and repeals obsolete and superseded statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Section 8.5 of article 1 of CERL in 1937, the predecessor to section 31461, provided: \u201c \u2018Compensation eamable\u2019 <em>by a member </em>shall mean the compensation as determined by the retirement board which would have been earned <em>by the member </em>had he worked throughout the period under consideration, the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions as the positions held by him during such period, and at the rates of compensation attached to such positions, it being assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that during any absence he was in the position held by him at the beginning of such absence.\u201d (Stats. 1937, ch. 677, \u00a7 8.5, pp. 1898-1899, italics added.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Assuming that, as plaintiffs contend, section 31461 is nothing more than a restatement of section 8.5 of the 1937 version of CERL, section 8.5 supports plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction of section 31461, as do other statutes which predate CERL and used the term \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in creating state employee pensions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The term is found in the act which established a retirement system for state employees in 1931. (Stats. 1931, ch. 700, \u00a7 1, p. 1442.) Section 13 of that act provided: \u201c\u2018Compensation eamable\u2019 by a member shall mean the average compensation as determined by the board upon the basis of the average period of employment of members in the same class of employment and at the same rate of pay, but such \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 shall not exceed four hundred sixteen dollars and sixty-six cents per month.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The term was used again in 1935 when the 1931 act was amended to provide for retirement of California Highway Patrol Officers. (Stats. 1935, ch. 850, \u00a7 3, p. 2277.) Section 13 of the 1931 act was then amended to read: \u201c \u2018Compensation eamable\u2019 by a member shall mean the average monthly compensation as determined by the board upon the basis of the average time put in by members in the same group or class of employment and at the same rate of pay, it being assumed that during any absence said member was in the position held by him at the beginning of the absence and that prior to entering State service he was in the position first held by him in such service, but such \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 shall not exceed four hundred sixteen dollars and sixty-six cents per month.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The definition was repeated in substantially the same terms in the 1945 legislation which codified the state retirement system, now the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). (\u00a7 20000 et seq., added by Stats. 1945, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ch. 123, \u00a7 1, p. 573 et seq.) As enacted in 1945, section 20023 defined \u201c \u2018Compensation eamable\u2019 by a member\u201d as \u201cthe average monthly compensation as determined by the board upon the basis of the average time put in by members in the same group or class of employment and at the same rate of pay. The computation for any absence of a member shall be based on the compensation of the position held by him at the beginning of the absence and that for time prior to entering State service shall be based on the compensation of the position first held by him in such service.\u201d (Stats. 1945, ch. 123, \u00a7 1, p. 575.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Legislature is presumed to be aware of other statutes on the same or analogous subject matter in which the same language is used. Since we have no reason to think that the Legislature intended that the same specifically defined term take on a different meaning in computing the pension of a county employee, the construction of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d should be consistent under CERL, the 1931 State Employee Retirement Act, and PERL, which is the successor to the 1931 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Each of these definitions suggests that \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d is the average pay of the individual retiring employee computed on the basis of the number of hours worked by other employees in the same class and pay rate\u2014that is the average monthly pay, excluding overtime, received by the retiring employee for the average number of days worked in a month by the other employees in the same job classification at the same base pay level.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The above version of section 20023\u2014the PERL definition of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d\u2014was repealed in 1993 and replaced with a new section 20023 that expressly included \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d and made it clear that the individual employee\u2019s pay is the basis for computing the employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d (\u00a7 20023 as enacted by Stats. 1993, ch. 1297, \u00a7 6.) Moreover, the items plaintiffs seek to have included in their \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d appear to be the type of \u201cspecial compensation\u201d items which are included in the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d of PERS members. (\u00a7 20636.)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest of Senate Bill No. 53 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.), which contained former section 20023, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>notes that bill recasts and redefines \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d but does not indicate that the inclusion of \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in the definition adds anything that was not included under the prior legislation or results in higher \u201cfinal compensation\u201d or increased pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We agree with plaintiffs therefore that both the language and the history of section 31461 support a conclusion that the premiums in dispute are \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d within the meaning of that section and must be included when their pensions are calculated. To the extent that <em>Guelfi </em>is inconsistent with this conclusion, it is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The county does not address plaintiff\u2019s legislative history argument and does not acknowledge the definition of the term \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in PERL or its predecessor. It claims only that <em>Guelfi </em>properly construed sections 31460 and 31461; that the Legislature has acquiesced in this construction; and that the doctrine of stare decisis teaches that this longstanding construction should be respected by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The county\u2019s legislative acquiescence argument is based on what it claims are almost 100 amendments to various provisions of CERL between 1984 and 1995, 11 of which occurred in the year immediately following <em>Guelfi. </em>None of those amendments made any change in the language construed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi, </em>however.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The county also relies on the principle of statutory construction teaching that \u201c[t]he failure of the Legislature to change the law in a particular respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>when the subject is generally before it and changes in other respects are made is indicative of an intent to leave the law as it stands in the aspects not amended.\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 345, 355 [289 P.2d 450, 54 A.L.R.2d 1137]; see also <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970, 977, fn. 10 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394]; <em>Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 837-838 [122 Cal.Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874].) This principle assumes legislative knowledge of judicial construction of the law. (See <em>Fontana Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Burman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 208, 219 [246 Cal.Rptr. 733, 753 P.2d 689]; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rush, supra, </em>at pp. 355-356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">It is not clear, however, that the general subject of county employee pensions was before the Legislature when any of the amendments to which the county refers was enacted. Instead, the amendments appear to address discrete aspects of the law or to have a general but nonsubstantive effect, such as gender-neutral wording. The county identifies none which suggests that the subject of pension computation generally was before the Legislature when one or more of the amendments was enacted. \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[Something more than mere silence is required before [legislative] acquiescence is elevated into a species of implied legislation.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ornelas </em>v. <em>Randolph </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1108 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 847 P.2d 560].) That being so, we cannot infer that the Legislature had section 31461 and <em>Guelfi </em>in mind when those amendments were adopted and intended by inaction to acquiesce in the <em>Guelfi </em>construction of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Two of the amendments did affect section 31461. The 1995 amendment (Stats. 1995, ch. 558, \u00a7 1) added the last sentence ensuring that deferred compensation would be included in \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in the year earned. That sentence had been part of a subdivision added to section 31461 in 1993 (Stats. 1993, ch. 396, \u00a7 3) which was applicable only to Los Angeles County and was repealed in the 1995 amendment. Again, however, we cannot assume that, in enacting a measure regarding the time at which deferred compensation is earned for pension purposes, the Legislature had the general subject of pension computation or specifically the <em>Guelfi </em>definition of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The stare decisis argument is also unpersuasive.  Stare decisis is, as we have recognized, \u201ca fundamental jurispmdential policy that prior applicable precedent [of an appellate court] usually must be followed [by that court] even though the case, if considered anew, might be decided differently by the current justices.\u201d <em>(Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 296 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58].)  <em>Guelfi </em>is not prior precedent of this court, however. The issue is one of first impression in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Finally, the county asserts that the 20 CERL counties whose actuarial calculations, and thus whose contributions to the retirement system, are based on the <em>Guelfi </em>construction of section 31461 would face practical problems if we depart from <em>Guelfi. </em>It claims that absent the certainty afforded by the <em>Guelfi </em>formulation, counties cannot perform their statutory obligations to adequately fund their retirement systems. <em>Guelfi, </em>they argue, has clarified any ambiguities in the statutory language in holding that compensation which is not paid uniformly to all persons in the same grade or class is not \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d No other county is before us in this matter, however, and we need not decide whether this decision applies retroactively to any other county.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">There may be unanticipated costs to Ventura County if the pensions of the individual plaintiffs and the employees the association represents must be recalculated and adjusted upward. If so, to comply with the financial provisions of CERL (\u00a7 31580 et seq.) and accommodate future increases, the county may have to make a supplemental appropriation and adjust the future annual appropriation for its contribution to the pension fund to cover the increase in future retiree pensions that results from inclusion of additional items of \u201ccompensation\u201d in \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d Past experience should enable the county to anticipate the number of employees who will receive premium pay, however, and adjustments of this nature are contemplated by CERL. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31453, 31454.) Nothing in this record suggests that the burden on the county fisc justifies either perpetuation of an erroneous construction of the applicable statutes or denying these plaintiffs the benefit of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed with directions to order the superior court to grant the petition for mandamus and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">George, C. J., Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The petition of all respondents for a rehearing was denied October 1, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Employees assigned to positions requiring the use of bilingual skills were to be compensated by a premium in addition to their base pay at rates initially set at 50 cents per hour and then in ranges of 65 cents, 80 cents, or 90 cents per hour based on their level of proficiency, not to exceed 80 hours per pay period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">A total annual uniform maintenance allowance of $675 was to be paid in the first pay period of each November.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Educational incentive pay was given to employees possessing an intermediate or advanced Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) certificate who had five years of law enforcement experience in a POST-accredited California law enforcement agency and met other criteria. The additional pay ranged from $77.74 to $172.71 biweekly, depending on the level of certification, the employee classification, and the time period. Employees classified as \u201csheriff\u2019s pilot\u201d who met experience, pilot certification, and salary criteria were also entitled to educational incentive pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Deputy sheriffs and senior deputy sheriffs assigned to patrol divisions, pilots, and crew chiefs, were to receive $60 biweekly in lieu of overtime for meal periods during which they were subject to call. The county has agreed that this item is furnished uniformly to all employees classified as sheriff\u2019s pilots and therefore \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d It is no longer in dispute as to those employees. As a result of this concession, this pay is included for purposes of computing the pension of an employee who served as a sheriff\u2019s pilot during the applicable period, but the identical amount is not included in computing the pension of a deputy sheriff, senior deputy sheriff, or sergeant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">After using a specified minimum days of annual leave, an employee could elect to receive pay in lieu of up to 40 hours of annual leave accrual and on accruing 400 hours could elect to be paid for another 40 hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Employees on a four-day-on, two-day-off schedule were to receive cash payments equal to the value of 50 percent of the number of hours normally worked on a regular day for an assigned holiday that fell on a regularly scheduled workday. When other employees worked on a holiday falling on a regularly scheduled workday, they were to receive a cash payment of pay for one and one-half times the number of hours actually worked on the holiday in addition to payment for the number of hours normally worked by the employee on a regularly scheduled workday. Provision also was made for cash payment when an assigned holiday fell on a regularly scheduled day off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b530-15\">The motorcycle bonus was $20 per pay period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b530-16\">Deputy sheriffs in class No. 00550 designated as field training officers were to receive $8 per shift when a trainee or deputy was assigned to them and they actually performed training-related duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\">This annual uniform maintenance allowance was $520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Employees in this category with five years of county service were entitled to a lump sum annual leave credit for eight hours per year for each year of service, not to exceed one hundred four hours. The credits could be accrued as annual leave or taken in the form of additional compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The annual leave redemption differed in the number of hours that had to be used and in the amount that could be redeemed, but like that of employees subject to the memorandum of agreement, was elective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">For these employees the county agreed to match employee contributions to a deferred compensation plan in percentages ranging from a 100 percent match when an employee deferred 1 percent of salary to a 50 percent match when the employee deferred 6 percent or more of salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">Since the question arose on petition for writ of mandate which the trial court had denied, we deem this to have been an order reversing the superior court judgment and directing that court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the board to include the county contributions to those plaintiffs\u2019 deferred compensation plan in its calculation of their pensions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Because the court found the language of section 31461 clear and unambiguous, it was not necessary to consider statutes that are part of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law and the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Law (former \u00a7 20025.2 (now \u00a7 20635); Ed.

(Evid. Code, \u00a7 459.) Plaintiffs requested that the Court of Appeal take judicial notice of various items of legislative history, including this document, but it is not clear from the record whether that court did so. The Court of Appeal opinion recites that consideration of the materials is unnecessary as the statutes under review are unambiguous, but the opinion does not indicate whether the request for judicial notice was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">Arguably the Court of Appeal was required to take judicial notice of all of the items encompassed by plaintiffs\u2019 request other than a publication of the county supervisors association as all of the other items are copies of documents which reflect \u201cofficial acts of the legislative [and] executive . . . departments\u201d of this state. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452.) Plaintiffs\u2019 request complied with Evidence Code section 453. This court is therefore required to take judicial notice of the items. It does not follow, however, that all are relevant and must be considered by the court. A memorandum from a staff member of the Attorney General to the Governor does not appear to be relevant in ascertaining the legislative intent underlying section <em>31461 </em>inasmuch as <em>there is no </em>indication that the views of the author regarding the purpose and content of Senate Bill No. 1117 were before the Legislature at the time the bill was enacted and therefore may be deemed to reflect legislative intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> Section 8 of CERL then defined \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds controlled by the board of supervisors, plus the monetary value, as determined by the board of retirement, of board, lodging, fuel, laundry and other advantages of any nature furnished to a member in payment for his services.\u201d (Stats. 1937, ch. 677, \u00a7 8, p. 1898.)</p>\n<p id=\"ATk\">Section 9 defined \u201cfinal compensation\u201d as \u201cthe average annual compensation eamable by a member during the three years immediately preceding his retirement.\u201d (Stats. 1937, ch. 677, \u00a79, p. 1899.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The term \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d is used in some 80 pension-related code sections, primarily in the Government Code and Education Code.
