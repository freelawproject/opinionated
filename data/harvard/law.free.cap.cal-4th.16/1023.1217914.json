We granted review to determine whether hands or feet can constitute \u201cdeadly weapons\u201d within the meaning of the statute. That hands and feet may be capable of inflicting deadly force, as by means of karate kicks or prizefighter blows, is not in question. We conclude, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>that the term \u201cweapon,\u201d as used in the statute, implies an object extrinsic to the body. Contrary to the Court of Appeal, we further conclude the jury was not asked to find defendant Raymond Aguilar guilty under an erroneous legal theory; hence, reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction (under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45]) was improper. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeal for consideration of defendant\u2019s other appellate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">During the evening of July 19, 1993, defendant, his codefendant Richard Perez and two companions, Bobby Nieblas and Edward Prado, had been drinking beer and were driving around Gilroy. Earlier that evening, while the group was at a Taco Bell restaurant, Nieblas was involved in a verbal altercation with a person on rollerblades. Later, as the four were driving around, Nieblas spotted the victim, Donald Tenny, Jr., who was rollerblading. Nieblas asked Perez, who was driving, to stop the car so he could see if Tenny was the same person who had \u201chassled\u201d him at the Taco Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Despite Tenny\u2019s efforts to communicate that he was not the person for whom the group was looking, a fight ensued. Tenny was repeatedly kicked \u201clike [a] football\u201d and suffered, as well, a few blows from the hands of his assailants. Exactly who did what during the assault was disputed at trial. Perez demanded Tenny\u2019s watch and billfold; when Tenny said he had no billfold, Perez stated, \u201cYou will die for that.\" Tenny estimated the fight lasted from one to fourteen minutes, at which point the assailants got into their car and left. Tenny then noticed his watch was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Having received a report of a fight, police stopped Perez\u2019s car a short distance away; after receiving a further report the incident might also have involved robbery of Tenny\u2019s watch, an officer visually inspecting the interior of Perez\u2019s car found the watch on the floorboard in front of defendant. Brought to the scene, Tenny identified the suspect vehicle and its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Tenny suffered multiple bruises, a concussion, a broken left thumb, a wound to the back of his head requiring stitches and an injury to his ankle requiring a cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">The jury found both defendant and Perez guilty of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1).) The jury also found Perez guilty, but defendant not guilty, of robbery (\u00a7 211) and found true as to Perez, but not true as to defendant, great bodily injury enhancement allegations. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, 1203, subd. (e)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>On appeal, in reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 1116, the Court of Appeal reversed defendant Aguilar\u2019s conviction, reasoning the prosecutor had relied on a legally incorrect theory in suggesting, during closing argument, that hands and feet may be deadly weapons within the meaning of section 245, subdivision (a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Section 245, subdivision (a)(1), punishes assaults committed by the following means: \u201cwith a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm,\u201d or by \u201cany means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d One may commit an assault without making actual physical contact with the person of the victim; because the statute focuses on <em>use </em>of a deadly weapon or instrument or, alternatively, on force <em>likely </em>to produce great bodily injury, whether the victim in fact suffers any harm is immaterial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169, 176 [121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001].)  That the use of hands or fists alone may support a conviction of assault \u201cby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d is well established <em>(ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1066 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 839]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Duke </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 296, 302-303 [219 Cal.Rptr. 873] [ when hands, fists and feet are employed in an assault, normally the charge will be assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury]; 1 Witkin <em>&amp; </em>Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crimes Against the Person, \u00a7 420, p. 482), but this court has never previously decided whether, under section 245, subdivision (a)(1), the use of hands or feet alone may suffice for conviction of assault with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">As used in section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is \u201cany object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury.\u201d <em>(In re Jose R. </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 269, 275-276 [186 Cal.Rptr. 898].) Some few objects, such as dirks and blackjacks, have been held to be deadly weapons as a matter of law; the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 327 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 20, 32 [120 Cal.Rptr. 377, 533 P.2d 1017].) Other objects, while not deadly per se, may be used, under certain circumstances, in a manner likely to produce death or great bodily injury. In determining whether an object not inherently deadly or dangerous is used as such, the trier of fact may consider the nature of the object, the manner in which it is used, and all other facts relevant to the issue. <em>(In re Jose R., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at p. 276; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Nealis </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 4, fn. 2 [283 Cal.Rptr. 376] [citing California decisions holding various objects, not deadly per se, to be deadly weapons under the particular circumstances].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">In the present case, the prosecutor asserted in the course of his closing argument that hands and feet may be deadly weapons. (We will more fully address the context of the statement below.) We are asked to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s comment was an accurate statement of the law within the meaning of section 245, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">As the Court of Appeal recognized, to answer this question we must look to the language of the statute and accord its words their usual, ordinary and commonsense meaning based on the language used and the evident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>purpose for which the statute was adopted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 597 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999].) The words of the statute must be construed in their context. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 599.) We also generally avoid a reading that renders any part of a statute superfluous. <em>(Quintano </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1058-1059 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 906 P.2d 1057].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The Court of Appeal concluded the ordinary understanding of the phrase \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument\u201d does not encompass hands or feet per se, but rather includes only objects extrinsic to the body. The Court of Appeal also reasoned that to define \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument\u201d to include feet and hands would make redundant the clause \u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d This is so because deadly weapons or instruments not inherently deadly are defined by their use in a manner capable of producing great bodily injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 464, 465 [28 Cal.Rptr. 67].) According to the Court of Appeal, \u201cif hands and feet can constitute deadly weapons, then it would appear that anything\u2014inanimate or animate object or body parts such as hands, feet or teeth\u2014could, in appropriate circumstances, be considered a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d If this were the case, the court noted, the \u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d clause would be unnecessary. The Court of Appeal inferred from the inclusion of both clauses in section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a legislative intent that a meaningful difference exist between the two clauses, an intent furthered by the court\u2019s reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s inference appears sound, particularly in light of the history of section 245. When first enacted in 1872, section 245 read as follows: \u201cEvery person who, with intent to do bodily harm, and without just cause or excuse, or when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances show an abandoned and malignant heart, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon, instrument, or other thing, is punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison not exceeding two years, or by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by both.\u201d (1872 Pen. Code, \u00a7 245.) Section 245 was amended two years later, in 1874; as relevant here, the amendments eliminated the intent and lack-of-provocation elements and added the \u201cforce likely\u201d clause as an alternative to the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d clause. (Code Amends. 1873-1874 (Pen. Code) ch. 614, \u00a7 22, p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Presumably in amending the statute the Legislature and the Code Commissioners, who drafted the amendment, were aware of this court\u2019s intervening opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Murat </em>(1873) 45 Cal. 281. In that case, we reversed a conviction of assault with intent to murder because the indictment failed to allege the use of a deadly weapon. We said: \u201cIn fact no case in this Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>been brought to our attention where the prisoner had been convicted of an assault made with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict upon the person of another a bodily injury in which there had been a failure altogether to allege the assault to have been made with a deadly weapon; <em>indeed, the fact that a deadly weapon was resorted to by the prisoner is made by the statute itself an indispensable characteristic of such an assault, and one which distinguishes it from all </em>others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 283, italics added; see also 1 Wharton, A Treatise on Criminal Law (9th ed. 1885) \u00a7 645d, pp. 586-588 [\u201cThe gravamen of the offense [of assault with a deadly weapon] is the use of a dangerous weapon with intent to hurt.\u201d].) The italicized language thus supports the view the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d language of section 245, as originally enacted, did not encompass assaults accomplished by mere use of physical force without a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">As noted, within one year of this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Murat, supra, </em>45 Cal. 281, the Legislature amended section 245 to add the \u201cforce likely\u201d clause as an alternative to the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d clause; only after that amendment do we find a decision of this court apparently recognizing that an aggravated assault within the meaning of section 245 may be committed without the use of a weapon or other extrinsic object. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Emmons </em>(1882) 61 Cal. 487, 488 [reversing trial court judgment sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to indictment that alleged violation of section 245 in that defendant, with force and violence, threw victim from third story window].) This sequence of events is consistent with the inference that addition to section 245 of the \u201cforce likely\u201d clause was necessary in order to punish as aggravated assaults those assaults not involving the use of a weapon extrinsic to the assailant\u2019s body and that the term \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d as used in section 245, thus was not intended to encompass bare hands or feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The Court of Appeal also found support for its conclusion in several decisions interpreting the term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in related contexts. <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 806 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 890] <em>(Davis) </em>addressed whether, for purposes of the prior serious felony enhancement provided in sections 667, subdivision (a)(1), and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23), a defendant\u2019s prior conviction under section 245, subdivision (a)(1), involved the personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. In the defendant\u2019s prior case he had pleaded guilty to an information alleging assault \u201c \u2018with a deadly weapon ... to wit, Hands, and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 812.) The <em>Davis </em>court concluded an assault with hands does not show the personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon required for a serious felony because the weapon must be an object or weapon extrinsic to the human body. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 814.) The court observed, however, that \u201cwhether [defendant] can commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>public offense of assault with a deadly weapon with his hands presents an interesting issue of first impression, but one this court does not have to reach.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 815.) As the Court of Appeal in the present case noted, <em>Davis </em>reasoned that distinguishing between assaults with a deadly weapon or instrument and assaults by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is generally unnecessary, \u201csince all aggravated assaults are ultimately determined based on the force likely to be applied against a person.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 814-815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dozie </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 474, 477 [36 Cal.Rptr. 728] <em>(Dozie), </em>the Court of Appeal concluded a defendant\u2019s fist could not constitute a dangerous or deadly weapon for purposes of the first degree robbery statute, former section 211a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although <em>Dozie </em>distinguished the armed robbery statute from section 245 on the basis of the two statutes\u2019 differing purposes, the Court of Appeal nevertheless found <em>Dozie </em>supportive of its conclusion. In the words of the <em>Dozie </em>court, \u201cThere are many decisions holding that use of the hands or fists will support an assault conviction under Penal Code section 245. All such decisions turn on the fact that hands or fists may be used with sufficient force to create bodily injury, not that they fall into the class of deadly weapons or instruments.\u201d <em>(Dozie, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.2d at p. 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The Attorney General contends the Court of Appeal erred in considering the term \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument\u201d as a whole; he submits, rather, that the phrase \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d must be read disjunctively from the phrase \u201cinstrument other than a firearm.\u201d As the Attorney General reads section 245, subdivision (a)(1), the word \u201cdeadly\u201d modifies both \u201cweapon\u201d and \u201cinstrument other than a firearm.\u201d Thus, he reasons, section 245, subdivision (a)(1), prohibits three different acts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon; (2) assault with a deadly instrument other than a firearm; and (3) assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. According to the Attorney General, the phrase \u201cdeadly instrument other than a firearm,\u201d but not the phrase \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d connotes an object extrinsic to the body. In support of this interpretation, the Attorney General cites the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Webster\u2019s Dictionary,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and several uses of the term \u201cweapon\u201d in world literature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. If the term \u201cweapon\u201d can mean a part of the human body, no reason appears why the same could not be said of the term \u201cinstrument,\u201d which is simply \u201ca means by which something is done.\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 666.) Moreover, as defendant notes, if \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is separated from \u201cother than a firearm,\u201d then the weapon clause of section 245, subdivision (a)(1), would include assault with a firearm and thus render subdivision (a)(2) of section 245 a redundancy, a result we strive to avoid under recognized canons of construction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Quintano </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1058-1059.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The Attorney General also criticizes the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the clause \u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d would be redundant if hands or feet were held to constitute deadly weapons. The \u201cforce\u201d clause would be redundant to the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d or \u201cdeadly . . . instrument other than a firearm\u201d language, the Attorney General contends, only if the \u201cforce\u201d clause spoke in terms of \u201cforce likely to produce death.\u201d But, as the Attorney General notes, the clause instead punishes assault by means of \u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d Therefore, according to the Attorney General, the apparent rationale for the inclusion of the \u201cforce\u201d clause is that it \u201cserves to additionally punish individuals who use less than deadly force, but nonetheless use force which is likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d This argument, however, overlooks that a \u201cdeadly\u201d weapon is one that is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing death <em>or great bodily injury. (In re Jose R., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at pp. 275-276; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Brookins </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1297, 1305-1306 [264 Cal.Rptr. 240]; see also CALJIC No. 9.02.) Both the \u201cweapon or instrument\u201d clause of the statute and the \u201cforce likely\u201d clause look to the probability or capability of producing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Reading the statute as a whole in a commonsense manner that avoids rendering any part superfluous <em>(Quintano </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1058-1059) and considering its history, we conclude a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of section 245 must be an object extrinsic to the human body. Bare hands or feet, therefore, cannot be deadly weapons; to the extent the prosecutor\u2019s argument suggested the contrary, it was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Despite this error in the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the Attorney General contends reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction was unnecessary. First, he maintains reversal was unwarranted because the evidence overwhelmingly showed that defendant used force likely to produce great bodily injury or that he aided and abetted Perez in so doing.  As the Attorney General observes, when the prosecution presents the jury with alternative factual scenarios on the basis of which it may convict a defendant, but the evidence is insufficient to support one of those scenarios, the error is not reversible (absent an indication in the record that the verdict actually did rest on the inadequate ground). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1129.) If, however, an erroneous <em>instruction </em>would permit the jury to convict based on the factually insufficient scenario, a reviewing court will reverse the conviction unless, from the jury\u2019s findings, it can determine beyond a reasonable doubt the jury did not in fact rely on the erroneous instruction and factually deficient scenario. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 416-419 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 886 P.2d 1193].)  In the instant case, the Attorney General argues, any error in the prosecutor\u2019s statement was harmless because the evidence was overwhelming that, in assaulting the victim, defendant used force likely to produce great bodily injury and that he aided and abetted Perez and Nieblas as they assaulted the victim. The Attorney General\u2019s reasoning, however, fails to meet directly defendant\u2019s argument, which is that the prosecutor\u2019s statement hands or feet may constitute deadly weapons arguably invited the jury to rely on that erroneous proposition without regard to the force used, and the jury\u2019s findings do not reveal the theory underlying the assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Second, the Attorney General argues that the jury could properly consider the deadly weapon theory of assault because shoes are extrinsic to the human body and are instruments capable of inflicting death or great bodily injury, and the record shows defendant and his coparticipants were wearing shoes at the time of the offense. The brunt of the assault, according to the victim, consisted of kicks; the assailants administered only a \u201cvery few\u201d blows with fists. Therefore, according to the Attorney General, whether defendant\u2019s shoes constituted a deadly weapon was for the jury to decide. Viewing the evidence in light of the instructions given by the trial court, the Attorney General argues, the jury thus was not asked to find guilt under an erroneous theory, and its verdict should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>The Attorney General\u2019s contention has some force. There can be no doubt that some footwear, such as hobnailed or steel-toed boots, is capable of being wielded in a way likely to produce death or serious injury, and as such may constitute weapons within the meaning of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). While evidence is lacking regarding the type of footwear worn by the four assailants, that they <em>were </em>shod is not disputed. This fact, together with evidence concerning the circumstances of the assault, thus provides some evidence from which the jury could find the assailants wielded their shod feet in a manner capable of producing, and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury. Nevertheless, in arguing \u201cfeet\u201d could be deadly weapons, the prosecutor did not expressly advance the theory the Attorney General now articulates; to uphold the verdict on this basis, therefore, would be to supply a link in the chain of reasoning we cannot be sure the jury considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">To resolve this case we need not, however, rely on the proposition the jury properly could have convicted defendant of aggravated assault on the theory he used his shoes as deadly weapons. The judgment of guilt is supportable for another reason the Attorney General cites: Ultimately (except in those cases involving an inherently dangerous weapon), the jury\u2019s decisionmaking process in an aggravated assault case under section 245, subdivision (a)(1), is functionally identical regardless of whether, in the particular case, the defendant employed a weapon alleged to be deadly as used or employed force likely to produce great bodily injury; in either instance, the decision turns on the nature of the force used. As the Court of Appeal reasoned in <em>Davis, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 806, \u201c[A]ll aggravated assaults are ultimately determined based on the force likely to be applied against a person.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 814-815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Given the availability, under current sentencing law, of enhancements affording severe punishment for assaults that result in serious injury or are committed on especially vulnerable victims, even when no firearm or other weapon is employed (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, subds. (a) [personal infliction of bodily injury], (b) [attack producing coma or paralysis], (c) [victim age 70 or older], (d) [injury involving domestic violence], 12022.8 [injury occurring during commission of sexual offenses], 12022.9 [intentional injury producing termination of pregnancy], 12022.95 [causing or permitting unjustifiable pain or injury that results in death of a child]; see also \u00a7\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8) [personal infliction of great bodily injury renders felony \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of recidivist sentencing scheme], 667.5, subd. (c)(8) [personal infliction of great bodily injury renders felony \u201cviolent\u201d for purposes of recidivist sentencing scheme]), the independent significance of the use of hands or feet as the means of injury has diminished as a practical matter. Nevertheless, we are confident that in tailoring their arguments to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>prosecutors henceforth will use correct nomenclature and no more label a fist a deadly weapon than call a foot a firearm. (See \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">That the jury here was not, in the end, invited to reach a guilty verdict by a faulty analytical path is clear from a consideration of the context of the prosecutor\u2019s summation: \u201cSo we know we have the assault; we know we have Mr. Tenny beaten with a deadly weapon or weapons or instruments, or with force likely to produce great bodily injury. [\u00b6 And we definitely have that, I\u2019ll explain that in just a moment. Hands and feet can be deadly weapons, and you don\u2019t have to be a black belt in karate, like sometimes you see on television. <em>It\u2019s the manner in which the hand or feet are used. If they are used in such a manner that it could cause, could cause great bodily injury, then those become dangerous weapons.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus the prosecutor argued only if the jury found defendant inflicted kicks and blows in a manner that created a likelihood of great bodily injury could it conclude he had used a deadly or dangerous weapon. Similarly, only if it likewise so found could the jury conclude defendant had used force likely to create great bodily injury. Regardless, therefore, of which path the jury took, the same finding was necessary to a verdict of guilt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moments later in his summation, the prosecutor added: \u201cSo if three guys hang around, and one guy is on the ground . . . and [they] try to kick him and actually miss, they have committed assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d In the context of the immediately preceding argument, which emphasized the \u201cmanner in which the hands or feet are used,\u201d we are confident this argument, although erroneous, would not have caused the jury to deviate from the proper analytical path. And, as noted above, the prosecutor\u2019s implication was correct that actual contact or physical injury to the victim is not essential to a conviction for aggravated assault. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">The standard instructions on aggravated assault reflect this fundamental identity of the concepts of assault with a deadly weapon and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. (See <em>In re Mosley </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 913, 919, fn. 5 [83 Cal.Rptr. 809, 464 P.2d 473] [\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>offense of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is not an offense separate from ... the offense of assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d].) Those instructions, as relevant here and as read to the jury in this case, provide as follows: \u201cEvery person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is guilty of a violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1) of the Penal Code, a crime. [C|Q In order to prove such crime, each of the following elements must be proved: One, a person was assaulted, and two, the assault was committed by the use of a deadly weapon or instrument or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. <em>A deadly weapon is any object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing, and likely to produce, death or great bodily </em>injury.\u201d (See CALJIC No. 9.02, italics added.) Thus, the instructions, like the prosecutor\u2019s argument, called on the jury to find defendant\u2019s conduct had the capability and probability of inflicting great bodily injury under either a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d theory or a \u201cforce likely\u201d theory. The jury\u2019s analytical process was the same in either event.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The foregoing analysis also disposes of defendant\u2019s argument concerning the prosecutor\u2019s statement hands can be deadly weapons. As we have said, in arguing \u201chands,\u201d per se, may be deadly weapons depending on the manner of their use, the prosecutor misspoke. Nor does anything in the record indicate defendant used weighted gloves, brass knuckles or any other weapon or instrument extrinsic to his hands that properly could be found to be a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). Nevertheless, given the victim\u2019s testimony his assailants administered only a \u201cvery few\u201d blows with their fists as compared with the number of kicks they delivered, that defendant\u2019s conviction was predicated on his use of his fists seems unlikely. Even, however, if the jury used the fact of the blows with hands to find defendant committed assault with a deadly weapon, it necessarily would have found, as we have seen, that defendant used his hands in a manner <em>likely to produce great bodily injury. </em>Moreover, the jury was instructed that \u201cAn assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury may be committed with the hand or fists. Proof of such an assault need not show that the defendant actually injured the other person. However, there must be proof that as a result of physical force used or attempted to be used, and the manner of such use or of such such [s/c] attempt, there was a likelihood of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>great bodily injury being inflicted upon another person.\u201d The instructions thus specifically invited the jury to consider the evidence of any blows from fists under the correct rubric (\u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeal for consideration of defendant\u2019s remaining appellate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">George, C.

We disagree; the finding has no such effect. One may commit an assault without making actual physical contact with the person of the victim; because the statute focuses on <em>use </em>of a deadly weapon or instrument or, alternatively, on force <em>likely </em>to produce great bodily injury, whether the victim in fact suffers any harm is immaterial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 176.) The not true finding on the enhancement allegation thus means only that the jury did not believe defendant <em>actually inflicted </em>great bodily injury on the victim; it cannot be understood as a determination on the question whether defendant used force <em>likely </em>to inflict such injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">We observe that, despite the identity of the jury\u2019s reasoning processes under either the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d clause or the \u201cforce likely\u201d clause in this case, our holding does not reduce the former clause to surplusage. There remain assaults involving weapons that are deadly per se, such as dirks and blackjacks, in which the prosecutor may argue for, and the jury convict of, aggravated assault based on the mere character of the weapon. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 327, disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 32.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1080-7\">MOSK, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AR6\">I write separately to clarify my understanding of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">Defendant was charged with and convicted of a violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a)(1) (hereafter section 245(a)(1)), which punishes an assault committed either (1) with a \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument\u201d other than a firearm or (2) by means of any \u201cforce likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">In turn, a \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument\u201d is either (1) a weapon that is deadly per se (e.g., a dagger) or (2) any \u201cobject, instrument, or weapon\u201d that is <em>used </em>in a way likely to produce death or great bodily injury (e.g., a hammer). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 327-328 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153]; CALJIC No. 9.02.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Reading this definition back into the statute, we find that section 245(a)(1) thus actually punishes an assault committed in any one of three ways: i.e., (1) with a weapon deadly per se, or (2) with an <em>object used </em>in a way likely to produce great bodily injury, or (3) by means of a <em>force </em>also likely to produce great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">We deal here with an assault committed with hands or feet. The cases hold that an assault committed with hands or feet <em>can </em>constitute the third of the foregoing three ways of violating section 245(a)(1), i.e., by means of a <em>force </em>likely to produce great bodily injury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169, 176 [121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001], and cases cited.) I understand the majority now to hold that an assault committed with hands or feet <em>cannot </em>constitute either the first or second of these three ways of violating section 245(a)(1), i.e., with a weapon deadly per se or with an instrument used in a way likely to produce great bodily injury, because to convict on either theory the weapon or instrument must be an object extrinsic to the human body, which hands and feet are obviously not. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>The prosecutor therefore erred in telling the jury that \u201cHands and feet can be deadly weapons . . . [i]f they are used in such a manner that it could cause . . . great bodily injury . . . Because of the compound structure of section 245(a)(1), however, I further agree with the majority that the error was nonprejudicial in this case. The majority stress that the prosecutor in effect told the jury it could not find defendant committed assault with a deadly weapon unless it found he used his hands or feet in a way likely to produce great bodily injury. The majority then reason that the same finding would also have supported a conviction of assault by means of a force likely to produce great bodily injury\u2014the third way of violating section 245(a)(1)\u2014which would <em>not </em>have been error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The majority\u2019s reasoning is premised on an unstated assumption, i.e., that (1) an <em>object used </em>in a way likely to produce great bodily injury and (2) a <em>force </em>likely to produce the same result are sufficiently equivalent to justify inferring that if the jury found one it would also have found the other. While this may not be true in every case, it is not an unreasonable assumption in the case at bar: Even though hands and feet are not objects extrinsic to the human body, their violent <em>use </em>in this case undoubtedly generated a <em>force </em>likely to produce great bodily injuiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">With these understandings, I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
