The issue in this case is whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to request a \u201cpinpoint\u201d jury instruction specifically relating voluntary intoxication to premeditation and deliberation. The Court of Appeal found counsel was ineffective. We disagree because the trial court gave a fully adequate pinpoint instruction. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">The prosecution evidence showed that on the evening of October 2, 1992, Jose Escobar was driving a car in Los Angeles with defendant as a passenger. Both were members of the Juares Maravilla gang. After driving for a short while, Escobar and defendant picked up another Juares Maravilla member and two others. The group drove to defendant\u2019s house. Defendant went inside and returned a few minutes later carrying an object, later identified as a sawed-off shotgun, wrapped in a towel. Escobar resumed driving and, at defendant\u2019s request, stopped at an intersection in Juares Maravilla gang territory. Rickey Garcia, Sergio Cortez, and Denise De La Rosa were standing nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Defendant asked Garcia \u201cwhere he was from,\u201d which meant, what was his gang affiliation. Garcia responded, \u201cTiny Boys,\u201d the name of a rival gang. Defendant got out of the car with a small gun and shot Cortez in the chest, shouting, \u201cJuares.\u201d Defendant returned to the car and removed the sawed-off shotgun that had been wrapped in the towel. Cortez, who survived the shooting, fled with Garcia and De La Rosa. Defendant chased Garcia and fatally shot him in the head with the shotgun. One of defendant\u2019s fellow passengers testified he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Defendant testified that he was not a Juares Maravilla gang member. He said he smoked about one and one-half cigarettes containing PCP the evening of the shootings, and that they caused his heart to beat rapidly and made him feel dizzy and unable to stand. Shortly after smoking the cigarettes, defendant heard someone call his name. He entered Escobar\u2019s car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>Defendant did not know who was in the car but assumed they were his friends. He remembered riding around in the car and getting out of the vehicle after hearing someone say \u201cTiny Boys,\u201d but he did not remember shooting anyone. He \u201cjust remember[ed] everything was in slow motion . . . .\u201d After his arrest, defendant told police that he recalled shooting at somebody at that intersection. At trial, defendant denied the recollection; he explained that he \u201cwas being asked too many questions at one time.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">On rebuttal, a police officer testified that at first defendant claimed he had been elsewhere at the time of these events. When informed that witnesses had identified him as the gunman, he said that he \u201cwished to change his story\u201d and told police about smoking the PCP cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">As relevant to this appeal, defendant was charged with the murder of Garcia and the attempted premeditated murder of Cortez. The court instructed the jury on first and second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for killing Garcia. The sole theory of first degree murder was premeditation and deliberation. The court also instructed on attempted murder and assault with a firearm for shooting Cortez. The jury convicted defendant of the first degree murder of Garcia and the assault with a firearm of Cortez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">Defendant appealed and filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The Court of Appeal issued an order to show cause and ordered the petition considered concurrently with the appeal. In the appeal, the court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction for first degree murder and otherwise affirmed the judgment. It found defense counsel had provided ineffective assistance for not requesting a jury instruction specifically relating voluntary intoxication to the premeditation and deliberation necessary to establish first degree murder. In light of its ruling on the direct appeal, the court denied as moot the petition for writ of habeas corpus. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Defendant testified that he had smoked PCP before the shootings, and that it made him dizzy and affected his mental state. At one time evidence of voluntary intoxication was admissible to support the defense of diminished capacity, but the Legislature has abolished that defense. By statute at the time of the crime and of trial, evidence of intoxication was \u201cadmissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant <em>actually </em>formed a required specific intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 22, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>(b), italics added; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1111-1112 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">In <em>Saille, </em>we explained that, with the abolition of diminished capacity as a defense, \u201cIntoxication is now relevant only to the extent that it bears on the question of whether the defendant actually had the requisite specific mental state.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1119.) An instruction relating intoxication to any mental state is therefore \u201cnow more like the \u2018pinpoint\u2019 instructions\u201d that \u201care not required to be given sua sponte.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under <em>Saille, </em>therefore, the court did not have a sua sponte duty to give <em>any </em>instruction on the relevance of intoxication, any more than it had to instruct on the relevance of other evidence. In the absence of instructions, defense counsel could simply argue that defendant did not actually have the necessary mental state due to his intoxication, just as counsel could argue any other inferences from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">In this case, the court did give a pinpoint instruction of the type discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 1103. It told the jury it should consider defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication in determining whether he had the specific intent or mental state required for the charged crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Defendant contends, however, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that defense counsel was ineffective for not requesting that the instruction specifically tell the jury it should consider the intoxication evidence in deciding whether he <em>premeditated </em>the killing. In effect, defendant argues that the pinpoint instruction did not pinpoint enough, that it did not additionally say that premeditation is a mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The law regarding claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is settled. Defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>and prejudicial, i.e., that it is reasonably probable that counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors affected the outcome. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687, 693-694 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067-2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-217 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) We have also said that if the record sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the challenged manner, we must reject the claim on appeal unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or there could be no satisfactory explanation for counsel\u2019s performance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza Tello </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134].) Here, we need not inquire into why counsel failed to request an additional explanatory instruction because, unlike the Court of Appeal, we conclude none was needed. The court fully apprised the jury of the law applicable to defendant\u2019s intoxication defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">The court gave CALJIC Nos. 4.21 and 4.21.1 as adapted to this case. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>The Court of Appeal found the instructions inadequate and misleading. It believed they caused the jury to conclude it should consider the evidence of intoxication on the question of intent to kill but could not consider it on the question of premeditation. Were that correct, the issue would not solely be one of ineffective assistance of counsel. If the trial court\u2019s instructions were indeed misleading, the issue here would implicate the court\u2019s duty to give legally correct instructions. Even if the court has no sua sponte duty to instruct on a particular legal point, when it does choose to instruct, it must do so correctly. \u201cAlthough we might hesitate before holding that the absence of any instruction on voluntary intoxication in a situation such as that presented in this case is prejudicial error, when a partial instruction has been given we cannot but hold that the failure to give complete instructions was prejudicial error.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 550, 575-576 [268 P.2d 705], and quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">But we find the trial court correctly and fully instructed the jury on the way in which the evidence of intoxication related to defendant\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>state, including premeditation. The Court of Appeal criticized the actual instructions as follows. \u201cNo \u2018pinpointing\u2019 was done in this case on the issue of premeditation. At the prosecution\u2019s request, CALJIC No. 4.21 (1992 rev.) was given to the jury. But although the blank for specific intent that appears in the first sentence of the instruction was filled in, mental state was not mentioned. Thus, the first paragraph of CALJIC No. 4.21 which was delivered to [the] jury provided: \u2018In the crimes of murder and attempted murder . . . , a necessary element is the existence in the mind of the perpetrator of the specific intent to kill.\u2019 Based on [defendant\u2019s] statement to the police and his trial testimony that he was intoxicated on PCP at the time of the crimes, the trial court would have been required to fill in the \u2018mental state[s]\u2019 blanks of CALJIC No. 4.21 with references to \u2018premeditation\u2019 and \u2018deliberation,\u2019 had trial counsel so requested. [Citations.] However, no such request was made.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) The Court of Appeal found the instructions misleading because, \u201cwhen the first sentence of the version of CALJIC No. 4.21 that was read to the jury referred to \u2018the specific intent to kill\u2019 and was completely silent as to mental state, a conscientious juror would have understood it to pertain <em>only </em>to the charge of <em>attempted </em>murder, and not to the concept of premeditation as to either the attempted murder or the . . . actual murder[].\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The instructions <em>as a whole, </em>however, were not misleading.  \u201c[T]he correctness of jury instructions is to be determined from the entire charge of the court, not from a consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular instruction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 538 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251].) \u201c \u2018The absence of an essential element in one instruction may be supplied by another or cured in light of the instructions as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 539.)  The trial court expressly referred to both the attempted murder and murder charges. It related voluntary intoxication to \u201cspecific intent or mental state,\u201d which would be defined \u201celsewhere in these instructions.\u201d The instructions correctly explained that, for the jury to find defendant guilty of first degree murder, it must find he acted with \u201cdeliberation and premeditation.\u201d They further explained that defendant\u2019s deliberation and premeditation to kill \u201cmust have been formed upon preexisting reflection and not upon a sudden heat of passion or other condition precluding the idea of deliberation . ...\u201d A reasonable jury would have understood deliberation and premeditation to be \u201cmental states\u201d for which it should consider the evidence of intoxication as to either attempted murder or murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The Court of Appeal specifically criticized the trial court for stating, in the first paragraph of CALJIC No. 4.21, that the \u201cspecific intent to kill\u201d is an element of murder and attempted murder, without also referring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>mental states of premeditation and deliberation. That language was correct although, by itself, it would not have been complete. Premeditation is <em>not </em>an element of murder. Instead, as the court went on to explain, premeditation distinguishes first degree murder from second degree murder. Although the trial court might have adapted the first paragraph of CALJIC No. 4.21 to refer to both the specific intent necessary for murder and the additional mental state necessary for first degree murder, its failure to do so did not mislead the jury in light of the rest of the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">The Court of Appeal found that CALJIC No. 4.21.1 \u201cdid nothing to reduce the potential for misunderstanding,\u201d and indeed exacerbated the problem, because \u201ca juror listening carefully to its reference to an \u2018exception\u2019 to the rule that intoxication is not an excuse and the admonition to refer to the other instructions would have understood the exception to apply to only \u2018the specific intent to kill\u2019 portion of CALJIC No. 4.21.\u201d Again, we disagree. The trial court expressly referred to an exception \u201cwhere a specific intent <em>or mental state </em>is an essential element of the crime.\u201d (Italics added.) No reasonable juror would understand the instructions to permit the jury to consider intoxication in determining whether defendant specifically intended to kill but to prohibit it from considering that same intoxication in determining whether he premeditated and deliberated. Premeditation and deliberation are clearly mental states; no reasonable juror would assume otherwise. Moreover, they refer to the quality of the intent to kill. By relating intoxication to mental state, the instruction necessarily directed the jury\u2019s attention to evidence of intoxication as it related to premeditation and deliberation. It is not reasonably likely the jury misconstrued the instructions as precluding it from considering the evidence of PCP use in deciding the degree of the murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Berryman </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1078 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">The court\u2019s instructions did not hinder defense counsel from arguing that defendant\u2019s intoxication affected all the necessary mental states, including premeditation. Counsel argued that defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cthe very type of thing that you could readily expect from someone who was under the influence,\u201d and that \u201cFrom all the evidence this simply does not appear that premeditated, deliberate type of homicide at all.\u201d He stressed, \u201cWe have a case where the defendant had taken a drug, PCP, taken it for the first time.\u201d Counsel tied the intoxication evidence to the issue of premeditation and deliberation, even calling the jury\u2019s attention to the instructions: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, look at those instructions, and you\u2019ll have an opportunity to read them. I\u2019m not going to go over them. You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity. And I think you\u2019ll reach the same conclusion as I do from the evidence in this case that we do not have a deliberate, premeditated homicide in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>nor do we have an attempted murder with premeditation and deliberation. The evidence just indicates just the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\"> For these reasons, we conclude that competent counsel could reasonably conclude that the instructions adequately advised the jury to consider the evidence of intoxication on the question of premeditation, and that an additional instruction stating the obvious\u2014that premeditation is a mental state\u2014was unnecessary. Moreover, the court did not breach its duty to instruct correctly once it decided to instruct on voluntary intoxication. The instructions allowed the jury to consider fully the effect, if any, that defendant\u2019s claimed PCP use had on the degree of the murder, as well as on the attempted murder and murder charges themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Defendant argues the verdict shows it is likely the instructions prejudiced him. The jury found defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Garcia but guilty only of assault with a firearm for shooting Cortez. Defendant argues that the jury may have convicted him of the lesser offense with respect to the Cortez shooting because it accepted his voluntary intoxication defense to attempted murder, but that it convicted him of the first degree murder of Garcia because, due to the instructions, it did not consider voluntary intoxication in assessing premeditation. The verdicts, however, are easily reconcilable without reference to voluntary intoxication. The evidence showed that defendant shot Cortez suddenly when Garcia said they were \u201cTiny Boys.\u201d By contrast, Garcia was the person who had responded to defendant\u2019s question. Defendant went back to the car, retrieved another gun, and chased Garcia before shooting him in the head. Defendant\u2019s added effort of returning to the car, getting the shotgun, and seeking Garcia could have supplied the jury with the evidence of intent to kill and premeditation it found lacking in the Cortez shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Moreover, the evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication was equivocal at best. While defendant testified he was under the influence of PCP at the time of the shooting, one of his companions testified he did not appear intoxicated. He did not claim PCP use until after he first denied any involvement in the crime. The acts of retrieving the murder weapon from his house and concealing it in a towel, asking Garcia the group\u2019s gang affiliation, then shooting two persons with two different weapons when he heard the wrong answer strongly suggest a planned gang killing, not the unintended acts of someone high on PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Defendant makes other arguments outside the scope of the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion and our grant of review. Accordingly, we do not consider them. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29.2(a).) On remand, the Court of Appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>should decide, as necessary, any issues our decision leaves unresolved, including the petition for writ of habeas corpus, which is no longer moot. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 979, 990 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 911 P.2d 1374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">III.

Although the trial court retains \u201cresidual discretion\u201d to comment \u201cupon assertions of fact as well as the governing propositions of law\u201d \u201cwhen confusion still reigns after closing argument,\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>the law is well established that the defendant generally cannot complain of the failure to more fully instruct if he did not request clarification. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Byrnes </em>(1866) 30 Cal. 206, 208 [general instruction sufficient \u201cparticularly . .*. where the accused does not request that the charge may be made more specific or minute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Here, the obvious and only \u201cdefense\u201d to first degree murder was lack of premeditation and deliberation\u2014defendant chased the victim with a shotgun and shot him in the head but claimed he was under the influence of PCP\u2014and counsel strenuously argued this theory. While the pattern instructions may have been legally sufficient, they did not plainly draw the connection between voluntary intoxication and proof of premeditation and deliberation. The instructions directed the jury at least twice to \u201cconsider [evidence of voluntary intoxication] in [determining] whether [or not] defendant had [the necessary] specific intent or mental state\u201d (see CALJIC No. 4.21); at no point, however, is premeditation or deliberation described as a \u201cmental state.\u201d The instructions simply define them as essentials of first degree murder. The only \u201cmental state\u201d identified as such is malice aforethought. Thus, the instructions were potentially misleading as to the legal relationship of voluntary intoxication to formation of this requisite state of mind. Although the average layperson may not be familiar with the Latin phrase <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>the deductive concept is commonly understood, and if applied in this context could mislead a reasonable juror as to the scope of the voluntary intoxication instruction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>In these circumstances, clarification was critical. Moreover, the instructions do nothing to \u201c \u2018pinpoint\u2019 the crux\u201d of defendant\u2019s only viable defense to first degree murder. In closing argument, counsel not only argued defendant did not premeditate or deliberate due to PCP intoxication, he specifically directed the jury to consider the instructions on this point. It is difficult to conceive a strategic explanation for not having the trial court include a clarification as well as add its imprimatur to the argument. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitehurst </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1051, fn. 2 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 33].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Nevertheless, it is unnecessary to resolve the question of competence since the court \u201cneed not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 697 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2069].) On this basis, I conclude defendant has failed to sustain his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">On the one hand, as explained above, the pattern instructions were potentially misleading as to defendant\u2019s defense even if not legally insufficient or inaccurate. On the other hand, for the reasons explained by the majority, the facts tend to militate against a finding of prejudice. Moreover, the trial court adequately instructed on voluntary intoxication in general, which allowed the jury to consider fully the possible effect of PCP in light of closing argument. Defense counsel could and did argue the inference from the evidence that defendant did not actually have the necessary mental state. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Padilla </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 891, 951-952 [12 Cal.4th 825h, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 906 P.2d 388]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 68, fn. 24 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In reaching a contrary conclusion as to prejudice, the Court of Appeal relied in part on the fact the jury failed to convict of attempted murder and therefore may have found the evidence of voluntary intoxication persuasive to the extent the instructions linked the elements of attempted murder to this defense. \u201cUnlike murder, in which specific intent may or may not be the basis of malice (i.e., express versus implied malice), specific intent is one of the elements of attempted murder.\u201d However, first degree murder cannot be predicated on implied malice, and the trial court explicitly instructed the jury first degree murder required \u201cexpress malice aforethought.\u201d In light of defense counsel\u2019s argument, a reasonable juror would likely have understood voluntary intoxication applied to premeditation and deliberation, notwithstanding the lack of precision in the instructions. Moreover, the prosecutor never argued voluntary intoxication could not negate premeditation and deliberation, only that defendant was not intoxicated. The jury was also instructed \u201cnot [to] single out any particular sentence or any individual point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>or instruction\u201d but to \u201c[c]onsider the instructions as a whole and each in light of all the others.\u201d (CALJIC No. 1.01.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">I thus conclude defendant has not met his burden to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s [alleged] unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 694 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2068].) In other words, he has failed to undermine my confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
