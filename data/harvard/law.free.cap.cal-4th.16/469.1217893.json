Code, \u00a7 68600 et seq.). We conclude that, under the governing statutes, a court may not impose this sanction if noncompliance is the responsibility of counsel, not of the litigant. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeal judgment, which reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">In April 1993, plaintiff Danny Garcia filed a complaint in the Fresno County Superior Court seeking damages for injuries he received during an altercation at Henry\u2019s Cantina, a cocktail lounge in Clovis, California. The complaint alleged claims for personal injury, general negligence, premises liability, and intentional tort, and named, among other defendants, Fern and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>David Avila, individually and doing business as Henry\u2019s Cantina (collectively the Avilas). On June 28, 1993, the clerk of the court served on Garcia\u2019s counsel, Tomas Nunez, a notice of failure to comply with former rule 5.4A of the Superior Court of Fresno County Rules,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which required a plaintiff to serve the complaint on all named defendants and file a proof of service within 60 days of filing the complaint. Former rule 5.4A was one of the rules that the Fresno County Superior Court promulgated \u201cpursuant to Code of Civil Procedure [\u00a7]575.1\u201d to implement the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Former rule 5.1.) The notice also cautioned: \u201cIt Is the Plaintiff\u2019s Responsibility to Timely Prosecute General Civil Actions Filed in Fresno County. See [former] Rule 5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On November 1, 1993, the clerk served Nunez with a notice pursuant to former rule 5.6B ordering him to appear at a status hearing on January 19, 1994. Former rule 5.6B directed the trial court to order all parties to attend a status hearing if \u00e1n at issue memorandum was not filed within 180 days after filing of the complaint. The notice ordered Nunez to comply with former rule 5.7, which required counsel for each represented party to file and serve at least five court days before the status hearing a sworn declaration addressing a number of matters, including counsel\u2019s explanation for failing to satisfy the requirements of former rules 5.4 (serving complaint and filing proof of service) and 5.6 (filing at issue memorandum). The notice also ordered Nunez to appear in person unless he was going to be out of the county on the hearing date and he arranged at least 14 days before that date to appear by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Nunez did not appear at the status hearing on January 19, 1994. Instead, that morning he informed the court he was out of the county in trial, but he did not arrange to appear by telephone. The Honorable Gary R. Kerkorian sanctioned Nunez $50 for failing to appear and $50 for failing to serve and file the required declaration. Judge Kerkorian continued the matter to April 19, 1994, \u201cfor hearing on the Court\u2019s sua sponte motion to dismiss the entire action.\u201d The court\u2019s minute order indicated that counsel\u2019s appearance would be unnecessary if an at issue memorandum was filed, or a dismissal or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On January 27, 1994, Judge Kerkorian followed up his order by issuing a notice of motion to dismiss the action, citing in the caption former rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>5.10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Former rule 5.10 provided: \u201cIn the event that any attorney, or any party represented by counsel or any party appearing in pro se fails to comply with any of the requirements of [former] Rule 5 or any order made pursuant to [former] Rule 5, the Court may, upon motion of a party or on its own motion: Ffl] . . .[&lt;][] B. Dismiss the action or proceeding or any part thereof . . . .\u201d Consistent with the caption\u2019s reference to former rule 5.10, the notice cited as grounds for the motion \u201cPlaintiff[\u2019s] . . . fail[ure] to comply with . . . [former] rule 5, and the Court\u2019s directives thereunder.\u201d The notice provided that all supporting or opposing papers should be filed at least five calendar days before the hearing. Although the notice was directed to \u201call parties and their attorneys,\u201d the clerk mailed it only to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">At the hearing on April 19, Judge Kerkorian sanctioned Nunez $300 for not complying with the court\u2019s service and at issue memorandum requirements and $25 for late filing of a declaration explaining his noncompliance. Judge Kerkorian continued the hearing on the dismissal motion to June 21 before the Honorable Dwayne Keyes. He cautioned that, if the case was not at issue by June 21, counsel would \u201chave to show Judge Keyes very good cause why he shouldn\u2019t dismiss it.\u201d Judge Kerkorian\u2019s minute order provided that counsel\u2019s appearance would be unnecessary if an at issue memorandum was filed, or a dismissal or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In May, Nunez sought and obtained permission to serve summons on several defendants by publication. Also in May, several of the other defendants who had already been served, including the Avilas, filed demurrers to Garcia\u2019s second amended complaint. On June 17, the Honorable Gary S. Austin sustained the demurrer of one defendant without leave to amend. He sustained the demurrer of the Avilas only in part and granted Garcia leave to amend until July 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">As scheduled, on June 21, four days after the demurrer hearing, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held before Judge Keyes. Nunez did not appear at the hearing. Judge Keyes granted the motion and dismissed the case without prejudice. Although the dismissal was without prejudice, the statute of limitations would have barred claims alleged in a new complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Accordingly, after learning of the dismissal, Nunez filed a motion for reconsideration on Garcia\u2019s behalf. In support of the motion, Nunez asserted that the dismissal was based on failure to serve the remaining defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>with the second amended complaint by June 21. He explained that he had not served the remaining defendants because of the demurrers that had been pending before Judge Austin. The Avilas opposed the motion, arguing that the court\u2019s dismissal was not based on failure to serve the remaining defendants, but \u201con plaintiff\u2019s willful and repeated failure to file status conference declarations, repeated <em>failure </em>to appear at status hearings, and finally, failure to appear at the June 21, 1994, hearing on the court\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">At the hearing on the reconsideration motion, Nunez asserted that he had not attended the June 21 hearing on the dismissal motion because he believed that Judge Austin\u2019s order partially sustaining the demurrer \u201chad obviated [the dismissal] hearing, because he gave me an extension to file a third amended complaint for July 20.\u201d Nunez also discussed his efforts to serve the other defendants. Judge Keyes replied: \u201cThat does not concern me as much as your cavalier attitude of when you appear in court and when you do not appear in court.\u201d Judge Keyes then denied the motion for reconsideration. His order of dismissal states that he based the ruling on \u201cthe moving papers, the lack of opposition papers, and the absence of plaintiff\u2019s counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling, concluding that section 575.2, subdivision (b) (section 575.2(b)), prohibits dismissal as a sanction where noncompliance with local court rules is the fault of counsel, not of the litigant. This section, the court explained, \u201cmakes clear the legislative intent that a party\u2019s cause of action should not be impaired or destroyed by his or her attorney\u2019s procedural mistakes.\u201d The court found nothing in the Act rendering section 575.2(b) inapplicable. On the contrary, it concluded that the relevant provision of the Act, Government Code section 68608, subdivision (b) (Government Code section 68608(b)), merely incorporates \u201cthe general authority granted to the courts by section 575.2, subdivision (a) to impose sanctions, including the sanction of dismissal. The limitation on that authority, as reflected in [section 575.2(b)], that parties not be punished for counsel\u2019s noncompliance with local rules, is not affected by any contrary expression of intent in [Government Code section 68608(b)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We then granted review to resolve an apparent conflict between the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and the decision in <em>Intel Corp. </em>v. <em>USAIR, Inc. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1559 [279 Cal.Rptr. 569] <em>(Intel). </em>The court in <em>Intel, </em>construing the predecessor of Government Code section 68608(b), concluded that section 575.2(b) does not limit a court\u2019s power to dismiss an action as a sanction for counsel\u2019s noncompliance with local rules implementing statutory delay reduction programs (fast track rules). <em>(Intel, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1563-1566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In 1982, the Legislature gave courts express statutory power to adopt local rules \u201cdesigned to expedite and facilitate the business of the court.\u201d (\u00a7 575.1.) At the same time, it enacted section 575.2, subdivision (a), which permits a court\u2019s local rules to prescribe sanctions, including dismissal of an action, for noncompliance with those rules. Section 575.2(b), on which the Court of Appeal relied, provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that if a failure to comply with these rules is the responsibility of counsel and not of the party, any penalty shall be imposed on counsel and shall not adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action or defense thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Courts have interpreted section 575.2(b) as \u201csharply limit[ing] penalties in instances of <em>attorney </em>negligence.\u201d <em>(State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Public Works Bd. </em>v. <em>Bragg </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1018, 1025 [228 Cal.Rptr. 576] <em>(Bragg), </em>original italics.) In <em>Bragg, </em>the court stated that section 575.2(b) creates \u201can exception to the general rule that the negligence of an attorney is imputed to the client [citations], with the client\u2019s only recourse a malpractice action against the negligent attorney. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bragg, supra, </em>at p. 1026.) Similarly, in <em>Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 491, 502 [256 Cal.Rptr. 296] <em>(Moyal), </em>the court explained that, in section 575.2(b), \u201c[t]he Legislature has made clear its intent a party\u2019s cause of action should not be impaired or destroyed by his or her attorney\u2019s procedural mistakes.\u201d In <em>Cooks </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 723, 727 [274 Cal.Rptr. 113], the court construed section 575.2(b) \u201cto proscribe any sanction against an innocent party for local rule violations of counsel and to proscribe sanctions against counsel that adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action or defense thereto.\u201d These decisions also hold that a court must invoke section 575.2(b) on its own motion when necessary to protect an innocent party. <em>(Cooks, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 727; <em>Moyal, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 502; <em>Bragg, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1028-1029; see also <em>In re Marriage of Colombo </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 572, 579-580 [242 Cal.Rptr. 100] [following <em>Bragg].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The Avilas do not challenge this judicial construction of section 575.2(b). Rather, they contend that a trial court\u2019s power under Government Code section 68608(b) to dismiss an action for violation of local fast track rules is not subject to the limits of section 575.2(b). Government Code section 68608(b) provides: \u201cJudges shall have all the powers to impose sanctions authorized by law, including the power to dismiss actions or strike pleadings, if it appears that less severe sanctions would not be effective after taking into account the effect of previous sanctions or previous lack of compliance in the case. Judges are encouraged to impose sanctions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>achieve the purposes of this [Act].\u201d The Avilas view this section as creating a dismissal power that is both independent of and greater than the court\u2019s power under section 575.2(b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The Avilas\u2019 construction of these provisions violates several rules of statutory interpretation.  As in any case involving statutory interpretation, \u201c[o]ur first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 597 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999].)  By its terms, Government Code section 68608(b) gives trial courts only those sanctioning powers \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d Under its plain and commonsense meaning, the phrase, \u201cauthorized by law,\u201d incorporates only those sanctioning powers that the law otherwise establishes, including those set forth in section 575.2. It does not express a legislative intent to establish an independent sanctioning power. Because section 575.2(b) directs that \u201cany penalty shall be imposed on counsel and shall not adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action\u201d when noncompliance \u201cis the responsibility of counsel and not of the party,\u201d dismissal without consideration of whether counsel or the client is at fault is not a sanction \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608(b); cf. <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>County of Mendocino </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 476, 486 [204 Cal.Rptr. 897, 683 P.2d 1150] [in conditioning permit on \u201ccompliance with the \u2018law,\u2019 \u201d the Legislature \u201cintended to require compliance with other state statutes\u201d]; <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Colgan </em>(1896) 111 Cal. 580, 585 [44 P. 238] [requirement that board proceed \u201c \u2018in the manner and method authorized by law\u2019 \u201d refers \u201cto the manner and method for making improvements provided in the law governing said board\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Avilas\u2019 interpretation also violates the rule of statutory interpretation that requires us, if possible, to give effect and significance to every word and phrase of a statute. <em>(Steinberg </em>v. <em>Amplica, Inc. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1198, 1205 [233 Cal.Rptr. 249, 729 P.2d 683].) \u201cWhen two statutes touch upon a common subject,\u201d we must construe them \u201cin reference to each other, so as to \u2018harmonize the two in such a way that no part of either becomes surplusage.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 778-779 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 889 P.2d 1019].) We must presume that the Legislature intended \u201cevery word, phrase and provision . . . in a statute . . . to have meaning and to perform a useful function.\u201d <em>(Clements </em>v. <em>T. R. Bechtel Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 227, 233 [273 P.2d 5].)  Contrary to these principles, the Avilas\u2019 view that Government Code section 68608(b) establishes an independent sanctioning power reads the phrase \u201cauthorized by law\u201d out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Finally, the Avilas\u2019 interpretation runs counter to the rule regarding repeal by implication.  \u201c[A]ll presumptions are against a repeal by implication. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>171, 176 [113 Cal.Rptr. 217, 520 P.2d 1033].) Absent an express declaration of legislative intent, we will find an implied repeal \u201conly when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes [citation], and the statutes are \u2018irreconcilable, clearly repugnant, and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re White </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 207, 212 [81 Cal.Rptr. 780, 460 P.2d 980].)  As we have explained, there is a rational basis for harmonizing section 575.2(b) and Government Code section 68608(b). By reading Government Code section 68608(b) as incorporating the limits of section 575.2(b), we \u201cmaintain the integrity of both statutes . . . .\u201d <em>(Penziner </em>v. <em>West American Finance Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 160, 176 [74 P.2d 252].) In contrast, the Avilas, by reading Government Code section 68608(b) as authorizing dismissal for counsel\u2019s noncompliance with local rules, would repeal section 575.2(b) with respect to all fast track rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">To support their interpretation, the Avilas invoke the principle that \u201cspecific statutory provisions relating to a particular subject will govern, as against a general provision, in matters concerning that subject.\u201d Citing <em>Intel, </em>they assert that, because Government Code section 68608(b) is the more specific statute regarding delay reduction, it \u201ccontrols over\u201d section 575.2(b). In <em>Intel, </em>the court considered section 575.2(b)\u2019s application to fast track cases in light of Government Code section 68608(b)\u2019s predecessor, Government Code former section 68609, subdivision (d). That section provided in relevant part: \u201cIn order to enforce the requirements of an exemplary delay reduction program and orders issued in cases assigned to it, the judges of the program shall have all the powers to impose sanctions authorized by law, including the power to dismiss actions or strike pleadings, if it appears that less severe sanctions would not be effective after taking into account the effect of previous sanctions or previous lack of compliance in the case.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 1200, \u00a7 1, pp. 4008-4009.) The court held that, notwithstanding section 575.2(b), dismissal for noncompliance with local delay reduction rules was proper, stating: \u201cWhile [section 575.2(b)] is concerned with penalties for violation of any local rules, the Government Code provision addresses imposition of sanctions for violation of local delay reduction rules. The Government Code provision is clearly more narrowly circumscribed and specific than [section 575.2(b)], and is therefore controlling.\u201d <em>(Intel, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at p. 1565.) The Avilas urge that the same analysis governs interpretation of Government Code section 68608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Avilas have incorrectly applied this principle of statutory construction. Initially, we question the assertion that Government Code section 68608(b) is the more specific provision. Although that section applies specifically to delay reduction programs, it speaks only generally about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>court\u2019s power to impose sanctions \u201cauthorized by law\u201d in connection with these programs. It does <em>not </em>expressly address the power of a court to impose sanctions for noncompliance with local rules. The Legislature has expressly addressed that subject in section 575.2 and has expressly limited the court\u2019s power in subdivision (b) of that section. Thus, it is arguable which statute is the more specific and which the more general. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 521 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328].)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In any event, \u201c[t]he principle that a specific statute prevails over a general one applies only when the two sections cannot be reconciled. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 293 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938].) If we can reasonably harmonize \u201c[t]wo statutes dealing with the same subject,\u201d then we must give \u201cconcurrent effect\u201d to both, \u201ceven though one is specific and the other general. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 385 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)  As we have explained, Government Code section 68608(b) and section 575.2(b) are not irreconcilable. By granting trial courts sanctioning powers \u201cauthorized by law,\u201d Government Code section 68608(b) expressly incorporates the terms of section 575.2, including the limitations of subdivision (b). More generally, the Act mandates that courts, in carrying out their responsibility to eliminate delay, must act \u201cconsistent with statute . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68607.) Where, as here, \u201cthe [assertedly] specific statute expressly requires compliance with other laws and when there is no direct conflict between the various laws,\u201d the principle on which the Avilas rely \u201cis entitled to little weight.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>County of Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 488.) Accordingly, we reject the Avilas\u2019 claim that, because Government Code section 68608(b) specifically addresses fast track matters, it \u201ccontrols over\u201d section 575.2(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>International Assn. of Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Pleasanton </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 959, 975-976 [129 Cal.Rptr. 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The Avilas additionally insist that, as a matter of public policy, the power to dismiss actions when counsel violate fast track rules is necessary to further the public\u2019s interest in reducing litigation delay. They assert: \u201c[A]ny delay in the resolution of litigation severely undermines the public confidence in the fairness and utility of the judiciary as a public institution since delay in the process reduces the chance that justice will be done and imposes severe hardships on the litigants.\u201d To support their assertion, they <em>partially </em>quote the following legislative findings and conclusions that were part of the original Trial Court Delay Reduction Act of 1986 (1986 Act): \u201c(a) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>expeditious and timely resolution of [legal] actions is an integral and necessary function of the judicial branch . . . . [H (b) Delay in the resolution of . . . litigation is not in the best interests of the state and the public. The people . . . expect and deserve prompt justice and the speedy resolution of disputes. Delay in the resolution of litigation may reflect a failure of justice and subjects the judiciary to a loss of confidence by the public in both its fairness and utility as a public institution. Delay reduces the chance that justice will in fact be done, and often imposes severe emotional and financial hardship on litigants, [ffl (c) Cases filed in California\u2019s trial courts should be resolved as expeditiously as possible . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 68601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">For two reasons, we reject the Avilas\u2019 claim. First, the general policy underlying legislation \u201ccannot supplant the intent of the Legislature as expressed in a particular statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 8 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449].) As we have shown, Government Code section 68608(b) expresses a legislative intent to grant trial courts only those sanctioning powers \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d Government Code section 68607 expresses a legislative intent to require courts, in carrying out their responsibility to eliminate delay, to act \u201cconsistent with statute . . . .\u201d Section 575.2(b) expresses a legislative intent that sanctions not affect a party\u2019s cause of action if a failure to comply with local rules \u201cis the responsibility of counsel and not of the party . . . .\u201d The Avilas err in relying on the general policy of delay reduction underlying the Act to the exclusion of the language of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Second, the Avilas are incorrect in suggesting that either the 1986 Act or the current Act directs that the goal of delay reduction take precedence over all other considerations. On the contrary, in the part of Government Code former section 68601, subdivision (c), that the Avilas have failed to quote, the Legislature recognized \u201cthe strong public policy that litigation be disposed of on the merits wherever possible.\u201d (See <em>Hocharian </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 714, 724 [170 Cal.Rptr. 790, 621 P.2d 829].) That section provided <em>in full: </em>\u201cCases filed in California\u2019s trial courts should be resolved as expeditiously as possible, <em>consistent with the obligation of the courts to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>give full and careful consideration to the issues presented, and consistent with the right of parties to adequately prepare and present their cases to the </em>courts.\u201d (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 68601, subd. (c), italics added.) Thus, in establishing delay reduction programs, the Legislature recognized <em>competing </em>public policy considerations and \u201cattempt[ed] to balance the need for expeditious processing of civil matters with the rights of individual litigants.\u201d (Moyal, <em>supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 500.) Unlike the Avilas, we find no evidence that the Legislature intended \u201cthe policy of expeditious processing of civil cases [to] override, in all situations, the trial court\u2019s obligation to hear cases on the merits.

Courts have numerous other methods for maintaining control of their calendars. Under section 1209, subdivision (a)5, \u201c[disobedience of any lawful. . . order ... of the court\u201d constitutes contempt. (See <em>In re Young </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1052, 1053 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 892 P.2d 148].) For each separate act of contempt, the court may impose monetary sanctions or imprisonment. (\u00a7\u00a7 1218, subd. (a), 1219.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying section 1209, courts have treated \u201can attorney\u2019s failure to appear in court at a time he was personally ordered to appear, without valid excuse\u201d as a punishable contempt. <em>(In re Baroldi </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 101, 106 [234 Cal.Rptr. 286].) Under Penal Code section 166, subdivision (a)(4), \u201c[w]illful disobedience of any . . . order lawfully issued by any court\u201d is a form of contempt that is criminally punishable as a misdemeanor by jail sentence of up to six months and/or fine of up to $1,000. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.) Under section 128.5, subdivision (a), courts may \u201corder a party, the party\u2019s attorney, or both to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under section 177.5, courts may \u201cimpose reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) ... for any violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or substantial justification.\u201d Thus, application of section 575.2(b)\u2019s limits on the dismissal power to violations of fast track rules will not leave courts without power to control their calendars.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In any event, the Avilas\u2019 interpretation of Government Code section 68608(b) might result in a proliferation of malpractice suits against counsel that would hinder, rather than promote, calendar control. This possibility was one of the concerns the Senate Committee on the Judiciary cited in recommending that the Legislature adopt section 575.2(b). The committee explained; \u201cWhile the client would likely have a malpractice cause of action against a lawyer whose misconduct resulted in dismissal or default, that remedy would be counter productive, since it would result in even more complicated litigation, further clogging the courts.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3784 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 5, 1982, pp. 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As our discussion demonstrates, granting a trial court power to dismiss an action where counsel alone is responsible for noncompliance with local rules would be a significant change in the law. Nothing in either the statutory language or the legislative history of the Act reflects a legislative intent to override section 575.2(b)\u2019s limits on a court\u2019s sanctioning powers or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>give courts expanded dismissal powers with respect to fast track rules. Instead, the words the Legislature chose reflect a contrary intent, i.e., to give courts only those sanctioning powers \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608(b).) \u201cWe are not persuaded the Legislature would have silently, or at best obscurely, decided so important ... a public policy matter and created a significant departure from the existing law.\u201d <em>(In re Christian S. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 782 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574].)

(Stats. 1990, ch. 1232, \u00a7 2, p. 5140.) The Avilas also rely heavily on the amended version of another repealed provision of the 1986 Act, Government Code former section 68612. That section permitted a court\u2019s delay reduction rules to be \u201cinconsistent with the California Rules of Court,\u201d to \u201cimpose procedural requirements in addition to those authorized by statute,\u201d and to \u201cshorten any time specified by statute for performing an act.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 1200, \u00a7 3, p. 4009.) Because the current Act contains no similar authorization, the repealed statute and the cases construing it are no longer relevant. (See <em>La Seigneurie U.S. Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1503 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 175]; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1314, 1318-1319 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In analogous contexts, the Legislature has also recognized the public interest in disposition of cases on the merits. (See, e.g., \u00a7 583.130 [\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute or by rule of court adopted pursuant to statute, ... the policy favoring trial or other disposition of an action on the merits [is] generally to be preferred over the policy that requires dismissal for failure to proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action in construing the provisions of this chapter.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> The court may fine the contemner up to $1,000 and, if the contemner is subject to the disobeyed order \u201cas a party to the action,\u201d may order the contemner to pay to the party initiating the contempt proceeding the reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in that proceeding. (\u00a7 1218, subd. (a).) The court may also imprison the contemner for up to five days (\u00a7 1218, subd. (a)) and, if \u201cthe contempt consists of the omission to perform an act which is yet in the power of the [contemner] to perform,\u201d may order the contemner \u201cimprisoned until he or she has performed it. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1219, subd.

As to actions filed after that date, the Legislature has suspended operation of section 128.5 until January 1, 1999, substituting in its place on a trial basis section 128.7, which was modeled on rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>(Crowley </em>v. <em>Katleman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 690, fn. 13 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 881 P.2d 1083].) Section 128.7 sets forth certification requirements for pleadings and authorizes courts to impose sanctions for violations of those requirements upon \u201cthe attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated\u201d the certification requirements \u201cor are responsible for the violation.\u201d (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (c).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"Agp\">Adoption of section 177.5 directly influenced the Legislature\u2019s decision to limit judicial power under section 575.2 to impose sanctions for noncompliance with local rules. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary cited the availability of monetary sanctions under section 177.5 as a justification for proposing the addition of subdivision (b) to section 575.2. The committee explained: \u201c[Last] week this committee passed [Assembly Bill No. 3573,] ... a bill that would allow courts to fine lawyers up to $1,500 for failing to comply with court orders. It would appear, therefore, that authorizing courts to indirectly penalize lawyers by dismissing causes of action under this bill would be superfluous should [Assembly Bill No.] 3573 become law.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3784 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 5,1982, p. 4.) At the request of amicus curiae Pacific Software Services, Inc., we take judicial notice of the committee\u2019s report. We also take judicial notice of the legislative reports the Avilas have submitted, and of legislative reports relating to other relevant statutes. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, 459; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 773, 780, fn. 9 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In their reply brief, the Avilas for the first time assert, with little argument in support, that the phrase \u201cauthorized by law\u201d in Government Code section 68608(b) includes a \u201ctrial court\u2019s inherent authority to dismiss cases for disobedience of its orders.\u201d Obvious reasons of fairness militate against our considering this poorly developed and untimely argument. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1116, fn. 20 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1]; <em>Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43].) This is especially true here, given the statutes we have discussed that specify the courts\u2019 sanctioning options. (See <em>Tide Water Assoc.
