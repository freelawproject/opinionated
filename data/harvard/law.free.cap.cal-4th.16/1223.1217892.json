A week earlier, he had sexually assaulted a different woman. Defendant pleaded guilty to first degree murder and admitted the special circumstances of attempted oral copulation and torture. After a penalty trial, the jury returned a verdict of death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">The information filed April 25, 1986, charged defendant with first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and alleged that he committed the murder while attempting to commit rape (former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii)) and unlawful oral copulation (former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(vi)). The information also alleged that the murder involved torture (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(18)) and that defendant used a deadly weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)). The information alleged defendant had two prior felony convictions (former \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)): possession of a concealed firearm by a felon (\u00a7 12021) and receiving stolen property (former \u00a7 496, subd. 1). Defendant admitted the two prior felony convictions before trial. Testimony began in defendant\u2019s trial on March 21, 1989. Two days later, defendant pleaded guilty to first degree murder and admitted the special circumstances of attempted oral copulation and torture. He also admitted personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. Defendant did not admit the attempted rape special circumstance, which the court dismissed at the prosecution\u2019s request. The penalty phase of defendant\u2019s trial began on April 4,1989. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury returned a verdict of death, and the court sentenced defendant to death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>The appeal to this court is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We briefly review the evidence at the guilt and penalty phases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">A. <em>Guilt Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">On the morning of December 12, 1985, Wendy Cheek told her friend, John Adkins, that she planned to attend a party at Adkins\u2019s house that evening. Adkins lived in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, not far from where Cheek lived. Cheek did not appear at the party. One week later, Adkins received a telephone call from Cheek\u2019s mother, who was worried because the family had not heard from her. Adkins looked for Cheek. He found her car parked near his house on the 900 block of Clayton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">On December 14, a motorist found a body in a grove of trees near highway 280 in San Mateo County. The body was naked, had numerous stab wounds, and was partially burned. Abandoned automobile parts had been placed over the body in an apparent attempt to conceal it. Fingerprints established that the body was Cheek\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">After the prosecution presented the above evidence, defendant changed his plea to guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">1. <em>Prosecution\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">Most of the evidence that would have been relevant at the guilt phase if defendant had not pleaded guilty was relevant at the penalty phase because it related to \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime\u201d or \u201cthe existence of [the] special circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a).) Accordingly, the prosecution\u2019s penalty phase evidence in some respects resembles a trial of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">The pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Cheek\u2019s body testified that Cheek had been burned extensively with gasoline but had died before being set on fire. A number of blunt injuries on Cheek\u2019s head and torso were consistent with blows from a fist. Multiple puncture wounds on the back of her head and neck appeared to be from a Phillips screwdriver. Other puncture wounds were consistent with stabbing by a barbecue fork. Stab wounds in her neck and upper back appeared to be from a knife. Two stab wounds, four and one-half to five inches deep, pierced Cheek\u2019s right lung and aorta, causing massive bleeding and death within a few minutes. Cheek had blood under her fingernails, suggesting she had scratched someone shortly before she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Phyllis Marie Kitchell Fairbank (Kitchell), who lived with defendant at 953 Clayton Street near where Adkins had found Cheek\u2019s car, testified that defendant often abused her physically, causing her to seek medical treatment. Kitchell was hospitalized in early December 1985. On the evening of December 12, the day Cheek disappeared, defendant visited Kitchell in the hospital. Defendant was upset and had fresh scratches on his face. He said two other people had gotten him involved in a murder. The murder had taken place \u201cup in the hills, in woods,\u201d but he did not admit personal involvement in the killing. The next day, defendant picked Kitchell up at the hospital. Defendant drove Kitchell\u2019s car, to which he had access while she was in the hospital. After meeting Kitchell, defendant picked up laundry from a laundromat, including bedding that he and Kitchell normally cleaned at home. When Kitchell arrived home, she discovered that a steamer trunk was missing. A car wash owner later found a bloodstained steamer trunk that matched the missing one abandoned at a San Francisco car wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">During the evening of December 14, defendant began to abuse Kitchell. He punched and kicked her repeatedly during this encounter. Kitchell called the police and claimed to have overdosed. An ambulance took her to the hospital. The next day, Kitchell admitted to a therapist at the hospital that she had not overdosed. She told the therapist what had really happened, and she again called the police. The police arrested defendant, and Kitchell returned home. Within a couple of days, Kitchell noticed that a rug from the front room was now in the bedroom. When Kitchell moved the rug, she noticed it covered a large hole in the carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Kitchell\u2019s sister, Toni Stracener, testified that she stayed for a few months at defendant\u2019s and Kitchell\u2019s apartment after Kitchell returned home from the hospital. On December 16, defendant called Stracener and told her part of the carpet was missing because the cats had soiled it. Defendant asked Stracener to replace the missing carpet. Stracener told defendant she would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Detective Mike Dirickson testified that he visited the apartment at 953 Clayton Street on December 27, 1985. Kitchell was speaking with defendant on the phone when Dirickson arrived. Defendant told Kitchell not to let the police in the apartment, but Stracener had already let them in. Defendant also told Kitchell to get rid of his jeans. Kitchell gave these jeans to the police. Kitchell had also discovered that her red bodysuit had blood on it and was stretched. She gave the bodysuit to the police. While Dirickson was at the apartment, defendant also spoke with Stracener. Stracener told defendant that tiie police were there, and defendant asked Stracener if she had replaced the missing carpet in the bedroom. Kitchell showed the police the missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>carpet. Dmckson observed blood along the edges of the carpet and blood spatters on the bed frame. Dmckson also examined Kitchell\u2019s car and found a flashlight with blood smeared on the handle and a Phillips screwdriver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">The next day, Dirickson returned to the apartment with a criminalist from the county forensic laboratory. The criminalist found blood on a wall above the bed, on a table adjacent to the bed, in the living room, and on the back door. He also discovered a large amount of blood on the mattress of the bed. Genetic marker testing indicated that the blood on the carpet and mattress matched Cheek\u2019s blood. The criminalist opined that only 1 in 66,000 people had that type of blood. The criminalist was able to rule out defendant\u2019s blood and Kitchell\u2019s blood. The criminalist also examined the blood found in the steamer trunk. Testing revealed this blood was consistent with Cheek\u2019s blood. Finally, the criminalist examined the blood on Kitchell\u2019s red bodysuit. It was consistent with Cheek\u2019s blood, and not Kitchell\u2019s blood. The criminalist returned to the apartment on January 2, 1986, and conducted luminol testing to detect blood that was not otherwise visible. The testing revealed footprints leading from the bedroom to other parts of the apartment. After comparing the footprints to sample footprints he had taken from defendant, the criminalist could not exclude defendant as the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">John Szymkiewicz testified that he became acquainted with defendant while occupying a jail cell near defendant\u2019s in the spring of 1986. Szymkiewicz was facing robbery, assault, and false imprisonment charges, and he admitted he had cooperated with police in return for a reduction of his own sentence from 22 or more years to 10 years. While in jail, defendant approached Szymkiewicz about having \u201ca girl named Phyllis\u201d hurt \u201cbecause she was a snitch.\u201d Defendant spoke to Szymkiewicz and also passed him notes. One note read, \u201cI want Phyllis &amp; her snitch ass sister beat on some &amp; scared to living hell, then smash in 25 [-inch] color TV, smash computer, &amp; anything else of value!!! I want the car totalled! I imagine the car can be done first or whatever these dudes decide. One of many reasons I want it done is to keep them from testifying against me next week!!\u201d In another note, defendant indicated he wanted Kitchell\u2019s leg or arms broken and wrote, \u201cI for sure want this done &amp; No I won\u2019t change my mind!!\u201d Defendant said he would pay Szymkiewicz. Kitchell testified that defendant called and threatened her before his preliminary hearing, telling her that \u201cother people\u201d would break her arms and legs if she testified against him. Stracener also testified that defendant called and threatened her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">Arlene G., who lived near defendant\u2019s apartment, testified that, on December 5, 1985, a week before Cheek\u2019s disappearance, she parked on defendant\u2019s block and stopped to pet a cat as she walked home. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>invited her to look at the cat\u2019s kittens. Once she was in a bedroom of defendant\u2019s apartment, defendant admitted he really had no kittens. As Arlene attempted to leave, defendant asked her if she wanted to make $1,000 modeling lingerie. Arlene was still trying to leave the apartment, getting within inches of the front door, when defendant grabbed her from behind and hit her hard on the left side of her face. Defendant continued to hit her before forcing her into a bedroom. He then forced her to orally copulate him. She tried to escape by winning his trust, but did not succeed. Defendant forced her to orally copulate him several more times. He also penetrated her vagina and anus with his finger and asked her to remove her clothing and put on a red bodysuit, which was very small. Defendant used a hypodermic needle to inject a brownish liquid into a vein in his arm, and he repeatedly asked Arlene if she wanted cocaine, though she did not see anything that looked like cocaine. He made numerous telephone calls, apparently in an attempt to purchase drugs and also to listen to pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Later, defendant apologized to Arlene for hitting her and said he wanted to take her out to dinner. Defendant permitted her to put her clothes back on, and they left the apartment together. When someone in a car passed close enough to hear Arlene scream, she walked away from defendant, who did not follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Dr. Deborah Heath, who had frequent contact with drug users, testified that drug users who want drugs sometimes insert a previously used hypodermic needle into a vein, draw out their blood, and then inject the blood back into the vein. The drug users believe the residue in the used syringe and needle will be enough to make them high.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">Jennifer Roth testified that, in October 1979, she lived with defendant on Irving Street in San Francisco. When defendant suspected Roth of having a relationship with another man, a fight ensued. Defendant tore up the bedroom, hit Roth, put a bullet in a pistol, spun the cartridge, put the barrel of the pistol to Roth\u2019s head, and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">The prosecution also presented evidence indicating that, on December 5, the day of the Arlene G. sexual assault, and again on December 12, the day Cheek disappeared, someone placed a series of telephone calls from defendant\u2019s apartment to a telephone number that connected to a pornographic recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">Finally, the prosecution presented documentary evidence of the following prior convictions: second degree burglary (June 24, 1975), receiving stolen property (Dec. 11, 1975), battery with serious bodily injury (Oct. 12, 1976), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>felon in possession of a weapon (Jan, 22, 1980), receiving stolen property (Apr. 26, 1983), and several counts of forced oral copulation and forced penetration of genital or anal openings (Sept. 25, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">The defense elicited from Kitchell on cross-examination that she met defendant when he was in the hospital receiving psychiatric treatment. They spent Christmas together, which was \u201cwonderful.\u201d They both liked camping, walking, going to the beach, and going to movies. They talked about having a family, owning a home, and possibly starting a business. Kitchell also described how cocaine use affected defendant\u2019s personality, causing paranoia and explosive outbursts of rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">The defense also elicited from Roth that, around the time defendant assaulted her with a pistol, defendant\u2019s personality changed because of heavier drug use. He lost weight, had needle track marks, became angry and paranoid, and abused himself. After receiving treatment for drug use, defendant became \u201cthe original self\u2019 whom Roth knew, \u201ca good person, a nice person, fun to be with.\u201d Roth testified that defendant rarely worked, that his mother helped support him, and that \u201che knew that he could get whatever he wanted from [his mother].\u201d After defendant\u2019s mother died, he received money from a trust fund that his mother established for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Dr. H. Westley Clark testified about the effects of defendant\u2019s longtime substance abuse. Dr. Clark reviewed defendant\u2019s medical and hospital records. He testified that the primary reasons for defendant\u2019s hospitalizations were cocaine dependency, alcohol abuse, and marijuana abuse. He also testified that defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain prescriptions for various tranquilizers in December 1985 were consistent with the effects of cocaine abuse. Dr. Clark concluded that defendant\u2019s \u201cchemical dependency was quite severe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">The defense also presented evidence relating to defendant\u2019s childhood. Defendant\u2019s father, Robert Fairbank, Sr., testified that defendant grew up in a \u201cvery nice\u201d neighborhood of a small resort community on the Connecticut coast. The family lived with defendant\u2019s maternal grandfather. Defendant\u2019s father agreed that he and his wife drank often, and he characterized his wife as a heavy drinker. He also testified that his father-in-law\u2019s wealth and interference in household affairs caused constant tension and resulted in fights with his wife. During one argument, defendant\u2019s mother spit in defendant\u2019s father\u2019s face. Defendant\u2019s father then hit her, and she fell through a glass door when she tried to retaliate. Defendant\u2019s father denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>hitting defendant, but other witnesses who knew the family testified that he often hit defendant, who was afraid of his father. As defendant grew older, he had a few minor brushes with the law, and two private schools expelled him. According to defendant\u2019s father, defendant\u2019s grandfather and mother spoiled defendant with presents whenever he did something wrong. On one occasion defendant\u2019s mother bought him a boat after police arrested him. In 1968, when defendant was 16 years old, he and his father got into a fight. Defendant hit his father, who suffered a broken rib. Defendant\u2019s parents were divorced a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">The defense called several witnesses who knew defendant and his family when he was growing up. Though he grew up in an affluent coastal community, one witness described defendant\u2019s upbringing as \u201cperfectly awful.\u201d Defendant\u2019s father was \u201cnasty, sarcastic, abusive,\u201d and a \u201cfrustrated, mean-spirited\u201d person who repeatedly verbally abused defendant\u2019s mother. Defendant\u2019s father also yelled at and humiliated defendant. Defendant feared his father. One witness described an occasion when defendant\u2019s father struck defendant hard in the face without provocation. This type of abuse was \u201ccommon knowledge in the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Defendant liked to perform dangerous stunts and had a reputation in the community as a \u201cbad boy.\u201d He stole money from a neighbor\u2019s house, and he and a friend frequently broke into summer houses. He repeatedly beat up this friend to show off to other friends. Despite this misbehavior, defendant\u2019s mother would make excuses for him and spoil him with \u201call sorts of material things.\u201d Defendant\u2019s grandfather would also spoil him and bail him out of trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Dr. Alfred Fricke, a clinical psychologist, performed research on defendant and his background and testified about defendant\u2019s psychological makeup. Dr. Fricke described defendant as a hyperactive child \u201cbom into . . . a family caldron.\u201d Defendant grew up with an \u201cabusive, angry dad\u201d who at some point \u201cgave up on him, and the kid could do no right.\u201d Dr. Fricke opined that defendant\u2019s father felt emasculated because he could not provide for his family alone. He had high expectations for his son. Dr. Fricke considered it significant that, while defendant\u2019s father abused defendant, his mother spoiled him but did nothing to stop his father\u2019s abuse. This type of background \u201csets up the pattern for a man to later on develop the kind of [abusive] relationships that he has as an adult.\u201d Dr. Fricke concluded that the conflicting signals defendant received from his parents prevented him from developing a conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">Dr. Fricke also administered a battery of psychological tests to defendant. The tests did not reveal that defendant suffered from any psychosis or mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>illness. Dr. Fricke concluded that defendant had an antisocial personality disorder and suffered from drug addiction. While defendant\u2019s drug addiction exacerbated his antisocial behavior, Dr. Fricke testified that defendant would still suffer from the antisocial personality disorder without the drugs. The drugs made defendant unpredictable, irrational, and paranoid. Nevertheless, according to Dr. Fricke, defendant was \u201cfully responsible for his behavior and his life.\u201d He was entirely capable of realizing that his various acts of theft, assault, and murder were wrong, but he just did not care about the consequences of his actions. Dr. Fricke thought defendant would respond well to the structured environment of prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">A. <em>Jury Selection Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">During voir dire, defendant unsuccessfully challenged various prospective jurors for cause (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 225, subd. (b)(1)), including Thomas A. Wood and Jerome J. Foster. Defendant later exercised peremptory challenges with respect to many of these individuals, but, with Wood and Foster still remaining on the prospective jury and with four unused peremptory challenges, defense counsel told the court, \u201cWe accept the panel.\u201d Defendant argues on appeal that the trial court improperly denied some of his challenges for cause, thus violating his \u201cright to an impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 16), his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7 &amp; 15), and his right to a reliable penalty determination under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15, &amp; 17).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">As we recently explained, \u201cTo preserve a claim of trial court error in failing to remove a juror for bias in favor of the death penalty, a defendant must either exhaust all peremptory challenges and express dissatisfaction with the jury ultimately selected or justify the failure to do so.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 667 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 573, 941 P.2d 752]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 988, 1005 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818, 874 P.2d 248]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 184 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1087 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, <em>774 </em>P.2d 659].) Defendant argues that here his failure to exercise all of his peremptory challenges was justified. He asserts that, when he accepted the jury, the jury panel from which the clerk was selecting prospective jurors included three persons whom defendant had unsuccessfully challenged for cause, two of whom he had challenged during both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>general voir dire and <em>Hovey </em>voir dire. <em>(Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 80 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301] [requiring individual, sequestered examination of jurors\u2019 attitudes about the death penalty].) He points out that, if he had exhausted his peremptory challenges and excluded Wood and Foster, \u201cthere was a clear possibility of having empaneled at least one juror, and possibly two, who had been challenged at both sessions.\u201d We do not, however, accept such after-the-fact justifications for a defendant\u2019s failure to exercise all peremptory challenges when, as here, the defendant offered no such justification at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 691 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 838 P.2d 729], the defendant asserted, as defendant does in this case, that, if he had exercised his peremptory challenge to exclude a particular juror, he might have ended up with a juror who was even more unfavorable. We rejected the argument, stating, \u201cBut the fact remains that counsel expressed satisfaction with the jury selected . . . , without using his remaining peremptory challenge and without requesting additional challenges. [\u00b6 . . . [\u00b6 . . . [W]e conclude that, by expressing his satisfaction with the jury without exhausting such challenges or requesting additional challenges, defendant waived his right to complain about the court\u2019s failure to excuse [a particular juror] for cause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 713-714.) Because defendant accepted the jury without reservation and without exhausting his peremptory challenges, he cannot now complain that the court should have granted his challenges for cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 355-356 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708]; see also <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 81, 86-88 [108 S.Ct. 2273, 2277-2278, 101 L.Ed.2d 80].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">B. <em>Guilt Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">1. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Original Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">John Szymkiewicz contacted police about information he had obtained, including notes he claimed defendant had written to him. Szymkiewicz reported that defendant had solicited him either to confess to Cheek\u2019s murder or to establish an alibi for defendant. The notes, which Szymkiewicz continued to receive after he contacted police, informed him about the details of Cheek\u2019s death so that he would be convincing when police questioned him. The notes included a detailed map of defendant\u2019s apartment, indicating the blood spot in the bedroom where Cheek apparently died. The notes also stated: \u201cI foolishly told lawyer where weapons were,\u201d \u201c[M]y attorneys now have weapons &amp; D.A. doesn\u2019t know it yet!\u201d and \u201cD.A. does not know that a BBQ fork was one of the weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">On July 22, 1986, the prosecution moved for an order compelling production of these weapons, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Meredith </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 682, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>694-695 [175 Cal.Rptr. 612, 631 P.2d 46] <em>(Meredith). In Meredith, </em>a defense investigator retrieved the victim\u2019s wallet from a trash can behind the defendant\u2019s home. The investigator gave the wallet to defense counsel, who examined it and then gave it to police. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 686.) We held that \u201c. . . whenever defense counsel removes or alters evidence, the statutory [attorney-client] privilege does not bar revelation of the original location or condition of the evidence in question.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 695, fn. omitted.) We noted that a contrary rule would \u201cpermit[] the defense in effect to \u2018destroy\u2019 critical information,\u201d because removal of the evidence would deprive the prosecution of the opportunity to observe the evidence in its original condition and location. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">In response to the prosecution\u2019s motion to compel production of evidence, defense counsel argued that, if they did have the weapons, which they did not admit, they did not have to produce them. Defense counsel relied on <em>Goldsmith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 76 [199 Cal.Rptr. 366] <em>(Goldsmith), </em>in which the prosecution sought to obtain, through pretrial discovery, a weapon the defendant had allegedly used in committing three felonies. The Court of Appeal held that production of the weapon would violate the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">The trial court denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to compel production of the weapons, but the Court of Appeal granted a petition for writ of mandate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Fairbank) </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 32 [237 Cal.Rptr. 158].) The court noted that, as in <em>Meredith, </em>and unlike <em>Goldsmith, </em>defense counsel had allegedly removed the murder weapons from the location where defendant had left them, thus preventing the prosecution from finding and observing them in place. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Fairbank), supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 39.) The court held that, when defense counsel removes or alters physical evidence, counsel must immediately inform the court. The court must then act to 'ensure the prosecution has timely access to the evidence and information about its alteration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 39-40.) The court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that, as long as they did not destroy or permanently conceal the evidence, they could withhold it from the court and the prosecution before trial in order to present it as part of the defense case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">After the Court of Appeal issued its decision, defense counsel turned over certain evidence to the prosecution, including a knife, clothing, and a steamer trunk. Defense counsel then sought a protective order barring the prosecution from presenting the evidence at trial. Defense counsel explained to the court outside the presence of the prosecution that they intended to offer this evidence as part of the defense case to establish defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>credibility with the jury \u201cbecause here is a man who is coming forward with what potentially from one valuation is inculpatory evidence.\u201d The trial court denied the protective order, the Court of Appeal denied defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate, and we denied review. At that point, because the notes to Szymkiewicz cast defense counsel \u201cin an odious light\" and because counsel had become potential prosecution witnesses, the court granted their motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">Defendant now argues that his original trial counsel were incompetent for moving this evidence. He rejects as making \u201cno sense\u201d counsel\u2019s purported strategy of offering the evidence to establish his credibility with the jury. He further argues counsel\u2019s incompetence prejudiced him because, had they not removed the evidence, investigators might never have found it. That circumstance, he argues, would have been far more favorable for his case than any use his counsel might have made of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">We cannot conclude that defendant\u2019s original trial counsel were incompetent without further development of the factual record, including, if available, sworn testimony addressing why counsel moved the evidence. The record indicates that counsel intended to offer the evidence as part of the defense case in order to establish defendant\u2019s credibility, but this explanation, which appears in unsworn statements counsel made to the trial court, may not be complete or wholly accurate. Therefore, whatever we might conclude about the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s purported strategy, the current record is inadequate to justify a finding that counsel were incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">In any case, when considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ca court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. ... If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 697 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d 674].) A defendant must prove prejudice that is a \u201c \u2018demonstrable reality,\u2019 not simply speculation.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 883, 937 [245 Cal.Rptr. 336, 751 P.2d 395], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 652, 661 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820].) Prejudice requires \u201ca reasonable probability that a more favorable outcome would have resulted .... i.e., a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>(In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 766 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729], citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 693-694 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2067-2068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Here, defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice assumes the prosecution would never have obtained the knife, the clothes, and the steamer trunk but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>for his counsel\u2019s actions. We cannot determine whether this assumption is correct without a more complete factual record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza Tello </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134].) Moreover, the limited record that we have does not establish that the knife, the clothes, and the steamer trunk played a key role in defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. For example, in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, defendant did not assert that he pleaded guilty because of this evidence. Other evidence in this case included the location of Cheek\u2019s car near defendant\u2019s apartment, fresh scratches on defendant\u2019s face on the evening Cheek disappeared, traces of blood under Cheek\u2019s fingernails, defendant\u2019s admission to Kitchell that he was involved in a murder, the large hole in defendant\u2019s carpet, defendant\u2019s varied efforts to conceal evidence of the crime, blood in defendant\u2019s apartment that closely matched Cheek\u2019s blood, blood in Kitchell\u2019s car, blood on Kitchell\u2019s red bodysuit, defendant\u2019s detailed notes to Szymkiewicz indicating private knowledge about the crime and the murder weapons, defendant\u2019s request that Szymkiewicz hire someone to injure Kitchell and Stracener, Arlene G.\u2019s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her just a week before Cheek disappeared and that he repeatedly called a pornography telephone number during the course of the assault, telephone calls from defendant\u2019s apartment to a pornography telephone number on the day Cheek disappeared, and Jennifer Roth\u2019s testimony that defendant recklessly pulled the trigger on a partially loaded pistol while pointing it at her head. Given all this evidence, which may not be the extent of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, defendant has not established a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he would not have pleaded guilty if the prosecution had never obtained the knife, the clothes, and the steamer trunk. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 694 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Defendant argues that the prosecution had little evidence supporting the special circumstance allegations of attempted oral copulation and torture. Because defendant admitted these allegations, we do not know what evidence the prosecution may have had. In any case, the additional evidence the prosecution obtained as a result of defense counsel\u2019s actions\u2014that is, the knife, the clothes, and the steamer trunk\u2014was at most marginally relevant to the special circumstance allegations. Moreover, we can discern from the penalty phase record that the prosecution had at least circumstantial evidence indicating defendant followed a pattern of conduct with Cheek similar to that which he had followed a week earlier with Arlene G., including attempted oral copulation. Similarly, the multiple blunt injuries and stab wounds on Cheek\u2019s body, indicating blows from a fist and separate attacks with three different weapons, supported a finding of torture. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 139-140 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887] [multiple stab wounds sufficient to prove torture].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>2. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Replacement Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Defendant also argues that, after his original counsel withdrew, his replacement counsel were incompetent for conceding to the jury during voir dire that defendant had killed Cheek, for later advising him to plead guilty \u201cwithout <em>any </em>reciprocal benefit,\u201d and for consenting to the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">\u201cIt is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. [Citation.] A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 689 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065].)  During voir dire, counsel could reasonably have decided, in light of very strong evidence that defendant killed Cheek, to concede that point and focus the jury\u2019s attention on the degree of murder and the truth of the special circumstance allegations. Defendant cites no case suggesting this strategy constitutes ineffective assistance. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 498 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, 31 A.L.R.5th 888]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 975, 988 [244 Cal.Rptr. 905, 750 P.2d 794]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 292-293 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s subsequent guilty plea and admission of two of the special circumstance allegations were reasonable tactical decisions in light of the compelling evidence against defendant, and therefore they do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, assuming defendant acted on the advice of counsel. As noted, most of the evidence that the jury would have considered as part of the guilt phase if defendant had not pleaded guilty was also relevant at the penalty phase because it related to \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime\u201d or \u201cthe existence of [the] special circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a).) Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s guilty plea and other admissions enabled him to prevent the jury from seeing or hearing about many of the notes he wrote to Szymkiewicz, because the trial court ruled that these notes, which would have been admissible at the guilt phase of trial to show consciousness of guilt, should be excluded from the penalty phase. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>court\u2019s decision to exclude these notes was, of course, discretionary, and we do not mean to suggest that a defendant can guarantee the exclusion of certain evidence by pleading guilty. We merely conclude that in this case defendant\u2019s guilty plea enabled him to prevent the jury from learning of these notes, and in that sense it was tactically reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Moreover, by pleading guilty, defendant could try to cast himself in a sympathetic light to the jury. Defendant argues that his counsel squandered this potential advantage by not asking for juror sympathy on his behalf. Counsel argued, \u201cYou will not hear me ask for your sympathy for Mr. Fairbank. Your sympathy, my sympathy[,] everybody\u2019s sympathy is not for Mr. Fairbank, it\u2019s with Miss Cheek.\u201d Nevertheless, counsel did not forgo the opportunity to emphasize to the jury that defendant had admitted his guilt, saying, \u201cHe must be punished, and we must be protected. Even Mr. Fairbank has accepted that by virtue of pleading guilty.\u201d Counsel also argued, \u201cWell, by his guilty plea in this case, Mr. Fairbank, I think, has made [as] strong a statement to you as he can that... he can accept some blame for what he\u2019s done.\u201d Finally, at the end of the argument counsel said, \u201c[A]fter a lifetime of wrong doing [sz'c], a lifetime of denying responsibility, for one of the few times in his life [defendant] did something right and appropriate, pled guilty to these charges. No deals. No plea bargaining. No promises. ... He just pled guilty. For once he did the right thing. After doing many wrong ones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Thus, counsel clearly asked the jurors to view defendant as favorably as they could under the circumstances. As we have said, where \u201ccounsel could reasonably have viewed the guilt phase evidence as overwhelming^ w]ithin the bounds of reasonable tactical decisionmaking, he could also have perceived a guilty plea as a demonstration of appellant\u2019s honesty and candor that would elicit jury sympathy or, at a minimum, avoid an irremediable adverse jury reaction to an unfounded denial of the crimes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wrest </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1088, 1115 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 511, 839 P.2d 1020].) Defendant attempts to distinguish <em>Wrest, </em>arguing that, unlike the defendant in <em>Wrest, </em>he changed his plea to guilty after his counsel had conceded during voir dire that he had killed Cheek and after the prosecution began presenting evidence. Neither distinction is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">During voir dire, defense counsel conceded only that the jury would find defendant guilty of killing Cheek. They did not concede the degree of murder or the truth of any of the special circumstance allegations. The subsequent guilty plea was a more comprehensive acknowledgment of wrongdoing and enhanced the tactical benefits of the earlier concession. The fact that the prosecution had already begun to present evidence when defendant pleaded guilty did not undermine these tactical benefits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>prosecution had only presented a small part of its evidence, and it did not present the same evidence a second time during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">Defendant also argues that, unlike the defendant in <em>Wrest, </em>he had strong defenses to the special circumstance allegations. Because of defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the record does not disclose what these defenses would have been. Nevertheless, as we discussed above, we can discern from the penalty phase record that the prosecution had persuasive evidence supporting the allegations of attempted oral copulation and torture. Admitting these allegations was a reasonable strategic choice under the circumstances. These admissions strengthened defendant\u2019s argument for exclusion of unfavorable evidence from the penalty phase, and they allowed defendant to present himself to the jury as being fully cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Finally, defendant argues that, even if we find he was not prejudiced by the incompetence of his original counsel or his replacement counsel, we should find the cumulative effect of their incompetence to have been prejudicial. He asserts violations of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution and article I, sections 1, 7, 15, 16, and 17 of the state Constitution. Because we do not find that his replacement counsel were incompetent, defendant\u2019s cumulative effect argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">3. <em>Factual Basis for Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Defendant argues that the trial court failed to make an adequate record of the facts that supported his guilty plea and special circumstance admissions. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoffard </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1170 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 899 P.2d 896], we held that a trial court has no duty to inquire into the factual basis of a plea that is \u201cunconditioned upon receipt of a particular sentence or other exercise of the court\u2019s powers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1181.) We noted that section 1192.5 requires the trial court to \u201c \u2018satisfy itself. . . that there is a factual basis for the plea,\u2019 \u201d but that section, by its terms, applies only to \u201cnegotiated pleas.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoffard, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1181, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 868, 871 [112 Cal.Rptr. 556, 519 P.2d 604].) We acknowledged that \u201c[conducting a factual basis inquiry . . .may further important interests,\u201d and \u201cwe approve[d] of the practice ... of attempting to ensure the existence of a factual basis for all guilty and no contest pleas,\u201d but we \u201cdecline[d] ... to impose, as a new rule of criminal procedure, a duty for the trial court in all cases to establish on the record the existence and nature of the factual basis for a plea.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoffard, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 1183-1184, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">Defendant now asks us to impose this duty for all <em>capital </em>cases. He argues that in capital cases \u201cthe fairness and accuracy of the process deserves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>greater scrutiny,\u201d and \u201cthe pressure to [plead guilty] may be undeniably strong.\u201d He also reasserts that in this case the prosecution had little evidence to support the special circumstance allegations. He recognizes that defense counsel stipulated to the factual basis of his plea and admissions, but he argues that a stipulation is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">We do not agree that the possibility of receiving the death penalty would increase the pressure on a defendant to plead guilty. On the contrary, we think the possibility of receiving the death penalty would cause a defendant to think very carefully before entering a guilty plea. Of course, fairness and accuracy are important in all criminal proceedings, whether or not involving the death penalty, but we do not believe that a rule requiring the trial court to inquire into the factual basis of an unconditioned plea is either necessary or appropriate to protect defendants in capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">4. <em>Massiah Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">As noted, John Szymkiewicz, who was awaiting sentencing, contacted police about information he had, including certain notes he claimed defendant had written him. On May 14, 1986, Detectives Dirickson and Poynter of the San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Department met with Szymkiewicz, who told them what he knew and asked about a possible \u201cdeal\u201d with respect to his sentence. The detectives told Szymkiewicz they would talk to the district attorney, but they did not suggest a deal was probable; they made no promises; and they did not instruct Szymkiewicz to try to obtain more information from defendant. They added that they needed proof, i.e., the original notes, but Szymkiewicz would not provide the notes until he had \u201csome kind of solid deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">After Szymkiewicz first met with police, defendant continued to provide him information about the Cheek murder, including more notes, but Szymkiewicz did not initiate these contacts. Szymkiewicz also had further discussions with Detectives Poynter and Dirickson. Most of these discussions concerned the status of negotiations with respect to his sentence. The detectives told him the deputy district attorney handling his case was not inclined to make a deal, and they continued to ask him for the notes. To show the detectives what information he possessed, Szymkiewicz recopied the notes in his own handwriting and gave the copies to the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">The detectives again made no promises to Szymkiewicz. They did not instruct him to elicit more information from defendant, and they did not suggest that more information would facilitate negotiations with the district attorney. Detective Poynter, however, believed Szymkiewicz was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>continue to try to obtain information from defendant. In addition, the deputy district attorney handling defendant\u2019s case intervened to prevent the sheriff\u2019s department from moving defendant, hoping he would continue to provide Szymkiewicz with information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Defendant and his attorneys discovered Szymkiewicz was an informant on May 23, 1986. Szymkiewicz eventually turned over the original notes and received a lower sentence than he otherwise would have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Defendant moved to exclude the notes and defendant\u2019s oral statements to Szymkiewicz pursuant to <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201, 206-207 [84 S.Ct. 1199, 1203, 12 L.Ed.2d 246] <em>(Massiah). </em>Defendant argued that Szymkiewicz acted as a government agent who deliberately elicited incriminating information from defendant, in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present during interrogation. After a hearing on the merits, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that there is no <em>Massiah </em>violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">To prove a violation of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant \u201cmust establish that the informant . . . was acting as a government agent, i.e., under the direction of the government pursuant to a preexisting arrangement, with the expectation of some resulting benefit or advantage.\u201d <em>(In re Neely </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 901, 915 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 864 P.2d 474].) If an informant \u201cacts on his own initiative,\u201d even if he interrogates the accused, \u201cthe government may not be said to have deliberately elicited the statements.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitt </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 724, 742 [205 Cal.Rptr. 810, 685 P.2d 1161]; see also <em>In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 915; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1240 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159].) \u201c[A] preexisting arrangement [with government agents], however, . . . need not be explicit or formal, but may be \u2018inferred from evidence that the parties behaved as though there were an agreement between them, following a particular course of conduct\u2019 over a period of time. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 915, quoting <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>York </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 933 F.2d 1343, 1357.) Specific direction from government agents <em>(In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 915) or a prior working relationship with government agents <em>(id. </em>at pp. 917-918; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1241) can establish an implicit agreement.

Here, the trial court reasonably found that police did not use Szymkiewicz deliberately to elicit incriminating statements and writings from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">With respect to notes and information defendant gave to Szymkiewicz before Szymkiewicz first contacted the police, we see no Sixth Amendment violation. Szymkiewicz acted wholly on his own initiative, and police did nothing to elicit defendant\u2019s admissions. \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment is not violated whenever\u2014by luck or happenstance\u2014the State obtains incriminating statements from the accused after the right to counsel has attached.\u201d <em>(Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 159, 176 [106 S.Ct. 477, 487, 88 L.Ed.2d 481]; see also <em>In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 915; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 1240-1241; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1127, 1141 [245 Cal.Rptr. 635, 751 P.2d 901]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitt, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 742-743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">After meeting with police, Szymkiewicz continued to obtain information from defendant, but his contact with police did not by itself make him a police agent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitt, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 744.) Of course, Szymkiewicz may have hoped to receive some benefit in exchange for his ongoing receipt of information, but he nevertheless continued to act on his own initiative. Defendant contends the police and Szymkiewicz operated under an implicit agreement.  As noted, a court can infer an agreement between police and an informant if \u201c \u2018the parties behaved as though there were an agreement between them, following a particular course of conduct\u2019 over a period of time. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 915, quoting <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>York, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 1357.) In addition, an informant\u2019s prior working relationship with police may imply an agreement <em>(In re Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 917-918), particularly when police knew from the circumstances that the informant likely \u201cwould take affirmative steps to secure incriminating information.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 264, 271 [100 S.Ct. 2183, 2187, 65 L.Ed.2d 115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">Here, Detective Poynter believed that Szymkiewicz would continue to try to obtain information from defendant, and a deputy district attorney intervened to prevent the sheriff\u2019s department from moving defendant away from Szymkiewicz. But the police made no promises to Szymkiewicz about a possible deal, they did not direct him to obtain more information, and they did not suggest that obtaining more information would benefit him. The trial court specifically found that Szymkiewicz \u201ccontinued to talk to the defendant on his [own] initiative,\u201d and \u201claw enforcement. . . made deliberate and direct efforts and attempts to do everything they could to dispel the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>they would be able to be of any help [to Szymkiewicz] and that there was any implied promise of leniency.\u201d Substantial evidence supports these findings of the trial court, and therefore we must defer to them. \u201cThe police simply made use of [Szymkiewicz\u2019s] own motivation to inform on defendant, a technique we found not to be a knowing subversion of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel in <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Whitt, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pages 742-743.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pensinger </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1250 [278 Cal.Rptr. 640, 805 P.2d 899].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Defendant asserts, citing evidence not in the record, that, before Szymkiewicz informed about defendant, he had acted as an informant about prison gangs to the California Department of Corrections. Of course, we cannot consider on appeal evidence that is not in the record. <em>(In re Carpenter </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 634, 646 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 889 P.2d 985].) In addition, assuming Szymkiewicz did act as an informant about prison gangs, defendant does not assert that Detectives Poynter and Dirickson were aware of this fact, and therefore it does not establish an implicit agreement between them and Szymkiewicz. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitt, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 744, &amp; fn. 14.) Moreover, even if the police and Szymkiewicz had an implicit agreement, defendant did not show that Szymkiewicz \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d information from him. <em>(Massiah, supra, </em>377 U.S. at p. 206 [84 S.Ct. at p. 1203].) Szymkiewicz denied initiating any communications with defendant, and defendant presented no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Finally, defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s erroneous denial of his <em>Massiah </em>motion \u201cviolated [his] rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution and under article I, sections 1, 7, 13, and 15-17, of the California Constitution, to due process, to fundamental fairness, to confrontation of witnesses, to assistance of counsel, to not incriminate himself, and to be free from outrageous governmental conduct.\u201d Because we conclude the trial court properly denied the <em>Massiah </em>motion, all these related claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">C. <em>Penalty Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">1. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-9\">Defendant argues that his counsel were incompetent for using Dr. Alfred Fricke as an expert witness and for making certain negative statements about defendant during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">Dr. Fricke diagnosed defendant as having an antisocial personality disorder, meaning a limited conscience, a diagnosis that is relatively common for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>criminals. Dr. Fricke stated that people like defendant \u201cdon\u2019t take responsibility for their behavior,\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t see much remorse.\u201d Dr. Fricke testified that defendant\u2019s drug use aggravated the situation. Dr. Fricke did not, however, believe defendant was psychotic or schizophrenic, and he concluded defendant was \u201cfully responsible for his behavior and his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Defendant argues that Dr. Fricke\u2019s testimony that cocaine psychosis was \u201ctransient\u201d and \u201cshort-lived\u201d undermined Dr. H. Westley Clark\u2019s testimony that cocaine psychosis might last \u201cas long as six months.\u201d Defendant also complains that Dr. Fricke put too much emphasis on defendant\u2019s inherent antisocial predisposition and lack of conscience. Defendant objects that the \u201cthe overall tenor\u201d of Dr. Fricke\u2019s testimony was unsympathetic to him and that it undermined his strategy of convincing the jury he felt remorse for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Defendant has the burden of proving counsel\u2019s \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... [\u00b6... under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065].)  Dr. Fricke\u2019s partly negative evaluation of defendant is hardly surprising in light of defendant\u2019s negative personal history. Defense counsel may well have concluded that Dr. Fricke would gain credibility with jurors by being forthright rather than trying to pretend defendant was someone he clearly was not. In fact, counsel argued to the jury, \u201cJurors come to court . . . assuming that the defense attorneys are going . . . to try to, perhaps put a white wash over what the defendant is and what he\u2019s done. . . . [W]e\u2019ve done the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Moreover, the thrust of Dr. Fricke\u2019s testimony was favorable to defendant. Dr. Fricke explained how defendant\u2019s inherent qualities and the different elements of his troubled upbringing combined to his detriment. Dr. Fricke confirmed that defendant\u2019s drug abuse played an important role in his violent criminal behavior. Finally, Dr. Fricke opined that defendant would respond well in the structured environment of prison. Dr. Fricke\u2019s testimony that defendant was responsible for his behavior was consistent with defendant\u2019s guilty plea and did not undermine his defense. In sum, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s decision to use Dr. Fricke as an expert witness \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... [\u00b6... under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1224 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">Defendant also argues that his counsel demonstrated incompetence in closing argument because they repeatedly expressed disdain and reprobation for defendant\u2019s actions. For example, counsel \u201ccondem[ned defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>for what he\u2019s done\u201d and told the jury, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to suggest anything to his credit. By his actions against Miss Cheek he clearly has given up any right to function in our free society. [\u00b6 [The prosecutor] is wrong. You will not hear me asking for mercy for Mr. Fairbank. You will not hear me ask for your sympathy for Mr. Fairbank. Your sympathy, my sympathy[,] everybody\u2019s sympathy is not for Mr. Fairbank, it\u2019s with Miss Cheek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Closing argument is as much an art as a science, particularly when counsel is faced with the delicate and difficult task of convincing a jury to exercise leniency toward an individual who has admitted brutal crimes. Counsel must establish as much credibility with the jurors as possible if his effort to persuade them is to succeed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1224-1225.) Here, counsel may well have thought that asking for sympathy or speaking favorably about defendant would merely alienate the jurors. Instead, counsel\u2019s apparent strategy was to align themselves with the jurors, winning their trust by expressing some of the same emotions they were likely feeling. Counsel\u2019s argument did not \u201c[fall] below an objective standard of reasonableness . . . HO . . . under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 988-989.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">We conclude defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of any of his state and federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">2. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">Defendant argues the prosecutor committed misconduct by introducing into evidence defendant\u2019s racial slur. In the course of evaluating defendant, Dr. Fricke administered the \u201cWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2014 Revised\u201d test. One part of the test required defendant to answer a series of factual questions such as, \u201cAt what temperature does water boil?\u201d; \u201cWho was President of the United States during the Civil War?\u201d; and \u201cIn what month is Labor Day?\u201d During cross-examination of Dr. Fricke, the prosecutor inquired about the test, asking how defendant had responded to specific questions. One of the questions was: \u201cWho was Martin Luther King?\u201d When the prosecutor asked about defendant\u2019s response to that question, Dr. Fricke testified that defendant responded: \u201cA dead nigger, don\u2019t like Black people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">Defendant points out that the trial court had earlier prohibited the prosecutor from inquiring whether psychological testing had revealed anything about defendant\u2019s racial attitudes. Defendant argues the prosecutor committed misconduct by soliciting from Dr. Fricke defendant\u2019s answer to the test question about Martin Luther King.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>Because defendant raised no objection at trial, he cannot challenge the propriety of the evidence on appeal. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 168, fn. 15 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) By interposing an objection, defendant probably could have prevented the jury from hearing defendant\u2019s answer to the test question about Martin Luther King. The record indicates that the prosecutor only knew a key word from each question, not the entire question. Therefore, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWhat is question 17 about a king?\u201d Dr. Fricke responded, \u201c \u2018Who was Martin Luther King?,\u2019 \u201d and the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid he answer that one?\u201d Dr. Fricke answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and the prosecutor asked, \u201cWhat did he say on that one?\u201d Dr. Fricke then gave the answer, \u201cA dead nigger, don\u2019t like Black people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">As soon the prosecutor mentioned \u201cquestion 17 about a king,\u201d defense counsel, who presumably had access to Dr. Fricke\u2019s records and knew defendant\u2019s answers to each of the test questions, could have predicted where the questioning would lead and could have objected. Because the prosecutor had to ask Dr. Fricke two more questions before eliciting defendant\u2019s racist comment, defense counsel had ample time in which to interrupt the line of inquiry. Instead, defense counsel remained silent. In addition, defense counsel could have objected after Dr. Fricke reported defendant\u2019s racist comment, in which case the court could have admonished the jury not to take defendant\u2019s racial attitudes into account. An admonishment of that kind would have negated any possibility of prejudice to defendant. Because counsel did not object at trial, defendant\u2019s present claim of prosecutorial misconduct fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">D. <em>Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">After the jury returned a verdict of death, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and his admission of the special circumstance allegations. (\u00a7 1018.) The trial court held a hearing. Defendant testified that the night before he changed his plea to guilty, he participated in a jailhouse party. He and other jail inmates had manufactured a crude alcoholic beverage using water, sugar, and fruit. Defendant testified that he drank six to nine 12-ounce cups of this mixture. At the same time, defendant was taking medications to help him cope with the anxiety of his trial. Defendant took his usual dosage of medication the night of the party. Defendant claimed he had previously saved a number of tablets and distributed these to friends at the party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>Defendant stated he was \u201c[v]ery drunk\u201d and went to sleep about 2 or 3 a.m. Other prisoners more or less corroborated defendant\u2019s testimony about the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Defendant testified that the morning of his guilty plea, he woke at 8:50 a.m. still drunk from the party. Sheriff\u2019s deputies took him to court. He stated that his lawyers pressured him to plead guilty, saying he was \u201cdone for\u201d and that he \u201cd[id]n\u2019t have a prayer at trial.\u201d He said he was scared and depressed, knowing he was pleading guilty \u201cwith no plea bargaining whatsoever.\u201d Counsel advised him that a guilty plea would improve his chances of a favorable verdict at the penalty phase. He agreed to plead guilty and signed the plea form. He \u201cwas in a haze\u201d and did not \u201cknow what was being said.\u201d He stated that he responded to the court\u2019s questions mechanically and could not remember details of the proceeding. He said he was \u201ctrying to keep from falling out of [the] chair\u201d because he was so drunk. His only concern was getting out of the courtroom. He testified that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had not been intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Defendant also presented the testimony of Dr. H. Westley Clark, who discussed the interaction between alcohol and the medications defendant was taking. Dr. Clark opined that the combination of alcohol and medications that defendant claimed to have consumed could \u201cpossiblfy]\u201d have impaired his judgment on the morning of the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">The prosecution presented the testimony of Dr. Richard Hayward, a psychologist who monitored defendant\u2019s response to medication. Dr. Hayward testified that he observed defendant the day before he changed his plea and determined that the medication, which defendant had then been taking for a few weeks, was not causing any disordered thinking or confusion. The prosecution also presented the testimony of Dr. Randall Clint Baselt, a forensic toxicologist, and Dr. Sayed Hamed, the psychiatrist who prescribed defendant\u2019s medication. These witnesses opined that the sedative effect of defendant\u2019s medications would have worn off by the time defendant entered his guilty plea. They also testified that defendant would have had visible signs of intoxication if he had consumed the amounts he claimed. Finally, Dr. Hamed reviewed the transcript of defendant\u2019s guilty plea and found no indication of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">The prosecution also presented the testimony of sheriff\u2019s deputies, who stated that defendant did not seem intoxicated at all when they transported him to court the morning he changed his plea. These deputies were observing defendant closely because of the significance of his change of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his admissions. The court disbelieved defendant, who obviously had an interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>in exaggerating the extent of his intoxication, concluding that defendant had in fact consumed less alcohol than he claimed, if any. The court stressed that it had observed defendant carefully the morning he changed his plea and that defendant showed no signs at that time of intoxication. The court found defendant had not met his burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that he entered his plea unknowingly. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 585 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 562, 566 [116 Cal.Rptr. 242, 526 P.2d 250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">A decision to deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea \u201c \u2018rests in the sound discretion of the trial court\u2019 \u201d and is final unless the defendant can show a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>(In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 679, 685 [108 Cal.Rptr. 801, 511 P.2d 1153], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Francis </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 335, 338 [267 P.2d 8].) Moreover, a reviewing court must adopt the trial court\u2019s factual findings if substantial evidence supports them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quesada </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 525, 533 [281 Cal.Rptr. 426].)  Here, substantial evidence, including the trial court\u2019s own observations of defendant, supports the court\u2019s factual determination that defendant was not intoxicated at the time he entered his guilty plea and that his plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Because the jury had returned a verdict of death, defendant had a strong incentive to exaggerate his intoxication. Defendant\u2019s testimony was inherently implausible. He stated twice that he was so drunk he was falling out of his chair, but other witnesses observed no signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Defendant asserts his counsel knew he was taking medication, and he argues they should have reported this fact to the court at the time of the guilty plea, but defendant points to no evidence that supports his assertion. Defendant also argues that he <em>implicitly </em>moved to withdraw his plea on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, defendant notes that a new attorney handled his motion to withdraw the plea, though his usual attorneys remained counsel of record. Use of a new attorney to argue a motion does not, by itself, establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, as we discussed above, defendant has not shown that his counsel were ineffective. Accepting as true defendant\u2019s testimony that counsel told him he had little chance for an acquittal and that a guilty plea might improve his chances at the penalty phase, this advice was reasonable in light of the evidence. Because of defendant\u2019s guilty plea and admissions, the jury did not see many of the notes defendant wrote to Szymkiewicz describing the details of his crimes, and defense counsel were also able to use the plea to defendant\u2019s advantage during argument at the penalty phase. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s assertion that his counsel would have abandoned him if required to defend a guilt phase trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">E. <em>Constitutionality of California\u2019s Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Defendant raises various constitutional contentions that we have previously rejected. We adhere to our prior decisions. First, the death penalty is not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution <em>(Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 153, 169 [96 S.Ct. 2909, 2923, 49 L.Ed.2d 859] (lead opn. of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); see also <em>Tuilaepa </em>v. <em>California </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 980 [114 S.Ct. 2630, 2639, 129 L.Ed.2d 750] [affirming death sentences in cases involving California law]) or article I, section 17 of the California Constitution (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 186 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587]). Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissent from the high court\u2019s denial of certiorari in <em>Callins </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1994) 510 U.S. 1141, 1143 [114 S.Ct. 1127, 1128-1129, 127 L.Ed.2d 435] does not convince us otherwise. Second, California\u2019s homicide and death penalty laws sufficiently narrow the class of homicide offenders eligible for the death penalty to satisfy the federal Constitution, and we decline to construe the California Constitution differently from the federal Constitution on this point. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 419-420; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at pp. 154-156.) Third, the use of lethal gas to impose death is not \u201c \u2018 \u201ca ground for reversal of the judgment of death. It bears solely on the legality of the execution of the sentence and not on the validity of the sentence itself.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 864 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 876, 896 [256 P.2d 911].) Moreover, defendant can at his option elect death by lethal injection (\u00a7 3604), and he does not assert that lethal injection is an unconstitutional method of imposing death. Fourth, the failure of California law to designate which of the factors in section 190.3 are mitigating and which are aggravating does not violate the state or federal Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 420; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montiel </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 944-945 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277]; see also <em>Tuilaepa </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 979 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2638] [\u201cA capital sentencer need not be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision.\u201d].) Fifth, neither the federal nor the state Constitution requires the jury to agree unanimously as to aggravating factors, or to find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factors exist, that they outweigh mitigating factors, or that death is the appropriate sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 421; <em>People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 709-710 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640]; <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number><em>Bacigalupo </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 147 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559] [addressing unanimity]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 935-936 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676] [addressing burden of proof].) Sixth, neither the federal nor the state Constitution requires the jury to make written findings in which it specifies the aggravating factors on which it relies. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 421; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 909-910 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Defendant argues that the collective effect of these asserted deficiencies in California\u2019s death penalty law violates the federal and state Constitutions. We disagree. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 419-421.) Finally, defendant argues that, on the facts of this case, imposition of the death penalty would violate the federal and state Constitutions. Again, we disagree. Jennifer Roth testified that defendant put a bullet in a pistol, put the barrel to her head, and pulled the trigger, thus demonstrating complete indifference to human life. Arlene G. testified that defendant repeatedly sexually assaulted her just a week before he killed Wendy Cheek. Circumstantial evidence suggested defendant engaged in conduct with Cheek similar to that in which he had engaged with Arlene G. Finally, multiple stab wounds and blunt injuries on Cheek\u2019s body, as well as defendant\u2019s admission of the attempted oral copulation and torture special circumstances, all support the death sentence. On this evidence, \u201cthe death sentence is certainly not so disproportionate that it shocks the conscience [or] offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Livaditis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 759, 786 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 831 P.2d 297].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">George, C.
