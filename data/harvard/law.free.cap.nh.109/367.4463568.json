The declared purpose of that act was to provide for a commission to operate, maintain, develop, improve and promote the Belknap county recreational area owned by the county of Belknap. The commission was \u201cincorporated as a body politic and as an agency of the county of Belknap . . . .\u201d The bill would change the commission\u2019s charter by limiting members of the commission to no more than two consecutive terms, deleting a requirement of annual reports, and requiring a budget to be submitted to the county convention under specified circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">Part I, Article 39th of the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire adopted in 1966 provides that no law changing the charter of a particular city or town shall become effective except upon approval of the voters of such city or town upon a referendum to be provided for in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">RSA 21:5 provides that \u201cthe word \u2018town\u2019 shall extend and be applied to any place incorporated, or whose inhabitants are required to pay any tax, and shall mean that city, town, ward, or place in which the subject-matter referred to is situate, or in which the persons referred to are resident, unless from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>context, a different intention is manifest. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">You submitted the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201c1. Does the word \u2018town\u2019 as used in Part 1, Article 39th of the Constitution of New Hampshire have the same meaning as the statutory definition of the word \u2018town\u2019 in RSA 21:5?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u201c2. Does the term \u2018town\u2019 as used in Part 1, Article 39th include the Belknap County Recreational Commission so that any change in the charter of said commission shall require a referendum?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In our opinion the Belknap county recreational area commission is not a town within the meaning of Part I, Article 39th of the Constitution, but as the statute creating it states, is a body politic and \u201cagency of the county of Belknap\u201d created for the specific purpose stated in the act. Laws of 1959, chapter 399. That act does not incorporate the inhabitants of the area but simply incorporates the commission. Part I, Article 39th of the Constitution by requiring \u201capproval of the voters of . . . such town\u201d clearly refers only to those subdivisions of government which include \u201cvoters.\u201d The answer to your second question is therefore in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">We respectfully decline to answer your first question, an answer to which is unnecessary in view of our answer to your second question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-10\">Frank R.
