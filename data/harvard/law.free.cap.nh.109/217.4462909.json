The plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the decree \u201c as being against the weight of the evidence and the law \u201d was denied subject to exception, and the questions presented by her exception were transferred by the Presiding Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">The only issue raised before this court is the validity of the order of custody of the two younger sons of the parties, who were six and nine years of age when the order was entered. At the hearing the father testified that since he worked during the daytime hours, it would be necessary for him to place these children in the care of an orphanage; and at arguments It was stated by counsel that this had been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The authority of the Court to make an order of custody of the children of parents who are living apart is well established (RSA 458:35 ), and may be exercised even though a divorce or separation is denied. <em>Trow </em>v. <em>Trow, </em>95 N. H. 529; <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>103 N. H. 290. See also, <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>99 N. H. 117. The plaintiff urges that because of the tender years of the children, custody should have been granted to her, in preference to the order made which has resulted in their being placed in \u201c impersonal \u201d surroundings, where their contact with their parents is confined largely to week-ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It is elementary that custody orders rest in the discretion of the Trial Court, and that \u201cthe paramount and controlling consideration \u201d is the welfare of the children involved. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>96 N. H. 443, 444. In the case at bar there was evidence that the mother\u2019s employment caused her frequent absence from the home at night, and that the two older children of the parties, aged nineteen and seventeen, had both been in difficulties suggestive of their incompetence to care for their younger brothers in the absence of the parents. It appeared that the nine-year old boy had \u201clearning difficulties\u201d which required special schooling. Much of the testimony related to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct as a mother and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Trial Court could properly find upon the record that the welfare of the children required that they \u201c be under the supervision and guidance of the steadier hand of [their] father, \u201d (<em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>445) as against the supervision and care which they would probably receive if custody were entrusted to the mother. No magic formula exists by which the salvaging of human values can best be attained where a home is divided. Comments, Selected Essays on Family Law, 607, 620. The order made cannot be said to be against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
