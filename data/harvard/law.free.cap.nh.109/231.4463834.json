Section 2 thereof provides in part that it \u201cshall be unlawful for any person to . . . possess, have under his control . . . any narcotic drug. \u201d Trial by jury resulted in a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Defendant\u2019s exceptions to the refusal of the Trial Court to give an instruction to the jury requested during the trial; to the admission of certain evidence; to a portion of the State\u2019s argument; and to the response of the Court to a question posed by the jury were reserved and transferred by <em>Grant, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">There was evidence that about 5:00 P. M. on September 27, 1967, police officers, acting under the authority of a search warrant, entered defendant\u2019s bedroom and found her sleeping on a couch. She was awakened and advised of her constitutional rights \u201c under the Miranda warning. \u201d The officers showed her a search warrant for a wooden box in her bedroom containing packages of marijuana rolled up in tinfoil and let her look at it and read it. Lt. Engelhardt testified that Chief Wike then asked the defendant \u201c shall we look around for the marijuana or do you want to give it to us. \u201d He further testified that defendant said she would give it to him and went to the west wall of her bedroom where there was an antique box which the defendant picked up and brought over to the chief. The latter asked the defendant what was in the box and she told him it was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">There was evidence that this antique box contained 12 packages of a \u201cdark-brown green substance\u201d each package being wrapped in tinfoil. An expert witness testified that each of these packages contained marijuana and that the twelve of them totaled about 221.7 grams. This same expert testified that residual material removed from the bowl of a clay pipe seized by the police in defendant\u2019s bedroom, which she admitted owning, was found also to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>It was testified that when defendant was asked where she got the marijuana she stated a man brought it to her room the Sunday previous to the Wednesday in question. She stated further, it was testified, that this man, whom she identified as a friend, brought it in brick form and that \u201c she assisted him and they broke it up and weighed it and put it in packages to sell for twenty dollars a package. \u201d There was further testimony that defendant said she was keeping the marijuana for this friend and when asked \u201csuppose somebody came up here to get some,\u201d she stated \u201cif he sends some one up I am to charge twenty dollars a package for it. \u201d There was also testimony that when defendant was being questioned by a policewoman she stated \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is any harm in selling or using\u201d marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Defendant testified that the marijuana introduced in evidence was found in her room and that the box in which it was found \u201c is mine. \u201d She denied selling marijuana, giving it away or smoking it in her room although she admitted having used marijuana the previous summer on two occasions but stated she was not using it any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Trial Court properly charged the jury that the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the defendant had knowledge that the substance in the box in her bedroom was marijuana; (2) that she had knowledge of its presence in her room; (3 ) that she had custody of the drug and exercised dominion and control over it. <em>People </em>v. <em>Yeoman, </em>67 Cal. Reptr. 869, 874; <em>People </em>v. <em>Truelook, </em>35 Ill. 2d 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>237 N. E. 2d 697, 701 (Ill. 1968); <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>365 Mich. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">There is abundant evidence, and the defendant admitted on the stand, that she knew that the substance obtained by the police in her room was marijuana and that she had knowledge that it was present in her room in a box which she owned, from Sunday until the following Wednesday. There was also evidence which warranted the jury to find that the marijuana had been left in her custody by the friend who brought it to her room and that she could sell it for $20 per package to anyone sent to get some. The jury could therefore properly find that the defendant was in possession of the marijuana, had control and dominion over it, and was guilty as charged in the indictment of unlawfully having in her possession and under her control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the drug, marijuana. <em>People </em>v. <em>King, </em>34 Ill. 2d 199, 201; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>75 Ill. App. 2d 50, 53; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nettles, </em>23 Ill. 2d 306; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>365 Mich. 494. See Annot. 91 A.L.R. 2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">When it was testified that the defendant handed the box containing the drug to the police, her counsel stated to the Court: \u201cI would hope that the State would not claim that . . . this act of itself was possession and control, because she was apparently complying with his [the policeman\u2019s] wishes to produce it. \u201d Defendant excepted to the Court\u2019s statement that he would make no ruling at that time one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The record discloses that defendant made no request that the charge indicate any instruction limiting the use of this evidence and took no exception to the Court\u2019s charge to the jury as given. We are of the opinion that this evidence was material on the issue of defendant\u2019s knowledge that the marijuana was present in her room and on the issue of her possession and control of it even though the delivery of the box to the officer would not in itself constitute a violation of the statute. The evidence objected to was not sufficient to constitute proof of entrapment as suggested in defendant\u2019s brief. <em>Brooke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 F. 2d 279 (D.D.C. 1967); <em>Rios-Ramirez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>386 F. 2d 831 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 206, 207, 208. See Annot. 33 A.L.R. 2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
