McCarthy and John V. Lindsay, under the designation \u201cElectors of President and Vice President of the United States. \u201d RSA 59:3. The petition alleges that the defendant seeks to justify his refusal to print the names in question upon the ground that requests were made to him on behalf of the persons named, that their names be withdrawn from the ballot. The plaintiffs allege that these declinations or withdrawals were not seasonably filed under the statute, and in the alternative that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the persons in question are without authority to \u201cremove or eliminate the candidacy \u201d of tire plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">All questions of law presented by the agreed statement of facts of the parties, and the pleadings and exhibits, were reserved and transferred by the Superior Court (Leahy, C. J.). The Court also transferred without ruling three specific questions which are hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The Constitution of the United States requires each State \u201cin such manner as the legislature thereof may direct \u201d to choose or \u201c appoint \u201d electors to vote for President and Vice President. U. S. Const., <em>Art. </em>II, <em>s. </em>1; Amendment XII. See also, Amendment XXIV; 3 U. S. C., <em>ss. </em>1-5; Annot. 153 A. L. R. 1066. Consistently, our statutes provide for the election of electors of President and Vice President in every fourth year. RSA ch. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Electors may be nominated by state conventions of any party held not later than the first Tuesday of October. RSA 56:62. They likewise may be nominated by petition \u201cstyled nomination papers, \u201d signed by qualified voters (RSA 56:65), and filed at such time and in such numbers as the statute provides. RSA 56:65-68. The four petitioners, consisting of the named petitioner, and Jack Kenney, Barbara Underwood, and Charles Wood, were duly nominated by petitions or \u201cnomination papers \u201d requesting that the plaintiffs \u2019 names \u201c be placed upon the official ballot to be used in [the biennial election of 1968] as candidates of the New Party. For Presidential Electors (of Eugene J. McCarthy and John V. Lindsay). \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The primary objective sought to be accomplished by the plaintiffs \u2019 petition is the printing of the names Eugene J. McCarthy and John V. Lindsay upon the ballot under the caption \u201c Electors of President and Vice President of the United States. \u201d They have indicated in oral argument that it is a matter of indifference to them whether or not their own names appear upon the ballot, if the names of McCarthy and Lindsay are omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The vital dispute between the parties centers about the provisions of RSA 59:3 as follows: \u201c59:3 Contents. Every ballot shall contain the name and residence of each candidate who has been nominated in accordance with law, except as hereinafter provided, and shall contain no other name except party appellations. The names and addresses of the presidential electors shall not be printed on the ballot, but in lieu thereof the names of a party\u2019s candidates for president and vice-president shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>be printed thereon under the designation \u2018 Electors of president and vice-president of the United States.\u2019 In case a nomination is made by nomination papers, the words, Nom. Papers, shall be added to the party appellation. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">This is not a unique provision, for the omission of the names of candidates for elector in favor of the printing of the names of the presidential nominees to whom they are pledged is required or permitted by the statutes of a majority of the states. See, Wilkinson, The Electoral Process, 47 ABA Jour. 251, 253 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">RSA 59:3, quoted above, thus provides for the printing of the names of \u201ca party\u2019s candidates for president and vice president, \u201d in lieu of the names of the candidates for elector. The contentions of the plaintiffs in this case fail for want of any indication in the record that \u201c Eugene J. McCarthy and John V. Lindsay \u201d are the nominees of any party for the offices specified. It is not suggested that they were chosen as candidates of the \u201c New Party \u201d at any national convention thereof; and had the plaintiffs been delegates to such a convention, they could not have run as \u201c pledged \u201d to the individuals in question without the written consent of those individuals, filed prior to the primary elections. RSA 57:6. Compare also the requirement of acceptance of nomination by a write-in candidate, RSA 56:51.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Instead of indicating that McCarthy and Lindsay are candidates, the exhibits in this case show that both have expressly advised the Secretary of State that they do not wish their names to appear upon the ballot as candidates of \u201c this party, \u201d or of \u201c these . . . nominated electors. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Since the individuals in question have not been shown to be \u201ca party\u2019s candidates for president and vice president\u201d within the meaning of the statute (RSA 59:3, <em>supra), </em>the defendant is not required to print their names upon the ballot. <em>State, ex rel </em>v. <em>Hummel, </em>150 Ohio St. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The petitions or nomination papers (RSA 56:65, <em>supra) </em>filed with the Secretary of State cannot be deemed to constitute nominations of McCarthy and Lindsay by the \u201cNew Party.\u201d They do not purport to be signed by members of any party, and they do not purport to nominate any candidates for the offices of President or Vice President of the United States. Instead they nominate the plaintiffs to the office of \u201c Presidential Electors, \u201d as the statute permits. RSA 56:65-68, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The plaintiffs contend that the communications received by the defendant from McCarthy and Lindsay and from their representatives were not seasonably received, so as to permit \u201cwithdrawal \u201d of their names as \u201c candidates \u201d in compliance with RSA 56:69. Oral withdrawals from the ballot were sought to be made by telephone on behalf of McCarthy and Lindsay before 6:00 P.M. on September 25, 1968. Written withdrawals were subsequently filed. This statute however has no application to the circumstances. It would govern withdrawal of the plaintiffs as candidates for the office of elector, should they seek to withdraw, since they are the candidates nominated \u201c as herein provided. \u201d RSA 56:69. McCarthy and Lindsay were not such candidates. See, <em>Pappagianis </em>v. <em>Daniell, </em>108 N. H. 467, 469. Thus the question of whether the withdrawal of a candidate may be oral, or must be in writing does not arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">What has been said disposes of the first two questions transferred by the Presiding Justice. McCarthy and Lindsay were not candidates within the meaning of RSA 56:69 and there was no occasion for them to file withdrawals in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The final question transferred by the Superior Court relates to whether the Secretary of State may \u201c cause to be printed upon the ballot the names of petitioners as electors of the New Party. \u201d Since the plaintiffs have indicated that they are not concerned about this question, no answer is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Petition denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
