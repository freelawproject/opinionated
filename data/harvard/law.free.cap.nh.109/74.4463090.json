H., and shown as a reserved area on a plan recorded in Grafton county registry of deeds. Trial by Court ( <em>Keller, </em>J.) resulted in certain of the plaintiffs being granted the right to use the reserved area, and the defendants being enjoined from interfering with the right to use the reserved area.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">The Court had a view of the area and by agreement of counsel no record of the hearing was made. The only evidence transferred to this court consists of exhibits, including two plans, and certain deeds to the defendants and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Defendants are the owners of lots 1, 2 and 3 on plan of Mas-coma Lake sites prepared on June 1, 1933 by George H. Cook and recorded in the Grafton county registry of deeds. The descriptions in the deeds in their chain of title are by reference to the plan and no other description appears. Lot <em>f\\ </em>is shown on die plan as a shore lot bounded on the east by a triangular piece of land running to the shore and marked \u201cReserved\u201d with lines running into die lake marked \u201cBathing Beach &amp; Boat Pier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AI0\">The sole question transferred is whether the Cook plan required a finding by the Trial Court that the defendants\u2019 deed gave them title to the reserved area regardless of any other evidence in the case. In the absence of any knowledge of the other evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the case we cannot hold that the Cook plan conclusively determined the issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The defendant argues that the distance along the shore line of lot #1 is given as eighty feet by the Cook plan and that such a distance measured from the monument on the shore at lot #2 would extend beyond lot #1 to include the shore of the reserved land as well. This argument ignores all aspects of the plan except the measurement stated for the shore line boundary of lot <em>#</em>1 which is apparently in error. The plan purports to have been drawn to scale, and according to the scale the shore line shown for lot <em>#1 </em>would support the measurement of fifty-six and one-half feet which is allowed by the Court\u2019s decree. Moreover, if the eighty feet stated on the plan were correct, then the course of the boundary between lot #1 and the reserved land would be in error, as would the measurement of one hundred twenty ieet shown as the scaled and stated length of that boundary. The Trial Court could reasonably find that the eighty foot measurement shown for the shore line boundary was in error. A plain error in a deed will be rejected and the deed construed reasonably to conform to the intent of the parties. <em>Wadleigh </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>99 N. H. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The rule relied upon by die defendants that a deed must be construed against the grantor is of no help to the defendants in this case, where the plan showing the extent of dieir purchase plainly shows it bounded by the land they now claim. <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Company, </em>76 N. H. 254; <em>Kennett Corporation </em>v. <em>Pondwood Co., </em>108 N. H. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
