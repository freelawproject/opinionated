The defendant\u2019s exception to the ruling was transferred by <em>Bownes, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">The defendant established the \u201cPlan\u201d in 1913. It is financed entirely at the defendant\u2019s expense without contribution by the employees. It provides greater benefits for disability resulting from accident than for that resulting from sickness. By section 3( 3 ) the committee, composed entirely of vice presidents of the defendant, appointed by its board of directors, is given authority to \u201c determine conclusively for all parties all questions arising in the administration of the Plan. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">The plaintiff who had been employed for 19 years by the defendant had received sickness disability benefits under the plan from February 1964 to February 1965 and since then has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>received a sickness disability pension also under the plan. Plaintiff requested that she be awarded accident disability benefits rather than sickness disability benefits. Her request was denied by the committee. Her declaration alleges that the committee \u201c wrongfully \u201d paid and continues to pay her sickness benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The plaintiff states in her brief that the central issue is \u201cwhether she has a right to litigate what she considers the arbitrary and capricious refusal of the Committee to award her accident disability benefits. \u201d We confine our opinion to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We hold section 3(3) of the plan does not bar an employee from seeking relief in the courts from arbitrary and capricious action by the committee. See Annot. 42 A. L. R. 2d 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">At the hearing on the motion to dismiss the Trial Judge asked counsel for the plaintiff if he had any evidence of \u201c malicious, capricious or arbitrary or wrongful conduct on the part of the board. \u201d Counsel replied that the only evidence he had was that \u201cthe board was notified of the medical ground for the claim and disregarded it. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">After counsel for the defendant stated that the board considered the medical evidence presented but rejected it the Court then stated: \u201c So that your only evidence, and I want to make this clear now, for the record, your only evidence as to wrongful conduct on the part of the board would be the board\u2019s decision that this was a sickness injury or a sickness disability benefit rather than an accidental injury benefit, alter they had been informed of the medical opinion of Mrs. Smith\u2019s doctor is that correct?\u201d To which counsel for the plaintiff replied: \u201cYes, plus the fact that the effect of section 3 paragraph 3 is to deprive Mrs. Smith of all her legal remedies. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">It seems clear to us that plaintiff\u2019s evidence would show only that the board considered but was not persuaded by the medical evidence rather than that it ignored or disregarded it. Such evidence falls short of showing arbitrary or capricious action by the board and the motion to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\n<em>Exception sustained; judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-10\">Griffith, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
