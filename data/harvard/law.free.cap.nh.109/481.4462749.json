The bases of plaintiff\u2019s action are (1) that die defendant negligently and carelessly performed the wave and other treatment, and (2) that the solution used in giving the permanent, warranted by the defendant to be safe, contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>in fact dangerous and harmful chemicals which made it unfit for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Trial by jury resulted in a verdict for the defendant on the negligence claim and in a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,500 on the warranty count. Defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of her motions for nonsuit, directed Verdict, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the warranty count were reserved and transferred by Griffith, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Plaintiff had been a patron of the defendant for 20 or 25 years. However, she had her hair bleached for the first time, in March 1963, while she was in Florida. Thereafter, not in defendant\u2019s beauty parlor, plaintiff\u2019s hair was rebleached a few times, a \u201ctoner\u201d was also applied, and she received one or two permanent waves. Her first visit to defendant\u2019s establishment for a permanent wave after her hair had been bleached was on September 12, 1964 for the permanent in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Defendant testified that plaintiff had \u201cbaby-fine\u201d hair which was very difficult to do and, when bleached, becomes even more sensitive to any form of treatment or solution. In giving a permanent wave a solution is used to process the hair which \u201cis dangerous if you don\u2019t pick out the right solution for the certain type of hair. . . . Even if you have the right solution you have to be careful not to expose the hair to it over too long a period of time.\u201d A \u201ctest curl\u201d is taken for the purpose of determining whether the hair is ready to be permanented and if properly given \u201cyou have complete assurance there will be no damage to the hair through the application of that solution.\u201d During the permanent other curl tests are taken \u201cto determine how far the permanent has worked on the hair.\u201d Plaintiff testified that, although she asked defendant about a \u201ctest curl,\u201d none was taken at anytime, while defendant testified that she took the initial \u201ctest curl\u201d and kept testing plaintiff\u2019s hair during the time the solution was on her hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Plaintiff testified that defendant had \u201ca very nice shop\u201d and advertised in the local paper representing that the quality of her work was \u201cvery good.\u201d, Defendant testified that plaintiff was \u201cin doubt and apprehensive\u201d about her hair. \u201cMrs. Elliott is like all other customers. They are concerned about their hair but they know nothing about it. . . . She was leaving it up to me or she would not have come to me. She must have had faith in me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>When plaintiff arrived home after leaving defendant\u2019s beauty parlor \u201call my hair was on my shoulders. Then I looked in the mirror and it kept coming out. For almost a week or so it kept coming out.\u201d It took about eleven months for her hair to grow back. Plaintiff testified that the defendant came to her home and stated \u201cI take the blame. I don\u2019t know what happened ... it must have been some fault or something ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d Defendant testified she told plaintiff she was sorry but cannot remember ever saying it was her fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">The propriety of the verdict for the defendant on the count in negligence is not before us. The Trial Court properly did not submit to the jury plaintiff\u2019s claim of an express warranty as there was no evidence to sustain it. The only question to be determined is whether the Trial Court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">This field of civil liability has undergone many changes in the past several years and \u201ccontinues to develop at a rapid and fascinating pace.\u201d 19 Rutgers L. Rev. 692 (1965); <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443; Vol. III The Forum (ABA I. L.) 25, 36. The Uniform Commercial Code which became effective in New Hampshire on July 1, 1961 (RSA ch. 382-A) and Restatement (Second), Torts, <em>s. </em>402 A have been significant factors in this evolution. 17 W. Res. L. Rev. 5; 50 Minn. L. Rev. 791; 19 Me. L. Rev. 181; 17 Bus. Law (ABA, CL) 157. See Annot. 13 A.L.R. 3d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">RSA 382-A:2-314 provides that \u201ca warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind . . . (2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as ... (c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">RSA 382-A:2-315 provides that: \u201cWhere the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and the buyer is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is ... an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Such warranties are not created by an agreement as such between the parties but are said to be imposed by law on the basis of public policy. They arise by operation of law because of the relationship between the parties, the nature of the transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>and the surrounding circumstances. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Anchor Serum Company, </em>198 Kan. 571, 579; <em>Markovich </em>v. <em>McKesson and Robbins, Inc., </em>106 Ohio App. 265; <em>Henningsen </em>v. <em>Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 N. J. 358; Hursh, American Law of Products Liability 6:16; Prosser, Law of Torts (3d <em>ed. )p. </em>651.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u201cIt is evident that the warranties of particular purpose and merchantability can, and often do, coincide. This stems from the fact that the particular purpose for which a product is used can also be one of the general or ordinary uses of the product.\u201d 2 Frumer-Friedman, Products Liability (1968 <em>ed.), s. </em>19.03 [2], <em>p. </em>503. See Annot. 79 A.L.R. 2d 431, 444. \u201cThere are, of course, situations when only one of the two warranties can apply.\u201d 2 Frumer-Friedman, Products Liability, p. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Such warranties, however, are subject to the Uniform Commercial Code provisions as to notice (RSA 382-A:2-607, 3(a)), disclaimer <em>(Id., s. </em>2-316) and to whatever requirement of privity is imposed by <em>Id., s. </em>2-318. <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443, 445; 19 Me. L. Rev. 181, 204-224. See <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N. H. 212, 214. Hence, there has arisen another remedy for matters treated as implied warranties under the Code. It imposes strict liability in tort for the sale of a defective product unreasonably dangerous to an intended user or consumer. <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, supra, </em>452; <em>Helene Curtis Industries </em>v. <em>Pruitt, </em>385 F. 2d 841 (5th Cir. <em>1961); Elmore v. American Motors Corporation, </em>75 Cal. Rptr. 652. 655; <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, </em>59 Cal. 2d 57, 62. Restatement (Second), Torts, <em>s. </em>402A.; Prosser, Law of Torts, s. 95; 50 Minn. L. Rev. 791; 31 Am. T. L. J. 243; 19 Rutgers L. R. 692. See Annot. 13 A.L.R. 3d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u201cStrict liability does not make the manufacturer or seller an insurer nor does it impose absolute liability.\u201d <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, supra, </em>459, 460. In other words, unlike absolute liability, the mere injury from a product does not create liability. \u201cFrom the plaintiffs point of view the most beneficial aspect of the rule is that it relieves him- of proving specific acts of negligence and protects him from the defenses of notice of breach, disclaimer, and lack of privity in the implied warranty concepts of sales and contracts.\u201d <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, supra, </em>460; Restatement (Second), Torts, <em>s. </em>402A, <em>comments </em>i, m.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Whether proceeding under an impLed warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, or on a strict tort Lability based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>on a defective product which is unreasonably dangerous, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that her injury resulted from the unmerchantability or unsuitableness of the product, in the former case, or from a defect therein, in the latter instance. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Weyer, Inc., </em>189 Kan. 501, 504; <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443, 451. It is not enough for the plaintiff to show that the permanent wave solution was applied and that she subsequently suffered injury. Plaintiff must adduce proof of facts and circumstances warranting the conclusion that the product was unwholesome or not fit for the purpose for which it was intended. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Weyer, Inc., </em>189 Kan. 501, 504; \u201cThe cornerstone rule in products liability is that proof of mere injury furnishes no rationai basis for inferring that the product was defective for its intended use.\u201d <em>Helene Curtis Industries </em>v. <em>Pruitt, </em>385 F. 2d 841, 853 (5th Cir. 1967); 2 Frumer-Friedman, Products Liability, <em>s. </em>16.03 [4]. See Annot. 13 A.L.R. 3d 1057, 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">It appears from the record in this case that four different products were applied to plaintiff\u2019s hair by the defendant on the day in question. There is no evidence as to the composition of any of them. There was no testimony that any one of such products was unfit for the ordinary purpose for which it was used or unsuitable for the particular use made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Plaintiff consulted her family doctor who saw her about four times in the month following her injury. His testimony consisted principally of treatments he prescribed for her extreme nervousness and anxiety as to whether her hair would ever grow in, and his suggestion \u201cthat she might consult a skin specialist.\u201d Lie did not prescribe anything for her scalp. Plaintiff testified she saw a specialist, Dr. Bienvenu, but he did not testify. There was no medical evidence that her condition was casually related to any product used by the defendant. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Weyer, Inc., </em>189 Kan. 501. Cf. <em>Newmark </em>v. <em>Gimbel's Incorporated, </em>102 N. J. Super. 279. See Annot. 79 A.L.R. 2d 431, 447. Nor was there any direct evidence that plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from a defect in a product used by the defendant which made it unreasonably dangerous for use on her hair. <em>Dippel </em>v. <em>Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443, 451; <em>Helene Curtis Industries </em>v. <em>Pruitt, </em>385 F. 2d 841, 853 (5th Cir. 1967); 19 Rutgers L. Rev. 692, 698. Furthermore the record does not contain sufficient circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>evidence to establish such unfitness or causal defect. Cf. <em>Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>61 Cal. 2d 256, 263; <em>Elmore </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>75 Cal. Rptr. 652. See Annot. 13 A.L.R. 3d 1057, 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We hold there is no evidence in the record from which the jury could reasonably find that any unfitness or defect in the products used by the defendant caused plaintiff\u2019s hair to fall as it did. \u201cThe mere fact that the plaintiff suffered injury is not sufficient to justify such a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N. H. 212, 215. Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the plaintiff should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The result reached renders unnecessary the determination of whether or not defendant was a seller under the Uniform Commercial Code or was in such a relationship with the plaintiff as to come under its warranty provisions. RSA 382-A:2-313, <em>comment, </em>2; <em>Newmark </em>v. <em>Gimbel's Incorporated, </em>102 N. J. Super. 279; <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Giannattesio, 25 </em>Conn. Sup. 109; 2 Harper and James, Torts, <em>s. </em>28.19; Vol. III The Forum (ABA IL) 25, 26-28. Similarly it is unnecessary to consider if defendant is a seller under the rule of Restatement (Second), Torts, <em>s. </em>402A. See <em>comment f; Garthwait </em>v. <em>Burgio, </em>153 Conn. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-8\">Griffith, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
