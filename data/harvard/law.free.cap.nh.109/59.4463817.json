H. 501. Authority to create such areas is expressly conferred upon municipalities by statute (RSA 31:3, 4 III), and the use of parking meters therein is likewise authorized by statutory provisions adopted in consistency with constitutional provisions. (RSA 249:1, 2) Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>6 - a. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Odier decisions of dris court make it evident that parking which is incidental to a viatic use of die highways is itself a highway use, provision for which serves a public purpose. <em>Papademas </em>v. <em>State, </em>108 N. H. 456. See also, <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Gilmanton, </em>101 N. H. 424; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>105 N. H. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In consequence, parking has become so far an integral part of highway use and regulation, that we are of the opinion that adequate provision for it must be considered to be the exercise of a governmental function in the course of which a municipality should be free from liability for negligence. <em>Gossler </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>107 N. H. 310. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>105 N. H. 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">In reaching this conclusion, we are sensible of the fact that provision of parking lots is not required of municipalities, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>recognize that metering is designed to provide a measure of compensation for facilities provided. RSA 249:1, 2, <em>supra. </em>These considerations however are not conclusive of the question of whether the particular undertaking is governmental or proprietary in character. <em>Kardulas </em>v. Dover, 99 N. H. 359; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>98 N. H. 22, 26. See <em>Krzysztalowski </em>v. <em>Fortin, </em>108 N. H. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In her well reasoned brief, the plaintiff relies upon the few decided cases to be found, to establish that elsewhere the operation of municipal parking lots has been thought to be proprietary. <em>Stringfield </em>v. <em>City of Hackensack, </em>68 N. J. Super. 38; <em>Amelchenko </em>v. <em>Borough of Freehold, </em>81 N. J. Super. 289; <em>Zaras </em>v. <em>City of Findlay, </em>112 Ohio App. 367. See also Annot., 8 A.L.R. 2d 373; 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d <em>ed. </em>Rev.) s. 53.107a.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The opinions which have considered this question however are those of intermediate courts, and the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in a case in which the court below had held the operation of a municipal parking lot to be proprietary, has made it plain that the question in that jurisdiction is resolved by statute, without regard to whether the activity is governmental or proprietary. <em>Amelchenko </em>v. <em>Borough of Freehold, </em>42 N. J. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">While it may reasonably be argued that parking lots, like sewers, are primarily \u201cfor the local accommodation and convenience\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>72 N. H. 147, 154; <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>73 N. H. 209, 211 ), we take the view that parking areas are so far akin to the establishment and maintenance of highways that they enjoy the status of an established function of government, and should be subject to the same limitations as to liability. <em>Fournier </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>92 N. H. 142. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>107 N. H. 377, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Since the condition of which the plaintiff complains was not a highway \u201cdefect\u201d as to which the defendant may be held liable <em>(Bernier </em>v. <em>Whitefield, </em>80 N. H. 245; RSA 247:17), the defendant\u2019s demurrer should be sustained. The plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the condition which caused her injury was a \u201cnuisance\u201d is not considered to alter the conclusion reached. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>98 N. H. 22, 27-28. <em>Cf. Allen </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Kenison, C.

Prosser, Torts 1005 (3d <em>ed. </em>1964); 2 Harper and James, The Law of Torts, <em>s. </em>29.6, <em>pp. </em>1621-1623 (1956). While disagreeing <em>(Gossler </em>v. <em>Man</em>chester, 107 N. H. 310, 315, <em>dissenting </em>opinion), nevertheless I am bound by the majority opinion in this case and in <em>Gossler </em>and concur solely for that reason.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-4\">Lampron, J., concurs in this opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
