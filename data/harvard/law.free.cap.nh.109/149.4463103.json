Trial by the Court ( <em>Grant, </em>J.) who ruled for the plaintiff and reserved and transferred the defendants\u2019 exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">The Court made the following finding: \u201c The Court finds that Claveau had undertaken and had commenced the process of filing before 5:00 P.M. [on July 25, 1968] and was within a minute or less of completing the act when the filings were closed to completion at 5:00 P. M. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">The single question raised in this appeal is whether a filing which has not been fully completed before the 5 o\u2019clock deadline is valid and legal. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike part III of the State\u2019s brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">An essential act required by the statute is the filing of the de - claration of candidacy. Although the plaintiff had tendered the required filing fee prior to 5 o\u2019clock, he had not completed the essential act of filing his declaration of candidacy prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>deadline. We conclude, as a matter of law, that any filing with the Secretary of State must be fully completed before 5:00 P.M. on the last day of filing. RSA 56:11, 13, 13-a, 14, 25 (supp).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Accordingly the order of the Superior Court is vacated (see <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>96 N. H. 316, 318) and the order in this court is</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Defendants\u2019 <em>exception sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
