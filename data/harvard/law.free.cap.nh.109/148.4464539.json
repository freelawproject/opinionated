Trial by the Court ( <em>Flynn, </em>J. ) who transferred questions of law without ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The controlling question is whether plaintiff\u2019s declaration of candidacy was seasonably filed under RSA 56:25 (supp) when presented to the city clerk at 10:45 P.M., Saturday, July 20, 1968. RSA 56:25 (supp) requires that such a declaration of candidacy must be filed \u201c not less than . . . fifty days \u201d before the day of the primary to be held on September 10, 1968. We hold that the filing in this case complied with that requirement. Accordingly the Secretary of State is ordered to place the plaintiff\u2019s name on the official ballot as a candidate for the office for which she filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
