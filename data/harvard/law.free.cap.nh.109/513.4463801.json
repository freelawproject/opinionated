A hearing on the merits of the city\u2019s petition for injunction is to be held by the Superior Court on September 15, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">\u201cProhibition is an extraordinary writ, the purpose of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>is to prevent subordinate courts or other tribunals, officers or persons from usurping or exercising jurisdiction with which they are not vested. The grant of such a writ is within the discretion of this court and should be used with caution and forbearance and then only when the right to relief is clear.\u201d <em>Hillsborough </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>109 N. H. 333, 334. Without passing on the contentions of any of the parties to the controversy we hold that a writ of prohibition should not issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Petition denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-5\">Griffith, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
