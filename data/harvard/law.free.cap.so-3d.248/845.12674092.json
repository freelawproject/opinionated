On August 5, 2013, Gregory Tyler Moore pleaded guilty to five counts of auto burglary and one count of burglary of a dwelling and was sentenced by the Rankin County Circuit Court to fifty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moore filed two motions for post-conviction relief (PCR) in 2014 (one for his auto-burglary convictions and one for the burglary-of-a-dwelling conviction), which the circuit court dismissed. In 2016, Moore filed the instant PCR motion. The circuit court determined the motion was procedurally barred, and Moore was not entitled to any relief for his claims. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Twenty-one-year old Moore was charged with six counts of auto burglary, five counts of burglary of a dwelling, and one count of statutory rape. After dismissing his original lawyer, Moore's parents hired attorneys John and Sherwood Collette in March 2013 to represent Moore. In July 2013, John Collette informed Moore that the State would recommend a thirty-five-year sentence if Moore entered a guilty plea. Moore refused, feeling the plea offer was excessively punitive since he had never before been guilty of any felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On August 2, 2013, a second plea offer was submitted for Moore to plead guilty to five counts of auto burglary and one count of burglary of a dwelling for a cumulative sentence of fifty years in the custody of the MDOC. According to Moore, Sherwood Collette said that although Moore would have to serve one-quarter of his sentence (twelve and one-half years), he could reduce his time for parole eligibility from twelve and one-half years to approximately six years by receiving \"trusty time\" and \"meritorious earned time.\" Moore claims that he entered guilty pleas to the six counts based on the attorney's advice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moore later discovered that trusty earned time and meritorious earned time could not reduce the time served to be parole eligible, and he would have to serve twelve and one-half years before being eligible. He also discovered he would not be eligible for placement in a work-center facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On February 7, 2014, a PCR motion was filed regarding Moore's conviction for\n   burglary of a dwelling, which alleged his guilty plea was not voluntary. A second PCR motion was filed on March 6, 2014, regarding Moore's convictions for automobile burglary. This motion asserted several errors, including ineffective assistance of counsel and raising mental-competency issues. Although both motions stated that they were submitted \"by and through counsel,\" only Moore's notarized signature was present on each. There was no attorney listed as representing Moore. The circuit court dismissed both motions on June 17, 2014, finding that Moore was not entitled to any relief. Moore did not appeal the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Moore filed another PCR motion on March 8, 2016, arguing his guilty pleas to the six counts were involuntary, as they were based on the misrepresentations by his trial counsel regarding his parole eligibility (ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim). He also contended that he did not authorize the filing of the two prior PCR petitions, which were \"prepared and filed\" by Robert Tubwell, a non-attorney engaged in the unauthorized practice of law; so his current PCR motion should be not be procedurally barred as successive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-23\">\n    Miss.

The circuit court concluded Moore's claims did not except the motion from procedural bars and dismissed the PCR motion as successive. The court also found that Moore was not entitled to any relief for his claims of involuntary plea and ineffective assistance of counsel. Moore filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, to clarify the judgment, reasserting his claims that his involuntary plea was a violation of his fundamental constitutional right to due process and that his prior PCR motions were prepared and filed by a \"person engaged in the unauthorized practice of law\" and should not be considered \"valid.\" The circuit court denied the motion, and Moore now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. \"If it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to any relief,\" the trial court may summarily dismiss a PCR petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-11\">\n    Miss.

Whether Moore's PCR motion is a successive writ.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8. Moore contends that the circuit court should not have dismissed his latest PCR motion as successive. In his PCR motion, Moore argued his two prior PCR motions \"were not properly prepared or filed pursuant to the requirements of the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act [ (UPCCRA) ],\" and the person who filed and prepared the first two PCR motions, Tubwell, was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moore\n   avers in his affidavit that he \"never met or spoke with Robert Tubwell\" and that he \"did not ask or give permission to Tubwell to file those motions.\" However, Moore does not allege that his signature on the motions was forged; he merely asserts that the burden is on the State to prove the signatures were his, and Tubwell's authorship and filing of the motions rendered the prior motions \"null and void.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that the record does not support Moore's claim that the prior motions were not authorized by him as his signature is on the two prior PCR motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. First, we find that Moore's notarized signatures constitute prima facie evidence that he indeed signed the previous PCR motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mack Fin. Corp. v. Decker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10143911\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/461/228/#p230\">\n    461 S.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (Tex. Civ.

While there is no Mississippi caselaw addressing the validity of a motion filed by a person unauthorized to practice law, Moore cites cases from other jurisdictions that have held court filings by a person not authorized to practice law are a nullity. In\n   <em>\n    Preston v. University of Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36036\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/354/666/\">\n    354 Ark. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36036\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/354/666/\">\n    128 S.W.3d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437-38 (2003), the Arkansas Supreme Court held that a complaint filed by Oklahoma attorneys in Arkansas constituted unauthorized practice of law, and the complaint was \"a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipe v.

These cases are distinguishable from the present case for one simple reason-Tubwell did not sign either PCR motion; nor is his name listed on either motion as Moore's attorney. Although the PCR motions both contain form language that Moore was filing the petition \"by and through counsel,\" the only signature on the motions is Moore's, and his signature is attested by a notary.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36036\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/354/666/\">\n    128 S.W.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no merit to the Prestons' claim their complaint was filed \"pro se ... because they hired attorneys to handle their case, and\n   <em>\n    those attorneys signed the complaint\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. \"[T]o be entitled to an evidentiary hearing, 'a [movant] must demonstrate, by affidavit or otherwise, that there are unresolved issues of fact that, if concluded favorably to the [movant], would warrant relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

There is no evidence of any representation by Tubwell in the record except for Moore's assertion in\n   his affidavit. While Moore claims his mother hired Tubwell, her affidavit is oddly silent on this issue. She makes no mention of Tubwell or the two prior PCR motions. Therefore, Moore's \"unsupported allegations\" do not warrant an evidentiary hearing on this issue, and we affirm the court's finding that Moore's motion is procedurally barred as successive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the advice by Moore's attorney constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and rendered his guilty plea involuntary.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13. Moore argues that his trial attorney's \"incorrect advice\"-that he could decrease his time for parole eligibility through \"trusty time\" and \"meritorious earned time\"-induced him to enter a guilty plea, constituting ineffective assistance of counsel and rendering his plea involuntary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moore's appellate counsel has acknowledged that the language of the statute concerning parole eligibility shows that, at the time Moore entered his guilty pleas, meritorious earned time could be used to reduce time served for parole eligibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Moore still maintains that, because the attorney told him that he could cut his parole-eligibility time in half (to six years), and he entered his plea based on this advice, he \"was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance\" and is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14. An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim requires a showing that (1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) this deficient performance resulted in prejudice to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

On appeal, Moore argues the circuit court erroneously dismissed his current PCR motion as successive-writ barred without holding an evidentiary hearing, and Moore claims relief is due because Robert Tubwell, a non-attorney, unlawfully prepared and filed the prior 2014 PCR motions without his permission. In his March 8, 2016 PCR motion, Moore contended the two prior 2014 motions \"were not properly prepared or filed pursuant to the requirements of the Mississippi Uniform Postconviction Collateral Relief Act.\" The face of each 2014 motion also reflected ambiguity and irregularity in stating the motions were filed \"by and through counsel\" without identifying any attorney or Mississippi bar number. Moore further asserted in his March 8, 2016 PCR motion that Tubwell prepared and filed the 2014 motions and that he (Tubwell) engaged in the crime of the unauthorized practice of law as defined by Mississippi Code Annotated section 73-3-55 (Rev. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 27.

In its judgment dismissing Moore's March 8, 2016 PCR motion, the circuit court issued no findings on Moore's prior PCR claims other than to state the prior motions rendered Moore's current PCR filing successive-writ barred. However, in the affidavit attached to his March 8, 2016 PCR motion, Moore averred that his mother, Lisa, mistakenly believed Tubwell was an attorney and paid Tubwell to file a motion on Moore's behalf. Moore further stated, \"My mother later learned that Tubwell was not an attorney and that the Mississippi Bar Association was trying to stop him from trying to practice law.\" According to Moore, he \"never met or spoke to\" Tubwell and \"did not ask or give permission to Tubwell to file [the two 2014 PCR] motions.\" Moore further averred in his affidavit that he only learned Tubwell had filed the two 2014 PCR motions after the circuit court dismissed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 30. As further support for his claims, Moore attached an exhibit to his appellate brief that shows the DeSoto County Chancery Court enjoined Tubwell in 2014 from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Because the chancery court's order is not part of the record before this Court, Moore asks that this Court on appeal take judicial notice of the document. In addition, in his appellate brief, Moore cites a prior opinion where the supreme court recognized Tubwell had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miss. Bar v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8171567\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/5/330/#p333\">\n    5 So.3d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 (\u00b6 40) (Miss. 2008).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tubwell v.

Based on his assertions that Tubwell engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and filed the two prior 2014 PCR motions without his permission, Moore asks this Court to find the 2014 motions are void and therefore pose no bar to his March 8, 2016 PCR motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 31. In review of this issue, I acknowledge that section 73-3-55 establishes the practice of law without a license constitutes a crime in Mississippi. The record reflects that Moore presented evidence to support his claims, and the record reflects ambiguity on the face of each of the two motions filed in 2014. Moore's own affidavit avers that his mother hired Tubwell and that Tubwell, without a license to\n   practice law, filed the two 2014 PCR motions without Moore's authorization. The circuit court held no evidentiary hearing and issued no findings as to the credibility of Moore's claims that he never authorized the 2014 PCR motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 32. After reviewing the record and applicable caselaw and statutory law, I find that Moore presented sufficient evidence to warrant a hearing on whether Tubwell filed the two prior 2014 PCR motions without Moore's authorization and, if so, whether the motions should pose a procedural bar to Moore's instant March 8, 2016 PCR motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would therefore reverse the circuit court's dismissal of Moore's March 8, 2016 PCR motion and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Moore's current PCR motion is procedurally barred. The record reflects Moore also asserts that his PCR motion is not successive-writ barred because his additional claims of involuntary guilty pleas and ineffective assistance of counsel demonstrate a violation of his fundamental constitutional right to due process. Because I find that the record shows that Moore also presented sufficient proof on these remaining claims to warrant an evidentiary hearing on them as well, I will briefly turn to a discussion of these two issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether Moore's attorneys provided incorrect parole-eligibility advice that rendered his guilty pleas involuntary and amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 33. Moore additionally argues the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his March 8, 2016 PCR motion as a successive writ because his motion raises a violation of his fundamental constitutional right to due process. Specifically, Moore contends that his attorneys provided incorrect parole-eligibility advice that induced his guilty pleas and amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. In addressing a similar situation in\n   <em>\n    Sylvester v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004064\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/618/\">\n    113 So.3d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621-22 (\u00b6\u00b6 9-10) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), this Court acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court may summarily dismiss a motion for postconviction relief if it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any annexed exhibits[,] and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to any relief.

This Court has held that an attack on a facially correct plea may survive summary dismissal if supporting affidavits of other persons are attached.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004064\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/618/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 34. As in both\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   , Moore attached affidavits to his current PCR motion to support his claims. In addition to his own affidavit, Moore attached an affidavit from his mother, Lisa. Thus, in applying precedent to the instant case, this Court on appeal must determine \"whether [Moore's] motion and [the supporting] affidavit[s]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   were sufficient evidence such that his allegations were not overwhelmingly belied by the plea-hearing transcript.\"\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004064\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/618/\">\n    113 So.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 11). I therefore turn to a review of Moore's claims regarding his guilty pleas and ineffective assistance to discuss whether he provided sufficient evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Involuntary Guilty Pleas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 35. As previously stated, Moore argues his reliance on his attorneys' incorrect parole-eligibility advice rendered his guilty pleas involuntary. In recently discussing another PCR movant's similar claim, this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A voluntary guilty plea emanates from the defendant's informed consent. An allegation that the defendant pled guilty in response to counsel's mistaken advice may vitiate the plea, because it indicates the defendant may not have been fully aware of the consequences of the plea. The petitioner bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his plea was involuntarily entered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   This Court has previously stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A guilty plea is binding on a defendant only if it is entered voluntarily and intelligently. A plea is considered voluntary and intelligent only if the defendant is informed of the nature of the charge against him and the consequences of the plea. Before the trial court may accept a guilty plea, the court must determine that the plea is voluntarily and intelligently made and that there is a factual basis for the plea. As part of its voluntariness inquiry, the court must determine whether the accused understands the minimum and maximum sentences for the charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   We have further stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   It is not a prerequisite to a voluntary plea that the defendant understand the nature of parole, his eligibility for parole, and the circumstances under which it may be granted. On the other hand, a plea is involuntary if a defendant is affirmatively misinformed regarding the possibility of parole and pleads guilty in reliance on the misinformation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that the defendant's eligibility for trusty earned time was analogous to eligibility for parole. Th[is] Court further found that, if a defendant alleges he was given erroneous advice by his attorney as to his eligibility for trusty earned time (or for parole) and that erroneous advice goes uncorrected, and he provides evidence other than his own statement (such as a sworn affidavit from a third party), he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Thinnes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779067\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/196/204/#p210\">\n    196 So.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208-09 (\u00b6\u00b6 15-18) (Miss.

In his affidavit attached to his PCR motion, Moore said he rejected the State's first plea offer for thirty-five years. Moore's affidavit further provided that he initially rejected a fifty-year plea deal until one of his attorneys informed him that he would be parole eligible after serving about five years. According to Moore's affidavit, his attorney told him he must serve one-fourth of his sentence (about twelve and a half years) but that he could reduce his time until parole eligibility to about five years through trusty time and meritorious earned time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 37. Significantly, Moore also attached to his PCR motion an affidavit from his mother, Lisa, who stated that one of her son's attorneys \"mentioned something [to her] about [Moore] having to serve six (6) years, and he mentioned something about forty percent (40%)[.]\" Lisa further stated that, following her son's guilty plea, Moore called her and said his attorneys had explained that, \"if he accepted the [fifty-]year plea deal and ple[d] guilty, then [he] would serve [twelve and a half] years minus [six] years for good time minus about one year for meritorious earned time, making [him] eligible for parole in about [five] years.\" Lisa also stated Moore informed her that he initially refused the fifty-year plea deal until his attorneys advised him that he would only have to serve five years before becoming eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 38. Similarly to the present case, in\n   <em>\n    Readus v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    837 So.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 (\u00b6 4) (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), the movant attached his own affidavit and one from his mother to support his claims that his attorney's incorrect sentencing advice rendered his guilty pleas involuntary and amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. In his own affidavit, Readus averred \"his attorney told him that, if he pled guilty, he would be sentenced to 'six months and ten years on paper' and that he would 'get RID.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). \"Readus'[s] mother's affidavit averred that she first spoke with the attorney the morning of the sentencing hearing in anticipation of her testimony ... [and] that the attorney told her that Readus 'would get about six years and he said something about papers after that.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 5). Although acknowledging a discrepancy existed in the affidavits as to the exact sentence length the attorney promised Readus, this Court found that the difference failed to invalidate the entirety of the affidavits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14). Instead, the\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that Readus's supporting affidavits corroborated that his attorney provided incorrect advice and \"instilled an expectation of a far more lenient sentence than Readus actually received.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We further determined in\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   that \"[c]ounsel's alleged deficiency was not 'cured' by the plea colloquy because the erroneous advice was not directly contradicted by the [trial] court's questioning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    at 214-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18) (citation omitted). As acknowledged, in the present case, the corroboration Moore's mother offered in her affidavit of incorrect legal advice constitutes similar corroboration to that offered by the mother's affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 39. Also as in\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   , Moore contends that the circuit court failed during the plea hearing to correct his attorney's erroneous parole-eligibility advice. Indeed, the record reflects that, although the circuit court informed Moore of the rights he waived and the minimum and maximum penalties applicable if he pled guilty, the circuit court never addressed the issue of Moore's parole eligibility. As a result, during the plea colloquy, the circuit court failed to correct the misinformation that Moore's supporting affidavits allege his attorneys provided as to his parole eligibility. In the analogous case of\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that the movant raised sufficient evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I likewise find Moore is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this issue and that the circuit court abused its discretion by summarily\n   dismissing his PCR motion without granting the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 40. During his plea hearing, Moore swore under oath he was satisfied with his attorneys' representation. \"[A] strong presumption ... exists that in-court declarations are truthful.\"\n   <em>\n    Thinnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779067\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/196/204/#p210\">\n    196 So.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 25) (citing\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   , 113 So.3d at (\u00b6 24) ). On appeal, however, Moore argues his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on his ineffective-assistance claim, Moore must prove: (1) his attorneys' performance was deficient; and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the deficient performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). With regard to a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis, this Court has explained, \"[I]t is presumed that counsel's representation falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance. However, the defendant may overcome the presumption. To do so, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004064\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/618/\">\n    113 So.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 22) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 41. The affidavits Moore attached to his March 8, 2016 PCR motion support his assertions that (1) his attorneys misinformed him about his parole eligibility; (2) he detrimentally relied on this erroneous information in pleading guilty; and (3) but for his attorneys' erroneous parole-eligibility advice, he would not have decided to accept the State's fifty-year plea offer and plead guilty. Thus, if Moore's instant PCR motion is not found to be procedurally barred as a successive writ due to the unauthorized and illegal actions of an unlicensed writ writer, then Moore's affidavits provide sufficient corroborating evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing as to his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Readus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9357328\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/837/209/\">\n    837 So.2d at 214-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 42. I would therefore reverse the circuit court's summary dismissal of Moore's March 8, 2016 PCR motion and remand this case for an evidentiary hearing on the claims raised by Moore's PCR motion.
