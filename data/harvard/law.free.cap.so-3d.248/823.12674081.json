Candace Webb, the legal guardian for minor Shane Webb, and Kathleen Webb, individually and on behalf of the wrongful-death beneficiaries of Christopher Webb (collectively, the Webbs), filed suit against the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) under the Mississippi Torts Claim Act (MTCA), claiming that MDWFP conservation officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of Shane, Christopher, and other boaters using the Tchoutacabouffa River in Harrison County, Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-9\">\n    Miss.

The MDWFP filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment, on October 27, 2010, and asserted that exemptions under the MTCA barred the Webbs' claims. On November 5, 2010,\n   the cases were consolidated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following discovery, the MDWFP filed a supplemental motion to dismiss and/or, alternatively, for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. The circuit court denied summary judgment on July 25, 2012, and the Mississippi Supreme Court subsequently denied the MDWFP's petition for interlocutory review. Following a two-day bench trial on February 18-19, 2014, the circuit court held that the MDWFP officers acted in reckless disregard for the safety of others when the officers told a boater to move to a safer area after they stopped him, but the suspect suddenly fled and caused a fatal boat collision. The circuit court conducted a hearing on damages on November 5, 2014, and awarded damages to the Webbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. The MDWFP now appeals, asserting that the circuit court erred in finding that the MDWFP officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others by ordering a suspect to a safer location to conduct a \"stop.\" Finding error, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and render judgment in the MDWFP's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. On August 22, 2009, MDWFP conservation officers Barry Delcambre and Michael Thrash witnessed Donald Bernius speeding in a boat on the Tchoutacabouffa River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers each navigated their separate patrol boats into the river to investigate and stop Bernius. Bernius saw the officers and came to an initial stop in the middle of the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. According to the officers' testimony at trial, they recognized that their boats and Bernius's boat were stopped in a \"dangerous area\" of the river. The officers testified that this particular area of the river, known as Bend 2, has blind spots where boaters heading from either direction cannot see other boaters approaching from the opposite direction. The officers explained that, as a result of stopping and approaching Bernius, the three boats were situated in a position so as to occupy most of the width of the river, which, according to the officers, created an eminent hazard for other boaters. As a result, Officer Delcambre instructed Officer Thrash to have Bernius move to the nearby\n   straightaway down the river to provide a safer location for them to question Bernius. Officer Delcambre proceeded ahead of Officer Thrash and Bernius with the intention of blocking oncoming traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Officer Thrash ordered Bernius to follow them out of Bend 2 into the straightaway, and Bernius agreed to comply with the instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Thrash then proceeded to the straightaway after Officer Delcambre so that Bernius could follow him. According to Officer Thrash, Bernius followed him a short distance, and then Bernius abruptly turned his vessel 180 degrees and fled in the opposite direction. Officer Thrash then signaled to Officer Delcambre, and the officers pursued Bernius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. At the same time, John Joachim was traveling down the river in his boat in the opposite direction from Bernius. Joachim provided in his statement that he observed Bernius speeding and recklessly driving on the wrong side of the river. As Bernius's boat approached, Joachim had to use evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision with Bernius. After passing Joachim's boat, Bernius collided with a boat operated by Christopher. The collision resulted in Christopher's death and injuries to Shane, who was a passenger in Christopher's boat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Neither Officer Delcambre nor Officer Thrash witnessed the collision. Once the officers arrived at the scene of the accident, they began rescue procedures, tended to the injured, alerted authorities, and assisted Bernius out of the water. Bernius was treated at Biloxi Regional Medical Center. Approximately two hours after the accident, a blood sample was drawn from Bernius, which indicated a .25 percent blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bernius later pled guilty to boating under the influence (BUI) and causing death and injury. Bernius is currently serving a twenty-year sentence in prison. As the record reflects, prior to the incident, Bernius was a paraplegic and wheelchair bound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. In connection with the boating accident, the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources (MDMR) investigated Officer Delcambre's and Officer Thrash's conduct. After interviewing Officer Delcambre and listening to an interview of Bouie, the passenger in Bernius's boat, the MDMR determined that Officers Delcambre and Thrash \"acted completely within the scope of their duties ....\" The MDMR concluded \"that the only people responsible for this boating accident were the people involved in the actual accident.\" The Webbs subsequently filed suit against the MDWFP under the MTCA, claiming that Officers Delcambre and Thrash acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others when they failed to detain Bernius and instructed him to move to a safer location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. At a bench trial held on February 18 and 19, 2014, Officers Delcambre and Thrash testified to their knowledge and understanding of the MDWFP's Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for handling BUI situations. Both officers testified that, in their initial contact with Bernius, his demeanor and handling of his vessel, among other things, failed to indicate he\n   was impaired. Officer Thrash specifically testified that, at the time, he had no reasonable suspicion to believe Bernius was intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Officers Delcambre and Thrash testified that their first priority during their initial contact with Bernius was to ensure the safety of other boaters and citizens on the river. Officer Delcambre explained, \"On that particular day[,] due to the river traffic and the fluctuations of the traffic coming north and south up the river where we encountered Bernius there in [B]end [2], due to the nature of where we [were] ... I made the judgment to move around the bend for the safety of the people and everybody involved on the river.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Relying on\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v. Brister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365650\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/274/\">\n    838 So.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2003), the circuit court concluded that the present case involved the officers' failure to detain Bernius rather than their pursuit of him or their failure to arrest him. The circuit court found that the officers' instructions to Bernius to move toward the straightaway violated Mississippi boating laws and the MDWFP's SOPs. The circuit court explained that Officers Delcambre and Thrash violated the MDWFP's SOP 04.01, which required the officers to issue boating-related citations \"at the scene,\" and that nothing in the SOP permitted the officers to direct \"the offending operator to continue to operate his vessel prior to issuing a citation.\" The circuit court thus held the officers' conduct in directing Bernius out of the bend was in reckless disregard for the safety of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. In making this finding, the circuit court relied on the MDWFP procedures set forth in SOP 07/03 for handling a BUI situation. SOP 07/03 defines \"probable cause\" and states that an officer's \"effort to establish probable cause for BUI will be after an [o]fficer's stopping of a water craft ....\" According to the circuit court, the term \"will\" is mandatory rather than permissive, such that the officers were not permitted to move or have Bernius move to another location for their \"stop.\" The circuit court recognized that law-enforcement officers make decisions every day \"concerning their safety and others, [and] that they are not to be faulted and do not become liable to those who may be injured simply because sometimes those decisions were not the best decisions in hindsight ....\" Nevertheless, the circuit court found the officers' decision to direct Bernius to move his boat was made with a deliberate disregard for the risk such that the officers \"were consciously indifferent to the consequences of their actions and inactions.\" According to the circuit court, this action constituted a failure to exercise any care, resulting in \"wantonness,\" and not a failure to exercise due care, which would have resulted in negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. The circuit court further found that the evidence discovered after the accident failed to determine whether Officers Thrash and Delcambre acted in reckless disregard prior to the accident. However, the circuit court did find that the \"after-accident information\" did \"impact on the credibility of the witnesses and the story told by the officers.\" The circuit court explained the fact that Bernius was ultimately determined to have a .25 percent BAC \"does not mean that the officers knew or should have known of that at the time they stopped Bernius. ... It does, though, call into question the officers' observations (or lack there of) [of] Bernius ... [and] [i]t raises a question in the court's mind about the accuracy of the officers' observations of Bernius or perhaps the accuracy of their testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. The circuit court also discussed Joshua Lord's testimony that, after the accident, he heard Officer Delcambre tell\n   other officers that \"they stopped Bernius because the [other] passenger was propping Bernius up and that the two men were back to back.\" The circuit court acknowledged that Officer Delcambre denied making this statement, but the court observed that \"[Officer] Delcambre's memory was also questioned concerning the odor of intoxicants on Bernius after the accident.\" The circuit court explained that Keith Bond's report from the accident \"clearly states that Officer Delcambre told Bond at the scene after the accident that he smelled the odor of intoxicants on Bernius's breath upon pulling Bernius from the water following the accident.\" The circuit court acknowledged that \"[Officer] Delcambre agreed that at his deposition he said that he could not recall and said in his deposition that he did not smell that odor. He says that as of the trial he is saying that he could not smell alcohol.\" The circuit court determined that, since Lord was not affiliated with any party in this case and did not know either Bernius or Officer Delcambre, \"there is no reason at all given as to why Lord's testimony should be [in] question concerning the statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. The circuit court ultimately held that, \"considering the totality of the circumstances and the applicable law, as well as the admissions of the officers, the officers acted in this case with reckless disregard.\" The circuit court found that, whether or not they knew or should have known that Bernius was intoxicated, the officers \"admittedly appreciated the unreasonable risk to others on the river in allowing a person to recklessly operate a boat and/or to operate at an unreasonable speed.\" The circuit court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [The officers] did not exercise any of the care or consideration [that] they were required to do in their dealings with Bernius. They clearly intended that Bernius continue to operate his boat without any restrictions from them and without their having made any inquiries as to his reckless operation, speeding, physical abilities, or use of alcoholic beverages. They \"intended to do the act that caused harm to come to the [p]laintiff.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. The circuit court ultimately rendered a judgment for the Webbs. The circuit court conducted a damages hearing on November 5, 2014, and awarded damages in the amount of $1,400,000 to the guardianship of Shane, and damages of $100,000 to Kathleen, individually and on behalf of Christopher's wrongful-death beneficiaries. After applying the MTCA's statutory cap on damages, the circuit court ultimately entered a final judgment to the guardianship of Shane in the amount of $466,666.67, and to Kathleen, individually and on behalf of Christopher's wrongful-death beneficiaries, in the amount of $33,333.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19. The MDWFP now appeals the circuit court's judgment, arguing that the circuit court improperly substituted its judgment and misapplied the reckless-disregard standard. The MDWFP submits that the circuit court's findings and conclusions demonstrate an application of negligence, and not the higher reckless-disregard standard that is required to find the MDWFP liable under the MTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20. \"A circuit court judge sitting without a jury is afforded the same deference as a chancellor.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

The MDWFP argues that the circuit court erred in its application of the \"reckless disregard\" standard. The MDWFP submits that the circuit court focused on whether the officers intended the act that caused the harm and ignored the requirement that the act at issue must be made with knowledge of an unreasonable risk and a high probability of harm. The MDWFP asserts that the evidence fails to support the conclusion that the officers acted wantonly or in utter disregard of an unreasonable risk with a high probability of harm to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22.

The\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   court further provided that \"reckless disregard occurs when the conduct involved evinced not only some appreciation of the unreasonable risk involved, but also a deliberate disregard of that risk and the high probability of harm involved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898578\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/689/#p693\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas ex rel.

The MDWFP argues that the record fails to contain sufficient evidence to support the circuit court's following findings: (1) the officers \"appreciated a risk\" that Bernius would flee; (2) Officers Delcambre and Thrash knew, understood, or realized an unreasonable risk or consciously disregarded a known unreasonable risk; and (3) Bend 2 was not a dangerous section of the river.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898578\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/689/#p693\">\n    153 So.3d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 5). The MDWFP further submits that the circuit court erred by: (1) applying a negligence standard instead of the standard for determining reckless disregard; and (2) failing to find that Bernius's unlawful actions were the intervening and superseding cause of the boating accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26. The record reflects that, at the bench trial, the circuit court heard testimony from Officer Thrash; Officer Delcambre; Bond, a conservation officer at the MDWFP who was called to the scene to investigate the accident and BUI charges; and Lord, a witness to the incident on the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27. At trial, Officer Thrash testified that he was an expert in boating safety and BUI enforcement. However, Officer Thrash admitted that the incident at issue on August 22, 2009, was the first time he had been involved in a BUI stop and the first time that someone suspected of reckless boating had ever \"run\" from him while performing a stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28. During cross-examination, Officer Thrash admitted that, as an MDWFP officer, he is obligated to stop any vessel he reasonably suspects is being operated by an individual who may be physically incapacitated and incapable of safely operating the vessel. Mississippi Code Annotated section 59-21-83 (Rev. 2013) prevents the reckless or negligent operation of watercraft vessels on Mississippi waters and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   No vessel shall be operated within this state in a reckless or negligent manner or at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the then existing circumstances or when the operator is so physically or mentally incapacitated as to be incapable of safely operating such vessel, or while the operator is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotics, or when such vessel is overloaded beyond its reasonable carrying capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Officer Thrash testified that he was unable to enforce section 59-21-83 because he never received the chance to do so. Officer Thrash testified that he stopped Bernius because Bernius was operating his boat in a reckless manner. Officer Thrash explained, however, that he and Officer Delcambre were unable to perform a \"complete stop\" of Bernius prior to Bernius fleeing because \"I pulled up [be]side him, but [with] the wave action and everything I never could get up beside him to do a complete stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29. Regarding whether or not the officers possessed probable cause to suspect that Bernius was operating the vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs, Officer Thrash admitted that, during the alleged stop, he did not ask Bernius or his passenger whether they had consumed alcohol. Officer Thrash testified that he could not tell if Bernius's speech was slurred because he only heard Bernius say \"Okay\" in response to the command for Bernius to follow the officers to the\n   straightaway. Officer Thrash also testified that, during the stop, Bernius \"was seated on his boat and he appeared to have good posture,\" and he was never close enough to Bernius to observe if his eyes were bloodshot. Officer Thrash further stated that Bernius exhibited no behavior anomalies suggesting that Bernius was not in complete control of his faculties. Officer Thrash admitted that it would have been reckless of him to not consider whether Bernius was under the influence of alcohol or drugs before he allowed him to continue to operate his boat. However, Officer Thrash testified that his interaction with Bernius during the stop failed to give him reasonable suspicion that Bernius may have been under the influence. The record reflects that, when Officer Thrash commanded Bernius to follow the officers around the bend to the straightaway to conduct the stop, Bernius remained in control of his boat and followed the officers a short distance before fleeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 30. Officer Delcambre testified that he worked at the MDWFP for approximately twenty-five years and was an expert in boating safety and BUI enforcement.

Officer Delcambre testified that, because of the blindspot located in the bend where he and Officer Thrash stopped Bernius, he was not close enough to Bernius's boat to be able to assess Bernius's mental, physical, or sensory faculties. Officer Delcambre explained, \"We never engaged [Bernius] in slurred speech. I never engaged him in a conversation. I never engaged him in any of that. My main objective at the point where we made contact was to get him out of the bend of the river.\" Officer Delcambre instructed Officer Thrash to tell Bernius to follow the officers around the bend so they could safely question Bernius regarding his excessive speeding and reckless operation of the boat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 32.

Turning to review the circuit court's findings, the record reflects that, in making its determination regarding whether the officers exhibited reckless disregard,\n   the circuit court discussed section 59-21-83, which governs boating safety. Section 59-21-83 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   No vessel shall be operated within this state in a reckless or negligent manner or at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the then existing circumstances or when the operator is so physically or mentally incapacitated as to be incapable of safely operating such vessel, or while the operator is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotics, or when such vessel is overloaded beyond its reasonable carrying capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35. The record reflects that the circuit court took issue with the MDWFP officers' request for Bernius to move his boat to a straightaway for safety purposes. The circuit court also discussed two MDWFP SOPs: SOP 04.01, which provides the guidelines for making an arrest, and SOP 07/03, which concerns the guidelines for enforcing the BUI law. The circuit court found that, although both Officers Thrash and Delcambre stated they were aware of section 59-21-83 and the SOPs, they failed to comply with the SOPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36. SOP 04.01 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   For violations of laws enforced primarily by [M]DWFP, ... custodial arrests will be made only for the following violations:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   a) All Class 1 Game and Fish Violations; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   b) Violations of the Alcohol Boating Safety Act;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   c) Narcotic[ ]s violations[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For violations of laws enforced primarily by [M]DWFP other than those named above, a citation should be issued [at] the scene[,] and the defendant should not be detained further except in extraordinary circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37. In examining SOP 04.01, the circuit court found that the SOP provides that citations are to be issued \"at the scene,\" and it \"does not provide that the officers may direct the offending operator to continue to operate his vessel prior to issuing a citation. Specifically, it does not provide for directing an operator to move his vessel to another location.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 38. SOP 07/03 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [I]t shall be part of the mission of [MDWFP] to enforce the laws of the United States and the State of Mississippi on the public waters under the jurisdiction of the State of Mississippi so as to protect all persons from injury and/or loss of life and to safeguard property[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Once a vessel has been stopped, the Officer may then ascertain if there is further probable cause to suspect that the operator of the vessel is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a controlled substance. Evidence to warrant proceeding to the screening/intoxication interview include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1. Slurred speech;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   2. Poor balance (not as convincing when on water due to wave action);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   3. Bloodshot eyes; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   4. Other behavioral anomalies that suggest the individual is not in complete control of his or her faculties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   If, in the Officer's best judgment, the subject displays outward signs of being under the influence, the Officer shall proceed to the screening interview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In its order, the circuit court found that SOP 07/03 indicates that an officer \"is required upon stopping a vessel to begin\n   his efforts to establish probable cause for BUI.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39. The circuit court recognized that both officers confirmed they were familiar with the SOPs, and the circuit court acknowledged Officer Thrash's testimony that \"[t]he SOPs never came into effect because they never had the opportunity to put [the SOPs] in effect.\" The circuit court determined that \"this is so, however, only because the officers chose to make it so.\" As a result, the circuit court held that \"the officers did not comply with the SOPs in this case.\" The circuit court further determined that \"it is also clear that the officers gave no consideration to ensuring that Bernius did not continue to recklessly operate his vessel during their trip down the river.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 40. The circuit court determined that, after the officers performed their initial stop of Bernius for recklessly operating his boat, the officers then lacked authority to direct Bernius to move out of the hazardous area on the river.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Precedent, however, reflects that speeding and reckless-driving citations are treated significantly differently from driving-under-the-influence arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41. The circuit court also found that the officers' defense rested solely on their position that their boats and Bernius's boat were stopped in a dangerous bend of the river and blocking a portion of the river, and that the officers wanted to move the boats around the bend and down river to a different point in the straightaway before proceeding to determine why Bernius had been reckless and speeding. The circuit court acknowledged the officers' argument that this was a reasonable and necessary judgment on their part, and not reckless disregard. However, the circuit court held that \"the officers' well-rehearsed mantra of Bend 2 being a blind, dangerous curve is not supported by evidence in the record.\" The circuit court explained that only Officers Thrash and Delcambre testified as to the bend's dangerousness. The circuit court stated that the photos of the bend admitted into evidence \"do not lend themselves to any real assessment that [B]end 2 is a blind curve or dangerous curve,\" and the court pointed to Officer Delcambre's testimony that no warning signs appeared at Bend 2 concerning any danger or hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 42.

MDWFP Officers Michael Thrash and Barry Delcambre\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   witnessed a boat traveling on the Tchoutacabouffa River speeding and operating in a reckless and uncontrollable manner. There was testimony presented that the officers saw Bernius being \"propped up\" (back to back) by a passenger while Bernius was operating the boat. The officers stopped Bernius in Bend 2, which is a part of the river the officers contended is a dangerous area. The officers did not inquire whether Bernius was able to operate his boat at this time. Instead, Officer Thrash instructed Bernius to move to a straightaway down the river. Officer Delcambre proceeded down the river ahead of Officer Thrash, and Bernuis was ordered to follow Officer Thrash. According to Officer Delcambre's testimony, they were going to move about one hundred fifty yards down the river to further talk to Bernius. At this time, both officers were in front of Bernius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 54. Bernius followed the officers out of Bend 2, then turned his boat around and recklessly sped off in the opposite direction. John Joachim, a witness of the accident, was traveling down the river and observed Bernius recklessly speeding on the wrong side of the river, traveling away from the officers. Joachim testified he had to maneuver his boat to avoid a collision with Bernius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 55. A few moments later, Bernius crashed into a boat operated by Christopher Webb. It is unclear how far away Bernius traveled away from the officers; however, the officers did not witness the crash. Christopher was killed in the crash,\n   and Shane Webb and Kailer Harper, passengers on Christopher's boat, were injured. Bernius and a passenger on Bernius's boat, Dexter Bouie, were thrown into the water. Neither Bernius nor Bouie was seriously injured. The Webbs\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed suit against the MDWFP under the MTCA. The Webbs asserted the officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 56. The trial court held that the officers' conduct in directing Bernius out of the bend was in reckless disregard for the safety of the public. I agree. The majority opines that the officers' deviation from the MDWFP SOPs (standard operating procedures) did not amount to the deliberate disregard for the safety of others. We do not believe that deviating from standard procedure alone is dispositive of the issue of reckless disregard. However, here it is one of the factors the trial court considered alongside the totality of the circumstances to render a finding of reckless disregard. The trial court determined that \"the parties have cited numerous cases from the appellate courts of Mississippi.\" \"A review of those cases clearly reveals that, while there are guidelines for applying the reckless disregard standard, the ultimate decision concerning recklessness is very much fact-driven, hence the totality of the circumstances requirement.\" I agree with the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 57. \"Based on our standard of review, the circuit judge's findings are safe on appeal if they are supported by substantial, credible, and reasonable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

I find the evidence supports a finding that the officers acted in reckless disregard for public safety, because they did not conduct the stop or control Bernius properly. In\n   <em>\n    Brister\n   </em>\n   , the court upheld a trial court's finding of reckless disregard involving two police officers in pursuit of a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365650\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365650\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/274/\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24).

The court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, the fact here that the officers did not intend that a fatal accident would result as a direct consequence of their high speed chase in violation of Jackson Police Department existing written policy is of no concern. Brister need only show that the officer actions rose to the level of recklessness. Here, it is sufficient that Brister has shown, and the trial judge so found, that the officers initiated a high speed chase with\n   <em>\n    conscious indifference\n   </em>\n   knowing they had not complied with Order 600-20 which was the existing governing policy of the police department at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365650\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365650\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/274/\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 23) (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations marks omitted). In this case, both officers allowed Bernius to continue to operate his boat without any restrictions, even though it was against the SOP regarding reckless operation of the boat. Both officers admitted that no distance\n   of operation is permitted for a reckless operator or an operator under the influence of alcohol. As a result of the officers' conscious indifference for failure to control Bernius after they made contact with him, the trial court found their actions rose to the level of reckless disregard, and I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 58. \"Reckless disregard is more than mere negligence, but less than an intentional act.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

Bernius was allowed to operate his boat at such a reckless speed after the stop was made that neither of the officers actually witnessed the accident. This demonstrates the officers' failure to control Bernius after the stop. Neither of the officers noticed that Bernius turned his boat around in the opposite direction and proceeded to speed again after the stop. Moreover, neither of the officers took the steps to ensure Bernius was not drunk while operating the boat. The trial court found that neither Officer Thrash nor Officer Delcambre performed any investigation, obtained any information, or made any informed decision regarding Bernius's continued operation of the boat. According to the SOP manual, the officers were required to determine the reason Bernius was operating his boat in a reckless manner, issue a citation, and investigate to determine whether Bernius was intoxicated. However, the officers chose not to follow those procedures in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 59. The SOP 07/03 provides, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Once a vessel has been stopped, the Officer may then ascertain if there is further probable cause to suspect that the operator of the vessel is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a controlled substance. Evidence to warrant proceeding to the screening/intoxication interview include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   1. Slurred speech;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   2. Poor balance (not as convincing when on water due to wave action);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   3. Bloodshot eyes; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   4. Other behavioral anomalies that suggest the individual is not in complete control of his or her faculties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Officers Thrash and Delcambre testified they did not witness any behavioral abnormalities demonstrating that Bernius was not in complete control of his faculties or intoxicated. However, Joshua Lord, a witness at the trial, testified Officer Delcambre told another officer that Bernius was stopped, because he observed someone propping Bernius up (back to back) while he (Bernius) was operating the boat. Officer Delcambre disputes Lord's testimony regarding his statement. However, the trial court noted that Lord was an uninterested party in the matter and did not appear to have any reason to be untruthful. Officer Thrash testified he noticed Bernuis's wheelchair and colostomy bag after he approached Bernius on the boat. This Court recognizes that the presence of a wheelchair does not in and of itself suggest one is not control of his faculties. However, the presence of the wheelchair and colostomy bag coupled with being propped up while recklessly operating the boat should have given the officers enough heightened awareness to conduct an investigation of some kind in that moment. Moreover, trial counsel asked Officer Thrash if he had a heightened awareness that he had just stopped a boat driving at a recklessly high speed, and that the operator\n   of the boat may have some significant physical issues. He replied in the affirmative. However, the officers chose neither to inquire nor control Bernius at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 60. After the crash, Bernius's BAC was .25 percent-well above the .08 percent legal limit. While Bernius's BAC level was taken after the incident, the evidence calls into question the officers' credibility regarding Bernuis's demeanor and reckless operation of the boat before the accident. Lord testified he detected a strong smell of alcohol coming from Bernius, yet Bernius never uttered a word to him. The evidence shows that a mere investigation or issuance of a citation after stopping the boat would have put the officers on notice of a potential BUI situation. This type of investigation is required under suspicion of BUI according to the BUI handbook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 61. Officer Thrash also testified he did not come to a complete \"stop\" because of wave action. However, at the time contact was made with Bernius, his boat had halted and had not continued to move. Bernius's boat did not move again until Officer Thrash ordered him to follow behind him. Interestingly, Officer Thrash testified he was close enough to Bernius to ask Bernius to follow him; however, Officer Thrash did not at least ask Bernius if he had been drinking (as required by the BUI-stop manual). More importantly, both officers admitted they did not have the authority to make their own guidelines regarding the stop, yet they deviated from the SOP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 62.

McAllister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420332\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/377/#p380\">\n    929 So.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (\u00b6 12) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). \"The common thread of these cases is that the conduct involved evinced not only some appreciation of the unreasonable risk involved, but also a deliberate disregard of that risk and the high probability of harm involved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420332\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/377/#p380\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted). In this case, both officers admitted they were obligated to enforce, without exception, the boating laws of Mississippi. The officers asserted the area where they initially stopped Bernius was dangerous, and they agreed to move to a safer location for a stop. However, the trial court found that the officers did not present any evidence that the bend was dangerous other than their own testimony. No \"hazardous\" or \"warning\" signs were posted during the time of the crash around Bend 2. No pictures were offered of Bend 2 from the angle in which the officers argued their boats were coming from. The photographs\n   admitted into evidence showed a pier protruding into the river. However, Officer Thrash gave testimony that he did not dock at the pier, because the three boats would have blocked traffic there. However, the trial court found no evidence to support that testimony. The trial court found that surely other boaters would be able to see three boats before coming too close to avoid contact. This conscious indifference of the officers to deviate from the SOP manual resulted in a failure-to-control situation. The trial court determined that, \"It is also clear that the officers gave no consideration to ensuring that Bernius did not continue to recklessly operate his vessel during their trip down the river.\" The officers' conduct evinced not only some appreciation of the unreasonable risk involved (deviation from SOP), but also a deliberate disregard of that risk by allowing Bernius to continue operating the boat and not conducting a BUI investigation at the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 64. The majority applies the laws dealing with traffic stops to this case. They opine that the officers possessed the discretion to request Bernius to pull out of the hazardous and high-traffic area of the river. I assert this is a case of \"failure to control\" during and after a stop. I am of the opinion that a \"stop\" of a boat carries greater risk and requires more thought for the safety of the public. Therefore, when the officers deviated from the manual, at a minimum, they should have taken further precaution by asking a simple question and gaining control over Bernius's ability to operate his boat. The SOPs and laws regulating boating safety exist to ensure that accidents of this nature do not occur. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances, I opine the officers' actions were such that a trial court could render a finding of reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 65. Respectfully, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   LEE, C.J., JOINS THIS OPINION; ISHEE, J., JOINS THIS OPINION IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    At the time of the crash, Officer Thrash had been employed by MDWFP for just over two and a half years. He received his BUI training roughly two months prior to the accident. According to testimony, this stop was the first time he had ever been involved in a BUI stop or investigation. Officer Delcambre had been employed by the MDWFP for twenty-two years at the time of the accident. He had been involved with over one hundred stops for reckless operation of a vessel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Candace Webb, legal guardian for Shane Webb, and Thomas Harper, legal guardian of Kalier Webb filed suits against MDWFP charging that the officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of Shane and Kailer. These cases were consolidated against MDWFP. Kathleen Webb, on behalf of the wrongful-death beneficiaries of Christopher Webb, brought suit against MDWFP, Bernius, and Victor Harrington (legal owner of the boat operated by Bernius). The claims were heard pursuant to the Mississippi Torts Claims Act (MTCA). As a result, all three cases were consolidated against MDWFP. No damages were sought on Kailer's behalf. Therefore, this appeal discusses the case on behalf of Christopher Webb and Shane Webb (\"Webbs\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
