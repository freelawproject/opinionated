We have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   art. V, \u00a7 3(b)(3), Fla. Const. For the reasons that follow, we hold that under federal law AHCA may only reach the past medical expenses portion of a Medicaid recipient's tort recovery to satisfy its Medicaid lien. Because the First District held otherwise, we quash the decision below, approve the Second District's decision, and remand with instructions that the First District direct the administrative law judge (ALJ) to reduce AHCA's lien amount in this case to $13,881.79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Juan L. Villa suffered extreme injuries in an all-terrain vehicle accident, Florida's Medicaid program (administered by AHCA) paid $322,222.27 for Villa's medical care. Villa later settled with one of multiple alleged tortfeasors for $1 million. Claims against other alleged tortfeasers were still pending. Using the formula outlined in section 409.910(11)(f), Florida Statutes (2015), AHCA calculated the presumptively appropriate amount of its lien at $321,720.16, and asserted a lien in that amount against Villa's settlement. Section 409.910(17)(b) authorizes Medicaid recipients to contest the amount of a Medicaid lien at a hearing before the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH), by proving that \"a lesser portion of the total recovery should be allocated as reimbursement for past and future medical expenses than the amount calculated by the agency pursuant to the formula set forth in paragraph (11)(f).\" \u00a7 409.910(17)(b), Fla. Stat. (2015). Villa timely petitioned for this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the DOAH hearing, Villa presented uncontested expert testimony establishing that only $13,881.79 of the $1 million tort recovery represented compensation for Villa's past medical expenses and argued that AHCA's lien should be limited to this amount. AHCA argued that the law authorizes recovery of Medicaid expenditures from third-party payments for past medical expenses and reasonably anticipated future medical expenses. Because Villa had the burden of rebutting the lien amount derived from the statutory formula-and put on no evidence to show that the lien exceeded the amount of his recovery properly allocated to his anticipated future medical expenses-AHCA argued that it should recover in the full amount of its lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Villa unexpectedly died weeks after the hearing, and his parents, as personal representatives of his estate, were properly substituted into this case as Petitioners. The ALJ's final order affirmed AHCA's lien amount and determined that Villa had failed to rebut the statutory formula because he did not establish that the lien exceeded the portion of his recovery allocated to future medical expenses. Petitioners appealed, and the First District affirmed the ALJ's final order, holding that Florida law\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the federal Medicaid Act allow AHCA to secure reimbursement for its Medicaid expenditures from the portions of Villa's third-party settlement recovery allocated to both past and future medical expenses. The Second District later reached the opposite conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Willoughby\n   </em>\n   , holding that the federal Medicaid Act prohibits AHCA from placing a lien on the future medical expenses portions of a recipient's recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case concerns interpretation of the federal Medicaid Act.

Therefore, because the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   held\n   that, pursuant to federal law, a state agency cannot assert a lien on a tort settlement in excess of the amount stipulated by the parties to constitute reimbursement for past medical expenses, we are compelled to conclude that federal law prohibits AHCA from asserting a lien in an amount exceeding the portion of a tort settlement that constitutes reimbursement for past medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Of course, the difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   is that AHCA has not stipulated to the $4,817.56 allocation for past medical expenses outlined in the settlement at issue in this case (or to the testimony that $13,881.76 is a reasonable allocation of past medical damages here). And the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   explained that this distinction may warrant procedural safeguards: \"[T]he risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the State's interest can be avoided either by obtaining the State's advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p275\">\n    at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p275\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conversely, \"just as there are risks in underestimating the value of readily calculable damages in settlement negotiations, so also is there a countervailing concern that a rule of absolute priority might preclude settlement in a large number of cases, and be unfair to the recipient in others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To protect parties against such possible manipulation, the United States Supreme Court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Wos v.

Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Wos\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court explained that \"[w]hen there has been a judicial finding or approval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical damages-in the form of either a jury verdict, court decree, or stipulation binding on all parties-that is the end of the matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407746\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/627/#p630\">\n    568 U.S. at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407746\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/627/#p630\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ALJ never found that $13,881.79 was the proper amount to allocate as past medical expenses in the settlement, and it is not proper that this Court do so on appellate review. While the beneficiary presented testimony of two expert witnesses to prove the valuation of total damages was $25,000,000, and that $13,881.79 was a reasonable allocation of past medical damages, the ALJ's final order noted that the testimony was questionable and based upon two-year-old hearsay reports. Therefore, I would remand this case to the First District with instructions that the ALJ determine the proper allocation for past medical expenses and that this allocation be awarded for satisfaction of AHCA's lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, I concur specially in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The First District correctly observed that Florida law plainly contemplates recoupment of AHCA's expenditures on behalf of a Medicaid recipient from portions of the recipient's tort recovery \"allocated as reimbursement for past\n    <em>\n     and future\n    </em>\n    medical expenses,\"\n    <em>\n     Giraldo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350705\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/244/\">\n     208 So.3d at 249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting \u00a7 409.910 (17)(b), Fla.
