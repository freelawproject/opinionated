We reverse the juvenile court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 18, 2016, A.F. (\"the paternal grandmother\") filed a petition seeking custody of J.P.; that case was assigned case no. JU-16-181.01. A guardian ad litem was appointed to represent J.P. The mother filed an answer to the paternal grandmother's petition. On April 28, 2016, J.P.'s guardian ad litem filed a motion requesting that the juvenile court enter an order placing custody of J.P. and his sibling, Ja.P., with their paternal grandparents. The mother filed a motion seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent her because, according to the motion, the mother was 17 years old; on May 9, 2016, the juvenile court entered an order appointing a guardian ad litem to represent the mother. Meanwhile, on May 4, 2016, the Madison County Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") filed a petition in the juvenile court, asserting that J.P. was dependent; that petition was assigned case no. JU-16-181.02. On May 5, 2016, DHR filed a petition in the juvenile court, asserting that Ja.P. was dependent; that petition was assigned case no. JU-16-447.01. The juvenile court entered a single order in case no. JU-16-181.02 and in case no. JU-16-447.01, appointing the same guardian ad litem for the children as had been appointed to represent J.P. in case no. JU-16-181.01 and appointing the same guardian ad litem for the mother as had been appointed to represent her in case no. JU-16-181.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 7, 2016, the juvenile court entered separate judgments in all three cases, finding the children dependent and vesting DHR with protective supervision of the children. On September 26, 2016, an order was entered in all three cases, setting them for a final hearing on November 7, 2016. The juvenile court entered an order in all three cases on November 7, 2016, resetting the final hearing for December 13, 2016. On December 6, 2016, the juvenile court entered an order in all three cases, resetting the final hearing for December 12, 2016. The mother was not present at the December 12, 2016, hearing, but she was represented by counsel. The mother's counsel indicated at the December 12, 2016, hearing that the hearing had been continued from November 7, 2016, because the mother had arrived late to the proceeding. Also at the December 12, 2016, hearing, counsel for DHR, counsel for the paternal grandmother, counsel for the children's father, the mother's guardian ad litem, and the children's guardian ad litem stipulated to a permanency plan, pursuant to which custody of J.P. would be transferred to the paternal grandmother and custody of Ja.P. would be transferred to D.F. (\"the paternal great-grandmother\"). The mother's counsel objected to the stipulations regarding the permanency plan on behalf of the mother. No evidence was offered by any party, and the hearing was concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the hearing on December 12, 2016, the juvenile court entered a single judgment on December 28, 2016, in case nos. JU-16-181.01 and JU-16-181.02, concluding that J.P. remained dependent, denying the mother's objection to the permanency plan regarding relative placement, and vesting legal and physical custody of J.P. in the paternal grandmother. On that same date, the juvenile court entered a separate judgment in case no. JU-16-447.01, concluding that Ja.P. remained dependent, denying the mother's objection to the permanency plan regarding relative placement, and vesting legal and physical custody of Ja.P. in the paternal great-grandmother. The mother filed a single motion to alter, amend, or vacate the juvenile court's judgments entered in all three cases. Following a hearing, the juvenile court entered separate orders in all three cases on January 17, 2017, denying the mother's postjudgment motion. The mother timely filed separate notices of appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The mother's appellate counsel filed, as to all three of the mother's appeals, a \"no-merit\" brief and a motion to withdraw, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

The mother's counsel indicated that he had attempted to serve the mother with the motion and accompanying brief in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    J.K.\n   </em>\n   but that those attempts had been unsuccessful. The mother did not provide this court with any issues to be considered on appeal. On July 19, 2017, this court entered an order directing the mother's counsel to file a supplemental brief addressing whether clear and convincing evidence had been presented to support the juvenile court's findings of dependency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ala.

Inherent in that plan is a determination that the children remained dependent. In her postjudgment motion filed in all three cases, the mother asserted that she was a proper person to parent the children and that the juvenile court had erred in transferring custody of the children to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother pursuant to the permanency plan. At the hearing on the mother's postjudgment motion, the mother was again not present. Her attorney argued on her behalf, however, that she had met the requirements placed upon her by DHR, and the mother's attorney sought an evidentiary hearing. Thus, the mother properly preserved for this court's consideration the juvenile court's findings that each child remained dependent and its transfer of custody of the children to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to support its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We note that, according to the juvenile court's June 7, 2016, judgments, the mother had stipulated to the children's dependency at a May 20, 2016, hearing. That stipulation did not, however, excuse the requirement that an evidentiary hearing be conducted on the issue of dependency at the December 12, 2016, hearing, given the mother's objection to the permanency plan to which the others who were present at the hearing stipulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    M.P.G. v.

In the present case, like in\n   <em>\n    L.F.\n   </em>\n   , no evidence was presented by any party at the hearing conducted on December 12, 2016. In accordance with \u00a7 12-15-310 and \u00a7 12-15-311, the mother objected to the permanency plan stipulated to by counsel for DHR and others that were present at that hearing.
