Marcotte, and John Hill claim ownership of a certain tract of land over which the State of Louisiana also claims ownership. After a trial, the trial court ultimately found ownership and superior title belonged to the plaintiffs. The State now appeals. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon learning that a tract of immovable property over which the family claims ownership was scheduled for a Sheriff's Sale, the plaintiffs filed a Petition for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunction, and for Declaratory Judgment against the State of Louisiana, Department of Administration, Office of State Lands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs asserted\n   that they own the land in question with the first link in their title tracing back to an 1833 patent from the United States to Francis M. Henderson. The plaintiffs presented certified documents from the Avoyelles Parish Clerk of Court, which they explained demonstrate the various transactions by which title to the property has changed hands since 1833 and by which the plaintiffs acquired the property. The plaintiffs further explained that they \"have been in continuous actual, open, and peaceable possession of [the property] as owners since they obtained it\" and provided a certified tax certificate to demonstrate that they paid the State and Parish taxes assessed on the property for the preceding three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to the petition, the trial court granted a temporary restraining order. Thereafter, the parties entered a consent judgment, which granted a preliminary injunction on the same grounds as the existing temporary restraining order pending resolution of the issue of a permanent injunction at trial. Subsequently, Stephen Mayeux petitioned to intervene \"as a property owner, adjoining property of plaintiffs, whose interest in said property hs [sic] been affected by the same demands made by the State of Louisiana unto plaintiffs ... in mover's property described as a certain 3 acre, more or less, tract or parcel of land[.]\" The trial court permitted Mr. Mayeux to intervene as a party plaintiff, and the matter was ultimately set for a bench trial. The State filed an answer, which stated in part that the Petition \"erroneously claims title to the subject property.\" In the answer, the State prayed for a judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' claims and declaring title and ownership of the land in favor of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their pre-trial brief, the plaintiffs and the intervenor (hereinafter referred to collectively as the \"plaintiffs\") reiterated their claim that their chain of title dates back to an 1833 patent issued from the United States to Francis M. Henderson. In support, their exhibits included excerpts from the record book \"General Government 2 Parish of Avoyelles[.]\" In particular, the plaintiffs explain that \"[t]he first transaction of record is from the United States of America to Frances [sic] M. Henderson dated November 19, 1833, [sic] bearing Certificate No. 687, conveying to him the NW4 of the NW4 of Section 36, T3N, R5E, Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, containing 38.42 acres.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs again described and provided documentation for the various transactions that led to their acquisition of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its pre-trial brief, the State first disputed the plaintiffs' ownership and chain of title by providing a copy of excerpts from the United States Tract Book. The State asserted that \"the alleged conveyance to Francis M. Henderson was posted in error\" because it is accompanied by the notation \"Posted in Error see T3NR5W, Vol 56, page 148[.]\" The State suggested that \"[t]he error appears to have emanated from a mistake between two persons with the same surname, Henderson.\" The State continued that \"[a] review of that latterly-referenced page shows that the NW4 of the NW4 of Section 36 of T3N,\n   <em>\n    R5W\n   </em>\n   was conveyed to Robert M. Henderson.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like the Avoyelles Parish tract book presented\n   by the plaintiffs, the entry bears a \" DATE OF SALE \" of November 19, 1833, and similarly shows \"687\" as the \" NUMBER OF RECEIPT AND CERTIFICATE OF PURCHASE [.]\" In their reply brief, the plaintiffs explained that the \"Posted in Error\" notation was done \"without making the record owners of the property party to the process\" and questioned the \"due process owed to\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State further presented a certified copy of Patent Number 1238658, in which the United States conveyed the subject tract of land\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the State of Louisiana on August 31, 1965. Regarding the patent introduced by the State, the plaintiffs asserted in their pre-trial brief that, when there is \"a conflict of two entities or persons being granted patents on the exact same piece of property, ... the first patent would have to prevail over the second, regardless of who [sic] the second patent was made to.\" However, as noted by the State, the plaintiffs did not provide the purported patent from the United States of America to Francis M. Henderson upon which they base their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, each party stipulated to the authenticity of the other party's evidence. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs are the owners of the subject property and have a claim of title superior to that of the State. In oral reasons for judgment, the trial court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I would be very remiss if I said ... 1965 patent supreme and that ends my inquiry. I have to look to the entire facts of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   What is of great concern for this court is that ... all of these years starting in 1833 through present this track [sic] that's in dispute drew revenue for the State of Louisiana in the form of taxes ... I just think that under the circumstances equity requires this court to exercise it's [sic] authority and to find that equitable title and superior title exists in the plaintiff's [sic] title in the chain that they've presented to this court. I find them to be in good faith, present possession, and ownership of a title that they possessed which reflects in this Court's eye as being from patent through a Mr. Henderson starting in 1833. I find that the issue done by the state is done without due process of law, without any notice to the plaintiff [sic], those who were in possession who have, where I consider to be very valid claim to the property[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Additionally, the trial court cited case law for the proposition that \"if the thing granted was not in the grantor no right has the grantee\" and for the proposition that \"cancellation without notice to the owner of the land ... was without due process and was invalid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State appeals, asserting as error that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. The district court erred in finding that the Appellees proved better title to the disputed property than the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a. The district court erred in not finding the State's U.S. patent to be the superior and conclusive evidence of legal title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b. The district court erred in not accepting the contents of the U.S. tract book for the facts stated therein given the absence of any argument or evidence of fraud or abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   c. The district court erred in finding that the Appellees held \"equitable title\" vis-\u00e0-vis the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The district court erred in making legal conclusions contrary to the controlling jurisprudence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. The district court erred in finding that the U.S. government's recognition of an erroneous posting in its tract book and its issuance of a patent to the State violated the Appellees' due process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Whether the plaintiffs' copies of the Avoyelles Parish record book or the State's copy of Patent Number 1238658 is superior and conclusive evidence of title presents only a question of law. Therefore, we review this matter\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    South Lafourche Levee District v.

Louisiana Civil Code Article 3338 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The rights and obligations established or created by the following written instruments are without effect as to a third person unless the instrument is registered by recording it in the appropriate mortgage or conveyance records pursuant to the provisions of this Title:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) An instrument that transfers an immovable or establishes a real right in or over an immovable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Francis M. Henderson acquired his title from the United States of America in 1833 as evidenced by a patent recorded in the tract book for Avoyelles Parish at the time. For the next 131 years, this ownership, through chain of title, was uninterrupted. In 1964, unbeknownst to the successors of Francis M. Henderson, the United States Tract Book was altered. A line was placed through the name of Francis M. Henderson, referencing the land at issue, with the inscription \"Posted in Error\" added. One year later, in 1965, the State of Louisiana applied for and received a patent deed from the United States, which included the same tract of land. It is from this patent that the State of Louisiana claims ownership of the property. However, this patent was never recorded in Avoyelles Parish, where the land is situated. According to La.Civ.Code art. 3346 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. An instrument creating, establishing, or relating to a mortgage or privilege over an immovable, or the pledge of the lessor's rights in the lease of an immovable and its rents, is recorded in the mortgage records of the parish in which the immovable is located. All other instruments are recorded in the conveyance records of that parish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because the patent was not properly recorded in Avoyelles Parish, the successors-in-title of Francis M. Henderson were unaware of the State of Louisiana's claim on the property. In fact, they continued to possess and pay the taxes on the property until such time as the property was scheduled for Sheriff's Sale. The State never asserted its claim during that time. Rather, the State now asks this court to deem it the owner of the property, even though it never asserted its rights and benefitted from the collection of taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, in 1964, when a line was placed through the name of Francis M. Henderson, no document was attached to the United States Tract Book explaining the reason behind the error. More importantly, no notice was given to the successors-in-title of Francis M. Henderson informing them that their title to the land was voided by the United States government. The successors-in-title were not given a hearing in order to refute whatever\n   evidence the United States may have had to substantiate its claim. Amendment V of the United States Constitution guarantees that \"[n]o person shall....be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]\" Likewise, La. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 2 provides, \"[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.\" This tenet is a cornerstone of our democracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State of Louisiana would like this court to declare it the owner of the tract of land based on the patent that was issued to the State by the United States in 1965. It is our opinion that this patent was issued in error because the previous title holders, the successors-in-title of Francis M. Henderson, were not afforded due process when their property was taken from them by the United States government. As such, they were still the legal title holders of the property in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Albritton v.

It would be a most extraordinary doctrine if the holder of a conveyance of land from a state were precluded from establishing his title simply because the United States may have subsequently conveyed the land to another, and especially from showing that years before they had granted the property to the state, and thus were without title at the time of their subsequent conveyance. As this court said in New Orleans v. United States, [35 U.S.] (10 Pet.) 662, 731[\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5616664\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/35/662/\">\n    9 L.Ed. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1836) ] :\n   <em>\n    'It would be a dangerous doctrine to consider the issuing of a grant as conclusive evidence of right in the power which issued it.

Both the Louisiana Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have declared the primacy of that instrument in evidencing legal title, providing that: \" 'Congress has the sole power to declare the dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United States; and the whole legislation of the federal government, in reference to the public lands, declares the patent the superior and conclusive evidence of legal title.' \"\n   <em>\n    Haggerty v.

Rather, they rely on excerpts from the Avoyelles Parish record book which\n   <em>\n    reference\n   </em>\n   an earlier issued patent. However, no actual patent was recorded in the Avoyelles Parish tract book and the reference entry has been called into question by a notation of error. Under these facts, I do not see how the plaintiffs can be viewed as having demonstrated their ownership of the property. Rather, they countered the superior and conclusive evidence of the State's ownership via patent with only a reference notation of a patent's existence which has a countervailing notation of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Certainly, the Louisiana Supreme Court has explained that \"even a patent from the government of the United States, issued with all the forms of law, may be shown to be void by extrinsic evidence,\n   <em>\n    if it be such evidence as by its nature is capable of showing a want of authority for its issue\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Albritton v.

I do not find that, given the primacy accorded the patent, the plaintiffs' mere references to an alleged conveyance in the Avoyelles Parish tract book demonstrate that the State's patent was issued without authority. Additionally, the United States Tract Book contains a notation that the alleged conveyance relied upon by the plaintiffs was \"posted\" in error. The lack of an actual patent, coupled with the error notation, undermines the position that a patent was ever issued to Francis M. Henderson. Absent such a conveyance it cannot be said, considering the record before us, that title was ever conveyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, I note that the majority opinion also references equitable concerns suggestive of prescription, observing that the plaintiffs and their ancestors in title have continually possessed the tract of land and paid property taxes for almost two hundred years. However, the record linearly demonstrates that, despite such possession, the tract of land was owned by the United States until 1965 when title was transferred to the State.

Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 3654 discusses declaratory judgments and provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"When the issue of ownership of immovable property ... is presented in an action for a declaratory judgment, ... the court shall render judgment in favor of the party:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) Who would be entitled to the possession of the immovable property or real right therein in a possessory action[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 3655 states that a \"possessory action is one brought by the possessor of immovable property or of a real right therein to be maintained in his possession of the property or enjoyment of the right when he has been disturbed[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The State answered, asserting its title via a patent from the United States and prayed for judgment \"declaring valid title and ownership of the subject property to be in favor of the State.\" Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 3657 provides, in pertinent part, that when \"the defendant in a possessory action asserts title in himself, in the alternative or otherwise, he thereby converts the suit into a petitory action, and judicially confesses the possession of the plaintiff in the possessory action.\" Thus, the suit, which began as a declaratory judgment action, was converted into a petitory action by the State's answer and assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   If a plaintiff in a petitory action wishes to \"obtain a judgment recognizing his ownership of immovable property or real right therein,\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 3653 requires that the plaintiff \"[p]rove a better title thereto than the defendant, if the court finds that the latter is not in possession thereof.\" Therefore, the question in this instance is which party has proved better title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In support of their claim, the plaintiffs introduced records establishing their chain of title, which dates back to an 1833 patent issued from the United States to Francis M. Henderson. Their exhibits included excerpts from the record book \"General Government 2 Parish of Avoyelles[.]\" The plaintiffs asserted that \"[t]he first transaction of record is from the United States of America to Frances [sic] M. Henderson dated November 19, 1833, [sic] bearing Certificate No. 687, conveying to him the NW4 of the NW4 of Section 36, T3N, R5E, Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, containing 38.42 acres.\" The plaintiffs further provided other documentation establishing the\n   chain of title emanating from the original transaction from the United States to Henderson. However, plaintiffs could not produce the physical patent from the United States to Francis M. Henderson. On the other hand, the State relies on a patent from the United States, Patent Number 1238658, by which the United States purportedly conveyed the land in dispute to the State of Louisiana in 1965.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is recognized that \"in reference to the public lands,\" Congress \"declares the patent the superior and conclusive evidence of legal title[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Haggerty v.

But this view is not sustainable. The issuing of a patent is a ministerial act, which must be performed according to law. A patent is utterly void and inoperative which is issued for land that had been previously patented to another individual. The fee having been vested in the patentee by the first patent, the record could convey no right. It is true a patent possesses the highest verity. It cannot be contradicted or explained by parol; but if it has been fraudulently obtained, or issued against law, it is void. It would be a most dangerous principle to hold, that a patent should carry the legal title, though obtained fraudulently, or against law. Fraud vitiates all transactions. It makes void a judgment, which is a much more solemn act than the issuing of a patent. The patent of the defendants having been for land reserved from such appropriation, is void; and also the survey of Coontz, so far as either conflicts with the plaintiff's title and this question, this court can decide.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Foley v.

Despite this reference in the tract book, another patent was issued in 1965. The use of Tract Books, as to support the validity of land titles, has a long history in this country.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The first tract books were prepared in about 1800.

Henderson acquired his title from the United States of America and, as recognized by the majority herein, for \"the next 131 years, this ownership, through chain of title, was uninterrupted.\" However, without notice to the successors of Francis M. Henderson, the United States Tract Book was altered in 1964, with a line drawn through the name of Francis M. Henderson and the inscription \"Posted in Error\" added. No document was attached to the United States Tract Book explaining the reason behind the error, nor was there any reference to any documentation providing authority for the tract book entry to be altered. One year later, the State of Louisiana applied for and received a patent deed from the United States. However, this patent was never recorded in Avoyelles Parish where the land in question is situated. The State applied for the patent despite the fact that the plaintiffs and their ancestors in title had paid the taxes on the property for decades and continued to do so until such time as the property was scheduled for Sheriff's Sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The trial court's reasons for judgment in favor of the plaintiffs do note, in part, the equitable doctrine of prescription, as shown in its oral reasons wherein the trial court expressed that the tract of land \"drew revenue for the State of Louisiana in the form of taxes\" while also mentioning the plaintiffs' \"equitable title\" and \"good faith, present possession[.]\" It is undisputed that the plaintiffs and their ancestors in title continuously possessed the property for decades, even prior to the State's purported acquisition of the property per the 1965 patent. Indeed, it is noted that had this been a case involving two individuals, instead of one individual versus the State, acquisitive prescription would be a direct issue and a prescriptive title could prevail. The State, on the other hand, asserts that \"[p]rescription shall not run against the [S]tate in any civil matter, unless otherwise provided in this constitution or expressly by law\", citing La.Const. art. 12, \u00a7 13. It then notes La.Const. art. 9, \u00a7 4, which provides, in part, that \"Lands and mineral interests of the state ... shall not be lost by prescription\" except in certain, narrow circumstances. However, it should be noted that plaintiffs' open possession of the property for at least 30 years, and certainly for 10 years, had long been accomplished prior to the State's attempted acquisition of the property in 1965. Thus, prescription did not \"run against\" the State; it had already tolled before the State's involvement with the land. What is most pertinent to this analysis is the silence of the State for the many, many years after acquiring the patent and its failing to provide any notice to the plaintiffs of its claim of adverse ownership of this property. Indeed, the acquisition itself, in light of the known fact that someone was claiming ownership of the property by the payment of taxes, makes the acquisition of the patent questionable without at least some effort to notify the taxpayers. Thus, under the circumstances of this particular case, the trial court had the authority to disregard the patent title asserted by the State.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    The power of a court of equity, by its decree to vacate and annul the patent, under the circumstances of this case, is undoubted.\n   </strong>\n   Relief, when deeds or other instruments are executed by mistake or inadvertence of agents, as well as upon false suggestions, is a common head of equity jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The patentee cannot complain of the proceeding, for the open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the premises, by the parties claiming under Goodbee, when the patentee made his entry and received the patent, was sufficient to put him upon inquiry as to the interests, legal or equitable, held by them; and if he neglected to make the inquiry, he is not entitled to any greater consideration than if he had made it and ascertained the actual facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.
