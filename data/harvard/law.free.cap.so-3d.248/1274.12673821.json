The order of contempt is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Dev., LLC v. Greer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042992,7042942\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/178/\">\n    32 So.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010) (noting that monetary sanctions cannot be construed as criminal in nature if \"the moneys are ordered to be paid, not to the fisc, but to a private party\"). A remand is appropriate for cases in this procedural posture, where an appellate panel cannot agree on whether actual damages were established thereby allowing for an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042992,7042942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/178/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042992,7042942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/178/\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding \"for findings as to actual damages and entry of an order tailoring any sanctions accordingly\"). To that extent, I concur in a remand consistent with\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   . Double jeopardy principles may prevent another criminal contempt charge for the same conduct, but nothing prevents the pursuit of a compensatory, civil contempt order under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-13\">\n   Bilbrey, J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I fully concur in granting clarification but not rehearing. Had I been on the initial panel in the case, I might have decided differently. The original majority and dissenting opinions both raise good points and I agree that this is a close call. But I believe my predecessor's opinion in this case is entitled to deference, and since I do not perceive the decision to reverse as a \"substantial departure from established law,\" I do not think rehearing is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gretna Racing, LLC v. Dep't of Bus. and Prof'l Reg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831042,6831135\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/15/\">\n    178 So.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 n. 10 (Fla. 1st DCA 2015) (on motion for rehearing) (Bilbrey, J., concurring). Clarification is appropriate, however, because the original opinion would have reversed without providing either a possible remedy for Appellee to be compensated for his actual losses, including attorney's fees, if a finding of civil contempt was contemplated by the trial court, or an opportunity by the trial court to punish Appellant for her outrageous conduct if a finding of criminal contempt was intended.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
