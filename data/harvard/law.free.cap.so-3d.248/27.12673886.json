In addition to a sentence of incarceration-which was suspended-fines, and court costs, A.Z. paid, upon his seeking bail, a $35 bail-bond-filing fee, pursuant to \u00a7 12-19-311(a)(1)a, Ala.

Code 1975, does not apply to youthful-offender adjudications. Paragraphs a and b of \u00a7 12-19-311(a)(1), Ala. Code 1975, assess separate costs to obtaining a bail. Paragraph a assesses what the statute terms as a \"filing fee\" of $35 \"on each bond executed.\" Paragraph b assesses what the statute terms a \"bail-bond fee\" and is colloquially often called \"the back-end fee\" because it is \"imposed by the court when the defendant appears in court for adjudication or sentencing.\" \u00a7 12-19-311(e)(1), Ala. Code 1975. A.Z. challenges paragraph b, the back-end fee. Specifically, according to A.Z., the \"bail-bond-fees\" statute explicitly states that the fee in paragraph b applies to misdemeanors and felonies, but the statute does not explicitly state that it applies to youthful offenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"(a)(1) In addition to all other charges, costs, taxes, or fees levied by law on bail bonds, additional fees as detailed in ... paragraph b. shall be imposed on every bail bond in all courts of this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"...

For a felony offense, a bail bond fee of 3.5 percent of the total face value of the bail bond or one hundred fifty dollars ($150), whichever is greater, but not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). Except that if a person is released on a judicial public bail, recognizance, or signature bond, including a bond on electronic traffic and nontraffic citations, the fee shall be affixed at twenty-five dollars ($25). For purposes of this section, face value of bond shall mean the bond amount set by court or other authority at release, not the amount posted at release on bail.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.Z. asserts that a youthful-offender adjudication is not a conviction for a crime;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   thus, according to A.Z., it is not a misdemeanor or a felony. A.Z. argues that, if the legislature had intended the bail-bond fee assessed in paragraph b to apply to youthful offenders, it would have so stated in paragraph b. In response, the State argues on appeal that \u00a7 12-19-311(a)(1) clearly states that the fee set forth in paragraph b applies to \"every bail bond in all courts of this state,\" and, according to the State, this fee is imposed without regard to the offender's age or the degree of culpability assigned to the criminal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.Z. cites\n   <em>\n    S.T.E. v.

A.Z. argues that there is no difference between the bail-bond fee and the Alabama Forensic Services Trust Fund fee and that, thus, this Court should follow\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   and hold that the bail-bond fee does not apply to youthful offenders. The State responds by arguing that A.Z.'s reliance on\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   did not address bail or bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court concludes that the Alabama Forensic Services Trust Fund fee, \u00a7 36-18-7, Ala. Code 1975, and the monetary penalty imposed by the Demand Reduction Assessment Act, \u00a7 13A-12-281, Ala. Code 1975, discussed in\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from the bail-bond fee in paragraph b. Both the Alabama Forensic Services Trust Fund fee and the Demand Reduction Assessment Act monetary penalty are mandatory penalties imposed in addition to other fines and penalties following a conviction for certain drug offenses. See\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   discusses both the Alabama Forensic Services Trust Fund fee and the Demand Reduction Assessment Act penalty in terms of the penal nature of those statutes, i.e., the imposition of additional punishment, and then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \" ' \"[Penal] statutes are to reach no further in meaning than their words.\" '\n   <em>\n    Fuller v.

The bail-bond fee is a cost associated with obtaining bail. It is not imposed unless a defendant seeks\n   and obtains bail\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the adjudication is something other than not guilty. Thus, unlike\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   , A.Z. is not challenging the application of a penal statute; thus,\n   <em>\n    S.T.E.\n   </em>\n   does not control this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, the Forensic Services Trust Fund Statute states that it imposes \"an additional fee of one hundred dollars ($100) on any\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   in any court of the state for drug possession, drug sale, drug trafficking, and drug paraphernalia offense as defined in Sections 13A-12-211 to 13A-12-260, inclusive.\" \u00a7 36-18-7(a), Ala. Code 1975 (emphasis added). The Demand Reduction Assessment Act also imposes an additional penalty for those defendants \"\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of a violation\" of certain drug offenses set forth in the Act. See \u00a7 13A-12-281(a), Ala. Code 1975 (emphasis added). Because the Demand Reduction Assessment and the Forensic Services Fee specifically state that they apply only to convictions, and A.Z. correctly states that a youthful-offender adjudication is not a conviction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   those additional assessments could not apply following a youthful-offender adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bail-bond-fees statute in \u00a7 12-19-311(e)(1), Ala. Code 1975, states that the bail-bond fee assessed in paragraph b is assessed when the defendant appears for adjudication:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The fee imposed on bail bonds under paragraph b. of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) shall be assessed to the defendant and be imposed by the court when the defendant appears in court for\n   <em>\n    adjudication or sentencing\n   </em>\n   .''\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The disposition following a youthful-offender hearing is an adjudication. The statute does not limit its application to a conviction. It applies equally to an adjudication. An \"adjudication\" is defined as \"the process of judicially deciding a case.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   50 (10th ed. 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, by use of the word \"adjudication\" and not \"conviction,\" the bail-bond statute was drafted broadly to include youthful offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, contrary to A.Z.'s appellate argument that paragraph b states that the bail-bond fee applies following a conviction, paragraph b states that the fee applies to a \"misdemeanor offense\" and to a \"felony offense.\" An offense is defined as a \"violation of the law\" and may be a misdemeanor or a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \"conviction\" is defined as: \"finding someone guilty of a crime; the state of having been proved guilty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"An adjudication of youthful offender status is very different from conviction as an adult, because it is not deemed a conviction of crime at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Use of the word \"offense\" in the bail-bond-fee statute allows for a broader application than had the statute used the word \"conviction.\" A youth tried as a youthful offender and found to have committed the underlying charged criminal offense has not been\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of a crime. The youth is adjudicated to be a youthful offender and is punished accordingly. In other words, a youth who is charged with committing a misdemeanor or a felony and who is granted youthful offender status, and is found guilty by a trial court of committing the charged offense is not\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of a crime, but is\n   <em>\n    adjudicated\n   </em>\n   to be a youthful offender and is punished according to the youthful-offender statute, which has the goal of rehabilitating the youth more than punishing the youth. Therefore, because the bail-bond-fee statute uses the word \"offense,\" rather than \"conviction,\" the statute is broader in scope and encompasses youthful-offender adjudications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, \u00a7 12-19-313 confirms that the bail-bond fee is not limited to \"convictions.\" Section 12-19-313 states that the fee in paragraph b is assessed when the \"the charge is disposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[W]herein the charge against a defendant is disposed of by conviction, a finding of guilty, or dismissal or nolle prosequi upon conditions to pay costs and fees, the fees pursuant to paragraph b. of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of Section 12-19-311 shall be assessed.

However, this issue was actually addressed and decided adversely to A.Z. in this Court's discussion in Part II.A of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In his appellate brief, A.Z. also makes the following contentions: 1) The statute has multiple subjects and, thus, violates \u00a7 45 because it distributes funds to various levels of government-municipal and county. 2) The statute contains multiple subjects in violation of \u00a7 45 because it assesses both a \"front-end\" administrative fee and a \"back-end\" posttrial penalty in the form of a fine based on the amount of bond required. In the circuit court, A.Z. asserted in his written motion that the \"back-end\" bail-bond fee set forth in paragraph (a)(1)b violates Ala. Const. 1901, Art. I, \u00a7 15, which prohibits the imposition of excessive fines. He did not argue that this statutory provision violated \u00a7 45. 3) The Act is unconstitutional because, he says, it includes a $2.00 allocation to the Police Officer's Annuity Fund, see \u00a7 12-19-310, Ala. Code 1975, which is a retirement fund for police officers, and this allocation has nothing to do with the court system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These claims were not presented to the circuit court. \"[T]o preserve an issue for appellate review, it must be presented to the trial court by a timely and specific motion setting out the specific grounds in support thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7434697\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/654/95/#p99\">\n    654 So.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (Ala. Crim.

Therefore, these claims are waived from appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A. &amp; B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A.Z. contends that the bail-bond fee is unconstitutional because, he says, it\n   creates incentives for the district attorneys to recommend a higher bond because the district attorneys' offices get a percentage of the bail-bond fee. This, according to A.Z., is a violation of the defendant's right to be released on bail. Additionally, A.Z. contends that the bail-bond fee creates an improper financial incentive for the district attorneys to seek convictions because the fee is assessed and collected after a conviction. Thus, according to A.Z., a prosecutor's duty to impartially administer justice cannot coexist where financial gain is the prosecutor's motive in obtaining convictions. This, according to A.Z., is a violation of a defendant's due-process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   These two issues concern the bail-bond fee set forth in \u00a7 12-19-311(a)(1)b, Ala. Code 1975. A.Z.'s argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Article I, \u00a7 16, Alabama Constitution of 1901, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"That all persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses, when the proof is evident or the presumption great; and that excessive bail shall not in any case be required.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[T]he amount of bail is discretionary, to be set by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Colbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709768,11709725\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/717/868/\">\n    717 So.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (Ala. Crim. App. 1998). Rule 7.2, Ala. R. Crim. P., sets forth a bail schedule as a guide in setting an appropriate bail. That rule states that it is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"a general rule for circuit, district, and municipal courts in setting bail for persons charged with bailable offenses. Except where release is required in the minimum schedule amount pursuant to the Rules of Criminal Procedure, courts should exercise discretion in setting bail above or below the scheduled amounts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Rule 7.2(b), Ala. R. Crim. P. The trial court may consider factors provided in Rule 7.2(a), Ala. R. Crim. P., and any additional factors when determining an appropriate bail amount. The prosecutor may, as with any issue before the court, present arguments on behalf of the State that he or she deems relevant under the circumstances. However, the district attorney does not set the amount of a defendant's bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, \u00a7 12-19-311(a)(1) b provides that the bail-bond fee for a misdemeanor charge shall not exceed $450.00 and the bail-bond fee for a felony shall not exceed $750.00. These limits on the fee protect a defendant from the concerns set forth by A.Z. Additionally, a defendant dissatisfied with the total bail amount, upon which the fee is calculated, may challenge the alleged excessiveness of bail by a writ of habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    Clay v.
