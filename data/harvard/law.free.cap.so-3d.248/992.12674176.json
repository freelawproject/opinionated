Code 1975, for the intentional murder of an on-duty law-enforcement officer, Deputy James Anderson. At sentencing, the jury completed a series of special interrogatories regarding aggravating circumstances pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-49, Ala. Code 1975, and found unanimously that the capital murder was committed while Henderson was under sentence of imprisonment, \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) ; that Henderson had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence or the threat of violence to another person, \u00a7 13A-5-49(2) ; that Henderson committed the murder for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or to effect an escape from custody, \u00a7 13A-5-49(5) ; and that the offense was committed in order to hinder or disrupt the lawful exercise of a government function or enforcement of the laws, \u00a7 13A-5-49(7). The jurors did not unanimously find that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, \u00a7 13A-5-49(8). The jury recommended, by a 9-3 vote, that Henderson be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At the final sentencing hearing, the trial court overrode the jury's recommendation and sentenced Henderson to death. The trial court entered a lengthy and thorough sentencing order. The trial court entered specific findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of each aggravating circumstance enumerated in \u00a7 13A-5-49, Ala. Code 1975. The trial court found four aggravating circumstances: that the capital offense was committed by a person under sentence of imprisonment, \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) ; that Henderson had previously been convicted of another capital offense or a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person, \u00a7 13A-5-49(2) ; that the capital offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody, \u00a7 13-A-5-49(5); and that the capital offense was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of laws, \u00a7 13A-5-49(7). The trial court found no statutory mitigating circumstances to exist. The trial court found the following nonstatutory mitigating circumstances to exist: that Henderson had expressed remorse; that\n   Henderson was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the offense; that Henderson had been diagnosed as having an antisocial personality disorder and displaying poor judgment; that Henderson had no violent disciplinary infractions while he was in jail awaiting trial; that Henderson joined the Navy when he was 19 years old; and that Henderson had a good relationship with his children. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Carroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102095\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/833/\">\n    852 So.2d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2002), the trial court considered the jury's recommendation that Henderson receive a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as a mitigating circumstance. The trial court then found that the aggravating circumstances vastly outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced Henderson to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 24, 2009, Deputy Anderson and Deputy Katie Bonham of the Lee County Sheriff's Department were on routine patrol when they encountered a white Honda Civic automobile that Henderson was driving. Deputy Bonham was driving the patrol car, and Henderson was traveling in the opposite direction. She testified that Henderson pulled into a driveway as they passed him, and then he immediately pulled back out onto the road and continued driving. It appeared to the officers that Henderson was attempting to evade them, so Deputy Bonham turned the patrol car around and followed him. Deputy Anderson contacted the dispatcher at the sheriff's office to check the license plate on the car. When the dispatcher reported that the license plate was registered to an older model black Ford Thunderbird automobile, the deputies decided to conduct a traffic stop. Henderson drove into another driveway. Deputy Bonham turned on the blue lights on the patrol car, which automatically activated the video-recording system in the car. While in the driveway, Henderson turned the Honda to the right. Deputy Anderson quickly got out of the passenger's seat of the patrol car, drew his gun, and yelled at Henderson repeatedly to stop. Deputy Bonham testified that Henderson backed up to try to escape down the driveway so she drove the patrol car behind him to block him from doing so. Deputy Anderson was on the driver's-side of Henderson's car and, Deputy Bonham testified, \"Henderson pressed the accelerator as far as it would go and piled over Deputy Anderson.\" (R. 1782.) Deputy Anderson was dragged a few feet by the vehicle and then remained pinned under Henderson's car when Henderson stopped driving forward. Deputy Bonham got out of the patrol car and fired two shots at Henderson. One shot entered the driver's-side door frame, and the second shot hit the engine block. Henderson laid his head over as if he had been shot, Deputy Bonham said, so she paused for a moment. Henderson then grabbed the steering wheel and accelerated repeatedly. He appeared to shift the car from \"reverse\" to \"drive,\" and he accelerated each time he shifted gears. The tires were in the dirt, so each time Henderson accelerated the tires spun and dug deeper into the ground. The Honda sank further down on top of Deputy Anderson. Deputy Bonham repeatedly ordered Henderson to get out and to lie on the ground. Henderson did not initially comply, but he did eventually get out of the car and lie on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Henderson cried and repeatedly asked Deputy Bonham to help get Deputy Anderson from under his car, but she held him at gunpoint until she received backup assistance and Henderson was placed in handcuffs. Before backup assistance arrived, the resident of the house where this incident took place came outside. He testified that he brought a jack to lift the Honda, but that the car was too low and he could not get the jack under the car. When emergency personnel and law-enforcement officers began to arrive, additional efforts\n   were made to get Henderson's car off of Deputy Anderson. Car jacks were used in an attempt to raise Henderson's vehicle, but the jacks sank into the dirt and did not raise the vehicle enough to pull the deputy out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputy Bonham testified that when she looked under the car, Deputy Anderson was not moving or talking and she was not sure whether he was breathing. More time passed before a tow truck came to the scene and raised Henderson's car off Deputy Anderson. CPR was administered and Deputy Anderson was transported to the hospital, but he did not survive. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy testified that Deputy Anderson suffered burns, abrasions, fractures of the sternum and three ribs, and hemorrhages in the muscles around the ribs. Those injuries were not sufficient to have caused death or immediate unconsciousness, the pathologist said. The cause of death was determined to be traumatic asphyxia that resulted from the weight of the vehicle on his chest that prevented him from being able to breathe, and it resulted in the fatal lack of oxygen to his brain. The pathologist further testified that when a brain is deprived of oxygen for approximately four minutes, irreversible brain injury occurs and, at that point, Deputy Anderson could not have been resuscitated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Investigators processed the scene. A law-enforcement officer found a large blade between the driver's seat and the door of the Honda. The State presented evidence from the investigation of the crime, including photographs and a diagram of the scene and the recording from the video camera in the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Henderson presented testimony from Dr. Glen King, a clinical and forensic psychologist who conducted a mental evaluation of Henderson before trial and prepared a written report. Dr. King made three diagnoses: cannabis dependence, amphetamine dependence, and antisocial personality disorder. Dr. King also stated in the report that Henderson was likely intoxicated at the time of the crime. On cross-examination, Dr. King testified that, based on further consideration after he submitted the report, it was his opinion that Henderson was not intoxicated or impaired at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A forensic toxicologist testified that she had tested a sample of Henderson's blood that was taken when he arrived at the jail, several hours after Deputy Anderson died. Henderson's blood contained methamphetamine and an inactive metabolite of marijuana. The levels of methamphetamine would have been higher had Henderson's blood been taken closer to the time of the incident, she said. The toxicologist testified that methamphetamine is a stimulant and that a person with the level of methamphetamine found in Henderson's blood could be impulsive, easily distracted, and have excessive energy but that she could not testify as to any impairment Henderson might have actually experienced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the State's rebuttal case the nurse at the Russell County jail testified that she drew Henderson's blood and obtained a urine sample during her routine assessment of Henderson as a new inmate, and that, as part of that assessment, she asked Henderson about his drug use. Henderson told her that he only used marijuana and alcohol and that he had not ingested either of those substances in the previous two days. Although Henderson did not admit to recent methamphetamine use, his urine sample tested positive for methamphetamine. The nurse testified that she could not tell whether Henderson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol during her assessment and that she did not treat him for symptoms of withdrawal from intoxicants while he was at the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the sentencing hearing before the jury, a Georgia probation and parole officer testified that, in 2008, he had been assigned to supervise Henderson after Henderson was released from prison following a conviction for aggravated assault. The officer testified that Henderson had been on probation for methamphetamine possession when he committed the aggravated assault, thus violating his probation and resulting in his imprisonment. In July 2009, a felony-fugitive warrant was issued because Henderson had failed to comply with the conditions of his parole and he had moved from his residence without notifying his parole officer. On September 21, 2009, three days before Henderson killed Deputy Anderson, Georgia parole officers assembled an arrest team after a tipster provided information that Henderson was at an auto shop. While en route to the auto shop the officers saw Henderson at the wheel of a white Honda Civic in the drive-through lane at a fast-food restaurant. Two of the officers got out of their car to approach Henderson, and the third officer began to drive to the front of the drive-through lane in an attempt to block Henderson's vehicle. When Henderson saw one of the officers he \"floored\" the gas and sped away. He drove around a customer's car in front of him, swerved around several cars in the parking lot, jumped a curb, and drove through a gas station parking lot. Henderson successfully evaded arrest on the fugitive warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Henderson's mother testified about Henderson's childhood and said she was a strict disciplinarian, but that she and her husband had openly expressed love for Henderson and his brothers. She said that Henderson had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\") when he was approximately six years old and was prescribed medication for the condition. He made good grades while he was taking the medication, but he dropped out of high school after he stopped taking the medication and began making failing grades. She said that, during his teenage years, Henderson began to get into trouble and he began smoking marijuana. Henderson's mother testified that Henderson had five children, that he had close relationships with them, and that he supported them financially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the sentencing hearing before the trial court Henderson presented his school records and reports of psychological evaluations conducted while he was in school. The reports consistently indicated that Henderson exhibited a pattern of behavioral characteristics, such as a short attention span, impulsivity, and overactivity. The reports also indicated that Henderson achieved an IQ score of 112 on the test administered in the first grade, and he achieved an IQ score of 107 on the test administered in the fourth grade. Henderson achieved an IQ score of 96 on the test administered in the seventh grade. He made A's and B's through the fifth grade, and his grades in many classes were lower during the rest of his school years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Henderson testified at the sentencing hearing before the trial court. He testified about his extensive drug history and said that he was under the influence of methamphetamine, Xanax, and marijuana when he ran over the deputy. He further testified that he had not slept for at least seven days before he ran over Deputy Anderson because he had been using illegal drugs. Henderson admitted that he had seen several law-enforcement officers the day of the murder and that he was relieved when they did not stop him because, he said, he had no insurance or driver's license and because he had been using drugs. Henderson testified that he pulled into several driveways, including the final one where he ran over Deputy Anderson, solely because he was lost and was trying to\n   get back to a road that he recognized. He stated that he had not seen the patrol car drive behind him in the driveway and that he saw the patrol car and Deputy Anderson only after he had turned around and was already moving forward toward the end of the driveway. Henderson said that it was too late to stop the car and he rolled over the deputy. He said he tried to back the car up several times because he knew the deputy was under the car, but the tires spun and the car would not move. Henderson testified that he asked Deputy Bonham to help him get the car off Deputy Anderson. Henderson denied telling anyone earlier that day that he would kill any officer who stopped him. He acknowledged that in a telephone call he made from the Russell County jail he had asked that someone talk to Alexandria Barfield, who he knew would testify at the sentencing hearing, so she would understand that she should not permit the prosecutor to trick her into believing she was helping Henderson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alexandria Barfield testified that she had dated Henderson in 2009. She said that she had been in Henderson's white car at some point before the incident\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that caused Deputy Anderson's death. Barfield acknowledged that she gave a statement to a law-enforcement officer after the murder and she told the officer that, before the day the deputy was killed, Henderson had told her that if he ever got pulled over by a policeman she should duck down in the floorboard because he was going to shoot the policeman. Barfield said she had been high on methamphetamine on the day Henderson made that statement to her and again when she told the law-enforcement officer about Henderson's statement. She testified at the sentencing hearing that she was not high on drugs and had not used any drugs in more than 24 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Russell County jail administrator testified that while Henderson was incarcerated there he had two disciplinary infractions-he had refused to \"lock down\" for a head count and he failed to report that some of the security screws in the window in his cell were loose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 45A, Ala.

Specifically, Henderson argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it could presume intent from the use of a dangerous instrument. He argues that an instruction that intent can be presumed from a defendant's act created a mandatory presumption that unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him.\n   <em>\n    Sandstrom v.

The trial court enhanced Harris's sentence pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-6(a)(5), Ala. Code 1975, which required proof that Harris had used a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony.

In connection with such evidence, consideration should be given to any evidence of the motive which may have prompted such flight. That is, whether a consciousness of guilt or an apprehension of being brought to justice caused the flight or whether it was caused by some other motive. In the first place where evidence is offered to show the defendant's flight, that is, he went away from the scene of the alleged offense, it would be for you, the jury, to say whether it is flight as a matter of fact. The jury is to determine from the evidence the question of whether this was flight or not, and then you would further consider such evidence in light of all the other evidence you have heard in this case including any evidence to negate or explain any such evidence of flight or whether such evidence was-was a reasonable explanation or not, all of which you may would consider in connection with all the other evidence giving each part of the evidence such weight as you, the jury, feel it's entitled to receive in this particular case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (R. 2442-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The facts of this case provided sufficient evidence to place before the jury the question whether Henderson resisted arrest or engaged in flight or attempted flight after he struck Deputy Anderson. Deputy Bonham testified that after Henderson struck Deputy Anderson, she got out of her patrol car and ordered Henderson to stop his car and get out. Henderson did not respond immediately, so Deputy Bonham fired two shots at Henderson. Initially he laid his head to the side as if he had been hit by the gunfire, then he grabbed the steering wheel and accelerated several times. Deputy Bonham testified that Henderson floored the accelerator in an attempt to get off of Deputy Anderson's body \"and go.\" (R. 1824.) The resident of the house where the murder occurred testified that after Deputy Bonham had ordered Henderson to stop, he continued to accelerate and he spun the tires forward and then backward but the car was stuck. The resident testified that he wondered at the time why Henderson did not stop accelerating, and said that if someone, especially a police officer, had shot at him and told him to stop, he would have stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The evidence supported the trial court's jury instruction on flight. The evidence of flight was not conclusive, but it was sufficient to put before the jury for its determination of whether the evidence constituted flight. Therefore, the evidence was properly\n   before the jury, and the trial court's instruction on that evidence was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   No plain error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Henderson argues that Dr. Glen King, the forensic psychologist he called as an expert witness, gave testimony on cross-examination that was based on facts not in evidence and, therefore, the testimony violated\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7491648\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/127/\">\n    575 So.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1990). Specifically, Henderson argues that the trial court erred when it allowed Dr. King to testify to his opinion that Henderson was not intoxicated or impaired at the time of the offense. Henderson did not raise this objection at trial, so we review it for plain error only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We set forth the details surrounding Dr. King's testimony and the matters discussed outside the hearing of the jury in order to provide the context for our resolution of the issue now raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   During Henderson's direct examination of Dr. King concerning Henderson's substance-abuse history, the State objected on grounds that Dr. King's opinions were based on facts not in evidence. Rule 703, Ala. R. Evid. The trial court allowed the State to conduct voir dire examination of Dr. King. During voir dire examination the State asked Dr. King whether he had learned anything about Henderson's substance abuse from sources other than his interview with Henderson. Dr. King testified that he had reviewed the notes from the nurse at the Russell County jail and the toxicology report with the results of the blood test taken approximately six hours after the incident, and he was aware that Henderson had been incarcerated in Georgia on a charge of possessing a controlled substance. Henderson argued to the trial court that Dr. King should be allowed to give his opinion about Henderson's intellectual ability and to testify as he had indicated in the psychological report that, \"based on all the information he had,\" it was likely that Henderson was intoxicated at the time of the offense. (R. 2134.) Henderson told the trial court that he could limit his questions on direct examination to those areas, and the trial court said it would allow the testimony with that limitation. During his testimony on direct examination Dr. King testified that he had indicated in his report that Henderson was likely intoxicated at the time of the offense. He said that, when he wrote the report, he had based that opinion solely on Henderson's statement to him that he had been using drugs at or around the time of the offense. Henderson questioned Dr. King about additional information in the report, including his diagnoses of drug dependency and antisocial personality disorder. Dr. King testified that antisocial-personality disorder is not exacerbated by the use of controlled substances and, rather, that antisocial personality disorder results in the use of illicit substances. Henderson's final question to Dr. King was whether, \"through this interview or any other-and/or any other reports or interviews or anything you-that you had at your disposal, did you make any determination whether [Henderson] had ADHD?\" (R. 2144.) Dr. King testified that he could say only that he thought Henderson had been treated for ADHD as an adolescent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On cross-examination, the State asked Dr. King whether, since he had generated the report, he had changed his opinion regarding whether Henderson was intoxicated at the time of the offense, and Dr. King testified that he had. He testified that his opinion was that Henderson was not intoxicated at the time of the offense. The State asked Dr. King why he had changed his opinion, and Dr. King said that he had additional information-the nurse's notes from Henderson's intake\n   evaluation-though he could not remember whether he had the notes when he wrote the report or whether he came across the notes later. Henderson objected \"in terms of what those nurse's notes indicate unless they have that particular witness here.\" (R. 2145.) The trial court sustained the objection; Henderson did not make a motion to strike. A bench conference was held, and the State argued that it was fundamentally unfair to have permitted Henderson to ask Dr. King what he had learned from the nurse's notes and then deny the State the same opportunity, and the trial court overruled State's objection. The trial judge said he thought the parties had no objection to testimony about the nurse's notes, and Henderson said he did not recall. The trial court determined that the nurse's notes had been provided to Henderson in discovery. The trial court asked Henderson whether he wanted the nurse's notes admitted, and Henderson said that he did not. The trial court told the State to get the nurse to testify and \"tie it up.\" (R. 2147.) Henderson again stated that he would object on hearsay grounds to any testimony based on the nurse's notes unless the nurse testified. The State argued that the nurse's notes were not hearsay because they were made for the purpose of medical treatment or diagnosis. See Rule 803(4), Ala. R. Evid. (\"Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment\" are not hearsay.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   During further cross-examination the State asked Dr. King whether he had had an opportunity to learn anything about the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   of the case \"\n   <em>\n    other than the one question I just asked you\n   </em>\n   , what ... actually happened out there?\" (R. 2148.)(Emphasis added.) The \"one question\" had been the basis for Dr. King's opinion that Henderson was not intoxicated at the time of the offense. (R. 2148.) Dr. King testified that he was not sure how to answer the question and said that he had reviewed witness statements and records, including toxicology reports and reports from the Russell County jail. The prosecutor then clarified his question; he submitted to Dr. King in the form of a hypothetical question a lengthy summary of Deputy Bonham's testimony about Henderson's actions leading up to and during the traffic stop, and he then asked Dr. King for his opinion whether, \"[b]ased on that information,\" Henderson was so intoxicated that he could not form the intent to kill. (R. 2151.) Henderson objected and began to state the grounds for the objection, but the trial court interrupted and asked whether Dr. King could form an opinion. The State then asked Dr. King whether he could form an opinion based on those facts and on others he had learned from the file he had read, and Dr. King testified that he could form an opinion. When the prosecutor asked Dr. King for that opinion, Henderson objected on the ground that the question went to Henderson's mental operation and was one for the jury. The trial court sustained the objection. In response to additional questioning by the State, Dr. King testified that he had not been asked as part of his evaluation to determine whether, because of Henderson's intoxication, he was incapable of forming the intent to commit a particular act. The State then asked: \"When you say it's your opinion that the defendant\n   <em>\n    was intoxicated\n   </em>\n   , at what level do you opine that he was actually impaired?\" (R. 2151-52.)(Emphasis added.) Dr. King testified without objection that he did not believe Henderson was impaired. When the State asked Dr. King whether it was possible to ingest a controlled substance and not be impaired to the extent it rendered one\n   incapable of forming intent, Henderson objected on the ground that the matter was a question for the jury, and the trial court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On redirect examination, Dr. King testified that, after he had completed his evaluation and report, he had changed his opinion and now believed Henderson was not intoxicated at the time of the offense. Dr. King also testified that he had spoken with the prosecutors about his report within a few days before he testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Janice McGinnis testified in the State's rebuttal case. She stated that she was a nurse and worked for the Russell County jail. She testified that she had evaluated Henderson when he was brought to the jail as a new inmate on the night of the offense and that she drew a blood sample as part of that evaluation. McGinnis testified that when she asked Henderson about his substance-abuse history he told her that he used only marijuana and alcohol and that he had not used either substance in the two days prior to the offense. Henderson did not mention using methamphetamine. McGinnis testified that she obtained a urine sample from Henderson and that it tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Rule 703, Ala. R. Evid., requires that the facts relied on by an expert other than those gained by firsthand knowledge generally must be admitted into evidence.

The\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   Court also stated: \"There is no reversible error if the facts upon which the opinion is based are admitted into evidence after the expert has testified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7491648\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/127/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7491648\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/127/\">\n    at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Henderson's argument, as best we understand it, is that the trial court erred when it allowed Dr. King to testify that Henderson was neither intoxicated nor impaired at the time of the offense because, he says, Dr. King's opinions were based substantially on facts not in evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As set forth in detail, above, the State attempted to elicit from Dr. King the reason he changed his opinion after he completed his psychological report about whether Henderson was intoxicated at the time of the offense. Dr. King said he had acquired additional information and began to refer to the nurse's notes when Henderson interrupted him and stated that he objected to the testimony about the nurse's notes unless the nurse testified. The trial court sustained Henderson's hearsay objection, and Dr. King did not testify about any opinions that he had based on the nurse's notes. Because Dr. King did not complete his answer or indicate what part of the nurse's notes might have impacted his opinion or how they might have impacted his opinion, and because the trial court sustained Henderson's objection, it cannot fairly be argued that Dr. King's opinion was based on facts not in evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, there was no violation of\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, even if we were to hold that Dr. King's incomplete answer could be interpreted as demonstrating that he relied on the nurse's notes when he changed his opinion, the nurse from the jail who conducted\n   the medical assessment of Henderson when he was booked at the Russell County jail testified that Henderson told her that he had not used any drugs or alcohol in the days before the offense. Because the nurse testified about the results of her medical assessment and about Henderson's denial of drug use in the days before the offense, any testimony that was based on the nurse's examination would not have been hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7491648\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/127/\">\n    575 So.2d at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, even if error occurred as a result of Dr. King's brief and interrupted reference to the nurse's notes with regard to his opinion that Henderson was not intoxicated, it does not rise to the level of plain error. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095438\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/936/#p947\">\n    856 So.2d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947-48 (Ala. 2003) (stating that plain error exists only if failure to recognize the error would \"seriously affect the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings,\" and that the plain-error doctrine is to be \"used sparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Our conclusion that Dr. King's testimony that he had changed his opinion and believed that Henderson was not intoxicated at the time of the offense was not a particularly egregious error affecting Henderson's substantial rights or the outcome of the trial is buttressed by the forensic records and testimony that Henderson tested positive for controlled substances, including methamphetamine that, he said, rendered him unable to form the intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Henderson also argues that\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   was violated when Dr. King testified that he did not believe that Henderson was \"impaired\" at the time of the offense. The prosecutor asked: \"\n   <em>\n    When you say that it's your opinion that the defendant was intoxicated\n   </em>\n   , at what level do you opine that he was actually impaired?\" (R. 2151-52.)(Emphasis added.) Henderson did not object to the question, nor did he object or move to strike Dr. King's answer that he did not believe Henderson was impaired. Henderson's allegation that\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   was violated fails. First, the prosecutor's question was premised on Dr. King's initial opinion that Henderson was, in fact, intoxicated. Second, nothing in the record indicates that Dr. King's testimony was based on any fact not in evidence, and he was not asked to base his opinion on a fact or facts not in evidence. We have considered Dr. King's testimony regarding Henderson's lack of impairment, alone, and as part of Henderson's apparent argument that intoxication and impairment are identical, and we conclude that in neither case does it constitute error and certainly not plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Henderson is not entitled to relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Henderson argues that the State used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of\n   <em>\n    Batson v.

The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   held that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution for the State to remove a black prospective juror from a black defendant's jury solely based on the juror's race.

First, the defendant must establish a prima facie case to raise the inference of discriminatory intent. Second, if the inference of discriminatory intent is established, the prosecution must offer legitimate,\n   race-neutral reasons for striking the jurors in question. Third, the trial court must then evaluate the evidence to determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination in the prosecution's jury strikes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Before Henderson's trial began, a 7-page juror questionnaire consisting of 53 questions\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was mailed to each prospective juror for completion before jury selection began. In addition to the information provided in the questionnaires, the parties gained a great deal of information through the extensive voir dire questioning conducted by the trial court and the parties. After excusals and challenges for cause, there remained 36 prospective jurors from which the jury was selected. In addition, prospective alternate jurors were separated into three panels with three veniremembers each; after the jury was struck the trial court allowed each party to exercise one strike per panel, and the remaining veniremember in each panel served as an alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Each party exercised 12 peremptory strikes to select the jury. The State struck six black veniremembers and six white veniremembers. Henderson struck 12 white veniremembers. The jury was composed of 10 white jurors and 2 black jurors. In each of the three panels from which alternate jurors were chosen, the State struck one black veniremember. Henderson struck two white veniremembers and one black veniremember from the panels of prospective alternates. Two white veniremembers and one black veniremember were selected as alternates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   After the jury was struck, the trial court specifically asked whether the parties wanted to bring anything to its attention. The prosecutor asked whether the court was referring to the defense, and the trial court said, \"Either one. Any motions?\" (R. 1594.) The prosecutor said he had none, and Henderson said that he had no motions either. The trial court stated, \"Okay. That's fine. Okay.\" (R. 1594.) The prosecutor then stated that he would like to put on the record the race-neutral reasons for the strikes, and the trial court allowed it. After the reasons were stated on the record, the trial court said, \"Okay. All right,\" and then asked whether the parties had anything they wanted to bring to the court's attention. (R. 1599.) Henderson said that the defense had nothing to bring to the court's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Henderson argues for the first time on appeal that the State exercised its peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner when it struck black veniremembers. Although the trial court twice invited\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   motions from either party after the jury was struck, Henderson stated that he had none. Because he declined to make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   motion, the trial court had no motion before it and, obviously, Henderson has no adverse ruling from which to appeal. This Court has held that a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objection can be waived, see\n   <em>\n    Calhoun v.

App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   To find plain error in the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   context, we first must find that the record raises an inference of purposeful discrimination by the State in the exercise of its peremptory challenges.

With these principles in mind, we turn to Henderson's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Henderson argues that a prima facie case of discrimination was established by the totality of the circumstances, including: the State's pattern of peremptory strikes against black veniremembers; the State's disparate questioning of black veniremembers and white veniremembers; and the fact that black veniremembers peremptorily struck by the State were as heterogeneous as the community as a whole and shared no common characteristic except their race. Henderson further argues that the State's proffered race-neutral reasons for striking black veniremembers were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In our plain error review of Henderson's claim, we must first determine whether the record supplies an inference of purposeful discrimination by the State in its exercise of peremptory challenges. We have carefully examined the record in light of the factors set out in\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   , and we hold that the record does not raise an inference of racial discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Henderson argues that the State targeted black veniremembers with its peremptory strikes.

(Henderson's brief, at pp. 35-36.) However, Henderson cites nothing in the record demonstrating that the two race-based lists exist, and our review of the record has disclosed none. Although Henderson provides no citation to the alleged lists, he repeatedly refers to \"the two lists\" in his initial brief and in his reply brief.

The court held that the striking pattern was not a per se violation under\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   .

He also asserts that, when the State questioned veniremembers regarding past arrests, convictions, or negative experiences with law enforcement, the\n   State asked more white veniremembers than black veniremembers whether those experiences would affect their ability to be fair and impartial. The record as a whole does not support Henderson's argument that the State targeted black veniremembers for questioning during voir dire. The State extensively questioned black veniremembers and white veniremembers alike. Furthermore, the trial court during individual voir dire first questioned the veniremembers with regard to their answers on the questionnaire or during group voir dire that had necessitated individual questioning. The veniremembers' answers to the trial court's questions provided substantial information to the State about the veniremembers before the State asked its questions so that further questioning in many areas would have been redundant. Additionally, the parties had before them a great deal of information the prospective jurors had provided in their questionnaires, and the necessity for some follow-up questioning during individual voir dire was influenced by that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nothing in the record suggests that the State's questions were designed to provoke responses from black veniremembers and not white veniremembers. And, more to the point, nothing in the record shows or even suggests that the State's questions were designed to elicit disqualifying responses from black veniremembers only. Our review of the jury-selection proceedings demonstrates that the State did not treat black veniremembers differently than it treated white veniremembers. Any disparity in the questioning of black and white veniremembers as to the two questions Henderson discusses does not establish an inference of racial discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Henderson also states that the trial court denied five of the State's challenges for cause against black veniremembers and, he says, the challenges for cause demonstrated that the State made unsuccessful efforts to disproportionately remove black veniremembers. Henderson cites\n   <em>\n    McGahee v. Alabama Department of Corrections\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429036\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/1252/#p1265\">\n    560 F.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265 (11th Cir. 2009), as support. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals addressed a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   issue and stated that this Court, on direct appeal from McGahee's conviction and death sentence, had considered only that the prosecution had used 16 of 22 peremptory strikes against black veniremembers but had failed to consider that all black veniremembers had been removed by the prosecution through challenges for cause and peremptory challenges. The Court stated that there could \"be no clearer 'pattern' than the total removal of all African-American jurors from the venire by the State.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429036\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/1252/#p1265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    McGahee\n   </em>\n   did not discuss the trial court's denial of the prosecution's challenges for cause, and it did not ascribe any meaning to a trial court's denial of challenges for cause.

Specifically, he argues that the State peremptorily struck male and female black veniremembers and that the veniremembers who were struck were of a broad age range and did not share the same career or marital status. This Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    McCray v.

App. 2015). Five of the black veniremembers who were peremptorily struck by the State responded affirmatively to question 33 on the questionnaire: \"Have you, a close relative, or a close friend even been convicted of a crime?\" Four of the black veniremembers who were peremptorily struck by the State disclosed on their juror questionnaires that they had been arrested. The record discloses that the black veniremembers who were struck by the State in this case were not heterogeneous in all respects but race. Therefore, this factor does not support an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Based on our thorough review of the jury-selection process and the juror questionnaires, we find no inference that the State engaged in purposeful discrimination toward black veniremembers; therefore, we find no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Henderson argues that, because the State volunteered its reasons for striking black veniremembers, this Court is obligated to review those reasons under a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   inquiry.

Henderson argues that, according to\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   , a trial court can use information that had not been available to a jury only to undermine a mitigating circumstance.

He raises this argument for the first time in this Court, so we review for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The trial court considered the evidence Henderson had proffered as support for this mitigating circumstance, and it found that the State had rebutted the evidence. The evidence established that Henderson had two prior felonies-possession of methamphetamine and aggravated assault. Those convictions were sufficient evidence upon which the trial court could base its determination that the mitigating circumstance did not exist. Even if the trial court considered Henderson's traffic convictions in its evaluation of whether the statutory mitigating circumstance existed, any error in doing so would not have risen to the level of plain error.

First, Henderson incorrectly states that the trial court considered traffic offenses that did not result in convictions. (Henderson's brief, at p. 68.) The trial court explicitly stated that it had considered only Henderson's adult criminal record, and that it had excluded from consideration any traffic offenses that had not resulted in a conviction or a plea of guilty and those that were still pending.

The Alabama Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Calloway\n   </em>\n   that the trial court had instructed the jury that it was to weigh the credibility of all witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Henderson states: \"Although the court gave a general charge on determining the credibility of\n   <em>\n    lay witnesses\n   </em>\n   , the charge did not remedy the omitted instruction on assessing expert witnesses.\" (Henderson' brief, at p. 71.

The trial court charged the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   \"You are the sole judges as to the weight that should be given to\n   <em>\n    all of the testimony\n   </em>\n   in the case.

The trial court's failure to give an instruction on the evaluation of expert testimony in the absence of a request for that instruction does not rise to the level of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Henderson argues that his conviction and sentence should be reversed because, he says, the State on cross-examination attempted to elicit from his expert, Dr. King, his opinion about whether Henderson had the specific intent to kill at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The State on cross-examination presented to Dr. King a hypothetical question based substantially on the facts of this case, then asked him to state his opinion about whether Henderson was so intoxicated as to have been unable to form the intent to kill. Henderson objected on the ground that the issue presented a jury question, and the trial court sustained the objection. The State later asked Dr. King whether it was possible to ingest a controlled substance and not be so impaired as to be incapable of forming some intent. Henderson objected on the ground that the issue was a jury question, and the trial court sustained the objection. Henderson argues for the first time on appeal that error occurred merely because the State asked the expert questions about the intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Henderson cites cases in which this Court held that reversible error occurred where a trial court permitted expert testimony\n   regarding a defendant's intent to kill. However, he cites no legal authority for the proposition now raised-that reversal is due based on the State's question about the formation of the intent to kill-when the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection before the expert witness answered the question. Henderson's bare allegation of error fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R. App. P., which requires the argument section of an appellant's brief to set out \"the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the cases, statutes, other authorities, and parts of the record relied on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Even though Henderson failed to raise this argument at trial and even though he failed to cite any legal authority to support the argument on appeal, we review for plain error. See\n   <em>\n    Shanklin v.

By sustaining Henderson's objections, the trial court precluded any testimony from Dr. King regarding his opinion about specific intent. Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jurors repeatedly that they were the sole judges of the facts in the case and that they were to determine the facts based, in part, on witness testimony. We presume that the jury follows the trial court's instructions. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

He argues that the photographs were unrelated to Deputy Anderson's death and were inadmissible; that the prosecutor projected the images during closing argument at the guilt phase and improperly argued that the presence of the blade in that location indicated that Henderson also intended to kill Deputy Bonham and that argument served only to establish Henderson's bad character; and that the trial court erred when it considered the blade in affording little weight to his proffered mitigating circumstance that he had remorse for the crime. We review Henderson's claims for plain error because he did not first raise them in the trial court. We find no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The blade was found during the investigation of the crime scene. Photographs of the blade were displayed, without objection, along with many other photographs related to the investigation. Evidence as to the scene of a crime and objects found at the crime scene are admissible and relevant. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Whatley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6920786\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/146/437/\">\n    146 So.3d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2010) (opinion on return to remand). There is no support for Henderson's bare allegation that the photographs were offered to show his bad character. No plain error occurred as a result of the admission of the photographs of the knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   During closing argument the State detailed the evidence it had presented, and it displayed the photographs of the knife while it described Henderson's actions after he had run over Deputy Anderson. The State summarized Deputy Bonham's testimony that, after she fired two shots, she thought she had hit Henderson because he slumped against the driver's window, but he started moving again and she leveled her gun at him told him to get out of the car. The prosecutor questioned why Henderson would possibly want to \"play possum\" and act like he had been struck by one of the bullets and whether Henderson was trying to get Deputy Bonham to move closer to his car because he had not dealt with her yet. Henderson did not object to the prosecutor's argument, but he argues now that the argument was made only to establish his bad character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Alabama law clearly holds that, during closing argument, the parties have a right to present their reasonable impressions from the evidence and to argue legitimate inferences from the evidence. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Largin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368780\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/233/374/#p404\">\n    233 So.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2015), and cases cited therein. The photographs of the knife were in evidence and Deputy Bonham had testified that Henderson had slumped against the window after she had fired shots at him. The prosecutor was permitted to comment on the evidence and on the reasonable inference that, perhaps, by \"playing possum\" and pretending to be shot and incapacitated, Henderson might have been attempting to get Deputy Bonham to walk up to the car because he had a blade next to the driver's door and he wanted to harm her. The prosecutor's comments, although they referred to Henderson's actions and made unfavorable inferences from it, were not improper. They were based on the evidence and on reasonable inferences from the evidence. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Albarran v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004105\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/96/131/#p213\">\n    96 So.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2011). No plain error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Henderson argues that the trial court erred when, in considering the proffered nonstatutory mitigating circumstance of remorse, the trial court gave it little or no weight because, he says, the trial court impermissibly considered the erroneously admitted evidence of bad character in making that determination. Again, Henderson did not raise this argument in the trial court, so we review for plain error. There is no plain error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   First, as discussed, above, the photographs of the blade and testimony about the blade were properly admitted. Therefore, the trial court's reference to the evidence from the crime scene did not constitute consideration of bad-character evidence. Furthermore, the trial court found that Henderson's expression of remorse at the crime scene and during his testimony at the final sentencing hearing constituted a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance. The court explained the many reasons it afforded the circumstance little or no weight:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   \"[T]he Court also bears in mind the statements and demeanor of Alexandria Barfield, specifically that Henderson had threatened harm towards law enforcement prior to the date of the offense; that on the day of the offense, an investigator found a large weapon in Henderson's car accessible from the driver's seat; phone conversations taped days prior to the July 27th, 2012, sentencing hearing from the Russell County Jail, in which Henderson acknowledged that Griffin and Barfield might appear to testify against him and specifically indicating that someone should talk to Barfield; and that Henderson has admitted\n   to lying under oath on at least one occasion. The Court notes in particular that at one point during Henderson's testimony, he callously compared Anderson's death to the collision of two bees he saw on television. While the Court recognizes that the defendant may be remorseful on some level, it affords this mitigating circumstance very little, if any, weight.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   (C. 468.)(Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The record does not support any of Henderson's claims of error with regard to the evidence of the blade found next to the driver's door. Finding no plain error, we conclude that Henderson is not entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   XI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Henderson argues that the trial court erred when it permitted Janice McGinnis, the nurse who conducted Henderson's intake assessment at the Russell County jail to testify about statements he made during her intake assessment because, he says, \"Russell County officials\" questioned him while he was being processed into the county jail. (Henderson's brief, at p. 78.) To the extent Henderson implies that he was questioned by members of law enforcement, he mischaracterizes the record. McGinnis testified, in relevant part, that during her routine intake evaluation of Henderson as a new inmate, Henderson told her that he used only alcohol and marijuana, and that he had used neither in the two days before the offense. Henderson had earlier invoked his right to counsel and, he now argues, because law-enforcement officers were present when the nurse asked the assessment questions, those questions were part of the ongoing criminal investigation. Therefore, he says, the statements should have been excluded, and he cites\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

McGinnis testified, in relevant part, that she was employed at the Russell County jail and that her contact with Henderson came as a result of her job to evaluate him as a new inmate; that the evaluation took place in the infirmary at the Russell County jail; that she asked Henderson questions during the evaluation and that none of the law-enforcement officers who were also in the room directed her to ask any of those questions, including when he last consumed drugs or alcohol; and that her questions to Henderson related to his medical history and had nothing to do with the case. McGinnis testified that Henderson told her that he only used marijuana and alcohol and that he had ingested neither in the two days before the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   McGinnis further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   \"I do this with all my inmates because I want an evaluation on how they are doing. I mean, I knew that he was-had been-had just first come to jail, and that, you know, you want to see how afraid they are, what their suicide status is, what their drug status is, psychiatric status, so that you can take better care of them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   (R. 2249.) She also stated, \"These are the same questions I ask every inmate that I do an assessment on.\" (R. 2250.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   McGinnis testified that it was customary for an inmate to be shackled or handcuffed during the intake assessment, and that Henderson probably was wearing restraints during the assessment; that a law-enforcement officer is always present with the nurse; that one clerk and three law-enforcement officers were present during Henderson's intake evaluation; and that Henderson's answers to her questions appeared to be voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Henderson argued at trial that McGinnis should not be permitted to testify because, he said, he had inferred during the intake assessment that the nurse was acting under the direction of law-enforcement officers and, therefore, the questioning was improper because he had invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights several hours earlier. The trial court asked Henderson whether he had any caselaw holding that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   applies to a nurse's questions during an intake evaluation, and Henderson said that he did not. The trial court stated that it appeared that the nurse was only asking questions that she typically asked any inmate during the intake evaluation process, and it determined that the nurse would be allowed to testify. The trial court acknowledged that the issue was unique, and told the parties it would be glad to review any relevant caselaw they might find. The parties provided none. The nurse testified before the jury, in relevant part, that Henderson had told her that he used only marijuana and alcohol and that he had not used either of those substances in the two days before the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Henderson argues that the trial court erred when it permitted the nurse to testify about the evaluation because, he says, the nurse's questions were made as \"part of an ongoing investigation by law enforcement.\" (Henderson's brief, at p. 81.) He further argues that, because McGinnis's questions were not part of a routine booking process, the State was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his statement was voluntary and that it failed to do so. The trial court determined that the nurse's questions were part of the routine medical-intake process, and we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island v.

Much like conducting a routine booking procedure, McGinnis was performing the intake evaluation she conducted on every newly admitted inmate, and the questions she asked Henderson were no different than those she asked every new inmate. McGinnis testified that law-enforcement officers did not direct her to ask any questions. She said that no one threatened, coerced, or offered any hope of reward to Henderson to make him answer her questions. Furthermore, McGinnis testified that a law-enforcement officer is present during each intake assessment at the jail. If the presence of a law-enforcement officer during an intake assessment of an inmate who invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, alone, is considered a violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , no information or evidence obtained\n   from an intake evaluation would be admissible in any case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Because the trial court correctly determined that McGinnis's questions were not part of the criminal investigation, proof of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   predicate was not required, and, more to the point,\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   was not violated because Henderson was not subjected to interrogation after he invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   The trial court committed no error when it allowed McGinnis to testify, and Henderson is not entitled to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   XII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Henderson argues that the trial court erred when it refused to excuse veniremember C.S. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   During voir dire questioning C.S. stated that he had known Deputy Anderson because the deputy had attended high school with C.S.'s daughters.

He said that he last saw Deputy Anderson when the deputy was working the gates at a ball field.

Henderson vastly overstates the record. The fact that C.S.'s daughters worked on a couple of projects together with Deputy Anderson away from C.S.'s house in no way constitutes \"years of socializing\" with C.S.'s daughters. Deputy Anderson was 39 years old when he was killed, and C.S. did not state that his daughters had any ongoing contact with Deputy Anderson after they completed the high-school projects, and he provided nothing to support Henderson's claim that his daughters socialized with Deputy Anderson during or after high school. C.S. said he saw Deputy Anderson while going into the gates at the ball field, but he was unable to state how long before the deputy's death that had occurred. Furthermore, nothing in the record supports Henderson's current allegation that C.S. and Deputy Anderson had \"continuing interactions\" at ball games. In fact, Henderson stated at trial that Deputy Anderson was working the gate at the ball field, and that C.S. saw him there. (R. 1117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   C.S. clearly stated that he could render a fair and impartial verdict, and that everyone is presumed innocent. The trial court was able to view C.S.'s demeanor and to consider it along with his answers to voir dire questions, and it denied Henderson's motion to strike C.S. for cause. The record provides no basis on which to conclude, as Henderson argues, that any acquaintance C.S. had with Deputy Anderson would have resulted in probable prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Furthermore, even if we had found error in the trial court's ruling, any error would have been harmless.

Crim. App. 2009), and was an argument concerning the strength of the State's case. The prosecutor's references to Henderson's stopping at nothing referred primarily to Henderson's actions after he ran over Deputy Anderson, particularly that Henderson continued to try to drive his car and that he might have \"played possum\" and acted like he had been struck by a bullet Deputy Bonham fired in order to get her to move closer to him so he could inflict harm on her also. The comments\n   were based on facts in evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   We find no plain error for the additional reason that the comments were replies in kind to Henderson's repeated arguments during his closing argument that the State had \"gone to great lengths\" to get the jury to ignore Henderson's intoxication and had attempted to keep evidence about his intoxication out of the case to prevent the jury from making an intelligent decision based on the truth and that, after he spoke to the prosecutor in the days before he testified, Dr. King had changed his opinion about whether Henderson was intoxicated at the time of the offense.

Specifically, he argues: the probation and parole officer who completed the report had made no meaningful assessment of Henderson's familial relationships and the report mistakenly portrayed Henderson's familial relationships as harmonious, even though the record indicates otherwise; the report contains scant information on his mental disability and his military record; and it contained no entry in the section for a sentencing recommendation to the court. Henderson raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, so we review them for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Section 13A-5-47(b), Ala.

Henderson's mother testified at length about Henderson's upbringing and his relationships with his family members and testified that Henderson openly showed his love toward his family. Her testimony included details about Henderson being sexually abused by her father; about his ADHD diagnosis and treatment; about his above-average academic performance in grade school and about the later decline in his grades; about his good relationship with his five children; about his employment history; and about her brother committing suicide when Henderson was about 15 years old, and about his lapse into depression for a long time after the incident because Henderson had been very close to his uncle. During the sentencing hearing before the judge Henderson admitted as exhibits copies of his academic reports and several psychological evaluations he had undergone during grade school and middle school. Henderson testified at the sentencing hearing before the trial judge. He described his history of drug abuse, and he testified about his diagnosis of ADHD and the medications he took for the disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   As in the cases cited above, the trial court had before it a vast amount of information about Henderson. Any inadequacy in the PSI did not constitute plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   To the extent Henderson argues that the PSI was inadequate because it did not contain a recommendation as to sentencing, Rule 26.3(b) does not suggest that a recommendation be included in the report. More importantly, this Court has stated that it did not approve or condone a parole officer's recommendation of punishment. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kuenzel v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7516934\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/474/\">\n    577 So.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (Ala. Crim.

There being no error, and certainly no plain error, Henderson is not entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   XV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Henderson next argues that, at the sentencing hearing before the jury, the original copies contained in State's Exhibit 1, Henderson's criminal history, were submitted to the jury, even though the parties had agreed that the exhibit should be redacted to eliminate any reference to a misdemeanor conviction and to charges for traffic offenses that had been dismissed. Henderson argues that the records contained evidence of prior bad acts and that\n   Rule 404(b), Ala. R. Evid., was violated. This argument is being raised for the first time, so we review it for plain error only. We find no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Henderson's argument is based purely on speculation. He contends that an unredacted copy of his criminal history was submitted to the jury, but the record does not support that assertion. Rather, the record discloses that Henderson stated that he had no objection to the State's presenting to the jury a portion of State's Exhibit 1, certified copies of his two prior felony convictions-one for aggravated assault and one for possession of a controlled substance. The State asked the trial court for permission to remove from its exhibit a page that referred to a misdemeanor traffic conviction, and the trial court allowed it. Henderson then told the trial court that State's Exhibit 1 also contained a reference to an arrest for armed robbery and that the case had been nolle prossed. He asked that the information be redacted from the exhibit; the trial court told the State that it should be redacted; and the State agreed to redact the information. The trial court admitted State's Exhibit 1 into evidence. The State then requested that State's Exhibit 1 in its entirety be admitted as an exhibit for the court record and that only the redacted version go to the jury. The trial court agreed and stated that State's Exhibit 1 would become a Court Exhibit, and that the redacted version of the exhibit, a photocopy of that exhibit with the agreed-upon information blacked out, would go to the jury. The trial court then asked the parties whether they had checked the redacted photocopy, and the parties stated that they had done so. During closing argument the State told the jury that it had introduced an exhibit of a certified prior conviction for aggravated assault, and that it had introduced testimony establishing that, at the time of the crime, Henderson was on parole for unlawful possession of methamphetamine and aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   After the trial court charged the jury, Henderson asked to look at State's Exhibit 1 before it went to the jury. He objected to the indictment for aggravated assault going to the jury, and the trial court agreed to exclude the indictment from the exhibit and allowed the court reporter to remove that page from State's Exhibit 1. When the exhibit had been redacted and Henderson reviewed it, he stated: \"The defense is satisfied State's Exhibit One is redacted.\" (R. 2709.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   As demonstrated above, the record contradicts Henderson's assertion that, \"[e]ven with the State's concession and the trial court's granting of Mr. Henderson's motion to the redact the records, the record does not demonstrate that these criminal records were properly redacted.\" (Henderson's brief, at p. 91.) Therefore, Henderson is not entitled to relief on this claim of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   XVI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Henderson argues that his due-process rights were violated when the trial court failed to give specific reasons for shackling him during the penalty phase of the trial and that he was unjustifiably restrained with leg irons that were visible to the jury. He cites\n   <em>\n    Deck v.

(Henderson's brief, at p. 94 n.48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   This Court has repeatedly held that it will not find plain error based on a silent record, and an error must be obvious on the face of the record or it cannot rise to the level of plain error. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317751\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/972/737/#p755\">\n    972 So.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 (Ala. 2007) (\"Speculation from a silent record will not support a finding of prejudice.).\n   <em>\n    Carroll v.

App. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Furthermore, the record shows that there was no basis at trial for an objection based on\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   because Henderson's restraints were never visible to the jury. Rather, Henderson asked the trial court whether, if he were to take the stand, the court would prefer him to testify from counsel's table because he was wearing leg irons. The trial court stated that Henderson could \"either testify from the table or we can take a recess and we can take the leg irons off of him.\" (R. 2535.) The State objected to the removal of the leg irons based on a report from an officer on the security detail that Henderson had acted out the day before. The State indicated that Henderson could testify from the stand in leg irons and could be moved to and from the witness stand outside the presence of the jury. The trial court stated that, before it would allow that to happen, the State was \"going to have to bring whoever this officer is and ... have a hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding that.\" (R. 2536.) The court stated that it would not mind if Henderson testified from counsel's table. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Henderson said he wanted to be sure that the jury could hear him if he testified from counsel's table, and the court stated that the distance between the jury and counsel's table was not far and the jury should have no difficulty hearing Henderson's testimony but that, if the jury did have difficulty, the court would take a break and adjust. Henderson then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   \"Your Honor, if for some reason he did-we ended up having to put him on the stand prior to the jury coming in here, obviously, I would ask that the jury be dismissed before he be removed from the stand, you know, so the jury didn't see the leg irons. You know, if we went to that point. Obviously, most witnesses get off the stand and, defense, call your next witness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   (R. 2537-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   The trial court then said that, if Henderson were to take the stand in leg irons, first, the officer who believed Henderson was a security risk would have to testify outside the presence of the jury. (R. 2538.) Henderson subsequently informed the trial court that he was going to testify on his own behalf. The trial court asked whether he was going to testify from counsel's table or from the witness stand. Henderson stated that he would prefer to sit at counsel's table, and the State indicated it had no objection. After a bench discussion was held outside the hearing of the court reporter, the trial court stated, \"Make sure his shackles don't show,\" and defense counsel said, \"That's what I was going to do.\" (R. 2627.) Henderson apologized to Deputy Anderson's family members and asked for their forgiveness. Before the State cross-examined Henderson, defense counsel asked the court whether Henderson could remain seated, and the trial court said that would be fine. (R. 2630.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the trial court went to great lengths to be sure that Henderson's rights were protected and that the jury did not see him in restraints. Because Henderson did not appear before the jury in visible restraints,\n   there was no violation of the principles announced in\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    McWhorter v.

Bohannon reasons that because in Alabama the judge, when imposing a sentence of death, makes a finding of the existence of an aggravating circumstance independent of the jury's fact-finding and makes an independent determination that the aggravating circumstance or circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstance or circumstances found to exist, the resulting death sentence is unconstitutional.

Henderson's argument fails under\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Henderson argues in his opening brief and his supplemental brief that his sentence must be reversed because, he says, constitutional principles require the jury to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists and that any aggravating circumstances it finds to exist outweigh any mitigating circumstances it finds to exist. He argues, too, that the ultimate decision to impose the death sentence must be made by the jury. The Alabama Supreme Court rejected these arguments in\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   The jury was properly instructed by the trial court about determining, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, whether any aggravating circumstances existed and, if so, which aggravating circumstances it found to exist. The jury was provided with special interrogatories to complete during deliberations regarding its findings as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jury's responses to those interrogatories established that the jurors found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt four aggravating circumstances to exist: that the capital murder was committed while Henderson was under sentence of imprisonment, \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) ; that Henderson had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence or the threat of violence to another person, \u00a7 13A-5-49(2) ; that Henderson committed the murder for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or to effect an escape from custody, \u00a7 13A-5-49(5) ; and that the offense was committed in order to hinder or disrupt the lawful exercise of a government function or enforcement of the laws, \u00a7 13A-5-49(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   The jury's unanimous determination that even one aggravating circumstance existed beyond a reasonable doubt rendered Henderson eligible for the death penalty. Therefore, the mandate in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   was satisfied, and Henderson is not due any relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   To the extent Henderson argues that\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   prohibits jury-verdict override and, more specifically as in this case, when the trial court's decision was based on evidence not presented to the jury and when the jury was instructed that its sentencing determination was a recommendation, each of those arguments has been rejected. In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Billups\n   </em>\n   , this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-373\">\n   \"The Court in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   also did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   hold ... that judicial sentencing in capital cases is unconstitutional or that it is unconstitutional to allow a trial court, in determining the appropriate sentence in a capital case, to consider evidence that was not presented to the jury. Although\n   the Court in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   found that a jury's capital-sentencing recommendation alone was not sufficient to establish that the jury found the facts necessary for imposition of the death penalty under Florida's capital-sentencing scheme, the Court did not state, or even imply, that it is constitutionally required that a jury, and not a judge, make the ultimate decision whether to sentence a defendant to death or to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Indeed, in reaching its decision in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   , the Court relied on its holdings in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , and ... the Court in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   specifically found that it was permissible 'for judges to exercise discretion-taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender-in imposing judgment\n   <em>\n    within the range\n   </em>\n   prescribed by statute.'\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Billups\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367052\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/954/#p963\">\n    223 So.3d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   As to his argument that the jury's findings regarding aggravating circumstances were undermined by the trial court's instructions that the jury's verdict was advisory, our Court has consistently held that no error occurs when a trial court informs a jury that its sentencing determination is advisory or a recommendation. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Albarran v.

This Court has specifically rejected Henderson's argument and has held repeatedly that aggravating circumstances do not have to be alleged in a capital-murder indictment. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Woodward v.

We are bound by the decisions of the Alabama Supreme Court. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Revis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004183\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/101/247/#p327\">\n    101 So.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (Ala. Crim. App. 2011). More importantly, however, this is not a case in which the jury's guilty verdict, alone, would have permitted the trial court to impose a death sentence, so Henderson's argument is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Henderson is due no relief on his claims that his death sentence must be reversed based on the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   XIX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   As required by \u00a7 13A-5-53, Ala. Code 1975, we must consider the propriety of Henderson's capital-murder conviction and the sentence of death. This statutory review includes our determination of whether any error adversely affecting Henderson's rights occurred during the sentencing proceedings; whether the trial court's findings regarding the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances were supported by the evidence; and whether death is the appropriate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Section 13A-5-53(b) requires that this Court determine: whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of\n   passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; whether an independent weighing by this Court of the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances indicates that death is the proper sentence; and whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   Henderson was convicted pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(6), Ala. Code 1975, for the intentional murder of an on-duty law-enforcement officer, Deputy James Anderson. The record shows that Henderson's sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. See \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(1), Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   By answering a series of special interrogatories regarding aggravating circumstances pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-49, Ala. Code 1975, the jury found unanimously: that the capital murder was committed while Henderson was under sentence of imprisonment, \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) ; that Henderson had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence or the threat of violence to another person, \u00a7 13A-5-49(2) ; that Henderson committed the murder for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or to effect an escape from custody, \u00a7 13A-5-49(5) ; and that the offense was committed in order to hinder or disrupt the lawful exercise of a government function or enforcement of the laws, \u00a7 13A-5-49(7). The trial court found the same four aggravating circumstances to exist. The trial court found no statutory mitigating circumstances to exist, but it found the following nonstatutory mitigating circumstances to exist: that Henderson had expressed remorse; that Henderson was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the offense; that Henderson had been diagnosed as having an antisocial-personality disorder and displaying poor judgment; that Henderson had no violent disciplinary infractions while he was in jail awaiting trial; that Henderson joined the Navy when he was 19 years old; and that Henderson had a good relationship with his children. The trial court's findings as to the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances are supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(2), this Court has independently weighed the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, and we are convinced that the death penalty is the appropriate sentence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(3), Ala. Code 1975, we must determine whether Henderson's sentence is disproportionate or excessive to penalties imposed in similar cases, and we find that Henderson's sentence is neither.

If that is the case, I would note that in the more than 13 years since\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   was decided, the Alabama Supreme Court has never overruled\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , despite having had multiple opportunities to do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Belisle v.

Code 1975. The distinction between a human body part and an automobile is a relatively easy one: an automobile that weighs thousands of pounds is quite unlike a human hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Second is the dissenting opinion's assertion that \"[t]he jury was instructed repeatedly that it could find that [Gregory Lance] Henderson acted with the specific intent to kill Deputy [James] Anderson\n   <em>\n    based solely\n   </em>\n   on the fact that he struck the deputy with his vehicle.\" (Emphasis added.) This is, I think, an overstatement. If the instructions had been as clear as the dissenting opinion characterizes them-and they were not-any reasonable defense attorney would have objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   In the instructions quoted by the dissenting opinion, the only instance I see in which the instruction as characterized therein could be inferred is the circuit court's use of the disjunctive \"and/or\" in its statement: \"Intent may be presumed from the act of using a dangerous instrument\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   from the character of the assault, including the nature and the amount of force used in the fatal injury.\" The circuit court, however, repeatedly instructed the jury to look to the \"circumstances\" to determine whether the requisite intent existed. Moreover, the circuit court thoroughly instructed the jury regarding less culpable mental states as well. Under these circumstances, I am convinced there was no plain error in the circuit court's instructions to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-471\">\n    It is unclear from the record whether the conversation took place days before the murder, or whether it took place the summer before the murder, because both time frames were referenced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-472\">\n    The State's requested jury charge no. 4 stated: \"Intent may be\n    <em>\n     presumed\n    </em>\n    from the act of using a deadly weapon and from the character of the assault, including the nature and amount of force used in the fatal injury.\" (C. 305.)(Emphasis added.) The parties and the trial court agreed to substitute \"dangerous instrument\" for \"deadly weapon,\" and the State's proposed jury charge was given to the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-473\">\n    Henderson argued at closing that Dr. King had not changed his opinion about Henderson's intoxication based on his review of either the nurse's notes or the toxicology report because, he said, Dr. King had already reviewed both before he evaluated Henderson. (R. 2333.) Rather, he argued, Dr. King \"changed his mind when he talked to the DA's Office ....\" (R. 2334.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-474\">\n    Four of the questions were designated as optional; those were related to religion and political-party preference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-475\">\n    In its brief the State points out that Henderson provided no record citation in support of his claim that the State created two lists and that Henderson's unsupported assertion is due no credence. Curiously, in his reply brief Henderson responds to the State's argument by stating, in relevant part: \"While the State relies on the fact that the lists are not in the record, the State does not need to have actually produced physical lists, although it very well may have, to sustain the claim.\" (Henderson's reply brief, at p. 20.) Obviously, the State could not produce lists that do not exist; furthermore, Henderson had the duty to provide this Court with a complete record on appeal, and the Court will not presume error from a silent record.

These instructions are unsupported by Alabama law. Alabama law permits a jury to infer that a defendant acted with the specific intent to kill based on the defendant's use of a deadly weapon, but Alabama law does not permit a jury to presume or infer that a defendant acted with the intent to kill based solely on a defendant's use of a dangerous instrument. The reason Alabama law has never expanded the inference to kill to include a defendant's use of a dangerous instrument is obvious, as will be detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   The statutory definition of a vehicle as a dangerous instrument applies when the \"instrument, ...,\n   <em>\n    under the circumstances in which it is used\n   </em>\n   , ... is highly capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\" (Emphasis added.) A vehicle can be used in a manner that results in an accident that was not the fault of the driver and that may have unintentionally caused a death; a vehicle can be used in a reckless manner that may have caused a death; and a vehicle can be used to intentionally to cause a death. All three scenarios are possible under the definition of a \"dangerous instrument\" in \u00a7 13A-1-2(5), Ala. Code 1975, because the definition requires consideration of the circumstances under which the dangerous instrument was used. Therefore, a death that results from the use of a vehicle or other instrument does not, per se, allow an inference that the driver of the vehicle or the wielder of the instrument had an intent to kill. Henderson's jury was erroneously instructed that it could make that precise inference. The jury was instructed repeatedly that it could find that Henderson acted with the specific intent to kill Deputy Anderson based solely on the fact that he struck the deputy with his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   Clearly, Alabama law does not hold that the mere use of a dangerous instrument-in this case, a vehicle-permits an inference of the specific intent to kill. As a result, instructions that the use of a \"dangerous instrument,\" without more, could be used to infer the intent to kill were incorrect and unsupported by Alabama law, and they undoubtedly had a tendency to mislead the jury. There was no dispute that Henderson was driving the car, so the improper jury charge here eliminated the State's burden to prove the element of intent. The jury charge also undermined the jury's responsibility to find the facts necessary to prove Henderson's guilt beyond\n   a reasonable doubt. Once the improper charge supplied the element of intent, the jury had to find only the additional elements that the deputy was dead and that he had been on duty when he was killed. With the element of intent established by way of the erroneous jury charge, the capital-murder conviction became an inevitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   The trial court's error in instructing the jury that it could infer from Henderson's use of a dangerous instrument that he had the specific intent to kill was exacerbated by the trial court's instruction that \"[i]ntent may be\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   from the act of using a dangerous instrument and/or from the character of the assault, including the nature and the amount of force used in the fatal injury.

The Alabama Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   noticed in its plain-error review that the trial court had incorrectly instructed the jury that the intent to commit murder could be presumed from the defendant's use of a deadly weapon and stated that such an instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. The Court found no plain error and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-432\">\n   \"We have, however, reviewed the entire text of the trial judge's jury instruction on this point. While the trial judge did, toward the beginning of his instruction, say that the intent 'may be presumed,' he then promptly and correctly changed his terminology to say that the intent 'may be inferred' and he concluded his instruction on this topic with the correct 'may-be-inferred' terminology. The absence of any objection by the defendant specifically directed to the court's initial incorrect verbiage that intent 'may be presumed' suggests that the defendant was satisfied that the trial judge's corrected language was adequate to eliminate any prejudice from the initially incorrect language.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11405684\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/827/193/\">\n    827 So.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   in two respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   First, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   , where the trial court's instruction that intent could be presumed was an error that was promptly corrected, in this case the trial court's instruction that intent could be presumed was not simply the result of the trial court's initial incorrect statement, nor was it immediately corrected. Rather, the State initiated the error when it submitted the following proposed jury charge: \"Intent\n   may be\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   from the act of using a deadly weapon and from the character of the assault, including the nature and amount of force used in the fatal injury.\" (C. 305.)(Emphasis added.) The trial court then instructed the jury using the \"may-be-presumed\" terminology from the proposed instruction and further instructed that intent could be presumed from the use of a dangerous instrument rather than a deadly weapon. Thus, the incorrect instruction-that intent could be presumed-was not inadvertent, and the instruction improperly relieved the State of its constitutional burden to prove that Henderson acted with specific intent. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable as to this point and does not preclude a finding of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Second, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   stated that the defendant's failure to object to the trial court's instruction that intent could be presumed suggested that the defendant had determined that the trial court's subsequent instruction that intent could be inferred eliminated any prejudice that might have resulted from the incorrect initial instruction. Again, this case is distinguishable. Here, there is no indication that Henderson's failure to object to the instruction regarding the presumption of intent was based on a strategic decision or a determination that any prejudice was eliminated by the instruction that intent could be inferred, and any belief that prejudice was eliminated because the trial court also instructed the jury on the inference of intent was based on trial counsel's misapprehension of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   The record reflects that the State had submitted proposed instructions that included the term \"deadly weapon,\" and the trial court stated that it had a problem with the instructions because the State was basing its case on Henderson's use of a \"dangerous instrument.\" Henderson stated that he also had that objection. The State said it would substitute \"dangerous instrument\" for \"deadly weapon,\" and Henderson said that, as long as that substitution was made, he had no objection to those instructions on that basis. Therefore, even if the trial court had attempted to correct its instruction on the presumption of intent, the trial court continued to instruct the jury erroneously that it could infer intent from the use of a\n   <em>\n    dangerous instrument\n   </em>\n   -an instruction and legal theory entirely without support in Alabama law. Furthermore, even if, as in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   , the record suggested that Henderson had determined that no prejudice occurred as a result of the trial court's instruction on the presumption of intent, that determination would have been flawed because there is no legal authority in Alabama permitting or approving a jury charge stating that the intent to kill can be inferred from the use of a dangerous instrument. Therefore, the lack of an objection to the instruction on the presumption of intent does not weigh against a finding of prejudice with regard to that instruction, and\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burgess\n   </em>\n   does not support the majority's holding that no plain error occurred as a result of the trial court's erroneous instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   The jury, of course, was instructed that Henderson was presumed to be innocent, and that the presumption of innocence remained throughout trial unless each juror determined from the evidence that Henderson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but those instructions acted to reinforce the instruction that the jury could also\n   <em>\n    presume\n   </em>\n   that Henderson had the intent to kill because he used a dangerous instrument. Furthermore, the instructions regarding the presumption of innocence were inconsistent with the instruction that the jury could\n   <em>\n    infer\n   </em>\n   that Henderson had the intent to kill. The two terms were never defined for the jury, and the conflict between those instructions was never clarified\n   for the jury. A reasonable juror could easily have resolved the conflict by choosing to\n   <em>\n    presume\n   </em>\n   that Henderson had the specific intent to kill solely based on his use of a dangerous instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   The general instructions on the presumption of innocence did not dispel the plain error that resulted from the challenged instruction regarding the presumption of the intent to kill.

Nonetheless, that invited error rose to the level of plain error because there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in an improper manner.

The trial court instructed that \"[i]ntent may be presumed from the act of using a dangerous instrument\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   from the character of the assault, including the nature and the amount of force used in the fatal injury.\" (R. 2447.)(Emphasis added.) By including the conjunction, \"or,\" the trial court reinforced the portion of the jury charge that erroneously instructed the jury that it could presume from the mere act of using a vehicle that Henderson had the specific intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   By following the instructions it received, the jury could have found Henderson guilty of capital murder based solely on the fact that he struck Deputy Anderson with a vehicle, without explicitly finding that he had the specific intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   The trial court's instruction that intent could be inferred from the character of the assault was also erroneous. The judge instructed the jury, in relevant part that intent \"may be inferred from the character of the assault and the use of a dangerous\n   instrument and other attendant circumstances\" (R. 2446-47); that \"[i]ntent may be presumed from the act of using a dangerous instrument\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   from the character of the assault, including the nature and the amount of force used in the fatal injury\" (R. 2447)(emphasis added); and that \"[t]he intent to cause the death of the deceased may be inferred from the character of the assault, the use of a dangerous instrument and all other attending circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased.\" (R. 2449.) These instructions again informed the jury that it could separately consider the use of a dangerous instrument as a sole means of finding that Henderson acted with the specific intent to kill, again reinforcing the error that occurred in other portions of the jury charge. As discussed earlier in this dissent, the definition of \"dangerous instrument\" in \u00a7 13A-1-2(5), Ala. Code 1975, states, in relevant part, that a dangerous instrument is an \"instrument, article, or substance which,\n   <em>\n    under the circumstances in which it is used\n   </em>\n   , attempted to be used, or threatened to be used, is highly capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the manner in which the defendant used a vehicle or other dangerous instrument is\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   of the circumstances that may properly be considered by a jury in determining whether the accused had the specific intent to kill the victim. The jury should have been instructed that it could consider whether the use of a vehicle was the use of a dangerous instrument and that it could consider the manner in which it was used in order to determine intent. Because the driver of a vehicle could cause a death accidentally, recklessly, or intentionally, the mere use of a vehicle is not a fact that allows an inference that Henderson had a specific intent to commit murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   Each of the instructions above as it relates to the character of the assault is plagued with ambiguity. It can be argued that the instructions do not indicate to the jury whether it could consider the character of the assault to independently allow the inference of intent to kill; whether the jury could consider that the use of a dangerous instrument and all other circumstances would independently allow the inference of an intent to kill; or whether all three factors should be considered together. The ambiguity of this part of the trial court's charge leaves no way for this Court to determine the manner in which the jury did, in fact, interpret the instructions. It is possible that some members of the jury considered the instructions to mean that the jury could infer intent only after considering all the matters delineated and that other members of the jury could have interpreted the instructions to mean that the jury could infer intent from any of them considered separately. The fact that the instructions might have been considered correctly by some members of the jury does not diminish the possibility that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury as a whole applied the instructions in a way that violated Henderson's constitutional rights and permitted the jury to find him guilty of capital murder without first finding that he acted with the specific intent to kill Deputy Anderson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   The trial court also instructed the jury that the intent to kill could be inferred \"from any deliberate action which is in the natural attempted and-which is naturally attempted and usually results in danger to the life of another.\" (R. 2448.) However, Henderson was not charged with engaging in actions that\n   <em>\n    usually\n   </em>\n   result in danger to the life of another, he was charged with specifically intending to cause the death of\n   Deputy Anderson. This part of the instruction impermissibly lessened the State's burden of proof, and it permitted the jury to find that the State did not have to prove that Henderson acted with the specific intent to kill but, rather, that the State had to prove only the mental state of recklessness\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to find Henderson guilty of capital murder. \"According to Alabama law, a defendant must have the intent to kill in order to be found guilty of a capital offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Heard v.

Consideration of the circumstances under which an object was used is limited by statute and caselaw to determining whether an object constitutes a\n   <em>\n    dangerous instrument\n   </em>\n   , and that consideration has no place in determining whether an object constitutes a deadly weapon. Section 13A-1-2(5), Ala.

Because\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   failed to follow the holding of the Alabama Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Cobb\n   </em>\n   , this Court should reverse\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and all other cases from the Court of Criminal Appeals holding that, to determine whether an object constitutes a deadly weapon, the totality of the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the object and the manner in which it is used, should be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   Court incorrectly interpreted and applied a portion of the definition of a deadly weapon. Section 13A-1-2(7), Ala. Code 1975, defines a deadly weapon as \"[a] firearm or anything manifestly designed, made, or\n   <em>\n    adapted\n   </em>\n   for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"adaptation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   as \"[t]he act or process of fitting or suiting one thing or form to another; the process of adjusting oneself or some thing to new conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   44 (10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2014). For example, when a toothbrush has been sharpened to a point for the purpose of stabbing someone, the toothbrush has been adjusted to new conditions and fitted from one form to another, and it can correctly be said that the toothbrush was adapted for the purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury. \"Adopt\" has been defined as \"to take up and practice or use.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   17 (11th ed. 2003). For example, when a baseball bat is swung at a person's head with the intent to cause physical harm, the baseball bat has been adopted for that use. No change was made to the bat, it was merely used by the person with an intent other than the one for which the bat was originally made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   incorrectly stated that the piece of a concrete block Harris had thrown into the victim's vehicle had been\n   <em>\n    adapted\n   </em>\n   to inflict death or serious physical injury. The piece of concrete block had not been changed or altered. Therefore, it would have been correct to state that the concrete block had been\n   <em>\n    adopted\n   </em>\n   or used in such a way as to inflict death or serious physical injury, but it had not been\n   <em>\n    adapted\n   </em>\n   to do so and, therefore, the concrete block did not constitute a deadly weapon. For this additional reason,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and should be overruled by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   Henderson's vehicle was not manifestly designed, made, or\n   <em>\n    adapted\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of causing Deputy Anderson's death. Therefore, the vehicle did not constitute a deadly weapon, and the jury could not have inferred based solely on the fact that Henderson ran over the deputy that he acted with the specific intent to kill. The majority's assertion otherwise contravenes a holding of the Alabama Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Considering the jury charge as a whole and as a reasonable juror may have interpreted it, as a reviewing court must do, I am convinced that the trial court's instructions on intent contained so many errors that there is at least a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instructions in an improper manner and that the jury was permitted to convict Henderson of capital murder without finding that he had the specific intent to kill. The record establishes that the errors in the jury charge constituted plain error, and that Henderson is due a reversal of his capital-murder conviction and death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-479\">\n    The error that resulted from the trial court's erroneous use of the word, \"presume,\" is specifically discussed in Part II.A. of this dissent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-480\">\n    For example, \u00a7 13A-6-2(a)(2), Ala.
