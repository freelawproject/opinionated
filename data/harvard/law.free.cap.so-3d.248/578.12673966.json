For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences and grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because defendant pled guilty, the facts were not fully developed at a trial. However, during the guilty plea colloquy, the State provided the following factual basis for the guilty pleas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [O]ur evidence in this case would have proven that Mr. Vaughn on or about March 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of this year violated La. R.S. 14:64.1 and that he did rob one Leda Baney ... while leaving ... said victim to reasonably believe that he was armed with a dangerous weapon. In connection with count two our evidence would have further proven that Mr. Vaughn on the same date committed a violation La. R.S. 14:35 and that he did commit a simple battery upon a juvenile. His date of birth was 2/27/11, he did that by using force or violence upon that individual person without their permission. With regard to count three our evidence would have proven that Mr. Vaughn on December 29\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of last year violated\n   La. R.S. 14:64.1 and that he did rob one Dariana Davis while leaving that victim to reasonably believe that he was armed with a dangerous weapon, and count four we would have additionally proven that on May 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of this year Mr. Vaughn violated La. R.S. 14:62.3 by committing unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling located at 200 Acorn Street in Kenner. It was the home or abode of one Daniel Gray. All those violations occurred in Jefferson Parish within this court's jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 30, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney charged defendant, John F. Vaughn, with two counts of first degree robbery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:64.1 ; one count of cruelty to a juvenile, in violation of La. R.S. 14:93 ; and one count of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, in violation of La. R.S. 14:62.3. On October 16, 2017, the State amended the bill of information to reduce the charge of cruelty to a juvenile to misdemeanor simple battery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 16, 2017, defendant withdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty to the charges as amended. In accordance with the plea agreement set forth in the record, the trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent sentences as follows: for each count of first degree robbery, twenty years at hard labor; for misdemeanor simple battery, six months in parish prison; and for unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, twelve years at hard labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During that same hearing, the State filed a multiple offender bill of information, alleging defendant to be a second felony offender, to which defendant stipulated. In accordance with a plea agreement set forth in the record, the trial court vacated defendant's underlying sentence for unauthorized entry into an inhabited dwelling, and sentenced defendant pursuant to La. R.S. 15:529.1 to twelve years at hard labor to run concurrently with his other sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 8, 2017, defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence and a Notice of Appeal and Designation of Record, seeking an appeal from the \"judgment rendered on October 16, 2017.\" The trial court denied the motion to reconsider sentence and granted defendant's motion for appeal on November 27, 2017.

R.S. 14:35(B) sets forth the penalties for simple battery, which are a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Thus, simple battery is not triable by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The proper procedure for seeking review of a misdemeanor conviction is\n   an application for writ of review asking this Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

Here, the misdemeanor and felony convictions are intertwined to the point that the interests of justice may be better served by considering the matters together.

If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.

She notes that an examination of the plea colloquy reveals that the district court explained to defendant each of the rights necessary to ensure a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights. She notes that he was informed of the maximum penalties for each of the offenses to which he was pleading. With respect to the habitual offender proceeding, appellate counsel avers that defendant was advised that he had the right to a hearing on the allegations and to require the State to prove the allegations\n   contained in the bill. Appellate counsel asserts that the court reviewed with defendant the sentences that it would impose as a result of his guilty plea and his stipulation to the multiple offender bill of information, which were the sentences that were imposed. As such, she notes that defendant is restricted from appealing his sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record which states she filed an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief and that defendant has a right to file his own brief in this appeal. Additionally, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed and of his opportunity to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State responds that appellate counsel correctly notes that the case presents no non-frivolous issues for appellate review. The State notes that the trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy with defendant and explained the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. The State avers that defendant's sentences were within the statutory limits. The State concludes that defendant voluntarily and intelligently entered into his guilty pleas, and there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. The bill of information and amended bill of information properly charged defendant, plainly stated the essential facts of the charged offenses, identified defendant, and the crimes charged.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 464 - 466. As reflected by the minute entries and commitment, defendant appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him. He attended his arraignment, his guilty plea proceeding, his sentencing, and his multiple bill proceeding, including his stipulation and enhanced sentencing. As such, defendant's presence, or lack thereof, does not present an issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, defendant pled guilty as charged in the amended bill of information; he also admitted to being a second felony offender as alleged in the multiple bill. If a defendant pleads guilty, he normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wingerter\n   </em>\n   , 05-697 (La. App. 5 Cir. 3/14/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440853\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/662/#p664\">\n    926 So.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664. Additionally, an unconditional plea, willingly and knowingly made, waives any and all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant from later asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the multiple offender hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Schaefer\n   </em>\n   , 97-465 (La.

Thus, the record does not contain any pre-trial rulings that could have been preserved for appeal under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, a review of the record reveals no irregularities in defendant's guilty pleas that would render them invalid. Once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La.

The record reflects that defendant acknowledged reviewing the waiver of rights form with his attorney. The record shows that defendant was aware he was charged with and pleading guilty to two counts of first degree robbery, one count of misdemeanor simple battery, and one count of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. Defendant was also properly advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy with the trial judge, defendant was advised of his right to a trial by jury, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant indicated both by his signature on the waiver of rights form and verbally with the trial judge that he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving these rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant was also informed that if he would be convicted of any felony in the future, he could be multiple billed under the habitual offender law which would increase the penalty for that conviction. Defendant confirmed that his pleas were knowing, intelligent, free and voluntary and that no promises or threats had been made to encourage him to plead guilty. Moreover, a factual basis was given by the State for the charged offenses, and defendant indicated he was pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty. After his colloquy with defendant, the trial judge accepted defendant's guilty pleas as knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Additionally, during the guilty plea colloquy and by means of the waiver of rights form, defendant was advised of the maximum six-year sentence he faced for the crime of unauthorized entry of an inhabited building and the maximum six-month sentence he faced for simple battery. Because neither of those charges have a mandatory minimum penalty, defendant was not advised of the mandatory minimum penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:62.3 and La. R.S. 14:35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, although defendant was advised of the maximum forty-year sentence that he faced for the crimes of first degree robbery on counts one and three, he was not advised of the mandatory minimum three-year penalty he faced for the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:64.1. The record reflects that the defendant was also not advised as to the mandatory restriction of benefits he faced for first degree robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:64.1(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was, however, informed of actual sentences that would be imposed if he pled guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 556.1(A)(1) provides that, prior to accepting a guilty plea, the court must personally inform the defendant of the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, any mandatory minimum penalty, and the maximum possible penalty.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we find that no substantial rights of defendant were affected by the trial court's lack of advisal concerning the minimum sentence defendant faced for the crime of first degree robbery and this does not present an issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, with respect to the trial court's failure to advise defendant as to the mandatory restriction of benefits he faced, this Court has noted, in a similar factual situation, that the omission of an advisal regarding the restriction of benefits did not present an issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record indicates that defendant reviewed the multiple offender waiver of rights form with his attorney. The waiver of rights form and the colloquy between the trial judge and defendant indicate that defendant was advised of his right to a hearing at which the State would have to prove his multiple offender status and of his right to remain silent throughout the hearing. Defendant was also advised of the potential sentencing range as a second felony offender and the sentence that would be imposed. Defendant indicated that he had not been forced or coerced into stipulating to the multiple bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Afterward, the trial judge accepted his stipulation to the multiple bill as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made by defendant. By stipulating to the multiple bill, defendant waived his right to a hearing and any possible non-jurisdictional defects were also waived. Defendant is barred from asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the multiple bill hearing when he waived the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaefer,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871677\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/300/#p304\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With regard to defendant's sentences, La.
