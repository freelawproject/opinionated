As French Quarter residents living near Funky 544 at 723 Toulouse St., the Appellants [Yokum] aver that they submitted verbal and written complaints to the nightclub's operators requesting cessation of the excessive amplified sound emanating from the property, but to no avail. Consequently, in 2010, they filed suit against Funky 544 asserting misdemeanor nuisance claims punishable by fines and/or imprisonment resulting from their amplifier and sub-woofer usage.[footnote omitted] The Appellants sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages. The Appellants explain that their lawsuit involves nuisance claims relating to physical sound-wave trespasses of excessive sound levels. Additionally, Mr. Yokum also raised claims under Sec. 66-136 et seq. of the Code of Ordinances for the City of New Orleans, which is also known as the City of New Orleans Noise Ordinance (\"the NONO\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 7, 2013, the district court issued a preliminary injunction wherein it ordered that Funky 544:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ... be enjoined from violating and shall comply with all applicable sections of the City of New Orleans Noise Ordinance, Sections 66-136, et seq., and specifically, Sec. 66-201, 202 and 66-203. This Court has instructed the Defendants [Funky 544] immediately institute policies and procedures to ensure the level of noise emanating from Defendants' premises does not exceed the sound level as indicated in Sec. 66-202 \"Maximum permissible sound levels by receiving land use.\" This includes, but is not limited to, taking appropriate measurements as called for by the City of New Orleans Noise Ordinance Sec. 66-201[footnote omitted] and reducing the level of sound emanating from the premises as necessary to comply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Appellants later filed a Motion for Violation of the Preliminary Injunction and/or Contempt asserting that Funky 544 failed to comply with the preliminary injunction. They assert that Funky 544 refused to institute a sound control program to comply with the NONO and did not maintain compliance documents. The district court referred the motion to trial on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   After several days of trial, a jury determined that Funky 544 was not a nuisance to the Appellants, who were not awarded damages. Post-trial, the district court considered the Appellants' Motion for Judgment Not Withstanding Verdict and a Motion for New Trial, which were denied by the district court. The district court also considered the Appellants' Motion for Violation of the Preliminary Injunction and/or for Contempt and Motion for Permanent Injunction. The district court denied both motions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The appeal currently before this Court arises from the jury trial, at which Yokum was not awarded any damages and all claims by Yokum against Funky 544 were dismissed with prejudice. While Yokum's motion for new trial and/or JNOV was under advisement, the district court also ruled upon the motion for permanent injunction, which was the subject of the prior appeal. After the district court denied Yokum's motion for new trial and/or JNOV,\n   the instant appeal followed, in which Yokum sets forth sixteen (16) assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yokum contends that the district court erred in two respects in its jury instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 by rejecting the jury instruction requested by Yokum regarding the appropriate evidentiary weight to give uncontroverted and unrebutted evidence\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 by refusing to give a jury instruction regarding spoliation and adverse inference relative to certain evidence destroyed by Funky 544\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court set forth the following standard of review relative to jury instructions in\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Rhodia, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2007-2110, pp. 6-8 (La. 5/21/08),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8226110\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/798/#p804\">\n    983 So.2d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 804-05 (internal citations omitted):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Adequate jury instructions are those which fairly and reasonably point out the issues and which provide correct principles of law for the jury to apply to those issues. The trial judge is under no obligation to give any specific jury instructions that may be submitted by either party; the judge must, however, correctly charge the jury. If the trial court omits an applicable, essential legal principle, its instruction does not adequately set forth the issues to be decided by the jury and may constitute reversible error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Louisiana jurisprudence is well established that an appellate court must exercise great restraint before it reverses a jury verdict because of erroneous jury instructions. Trial courts are given broad discretion in formulating jury instructions and a trial court judgment should not be reversed so long as the charge correctly states the substance of the law....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   However, when a jury is erroneously instructed and the error probably contributed to the verdict, an appellate court must set aside the verdict.... Ultimately, the determinative question is whether the jury instructions misled the jury to the extent that it was prevented from dispensing justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ... Because the adequacy of jury instruction must be determined in the light of jury instructions as a whole, when small portions of the instructions are isolated from the context and are erroneous, error is not necessarily prejudicial. Furthermore, the manifest error standard for appellate review may not be ignored unless the jury charges were so incorrect or so inadequate as to preclude the jury from reaching a verdict based on the law and facts. Thus, on appellate review of a jury trial the mere discovery of an error in the judge's instructions does not of itself justify the appellate court conducting the equivalent of a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , without first measuring the gravity or degree of error and considering the instructions as a whole and the circumstances of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Yokum requested the following jury instruction on uncontroverted evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The law is clear that in evaluating the evidence, you should accept as true uncontradicted testimony of a plaintiff witness absent a sound reason for its rejection, and these factual finding[s] are to be given great weight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court gave the following instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ...if the testimony on any point is not contradicted, you should treat it as proving that fact unless the testimony seems to you to be impossible or improbable or unless the witness has shown by his or\n   her testimony or it is shown by the other evidence in the case to be unworthy of belief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, Yokum argues that the jury instruction given by the district court was confusing and \"encourage[d] the jury to doubt uncontroverted testimony.\" Funky 544 contends that the district court's instruction was a correct statement of the law and was very similar to the instruction proposed by Yokum. Funky 544 also argues that Yokum failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the jury instruction; thus, he failed to preserve the issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We agree with Funky 544. Yokum waived appellate review of this issue because he objected to the instruction for the first time in his motion for new trial and/or JNOV. La. C.C.P. art. 1793(C) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto either before the jury retires to consider its verdict or immediately after the jury retires, stating specifically the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. If he objects prior to the time the jury retires, he shall be given an opportunity to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Nevertheless, if jury instructions or interrogatories contain a 'plain and fundamental' error, the contemporaneous objection requirement is relaxed and appellate review is permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Prop. Interests, L.L.C. v. Broussard\n   </em>\n   , 2015-0299, p. 4 (La.

Moreover, Yokum fails to explain how the jury instruction at issue is an incorrect statement of law. Consequently, Yokum is precluded from raising this assignment of error because he did not object to the jury instruction regarding uncontroverted evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Yokum also argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury regarding spoliation and adverse inference. During discovery, Yokum took depositions of Funky 544 pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1442, through its representatives Jude Marullo (\"Marullo\") and Anthony D'Arensbourg (\"D'Arensbourg\"). Marullo is the managing member of Funky 544, and D'Arensbourg is its general manager. Both Marullo and D'Arensbourg denied in their depositions that Funky 544 had any policy to record sound measurements taken by the nightclub staff or that any Funky 544 records existed of such sound measurements. According to Marullo and D'Arensbourg, nightclub staff were using a sound reader to determine sound levels but were not writing down or recording any measurements. Subsequently, Funky 544 disclosed to Yokum that, for a limited period of time, the sound measurements taken by Funky 544 employees in the doorway of the nightclub were written on \"band production sheets;\" however, Funky 544 did not retain those records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Yokum filed a motion for contempt, and on June 19, 2014, the district court found that \"spoliation did occur,\" granted the motion against Funky 544, and denied the motion as to Marullo. The district court ordered that Funky 544 is \"estopped from disputing the sound readings made by [Yokum's] expert from the doorway\" of the nightclub. Thereafter, Funky 544 filed a motion for reconsideration. On August 29, 2014, the district court granted the motion, finding that the \"improperly destroyed\n   sound readings taken from the doorway of Funky 544... has not harmed or prejudiced\" Yokum. Nevertheless, the district court determined that Yokum was denied access to these readings and ordered that Funky 544 \"will not be allowed to produce any of the band production sheets at the trial of this matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Prior to trial, Yokum requested the following jury instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The court instructs the jury that, with regard to inferences to be drawn from a party's destruction of evidence, the test is whether the court can draw from fact that a party has destroyed evidence and that the party did so in bad faith. If you, the jury, find that the defendant intentionally hid or destroyed evidence, then you may infer that evidence would be unfavorable to defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court did not include the proposed instruction or any other instructions on the legal standard for spoliation or adverse inference. Yokum objected to the exclusion of its proposed instruction before the jury received its instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The theory of spoliation of evidence refers to the 'intentional destruction of the evidence for the purpose of depriving the opposing parties of its use.' \"\n   <em>\n    Everhardt v.

While different sanctions may be appropriate under the facts of a given case, \"courts agree that [a court] should impose the least severe sanction necessary to remedy prejudice to the non-spoliating party.\" [Footnote omitted.] Any sanction to be imposed by the trial court should be tailored to the particular facts existing in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The range of possible sanctions include dismissing a case, rendering a default judgment, striking pleadings, striking a claim or defense, and excluding evidence. A determination as to what sanction is appropriate in a particular case is a matter within the province of the trial court, depending upon the facts present. As with other evidentiary and discovery rulings, the trial court has much discretion in deciding which sanction, if any, to impose. The appellate standard of review for a trial court's evidentiary ruling on this issue is whether the trial court abused its broad discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   La.

He contends that certain evidence he introduced at trial was not rebutted but was improperly disregarded by the jury. According to Yokum's argument, this evidence required a reasonable jury to find Funky 544 liable for Yokum's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Yokum argues that he presented uncontroverted evidence that Funky 544's activities interfered with Yokum's use and enjoyment of his home for at least four years. Yokum relies on a complaint log he created, along with his testimony about the log, in which he attributed noise from several different sources on different occasions, including Funky 544. The testimony at trial revealed that Yokum lives within one block of Bourbon Street and that multiple bars, nightclubs, and other establishments that play music are located near his home. The complaint log begins ten years before Funky 544 opened in 2006. This log contains complaints not only about Funky 544, but also against several other establishments near Yokum's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Yokum also contends that evidence of excessive noise levels at Funky 544 in March 2011 and October 2012 was uncontroverted. During the time period in question, Yokum's expert noise control engineer, Arno Bommer, opined that noise from Funky 544 was excessive; according to Yokum, Bommer's testimony was uncontroverted because no defense expert had been retained in 2011 or 2012, and Funky 544 did not introduce expert testimony about any testing during that period. Funky 544's expert, Zwerling, was engaged in 2013. Both experts testified at trial as to their respective testing methodologies, findings, and opinions regarding testing by the other experts, which this Court discussed in its prior opinion in\n   <em>\n    Yokum\n   </em>\n   , 2015-1353 at pp. 8-9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187920\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1065/#p1067\">\n    202 So.3d at 1071-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bommer and Zwerling offered differing opinions regarding what the sound level at Funky 544 should be so as to not impact Yokum and the proper method to measure ambient sound under the NONO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bommer's 2011 and 2012 testing focused on determining whether Funky 544 violated the NONO, which involved taking sound measurements on Bourbon Street and Toulouse Street outside of Funky 544, as well as outside of Yokum's home. Bommer did not conduct any testing or measure any sound levels\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   of Yokum's home in 2011 or 2012. Zwerling's testimony criticized Bommer's methodology during this period as failing to demonstrate the impact of sound on Yokum inside his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Yokum also argues that Funky 544 knew their noise levels were audible within Yokum's home and that Funky 544's expert admitted that its noise levels were excessive and impacted the neighbors. Marullo and D'Arensbourg testified, however, that they knew of Yokum's\n   <em>\n    complaints\n   </em>\n   of noise from Funky 544. Marullo testified regarding numerous measures taken at the\n   nightclub to reduce the level of sound leaving Funky 544 once Yokum's complaints came to his attention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that his office is located on the second floor of Funky 544, that he is not disturbed by the music downstairs in the nightclub, and that he does not believe that the sound that Yokum hears in his home is from Funky 544. D'Arensbourg testified that when he received complaints from Yokum, he would instruct musicians and staff to reduce the volume of music. Zwerling testified that his statements regarding excessive noise impacting the neighbors appeared in an initial letter to Funky 544 and were based only on Bommer's reports before ever having visited Funky 544 or the French Quarter. Zwerling stated that after having taken sound measurements at Funky 544 and while walking in the direction of Yokum's home, he concluded that music from Funky 544 was inaudible within 30 feet of the nightclub and was inaudible at the doorway of Yokum's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Yokum also contends that evidence of causation between Funky 544's noise and Yokum's medical conditions was unrebutted. Yokum relies on the testimony by Dr. Robert Porter, a neuropsychologist, who treated Yokum and Anderson and diagnosed them with adjustment disorder that was caused by noise. While Dr. Porter testified that part of the noise at issue came from Funky 544, he also clarified that his opinion as to the source of noise was based on statements by Yokum and Anderson and reports by Bommer. Yokum also contends that the medical opinions of Dr. Kevin Bianchini and Dr. Arline Bronzaft, as well as Zwerling's findings, support Dr. Porter's opinion. Nevertheless, neither Dr. Bianchini's report nor Dr. Bronzaft's testimony differentiates between the multiple sources of noise in the area. Also, Zwerling testified as to the results of controlled impact testing done in June 2014 inside Yokum's home, in which Bommer and representatives of the parties participated, which was done during daytime when other establishments in the area were closed. Zwerling testified that the testing revealed no significant change in sound levels between when Funky 544 was playing music and when it was not. Zwerling also concluded that music from Funky 544 was barely audible in Yokum's bedroom when the air conditioner was off, and was inaudible with the air conditioning on or the bedroom door closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons ascribed above, we cannot agree with Yokum's characterization of the evidence in question as uncontroverted or unrebutted. This Court has stated that \"[w]here there is conflict in the testimony, reasonable evaluation of credibility should not be disturbed on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Yokum\n   </em>\n   , 2015-1353 at p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187920\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1065/#p1067\">\n    202 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1071 (citing\n   <em>\n    Badke v.

Funky 544 argued, and the district court agreed, that the 2014 measurements were different from the earlier doorway readings at issue in Yokum's motion for contempt and were outside the scope of the district court's order finding spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In the documents containing the 2014 measurements, Funky 544 recorded the ambient sound level, the sound level 25 feet from the nightclub's door, and a reading in the doorway closest to the speakers.

At trial, Yokum and Anderson each testified as to their individual complaints about noise from neighboring businesses, and Yokum testified about a complaint log that he kept regarding noise from several different French Quarter businesses. Yokum's experts, Bommer and Dr. Porter, both testified about work they performed for Yokum in connection with his complaints of noise from other businesses and about Yokum's complaint log.

Nevertheless, Yokum's counsel mentioned the injunction in both opening and closing statements to the jury. In addition, the preliminary injunction dealt largely with alleged violations of the NONO, a topic around which much of the trial testimony centered. Moreover, whether Funky 544's activities complied with the preliminary injunction was an issue reserved to be tried by the district judge, not the jury. \"The trial court has great discretion in controlling the presentation of evidence, including the power to admit or refuse to admit rebuttal evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Beecher v.

Yokum contends that he was denied the opportunity to rebut comments characterizing the \"party atmosphere\" of the neighborhood, causing him prejudice. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Contrary to Yokum's assertion, the record reveals that Tung testified about the unique characteristics and historical significance of the Yokum house and the importance of historical preservation in the French Quarter. The district court did not permit Tung to testify \"as to the commercialization or quality of life or change of quality of life in the [French] Quarter as it relates to anyone else other than Mr. Yokum and Ms. Anderson.\" The district court found that claims of injury to the French Quarter itself or other residents were not relevant, because Yokum and Anderson were the only plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Yokum fails to explain with any jurisprudence, and we find none, demonstrating that the district court abused its discretion in limiting Tung's testimony. \"Whether evidence is relevant is within the discretion of the trial judge....\"\n   <em>\n    Pattison v.

Yokum sought to call Polcer to rebut testimony by D'Arensbourg that Funky 544 had received no noise complaints from neighbors other than Yokum and Anderson.
