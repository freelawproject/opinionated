Joseph Patton was convicted of murder following a jury trial in the Warren County Circuit Court. Patton appeals his conviction, claiming his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair by the trial court's refusal to strike for cause two prospective jurors from the jury venire who said during voir dire examination they knew the decedent's son. Finding no merit in Patton's claim, we affirm Patton's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In September 2015, Patton was living with his sixty-three-year-old uncle, Alfred Patton, in a mobile home in Warren County. On Tuesday, September 22, 2015, Alfred's next-door neighbor, William Thigpen, went to Alfred's trailer to check on him, having not seen Alfred in several days. Thigpen discovered Alfred's body inside the mobile home with an ax lodged in the throat. The body appeared to have been dead for several days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Thigpen last saw Alfred alive on Friday, September 18. The Thursday night before, he and Alfred had watched a televised football game together at Alfred's trailer, and Patton also was present. Thigpen said Alfred had expressed to him on several occasions that Alfred did not like the circumstances of Patton living there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Thigpen's live-in fianc\u00e9, Gabrielle Phillips, testified that Patton and Alfred had conflicts and that Alfred wanted Patton to move out. She recalled an argument Patton and Alfred had on Thursday, September 17, during which Alfred asked Patton to leave. Phillips said she heard Patton tell Alfred, \"You keep on and one of these days you're going to regret it.\" Phillips said she last saw Alfred alive on Friday, September 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Phillips saw Patton on Saturday, September 19, and Patton spoke to her before going inside Alfred's trailer. He did not stay there long. She saw Patton again on Monday, September 21, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m. They spoke to each other before Patton went inside Alfred's trailer. Phillips saw Patton come out of Alfred's trailer carrying a basket which Patton put in his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Warren County Sheriff's Investigator Chris Satcher described the ax which killed Alfred as a 26-inch Estwing brand camping ax. Investigators found a matching head cover for the ax in the trash outside Alfred's trailer. Investigators learned that a local Home Depot sells this brand of ax and obtained an in-store video from the store which showed Patton purchasing this type of ax on Wednesday, September 16, 2015. Investigators also obtained a receipt from the transaction, which showed a debit card was used to purchase the item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Meanwhile, at the scene of the homicide, investigators observed and photographed a Cobra beer bottle on the floor inside the trailer, along with a Seagram's gin bottle. Satcher said the gin appeared to contain a cloudy foreign substance, which experts later determined was diphenhydramine, an active ingredient in Benadryl and other over-the-counter sleep aids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Satcher also inspected and gathered a pair of athletic shorts from one of the trailer's bedrooms. Inside the shorts, Satcher found a folded envelope containing a grainy white powder similar to a crushed\n   pill, which experts determined contained diphenhydramine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Also found in the shorts was a debit card; a Nationwide life insurance proposal for a sixty-three-year-old male with a $25,000 death benefit; a document addressed to Patton referencing the last four digits of Patton's social security number; and a receipt from a convenience store in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The receipt was for gasoline and one King Cobra 32-ounce beer, and was dated September 18, 2015. The transaction was made with the debit card found in the shorts, which matched the debit card number used to purchase the ax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. On the front deck of Alfred's home, Satcher recovered a few folded towels, garbage bags, and a gallon container of household bleach. From these items, Satcher recovered a receipt from a Family Dollar store dated September 18, 2015, with a time stamp of 3:36 p.m. Investigators also obtained a video from the Family Dollar store showing Patton purchasing the bleach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. When Patton developed as a person of interest on September 22, a BOLO (\"be on the lookout\") was issued. That same day, Vicksburg police spotted Patton's vehicle parked on Washington Street. As authorities approached the vehicle, Patton appeared, and he was arrested. Patton initially gave authorities Alfred's address as his residence, but in a subsequent interview, Patton claimed his address was 3133 Washington Street, the location where authorities found Patton's vehicle parked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. After obtaining a search warrant for Patton's vehicle, authorities found a small spiral notebook inside the vehicle. Written inside the notebook was a \"to-do list\" which included a list of items: \"Clorox, garbage bags, Benadryl, blankets, and towels.\" Also found in Patton's vehicle was a term life-insurance policy death-benefit quote from Nationwide Insurance for a sixty-three-year-old male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Investigators thereafter contacted several insurance companies and subpoenaed information about a term life policy issued by MetLife in the amount of $20,000 on the life of Alfred Patton. The policy was issued September 16, 2015, to Joseph Patton as the beneficiary. The subpoena production included MetLife's recorded telephone conversations with the party who had purchased the policy and showed the initial premium was paid with the same debit card found in the shorts recovered from Alfred's home. Also produced were records sent to an email address, purportedly Patton's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. When Patton was arrested on September 22, authorities seized a cell phone in his possession. Investigators obtained a search warrant for the phone's records and data. Investigators found a text message dated September 16 from MetLife thanking the recipient for signing up for texts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. At trial, Patton testified he moved in with Alfred after moving back from Texas, and that he paid Alfred $75 a week in rent. He said he did not have a bedroom in Alfred's trailer and slept on the couch. Patton said he got along with Alfred. But when Alfred drank, Alfred wanted to be left alone and would ask Patton to leave, which is what occurred on Thursday, September 17. Patton said there was no argument and he complied with Alfred's request, leaving before the end of the football game they were watching to go stay with a friend in Vicksburg. Patton denied ever going back to Alfred's house after Thursday night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. Patton denied killing Alfred. He said the athletic shorts belonged to Alfred and were found in one of the rooms in which Alfred slept. Patton said he did not know whose debit card was found in the\n   shorts, but he had a debit card and Alfred had another. Patton said he and Alfred shared a third debit card, which according to Patton was the card used to buy the ax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. Patton said his papers were in Alfred's shorts because Alfred always got the mail. And regarding the powder found in the shorts and the substance in the gin, Patton said Alfred often took something to help him sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18. Patton admitted buying the bleach, which he used for cleaning the home and doing the laundry. Patton also admitted to buying the ax because Alfred had asked him to chop down a tree in the yard to cover a week's rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19. Patton claimed the notebook found in his vehicle belonged to Alfred, who frequently used Patton's vehicle. Patton said he did not know whose handwriting was in the notebook, but it was not his (Patton's).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20. Patton also said that he never applied for any life insurance, and he did not know whose voice was on the phone recordings obtained from MetLife, but it was not his. Patton also told the jury that he often let Alfred use his email address, which he and Alfred shared. Patton admitted the cell phone found in his possession was his, but Alfred used the phone also because he did not have a home phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21. Patton was found guilty of murder. He appeals his murder conviction, claiming one assignment of error: his trial was rendered unfair by the trial court's denial of a request to strike for cause two prospective jurors who each said they knew Alfred's son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22. Additional facts will be related as necessary in our discussion of Patton's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether Patton's trial was rendered unfair by trial court's refusal to strike for cause two prospective jurors who said during voir dire examination they knew the decedent's son.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23. The record shows that, during voir dire, when asked by defense counsel whether anyone knew certain members of the Patton family, potential jurors Cedric Wyatt, juror number 153, and a Mr. Carter, juror number 139, both advised they knew the decedent's son, Alfred Jr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24. Wyatt said he used to work with Alfred Jr., and Wyatt's brother was friends with Alfred Jr. Defense counsel asked Wyatt, \"Would you have a problem-would it cause you some problem to sit here?\" Wyatt answered, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25. Carter said, \"Yeah, I worked with Alfred [Jr].\" Defense counsel commented, \"Well, you're going to have to face him at work again, correct, when you go back to work?\" Carter indicated affirmatively. Defense counsel then asked, \"Would it cause you some problems, how you voted in this case, if you saw him again?\" Carter replied, \"You'd have to ask him that.\" Defense counsel said, \"No. I mean cause you problems.\" Carter replied, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26. After voir dire examination, defense counsel requested that Wyatt and Carter be removed for cause. The trial court denied both requests. Carter thereafter was struck with the defense's last peremptory challenge, and Wyatt ended up on the jury after the defense had exhausted its peremptory challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 27. We point out that the record shows there was some confusion on Patton's part during jury selection. According to the record, Patton participated in the selection process with his attorney assisting. After the State tendered twelve jurors, Patton struck the first eight chosen by the State, at which point Patton's attorney said, \"You don't get but 12.\" Patton indicated that he\n   did not understand. The trial court then explained to Patton how the process worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 28. Afterward, Patton elected to accept the last juror he had previously struck with his eighth peremptory challenge, and the trial court allowed Patton to do so. The selection process continued, and Patton used his last peremptory challenge to strike Carter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 29. Patton contends on appeal that there was an implied prejudice in this instance which the trial court should have recognized and acted upon, striking both potential jurors for cause. Citing\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505628\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/848/\">\n    595 So.2d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1992), and other cases, Patton submits this Court has indicated that not only is implied prejudice present in cases where a close relationship between jurors and parties or witnesses, but there is a presumption of impaired impartiality also is present in such instances. Patton thus contends it was error for the trial court to refuse the challenges for cause as to Wyatt and Carter because of the presumption of prejudice and other factors. Accordingly, Patton requests a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 30. We disagree. \"[U]nder Mississippi law, any person not disqualified under Mississippi Code Annotated Section 13-5-1, who will make oath that he or she is impartial, is competent to sit as a juror in a criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    Archer v.

The trial court in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   declined to excuse any of the five potential jurors for cause, and the defendant used five of his allotted twelve peremptory challenges to strike them.

I would find that the trial court abused its discretion by\n   denying Patton's request to strike prospective jurors Wyatt and Carter for cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patton was on trial for the brutal ax murder of his uncle, and it is manifest from the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examination, in which numerous venire members expressed knowledge of the facts of the case or had some connection to persons involved, that the crime was notorious and news of it had spread throughout the county. Carter, on whom the defense exercised a peremptory strike, said that he had worked with the murder victim's son and would have to face him when he returned to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wyatt, who was selected for the jury because the defense had exhausted its peremptory strikes, said that he previously had worked with the victim's son, and also that his brother and the son were friends. While both Carter and Wyatt said that they would have no problem serving, neither expressly said that he could be fair and impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 49. The defendant's right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. VI ; Miss. Const. Art. 3, \u00a7 26. The circuit court has considerable discretion in determining whether to strike a juror for cause.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Nonetheless, \"[t]he circuit judge has an absolute duty ... to see that the jury selected to try any case is fair, impartial and competent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505628\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/848/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505628\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/848/\">\n    at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I would find that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to excuse Wyatt and Carter for cause. Both of these potential jurors communicated that they worked or had worked with the victim's son, and Wyatt also said that his brother and the son were friends. Thus, it was reasonable for the defense to challenge them for cause on the basis of their relationships with the victim's son. Because it is readily conceivable that coworkers would afford each other some degree of loyalty, a potential for bias against Patton certainly existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding Wyatt, that\n   potential was compounded by the fact that his brother was a friend of the victim's son. This Court has recognized that, when a reasonable challenge is made and other jurors against whom no challenge is made are available, the trial court's discretion to deny the challenge is \"considerably narrowed.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505628\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/848/\">\n    595 So.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, neither of the potential jurors expressly said that he could be fair and impartial; rather, each merely said that serving would not be a problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billiot v.

Because the defense's for-cause challenges were manifestly reasonable, other potential jurors against whom no challenge had been made were available, and the challenged jurors never said they could be fair and impartial, I would find that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his for-cause challenges to them. And because Wyatt served on the jury, I would reverse and remand for a new trial. The risk of this juror's being less than impartial in this particular case, either consciously or subconsciously, was obvious, and it easily could have been avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   WALLER, C.J., AND KING, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    One cannot complain on appeal of the failure to excuse a juror for cause unless the appellant exhausted all his peremptory challenges.\n    <em>\n     Billiot v.
