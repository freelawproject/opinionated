LOVE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This application for supervisory review arises from petitions filed by cab drivers against Uber drivers alleging violations of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act. Following supplementation of the original petition, the Uber drivers filed an exception of no cause of action, which the trial court denied. The Uber drivers sought our supervisory review. This Court denied the writ, and the Uber drivers sought review from the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Supreme Court remanded the matter for full briefing, oral argument, and opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court considered the matter\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and finds that the trial court did not err by denying the Uber drivers' exception of no cause of action because the cab drivers set forth a cause of action. Thus, the application for supervisory review is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A group of cab drivers (\"Cabbies\") filed a Petition Based Upon Unfair Trade Practices, Request for Class Certification and\n   Request for Injunctive Relief against a group of Uber drivers (\"Ubers\") alleging that they were operating in violation of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"LUTPA\"). The Cabbies contended that the Ubers' violations of the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Safety Law, the Louisiana Driver's License Law, and other municipal ordinances constituted unfair trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Ubers filed Exceptions of No Cause of Action and No Right of Action. The trial court granted the Exception of No Cause of Action as to the Cabbies' LUTPA claims, but denied the Exception of No Right of Action regarding the alleged violations of the Louisiana Driver's License Law.

The Cabbies contended that the Ubers: (1) accepted passengers for cash without the Uber app; (2) staged and used cab stands; (3) accepted fares to and from the airport without authorization; (4) failed to notify Uber (the Transportation Network Company \"TNC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its insurer of accidents; (5) transported passengers without a chauffeur's license; and (6) prohibited cabs from picking up and dropping off customers at the Voodoo Experience Music Festival. The Cabbies further asserted that the Ubers were engaging in illegally providing transportation services for hire, and that their non-compliance with state regulatory rules resulted in unfair competition pursuant to LUTPA. Moreover, the Cabbies averred that they \"suffered an ascertainable loss of money or movable property, corporeal or incorporeal, as a result of the use or employment by Defendants of an unfair and unlawful trade practice in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute \u00a7 51:1405.\" They asserted that they suffered \"harm, injuries, and damages, including loss of income, relevant market share, business reputation, goodwill, and attorneys' fees and costs.\" The Cabbies also alleged the following class of defendants, for purposes of class action: \"All UberX drivers operating in New Orleans during the time of April 16, 2015 through the present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, the Ubers filed an Exception of No Cause of Action regarding the Second Amending, Supplemental and Restated Petition.

As this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Rasier\n   </em>\n   , 16-0930, pp. 2-3, 222 So.3d at 810-11 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2015, the City passed a series of laws permitting TNCs to operate within the parish. A TNC is an organization \"that connects passengers with drivers using their personal vehicle for purposes of for-hire transportation services by means of a TNC digital network.\" City Code Section 162-1700. TNC services comprise \"the transportation of a passenger between points chosen by the passenger and is prearranged by a TNC using a TNC digital network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A TNC digital network is \"any online-enabled application, software, website, or system offered or utilized by a TNC that enables the prearrangement of rides with TNC drivers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A TNC driver is \"a person who uses his or her personal vehicle to provide for-hire transportation services for passengers matched through a TNC digital network. A TNC driver need not be an employee of a TNC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A TNC vehicle is a motor vehicle used to provide TNC services through a TNC network that is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) Owned or leased by the TNC driver, or otherwise authorized for use by the TNC driver to provide TNC services, and is not wholly owned or leased by a TNC;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) Not licensed as a taxicab, limousine, horse-drawn carriage, pedicab, general charter tour vehicle, sightseeing tour vehicle, courtesy vehicle, non-emergency medical vehicle, airport shuttle, or any other classification of for-hire vehicle as provided under Article\n   III of this chapter or licensed by any other political subdivision or the Louisiana Public Service Commission;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Therefore, TNCs, like Rasier/Uber, are transportation companies that have developed proprietary software that enables smartphone users to hail rides via the internet from a member of the TNC's fleet of contractor drivers. The TNCs market their services under the company's trade name, process payments from riders, and provide confirmation receipts once a ride is complete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The City's ordinances also reveal that the City does not regulate TNCs like taxicab companies. That is, unlike its licensure of taxicabs, the City's ordinances permit TNCs to self-regulate and to ensure that its drivers satisfy the City's permitting standards. For example, a TNC driver does not obtain his Certificate of Public Necessity and Convenience/CPNC or driver's permit through the City. Rather, he obtains licensure by virtue of his contractual affiliation with the TNC, which serves as the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   regulatory authority for its drivers. Further, the TNC is tasked with performing criminal background checks and drug testing on its drivers. Moreover, each TNC is required to maintain a registry of all employed or contracted TNC drivers and to provide an updated list of drivers to the City each month. The TNC registry shall include each TNC driver's: 1) full name; 2) date of birth; 3) Louisiana driver's license number; 4) license plate number of the vehicle used by the driver to provide TNC services; and, 5) active dates of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   City Code Section 162-1709. TNC drivers, unlike taxicab drivers, do not hold city-issued occupational licenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, we turn to the Cabbies Second Amending, Supplemental and Restated Petition, which provides that the Ubers are violating regulatory statutes in order to siphon the Cabbies' market share, causing income losses and other damages to the Cabbies. The petition also contains alleged examples of the Ubers accepting street hails, staging, using cab stands, and circumventing post-accident drug test requirements. The examples include the dates and the defendants' names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, the Ubers contend that the Cabbies have not alleged an ascertainable loss because the petitions do not contain a specific quantified amount of alleged loss. The Ubers also contend that the Cabbies \"failed to meet their burden of establishing causation.\" The Ubers' assertions correspond with a more merit-based examination like that considered on a motion for summary judgment. However, at this early procedural stage, we are unaware of the actual evidence assembled by the Cabbies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, abiding by our limited scope on an exception of no cause of action, we find that the Cabbies' petition states a cause of action. Firstly, the Cabbies are persons pursuant to La. R.S. 51:1409(A). Secondly, the Cabbies alleged an ascertainable loss (loss of income, relevant market share, business reputation, goodwill, and attorneys' fees and costs), specific amounts to be determined during discovery/trial. Thirdly, the Cabbies contend that the Ubers' alleged practice of working outside the regulations applicable to TNCs results in unfair trade practices, i.e. the Ubers now are performing work reserved to the Cabbies. If Ubers are illegally functioning as Cabbies, they could be subject to the same set of regulations applicable to the Cabbies. Unfair trade practices offend \"established public policy ... when the practice is unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , 97-2436, p. 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11811552\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/713/785/#p792\">\n    713 So.2d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accepting all of the Cabbies' well-pleaded factual allegations as true as a whole and resolving all doubt in their favor, we find that under the facts and circumstances of this case, the Cabbies have stated a cause of action pursuant to LUTPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court did not err by denying the Ubers' Exception of No Cause of Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, we find that the Cabbies have stated a cause of action and uphold the judgment of the trial court.

I disagree with the dissent opinion that the Uber drivers' alleged violation of local ordinances \"cannot support an unfair competition claim\" and that the ordinances relied upon to support the plaintiffs' \"claims under LUTPA do not provide\n   for causes of actions by private persons.\" The allegations that these city ordinances were violated would, by definition, constitute an unfair or deceptive practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiffs are not required to prove their case to survive a peremptory exception of no cause of action. For these reasons, I concur in the result of the majority upholding the trial court's denial of the exception of no cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   LEDET, J., DISSENTS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This is a multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant suit. In their petition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiffs-twenty-six individual taxi cab drivers (the \"Cabbies\")-assert a single cause of action against the defendants-thirty-one independent transportation providers who use the Uber app (the \"Ubers\"). The single cause of action is an alleged violation of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act (the \"LUTPA\"). The sole issue before us is whether the Cabbies' petition states a LUTPA cause of action. Contrary to the majority, I would find that the Cabbies fail to state a LUTPA cause of action. In so finding, I rely on the following three factors: (i) lack of class action; (ii) lack of causation; and (iii) lack of conspiracy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Lack of Class Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Key to the trial court's reasoning in overruling the Ubers' exception of no cause action is the assertion in the Cabbies' petition of a defendant class. The Cabbies' petition not only names multiple individual defendants, but also seeks to certify a defendant class, defined as \"[a]ll UberX drivers operating in New Orleans during the time of April 16, 2015 through the present.\" Relying on the defendant-class action assertion, the trial court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The reason I think it's a close call is because what they're attempting to do is assert a Class, assert claims broad enough in order to create a class action. I understand what's going on. They're not attempting to do specific, this plaintiff, this defendant so much as to assert, to assert actions broad enough so as to create a group of people who potentially would qualify as a class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The trial court's reliance on the potential creation (certification) of a defendant-class is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The express language of the LUTPA belies any legislative intent to authorize a private party to bring either a plaintiff or a defendant class action. The pertinent statutory provision, La. R.S. 51:1409(A), states as follow:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or movable property, corporeal or incorporeal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act, or practice declared unlawful by R.S. 51:1405, may bring an action individually but not in a representative capacity to recover actual damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As one court noted, \"[t]his provision of LUTPA is entitled, 'Private Actions.' This language in La. R.S. 51:1409(A) refers to 'the clear ban against class actions by private persons' under the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Indest-Guidry, Ltd. v.

I thus agree with the majority that the \"Cabbies are persons pursuant to La. R.S. 51:1409(A)\" and that the Cabbies have the right to bring an individual LUTPA claim.
