For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's March 15, 2017 judgment and reinstate the jury's verdict, together with the judgment of December 6, 2016, rendered in accordance with the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   J.C. Myles and Willie L. Myles (\"plaintiffs\") filed a petition against Hospital Service District No. 1 of Tangipahoa Parish, d/b/a North Oaks Health System (\"North Oaks\") asserting a survival action\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of their deceased mother Mattie Parker Myles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs alleged that the North Oaks nurses (particularly, Marsha Zettler, RN) breached the standard of care in the treatment of their mother, which \"negatively impacted Ms. Myles' outcome and resulted in Ms. Myles' respiratory distress and her ultimate demise.\" According to the plaintiffs' petition, Ms. Myles aspirated on a Plavix pill administered by Nurse Zettler, causing her condition to rapidly deteriorate as she developed, among other things, acute respiratory failure and pneumonia, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy. The plaintiffs further maintained that because North Oaks failed to properly manage, control, and supervise the nurses who were acting in the course and scope of their employment with North Oaks, the negligent acts of the nurses were imputed to North Oaks. After extensive discovery, the case was tried to a jury on November 15-18, 2016. On November 18, 2016, the jury answered \"No\" to the following jury interrogatory: \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that North Oaks\n   or its nurses breached the standard of care in the treatment of Mattie Myles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The jury was polled, confirming a unanimous verdict, and the verdict was made the judgment of the trial court in a written judgment signed by the trial court on December 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a motion for a JNOV and a motion for a new trial. Following a hearing on January 30, 2017, the trial court granted the motion for JNOV and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $534,338.78, plus judicial interest until paid, and all court costs. The trial court also conditionally granted the motion for new trial in favor of the plaintiffs. The trial court signed a judgment in accordance with these findings on March 15, 2017. North Oaks subsequently filed a motion for new trial, which was denied by the trial court in a judgment signed July 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because the trial court granted the JNOV and awarded damages above the statutory cap of $100,000.00 for qualified health care providers as provided in La. R.S. 40:1299.42(B)(2), the Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund, Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund Oversight Board (collectively, the \"Board\") became involved in the appeal as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   North Oaks and the Board filed suspensive appeals of the judgment, assigning error to the trial court's grant of the JNOV, its conditional grant of a new trial, and its damage award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the applicable standard of care, a violation of that standard of care, and a causal connection between the violation of the standard of care and the claimed injuries.\n   <strong>\n    Pfiffner v.

The motion should be denied if there is evidence opposed to the motion which is of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions. In making this determination, the trial court should not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, and all reasonable inferences or factual questions should be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.

Ta's orders and by failing to conduct a dysphagia screen on Ms. Myles before administering anything to Ms. Myles by, mouth. The plaintiffs also argued that Nurse Zettler violated North Oaks' protocols by failing to functionally evaluate Ms. Myles as required by the Adult Admission Summary and by not following the Aspiration Precautions protocol, both of which, upon completion, would have required Nurse Zettler to complete a dysphagia screen on Ms. Myles before administering anything to her by mouth. North Oaks and the Board allege that given the considerable disagreement among the medical experts, a reasonable person could conclude that the plaintiffs had not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that North Oaks or its nurses breached the standard of care in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Among the exhibits presented as evidence to the jury was a copy of the oaths and findings of the medical review panel who considered this case before the matter proceeded to trial. The three physicians on the panel opined that there was no deviation in the standards of care regarding the treatment provided by Dr. Gayden Robert and Dr. Ta, specifically noting that Dr. Ta's orders for \"NPO until nurse assess for swallow,\" was appropriate. With regard to North Oaks, the panel concluded that there was a material issue of fact bearing on liability for consideration by the court, noting that there was \"not enough information as to what was communicated as to the findings of the nursing dysphagia screen performed in the Emergency Department.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to the record, Ms. Myles was brought into the North Oaks emergency room (\"ER\") by her granddaughter on December 19, 2012, with right sided weakness. It was noted by North Oaks' staff that Ms. Myles was a poor historian and they were unable to get an accurate medical history at that time. Dr. Robert began a CVA (cerebrovascular accident/stroke ) workup and ordered aspirin to be given. A head CT scan performed in the ER was negative for any bleeding, but Ms. Myles continued with residual weakness on the right side with some facial drooping. One of the ER triage nurses, Chanda Fisher, testified about her interaction with Ms. Myles. Nurse Fisher described Ms. Myles as very thin and frail, weighing about eighty pounds. She noted, however, that Ms. Myles was smiling and talking with the nurses, was oriented \"to self and place,\" and was able to follow commands. Nurse Fisher had an order to give Ms. Myles an aspirin, which, based on Ms. Myles' condition, Nurse Fisher expected she would be able to swallow. Nurse Fisher noted that although Ms. Myles had some difficulty swallowing the aspirin and coughed a little, she did, in fact, swallow the aspirin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At some point thereafter, Dr. Robert verbally ordered the ER nurses to complete a dysphagia screen. Nurse Tiffany Pizzitola, another member of the ER triage team who cared for Ms. Myles, testified at length about her involvement in this case. Nurse Pizzitola explained that a dysphagia screen is \"basically a swallow study,\" and described it as a step-by-step list of questions that nurses go through to determine, among other things, if a patient is able to swallow, cough, and maintain\n   head control. Nurse Pizzitola completed the dysphagia screen on Ms. Myles at 10:15 a.m., and based on Nurse Pizzitola's observations, she believed a speech therapy consult was in order. Nurse Pizzitola acknowledged that although she was familiar with the dysphagia screen, she had only worked in the ER and was not familiar with how things were done by the floor nurses. When asked about Dr. Ta's orders for the floor nurses, i.e., \"NPO until nurse assess for swallow\", the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A I mean, if I had to-I can't speculate what his assumptions were on the floor, or what he might have verbally told them on the floor to do.

I mean, I only know what I do in the ER.

Ms. Myles was \"oriented to herself and possibly time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With regard to Nurse Zettler's December 19, 2012 notes and the doctors' orders concerning the care of Ms. Myles, the following exchange occurred between Nurse Zettier and counsel for the plaintiffs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q When you write patient is NPO until speech therapy evaluation, where are you getting that information from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A Doctor's orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q Which doctor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A Dr. Ta.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q You're writing Dr. Ta's order.

He doesn't actually say with a pill. What I decided at that point was that we were treating her for CVA. Dr. [Mussarat] had seen her earlier. He wanted her to have a Plavix and that's really important for her to have If we're treating her for a stroke. It's acceptable to use what I used to assess her swallow at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q Did you think there was some emergency need at 7:00 to give her the Plavix pill?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A I did feel that way.

I used the medicine to see if she could swallow with the applesauce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q You did it at the same time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q You did not assess the swallowing first?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A I am not going to-yes; I did assess the swallow at the same time with that pill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Q Before giving Mattie Myles medicine. Before giving her medicine, did you assess swallow?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A No. I mean, if you put it like that, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Q Are you allowed to use nursing judgment to decide that she needs her Plavix even though her doctors had not thought she needed on an emergency basis for nine hours. Are you allowed to use nursing judgment to say, oh, I think she needs it now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   A I used my nursing judgment in this call. Am I allowed to do that? Yes; I think I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After admitting that in her prior deposition testimony she indicated that she should have called and clarified Dr. Ta's orders with him, Nurse Zettler was questioned further about Dr. Ta's orders and whether she found the orders confusing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q You felt like you did exactly what Dr. Ta asked, or you're not sure what-if you did what Dr. Ta asked? Or, do you feel like Dr. Ta's order is unclear and you don't know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A I felt like his order was to allow me to assess Ms. Myles for her swallow. And at the time when I got her in the afternoon-late afternoon and she had come from the emergency room, given that she had possibly had a stroke, I assessed her, and I used the Plavix pill. I crushed the Plavix pill, put it in the applesauce in one little teaspoon and gave it to her and she did not pass.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   And, on cross examination, Nurse Zettler added that she did not find Dr. Ta's orders confusing in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Nurse Zettler explained that she used a small plastic spoon for the swallow assessment. She crushed the small Plavix pill, which Nurse Zettler described as being round and \"a little smaller than an aspirin,\" into the applesauce and administered the swallow assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurse Zettler testified that this was consistent with her nursing training and over twenty years of nursing experience. Ms. Myles immediately began choking on the applesauce and pill mixture as she \"choked up the applesauce,\" but Nurse Zettler was uncertain whether she aspirated at that point. Nurse Zettler successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver on Ms. Myles, but her condition deteriorated immediately. Ms. Myles was suctioned and placed on a venting mask. It was not until later that evening when Ms. Myles was hooked up to a ventilator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   With regard to the Adult Admission Summary she completed when Ms. Myles was admitted to the floor, Nurse Zettler acknowledged that she noted Ms. Myles was confused and had swallowing problems and weakness. Nurse Zettler further admitted that she failed to complete the \"Functional Screening\" section, which would have required a dysphagia screen with a score of 2 or 3 on swallowing status. Nurse Zettler testified that she was familiar with the Aspiration Precautions protocol employed by North Oaks and that if a patient exhibits any of the listed sign/symptoms or risks of aspirations, the nurse is to initiate the dysphagia screen. Nurse Zettler went on, however, to explain her assessment of Ms. Myles upon her arrival to the surgical ICU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   According to Nurse Zettler, Ms. Myles was very thin and frail and appeared to be malnourished. Nurse Zettler indicated that Ms. Myles' speech was a little slurred and she was wispy, but that she was able to communicate and respond appropriately. Ms. Myles was also able to manage her saliva and secretions and was not drooling. Based on her assessment of Ms. Myles and Ms. Myles' alertness and her ability to respond to commands, Nurse Zettler believed that Ms. Myles would be able to swallow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Nurse Zettler was asked specifically about the dysphagia screen and whether it was a tool that was utilized by the nurses on the floor, to which she responded that it was used in the ER. When pressed about why she failed to follow the steps of the dysphagia screen before giving Ms. Myles anything by mouth, Nurse Zettler explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   I-I had to assess her. I did. Because of the doctor's orders. And I felt I was following these doctor's orders and then I assessed her to see if she could swallow something. She was-I wasn't going to put an NG tube down her if I didn't have to. I think that she was going to pass this test. Hours later after she came into the emergency room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Nurse Zettler added that she was never disciplined or reprimanded for her treatment and care of Ms. Myles on December 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The plaintiffs also presented the testimony of Deborah St. Germain, a registered nurse and assistant professor of nursing who was accepted as an expert in the field of nursing. In Nurse St. Germain's opinion, a nurse should follow a doctor's orders as long as it does not put the patient at risk. She stated that if a doctor's orders say \"NPO\" and a nurse gives the patient something by mouth, this would be a breach of the standard of care. When asked about the use of applesauce to do a dysphagia screen, Nurse St. Germain indicated that applesauce could be used as long as it was used at the appropriate time. She had no opinion on whether the crushed-up pill in the applesauce had any bearing on the outcome in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Nurse St. Germain agreed that because Ms. Myles was already NPO when Dr. Ta wrote his orders, there was really no need for another dysphagia screen. However, another screen would have provided Dr. Ta with information about whether Ms. Myles was still at risk for aspiration and whether they could feed, hydrate, or medicate her by mouth. Nurse St. Germain agreed that there are ways to assess for swallow other than the dysphagia screen and that everyone who testified in this case would likely have differing opinions as to whether it was acceptable and reasonable to proceed the way Nurse Zettler did. She further acknowledged that based on a nurse's training and experience, the way in which the nurse proceeds for a swallow assessment would be a matter of professional judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Another witness called by the plaintiffs was Dr. Donald S. Gervais, Jr., a neurologist accepted as an expert in neurology with a subspecialty in neurological diseases. Based on his review of Ms. Myles' prior medical records, Dr. Gervais described Ms. Myles as very sick and malnourished, noting that she was dependent upon others for all of her nutritional and functional needs even before she was admitted to North Oaks. Ms. Myles had an abdominal hernia, a history of CORD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (\"the condition that led to her needing to be in the hospital in the first place\"). Dr. Gervais explained that Guillain-Barre was an acute autoimmune inflammatory neuritis that causes muscles weakness that progresses throughout the entire body. Ms. Myles also had a Zenker's diverticulum, which Dr. Gervais described as a \"gastroenterologic obstructure\" that is typically a congenital issue. Dr. Gervais explained, \"It's a-like a protrusion of the esophagus that goes into-up into the esophageal area which can cause gastric contents to come up into the esophagus.\" And while Dr. Gervais believed it was the choking incident and not any of these underlying conditions that led to Ms. Myles developing aspiration pneumonia, he testified that there were\n   \"probably complicating factors which probably led to her weakness as well, which made it even more likely to have an aspiration pneumonia.\" Dr. Gervais added, \"her premorbid condition, her other medical problems predisposed and really ticked her over into a fatal outcome unfortunately for her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Dr. Gervais testified that it was appropriate for Dr. Ta to rely on the nurses to do a swallow assessment. He agreed that because Ms. Myles was already NPO when Dr. Ta wrote his orders, any subsequent use of the dysphagia screen form to let him know that she needed to be NPO would have been a meaningless act. Dr. Gervais acknowledged that applesauce was an appropriate medium to assess for swallowing, but added that he questioned whether Nurse Zettler should have even proceeded to do the assessment. Dr. Gervais opined that Ms. Myles would have had a better chance of getting off the ventilator had she not had pneumonia. And he agreed that Ms. Myles' choking on the Plavix pill was a substantial contributing factor to the aspiration pneumonia and to the further debilitating of her condition, which ultimately led to her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Dr. Ta's expert testimony was presented to the jury by video deposition. Dr. Ta, who is board certified in internal medicine, was an internal medicine hospitalist at North Oaks when Ms. Myles was admitted to North Oaks on December 19, 2012. Dr. Ta was called to assess Ms. Myles in the ER and determine if she needed to be admitted. The suspicion at the time was that Ms. Myles had a stroke, but they did not have any tests to confirm this diagnosis at the time. In the days after Ms. Myles was admitted to North Oaks, the neurologist who was following her case began to suspect that Ms. Myles, in fact, had Guillain-Barre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Dr. Ta stated that Ms. Myles was a poor historian and was having difficulty remembering things. In fact, neither Ms. Myles nor anyone in her family ever disclosed that Ms. Myles had a Zenker's diverticulum before it was discovered on imaging. Ms. Myles was able to respond to Dr. Ta's questioning and speak such that he could understand her clearly. The decision was made to admit Ms. Myles and \"administer aspirinPlavix which is an antiplatelet.\" When asked about his orders, Dr. Ta testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q Did you write orders along those lines?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A I did....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A These are my orders.... [A]dmit the patient to internal medicine, inpatient. Diagnosis: [CVA]. Diet: NPO until nurse assess for swallow. If passed, soft, low sodium diet. And if she passed, she can take PO meds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A And at the bottom: If patient cannot take PO, please put an NG tube for meds. Continue Plavix and other orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Q ... When did you write these orders?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A 3:30 p.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   When he wrote his orders, Dr. Ta was aware that Ms. Myles had already had a dysphagia screen done in the ER. Dr. Ta indicated that he wanted the floor nurses to do an independent assessment for swallow, noting that a patient's neurological picture may change over time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   So after five or so hours of her being in the ER waiting for me to come down, and after being assessed by neurology and ER staff and on physical examination she was able to communicate with me; I didn't see any slurring; I didn't see any-so it needed to be assessed again because people, after-over time, I've had people who continue to have\n   dysphagia and some people who actually pass the swallow test and are able to eat and take medications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   With regard to his expectations of the floor nurse concerning his orders, Dr. Ta testified that he \"didn't intend anything.\" He added, \"I just wrote down my instructions, and that's how-however the hospital is supposed to do things, the nurse is supposed to do things, that's how ... I didn't intend anything.\" Dr. Ta was adamant that he was not familiar with what the nurses do or what methods they would employ for a swallow assessment. And he had no opinion on whether applesauce is an appropriate medium for a swallow assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dr. Katherine St. Amant, board certified in internal medicine and pulmonary diseases, was the first expert witness called to testify on behalf of the defendants. She was first consulted on December 20, 2012, because Ms. Myles was having difficulty with her breathing. Ms. Myles was already intubated at that time, and, by the next day, was on the ventilator and comfortable with acceptable oxygen levels. Dr. St. Amant testified regarding her review of Ms. Myles' CT scan from three weeks prior that revealed a \"debris-filled cavity\" area. While acknowledging that at the time she was unaware of the term \"Zenker's,\" she knew that this was an abnormal finding and an aspiration concern.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Q Does the debris-filled cavity that was later called a Zenker's diverticulum, does that represent a setup for aspiration into the lungs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A As I said, I'm not an expert on Zenker's diverticulum, but as a pulmonologist, if there is a pouch very close to the throat that has debris and food and left over material that was swallowed, but did not go down into the stomach, but stayed in this pouch there, then I would have concerns that there is a potential there for possible regurgitation and then aspiration as the potential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Later, when asked if this \"pouch with retained content\" made Ms. Myles more prone to have repeated aspiration events, Dr. St. Amant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Yes. I think in my opinion that this would be-would make someone predisposed to potential for aspiration of whatever was in the pouch coming out and going into the throat and then possibly coming back into the lungs from that area. So, I would assume that it would give them the potential for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Dr. St. Amant noted that as they began to work with Ms. Myles, it became more obvious that the problem was the Zenker's diverticulum. When asked about the failed attempt at placing a nasal gastric tube in Ms. Myles on December 23, 2012, Dr. St. Amant stated that she was not involved in that procedure but that in retrospect, it makes sense that there would have been difficulty trying to pass the tube from the nose down into the stomach because of the Zenker's diverticulum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Dr. St. Amant testified that Ms. Myles would have likely required intubation regardless of whether she choked on the applesauce because of her worsening Guillain-Barre, which was making her increasingly weak and compromising her respiratory muscles. And, according to the record, there were documented respiratory issues in Ms. Myles' medical chart dating back to the month prior to her admission to North\n   Oaks. In Dr. St. Amant's opinion, the aspiration pneumonia did not cause the level of weakness shown in Ms. Myles' respiratory muscles or the paralysis in Ms. Myles' hands and feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   According to Dr. St. Amant, by December 21, 2012, Dr. Mussarat started Ms. Myles on medication for Guillain-Barre and that \"became the working diagnosis rather than stroke.\" Dr. St. Amant was concerned about being able to keep Ms. Myles safe on the ventilator because of the weakness of Ms. Myles' respiratory muscles. Dr. St. Amant noted that \"as the days went on, the major reason that [Ms. Myles] was on that ventilator was her Guillain-Barre.\" By December 26, 2012, Dr. St. Amant was more focused on Ms. Myles' weakness from the Guillain-Barre, and the aspiration pneumonia was becoming less and less of an issue. In fact, by December 31, 2012, the aspiration pneumonia had resolved. Nonetheless, Ms. Myles was still very weak with Guillain-Barre and needed to be on a ventilator. By January 10, 2013, Ms. Myles was in no acute distress, was off the ventilator, and had undergone a tracheotomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Dr. St. Amant opined that the aspiration pneumonia had nothing to do with anything that happened with Ms. Myles' health after December 31, 2012. Moreover, she had no reason to believe that Ms. Myles' death resulted from anything related to the aspiration event and being put on a ventilator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Another expert who testified on behaif of the defense was Dr. Ross Carl Klingsberg, board certified in internal medicine, pulmonary diseases, and critical care medicine. Dr. Klingsberg stated that Ms. Myles had several chronic conditions prior to arriving at North Oaks on December 19, 2012. Ms. Myles had severe CORD, with a very limited ability to exhale. She was borderline with respect to needing supplemental oxygen. Dr. Klingsberg indicated that Ms. Myles' body mass index was \"far below well nourished,\" putting her at risk for decreased immune function and decreased strength. She also suffered from cachexia, or muscle wasting. Dr. Klingsberg noted on Ms. Myles' original chest x-ray that she had \"virtually no muscle mass there to drive a breathing response.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Dr. Klingsberg opined that it is reasonable to test a patient's swallowing to avoid putting in a nasal gastric tube, which is very uncomfortable. He found nothing wrong with Dr. Ta's orders concerning the bedside swallow assessment. Dr. Klingsberg added that it was appropriate to use applesauce to assess for swallow and that it was appropriate for Nurse Zettler to give Ms. Myles the Plavix as ordered by the doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   When asked why Ms. Myles was intubated, Dr. Klingsberg stated it was because she had hypercapnic respiratory failure. He explained that after the aspiration event, she was simply too weak to breathe. Dr. Klingsberg testified that the aspiration pneumonia occupied a small portion at the base of Ms. Myles' right lower lobe. He stated this was not the amount of lung involvement that would normally require ventilation support. Dr. Klingsberg noted that based on Ms. Myles' clinical course and presentation, \"one would predict her to have needed ventilatory support. It was just a matter of time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In ruling on the JNOV, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Okay. Let's say I was quite surprised by the jury's verdict. And immediately thought that the jury didn't follow the law as I gave it to them when I heard their verdict. And I find that the jury didn't follow the law as I gave it to them. I find that the plaintiff did prove the defendant's liability with the burden of proof more probable than not. The\n   verdict was clearly and contrary to the way the evidence, just from ... what I sat and listened to for several days and the law I read. And I have reviewed both memos and the law. And I did sit through the trial with the jury. But, under the evidence presented at the trial, I don't find reasonable minds could differ as to the liability finding the defendant liable to the action of the plaintiff. As the defense points out, the law and-the case law as well as ... Article 1811, and the case law surrounding it, great deference is given to the jury in this fact finding role. I've never done this before. I've never overturned, I never granted a JNOV because I always gave great deference to the jury. And in this case in the last several weeks and after receiving the motion for a judgment [notwithstanding] the verdict, I've thought back and I've reviewed notes and things. And again, I was quite surprised. I did feel like the plaintiff proved the defense liability and met the burden of proof. So, I wasn't sure and don't know what they went through. A very intelligent jury. I need to say that. They did take their time, they did review the evidence. I just don't find that they followed the law in the end. Whatever they did, and why they did it, they felt like it was just. And it may have been just. But I don't find that they followed the law as I gave it to them on the burden of proof and on what the plaintiff had to prove as far as liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   After reviewing the testimony of the medical experts in this case, we disagree with the trial court's finding that no reasonable juror could conclude that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof on liability. The jury heard conflicting expert testimony concerning whether Nurse Zettler's actions of conducting the bedside swallow assessment of Ms. Myles before completing a second dysphagia screen constituted a breach of the standard of care in this case. All of the experts agreed, however, that applesauce was an appropriate medium to be used to assess for swallow. Moreover, the experts acknowledged that Nurse Zettler faced a judgment call, which required Nurse Zettler to use her training, skill, education, and experience in implementing Dr. Ta's orders. Based on the disagreement among the medical experts in this case, and given that neither the trial court nor this court may substitute its evaluation of the evidence for that of the jury unless the jury's conclusions totally offend reasonable inferences from the evidence, a reasonable person could conclude that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of proof on liability by a preponderance of the evidence presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Pitts v.

Unlike the standard applicable to a JNOV, in considering whether to grant a new trial under La. C.C.P. art. 1972(1), a trial judge may evaluate the evidence without favoring either party, and draw its own inferences and conclusions. Most significantly, the district court has authority to evaluate witness credibility to determine whether the jury erred in giving too much credence to an unreliable witness. However,\n   <strong>\n    because a motion for new trial solely on the basis of being contrary to the evidence is directed squarely at the accuracy of the jury's factual determinations, the jury's verdict cannot be set aside on that ground if it is supportable by any fair interpretation of the evidence.\n   </strong>\n   [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    Pitts,\n   </strong>\n   2016-1232 at 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362502\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/58/#p65\">\n    218 So.3d at 65-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   With regard to the motion for new trial herein, the trial court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   Now since this [is] the first time I've ever done this, I know the rule is now that I'm conditionally denying a motion for a new trial according [to] the law. I need to conditionally deny that since I granted the JNOV.... So, again I'm conditionally denying the motion for new trial filed by the plaintiff. And I'm granting the JNOV filed by the plaintiff, but reserving a ruling on any-as to liability. And I'm going to reserve any ruling on damages until I can get memos from you.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Without articulating a specific reason for granting a new trial, the trial court conditionally granted the new trial in favor of the plaintiffs. In its reasons for judgment, the trial court found that the jury did not follow the law on the burden of proof as it\n   was given to them and that the verdict was contrary to the law and to the evidence presented. If that were the case, Article 1972 would mandate the granting of a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In the instant case, however, we have concluded that based on the considerable disagreement among the medical experts, a reasonable juror could find that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of proof on liability by a preponderance of the evidence presented at trial. The law is well settled that when a JNOV is reversed based on the appellate court's determination that the jury's verdict was reasonably supported by the evidence presented at trial, the alternative request for a new trial should also be denied or reversed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Trunk v.

In reversing the trial court's grant of a JNOV, we determined that the evidence in the record fully supported the jury's verdict that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that North Oaks and its nurses breached the standard of care in the treatment of Ms. Myles. Moreover, we concluded that given the conflicting opinions expressed by the medical experts, the jury's verdict was reasonable and supportable by a fair interpretation of the evidence. Therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to a new trial on the basis that the jury's verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Based on our review of the record evidence, we have found no other grounds-peremptory or discretionary-upon which a motion for new trial could have been granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.
