This court granted Overman leave to appeal in forma pauperis and directed the Clerk of the United States District Court to forward to this court the original files in the cause, and appointed an attorney to represent Over-man. Briefs were filed and oral arguments presented in behalf of Overman and the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-21\">On authority of Ragan v.
