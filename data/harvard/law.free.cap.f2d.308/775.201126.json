The next day he was returned to Court and made an oral motion for reduction of sentence on the ground that a government agent told him he would receive leniency, if he pleaded guilty. After a hearing, the Court denied relief. Klink was aware of his right to appeal, but did not do so within the 10 days prescribed by Rule 37(a) (2), F.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Later Klink filed a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. That motion was denied on January 29, 1962. An application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis was filed on April 30, 1962 and denied. We granted the necessary permission to appeal and the government has moved to dismiss, on the ground that this Court has no jurisdiction because the appeal was filed out of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">If the appeal is from the denial of the motion for reduction of sentence, the Criminal Rules apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, as no notice of appeal was filed within 10 days, we have no jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the appeal is from the denial of relief under \u00a7 2255, the Civil Rules apply<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we have no jurisdiction because no notice of appeal was filed within 60 days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-11\">.
