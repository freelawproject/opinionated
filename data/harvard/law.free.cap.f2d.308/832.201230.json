Between February and October 1939, Illana Company laid and constructed an 8 inch pipe line, 72.9 rods in length, across the Mehlberg property. The $50 mentioned in the contract was paid to Mrs. Mehlberg by the Illana Company at the time of the execution and delivery of the contract, and later she was paid an additional $.22.90 compensation, and also the sum of $25.94 for pipe line damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">On November 30, 1939, the Right of Way Contract and the 8 inch pipe line were assigned by Illana. Company to Phillips Petroleum Company, who later assigned its rights in the contract and pipe line to defendant, Phillips Pipe Line Co. On October 14,1941, plaintiffs became the owners in fee simple of the above-described lands, subject only to the \u201cRight of Way Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">During September 1951, Phillips Pipe Line Co., over the objection of plaintiffs, laid and constructed within eight feet of the first pipe line, a 10 inch pipe line 73.1 rods in length across the lands owned by plaintiffs. Phillips Pipe Line Co. made a tender of $73.10 as consideration for the additional pipe line, and also made an offer to plaintiffs in settlement of the construction damages, all of which plaintiffs refused to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">The \u201cRight of Way Contract\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-18\">\u201cFor and in Consideration of the sum of Fifty &amp; No/100 Dollars ($50.00) in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Elizabeth Mehlberg, a widow hereinafter referred to as Grantor (whether one or more), does hereby grant unto Illana Company, a Delaware corporation, hereinafter referred to as Grantee, its successors and assigns, the right to lay, maintain, inspect, alter, repair, operate, replace, remove and relay a pipe line, or pipe lines, for the transportation of oil and gas and products and by-products thereof, water and other substances, and such drips, valves, fittings, meters and other equipment and appurtenances as may be necessary or convenient for such operations under across the following described land in Montgomery County, State of Illinois, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-19\">\u201cThe West half of the Southeast Quarter of Section 22, Township 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>North, Range 5 West of the Third Principal Meridian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">\u201cTogether with the rights of ingress and egress to and from said line or lines, or any of them, for the purpose aforesaid, Grantor hereby releasing and waiving all rights under and by virtue of the homestead exemption laws of this State. Grantor to have the right to fully use and enjoy the above described premises, except as to the rights hereinbefore granted; and Grantee hereby agrees to pay any damages which may arise to crops, fences or buildings of said Grantor from the exercise of the rights herein granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">\u201cPipe line to be at least 40' from running water spring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">\u201cShould more than one pipe line be laid under this grant, at any time, an additional consideration, calculated on the same basis per lineal rod as the consideration hereinabove recited, shall be paid for each line so laid after the first line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">\u201cGrantee shall bury pipe lines below plow depth, in presently cultivated fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">\u201cTo Have and to Hold said easement, rights, and rights of way unto the said Grantee, its successors and assigns until said easement be exercised, and so long thereafter as the same shall be useful for the above named purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">\u201cIt is understood that the person securing this grant is without authority from Grantee to make any agreement in respect of the subject matter hereof not herein expressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">\u201cThis agreement is binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">\u201cExecuted this 23rd day of Jany. 1939.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The District Court pointed out that no consideration \u201cper lineal rod\u201d of pipe, and no standard by which such consideration is to be determined, is recited in any part of the instrument. The District Court stated: \u201c* * * [N]o case is found in which a court, under the guise of construction, has decreed the element of consideration where the instrument in question provided no standard for that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The District Court concluded that the Right of Way Contract is too indefinite and uncertain to authorize the claimed right to lay a second pipe line, and that Phillips acted at its peril when it entered plaintiffs\u2019 land for that purpose despite plaintiffs\u2019 protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Judgment for plaintiffs was entered for an injunction in accordance with the prayer of the complaint, but jurisdiction was retained to determine the amount of damages. Requisite findings were made under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) so that an immediate appeal might be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">We agree with the learned District Judge that the critical issue in this case is whether the language of the Right of Way Contract is sufficiently certain so that the intentions of the parties may be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">We hold the Right of Way Contract is too indefinite and uncertain to authorize the claimed right of defendant to lay a second pipe line some twelve years after the original pipe line was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">A pertinent case that is persuasive in its reasoning is Winslow v. City of Vallejo, 148 Cal. 723, 84 P. 191, 5 L.R.A., N.S., 851. There, the question was whether, after the installation of a single water main, the City of Vallejo, by virtue of a grant to it of a right of way for \u201cany water pipes or mains which may be laid by the city,\u201d had the right to lay an additional main. Holding that the city had no such right, the Court said at page 192 of 84 P.: \u201c* * * [W]e see nothing in the language of this grant, or in the conditions existing when it was executed, to indicate that it was intended to give the defendant the right to increase from time to time the number of pipes laid. The appellant\u2019s plea for such construction is based largely on the fact that the conveyance throughout uses the words \u2018pipes\u2019 and \u2018mains\u2019 in the plural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>number, and that, therefore, the parties could not have intended to limit the city to a single pipe. But, while the city might, at the outset, have laid more than one pipe, the most that can be said regarding this language is that the grant is indefinite as to the number of pipes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">' The interlocutory judgment in favor of plaintiffs is</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
