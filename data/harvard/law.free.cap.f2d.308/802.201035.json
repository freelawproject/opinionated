Concurrent sentences of ten (10) and twenty-five (25) years were imposed. Shortly thereafter, on motion by appellant, the trial court ruled the offenses merged and corrected the sentence by imposing a single sentence of twenty-five (25) years.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Appellant\u2019s present motion asserts the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction and the invalidity of the sentence. Both points are governed by Martin v. United States (10 C.A.), 241 F.2d 698, where the same issues were presented under essentially the same operative facts. There we held that \u201c(S)ince the illegal sentence * * * under count one was made to run concurrently with the lawful sentence of twenty-five years under count two, he [appellant] has suffered no injury because he is in lawful custody under the twenty-five year sentence.\u201d Indeed, appellant would be entitled to no relief even if the trial court had initially failed to change the sentence to prescribe a single twenty-five year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
