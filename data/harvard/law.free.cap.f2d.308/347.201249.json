The question presented is whether the subject matter of that cause of action had been submitted to arbitration along with the subject matter of appellant\u2019s second cause of action, and had therefore been disposed of by the award of the arbitrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">We hold that under the undisputed facts established in connection with cross-motions for summary judgment, the subject matter of the first cause of action was a part of the claim submitted to the arbitrators. Their award in \u201cfull settlement of all claims submitted\u201d therefore disposed of that cause of action, leaving nothing pending in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
