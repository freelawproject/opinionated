Goldsmith testified as a Government witness. On April 3, 1961, the jury returned verdicts finding Bruce, Rainey and Toles guilty as charged in each count, and a further finding that at the time of the commission of the offense alleged in Count II Bruce, Rainey and Toles did place in jeopardy the life of a named person by use of dangerous weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-19\">Toles appeals <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of convictions entered on May 15, 1961, whereby he was</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">1) Adjudged guilty of the conspiracy offense charged in Count I and sentenced thereon to imprisonment for a period of five years, and</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">2) Adjudged guilty of the bank robbery offense charged in Count II and sentenced thereon to imprisonment for a period of 25 years,</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the two sentences to run consecutively, for a total of 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">STATEMENT OF CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">It appears from the evidence and primarily the testimony of Goldsmith, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">During a meeting at Toles\u2019 home on November 25, 1960, he (Toles), Bruce, Rainey and Tate agreed to commit an armed bank robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Toles drove to the Bank of Ameri-ca, 48th and Vermont Branch, Los Angeles, California, and studied the physical surroundings of the bank;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">Toles then rejoined Goldsmith, Bruce, Rainey and Tate at the location of Toles\u2019 home and explained to them the manner in which the bank would be robbed and the particular duty of each in the course of the robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">Toles gave Goldsmith a shotgun and also gave Bruce a pistol and Rainey used his own gun, which was a .45 automatic pistol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">On November 25, 1960, in the manner planned by Toles, the Bank of America at 48th Street and Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, was robbed of the sum of $3,567.95;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">Goldsmith, armed with a shotgun, stood on a counter and \u201ccovered\u201d the customers and employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">Bruce, armed with a .32 snub nose revolver, and Rainey armed with a .45 automatic pistol, jumped over the counter, and while Bruce \u201ccovered\u201d the tellers, Rainey took the money from the cash drawers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Thereafter, Toles, Goldsmith, Bruce and Rainey met to divide the money taken in the robbery; after some argument Toles was given from $400 to $600 from the money taken in the robbery, and for driving the \u201cgetaway\u201d car, Tate received $250 from Toles\u2019 share of the proceeds of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">SPECIFICATION OF ERRORS AND CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AfR\">We deal with the specification of errors in the order in which they are numbered and for the following reasons will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-21\">\u201cThe evidence is insufficient to justify the verdicts; there is plain \u2022 error on the face of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-22\">Toles urges that the case against him on each count depends solely on the testimony of his codefendant Goldsmith and therefore must fail. The position is without merit, as the testimony of an accomplice, even if uncorroborated, if believed by a jury,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is sufficient to support a conviction. Marcella v. United States, 285 F.2d 322, 323-324 (9th Cir.1960). In this connection, Toles suggests that the prospect of Goldsmith\u2019s receiving a lighter sentence than he (Toles) would if convicted (Goldsmith had not been sentenced at the time of trial and ultimately received a five year lighter sentence than Toles) was so great an inducement to give false testimony that Goldsmith\u2019s testimony must be entirely disbelieved and disregarded. Suffice, it appears that the testimony of Goldsmith, an admitted accomplice, was submitted to the jury for its consideration under appropriate instructions by the District Judge. This Court cannot engage in a rehash of the evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Sandez v. United States, 239 F.2d 239, 243 (9th Cir.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">With reference to the substantive charge of bank robbery, Toles urges that there is no evidence whatsoever and it is not contended that he (personally) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entered the bank or used force, violence or intimidation to take any money or property from the bank. It is a fair consideration from all of the evidence on behalf of the Government to place Toles as the \u201cmaster mind\u201d behind the two crimes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cWhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is a principal.\u201d Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2 (a). Cossack v. United States, 82 F.2d 214 (9th Cir.1936).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Also, under this specification Toles lays the premise that the conviction of the conspiracy count placed him in jeopardy of the substantive offense of armed bank robbery, and in support therefor urges that since the conspiracy verdict was read before the substantive charge verdict on Count II, his plea of jeopardy is substantiated. This premise is untenable. True, the theme of the two counts relates to phases of the same unlawful production, but nonetheless two separate and distinct offenses were thereby produced by Toles. United States v. Kramer, 289 F.2d 909, 913 (2nd Cir. 1961), and United States Supreme Court decisions cited therein; Nemec v. United States, 191 F.2d 810 (9th Cir.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">\u201cEvidence relating to a plan to rob a market was improperly admitted in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">It appears that this complained-of evidence consisted of Goldsmith\u2019s testimony to the effect that originally Toles and the others had planned to rob a market on November 25, 1960; for the purpose of effectuating the market robbery, Toles had given a shotgun to Goldsmith and a .32 pistol to Bruce; these weapons were later used in the bank robbery; when the robbery of the market didn\u2019t materialize, the group meeting at Toles\u2019 house on Burnside Avenue occurred, and it was then that Toles and the others changed their original plan to rob the market and agreed to rob the Bank of America, 48th and Vermont Branch. This testimony was admissible. First, it tended to show the intent and purpose of Toles and the others to engage in a general scheme or plan of armed robbery. Secondly, it tended to show, as charged in Count I, that Toles and the others were associated in the commission of an armed robbery. Therefore, proof of their prior association within reasonable time and area is competent. Cossack v. United States, supra; Schwartz v. United States, 160 F.2d 718 (9th Cir.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-14\">\u201cThe prosecutor was guilty of prejudicial misconduct in the trial of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">This specification is predicated upon two statements of the Government\u2019s counsel during the oral argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-16\">1) \u201cThese are vicious people. Sitting in here now they aren\u2019t as they looked on the 25th day of November or as they acted * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-18\">2) \u201cLet me just wind up with some interesting testimony regarding Toles, an interesting conversation between Toles and Tate in the jail, which was overheard * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-19\">It must be borne in mind that a prosecutor is an advocate and entitled to a fair verbal analysis and description of the facts in earnest, though forensic attempt to persuade a jury. If \u201cthese people\u201d were the persons who conducted the armed bank robbery, as urged by the Government\u2019s counsel, they were indeed \u201cvicious people,\u201d and were not prejudiced by being so referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-20\">An advocate is also entitled to an occasional slip of the tongue, which is here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>manifested by a reading of <em>the </em>language complained of. The use of the words \u201cinteresting testimony,\u201d when referring to an outside conversation, is innocuous when withdrawn and substituted by the words \u201can interesting conversation.\u201d The specification is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">IV.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201cSection 2113(a) (d) of Title 18 U.S. Codes is unconstitutional in that it invades powers exclusively reserved to the states by the Constitution of the United States. (Tenth Amendment, U. S. Constitution.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Toles urges that \u201cCongress did not have the Constitutional authority to make a federal crime out of robbery of a bank merely because money in that bank happened to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Agency. The police powers have always been considered a matter of state concern exclusively.\u201d Citing Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495, as to the proper delegation of Constitutional judicial powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">This contention has already been answered adversely to Toles. As Mr. Justice Holmes in Westfall v. United States, 274 U.S. 256, 47 S.Ct. 629, 71 L.Ed. 1036 (1927) wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">\u201cOf course an act may be criminal under the laws of both jurisdictions. (Citation). And if a state bank chooses to come into the System created by the United States, the United States may punish acts injurious to the System, although done to a corporation that the State is also entitled to protect. The general proposition is too plain to need more than statement.\u201d Mosco v. United States, 301 F.2d 180, 185 (9th Cir. 1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">V.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">\u201cThe Court erred in its rulings in the trial of the case and in denying a motion for a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">1) Toles complains of the allowance in evidence during the Government\u2019s rebuttal stage of the trial of testimony in contradiction of the defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">We have read the transcript of the testimony and the Court\u2019s rulings. This complaint has no merit. Rodella v. United States, 286 F.2d 306, 309 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">2) Toles claims error in allowing the jurors to take notes during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">At a stage of the proceedings, the late very able and individualistic Judge Tolin spoke to the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-16\">\u201cI have noted that some of the jurors appear to be making notes. It is perfectly proper for a juror to make notes, but bear in mind they are your notes. They are not a transcript of the case. You can\u2019t for instance, pull them on the other jurors and say, \u2018See, I got a note of this.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-17\">\u201cSome of the judges do not allow notetaking at all and others feel that the notes are taken simply as an aid to memory and that the jury understands they are to recall the testimony and use the notes only as an aid to memory, and any juror who takes notes will use those notes only for that juror\u2019s assistance in that regard and not as an authoritative thing to show to other jurors. I belong to the latter number of judges, so go ahead and take all the notes you want.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">Judge Tolin has good company in his school of \u201cthe latter number of judges,\u201d and it is obvious from the record that he had the feel of the case and the jury. In granting the \u201cnotetaking\u201d license to the jury he did not abuse his sound discretion. Harris v. United States, 261 F.2d 792 (9th Cir.1958).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Toles\u2019 judgment of convictions is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-22\">.
