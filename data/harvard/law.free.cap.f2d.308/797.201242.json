Tennessee. Three of the sites were separated from the other site by a distance of several miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, appellants moved for a directed verdict of acquittal contending that the evidence established two or more conspiracies instead of the one general conspiracy charged in the indictment and. that there was a fatal variance between the indictment and proof. They relied on. Brooks v. United States, 164 F.2d 142. (C.A. 5). The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury as to defendants Gary Carl Durham and William. Thomas Guess and dismissed them. He granted permission to the Government to' enter a nolle prosequi as to Clifford Arnie Durham. The court further held that the evidence as to still sites two, three- and four was not sufficiently connected to the conspiracy charged in the indictment and instructed the jury to disregard it. The evidence with respect to these three still sites was not extensive and concerned only a few of the defendants. The evidence which remained related only to still site No. One and as to this site there-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>was substantial evidence connecting all of the defendants with the conspiracy. The court denied the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In this Court, appellants complain of the rulings <em>of </em>the trial court in confining the jury to the consideration only of the testimony with respect to still site No. One and denying the motions for a directed verdict of acquittal. If the testimony relating to still sites Nos. two, three and four involved other conspiracies with which these appellants were not connected, there was certainly no prejudice to them for the District Judge to remove such testimony from the case. It might have been error for him not to do so. When this was done the evidence which remained related only to the one conspiracy charged in the indictment and there was no variance between the indictment and the Government\u2019s proof. The court was justified in denying the motions for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">We find no prejudicial error in the record and the judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
