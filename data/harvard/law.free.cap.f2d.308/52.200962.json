(hereinafter called \u201cWis-eombe\u201d) in 1951 at which time he was an active member of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America, a labor organization within the meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act. He became General Superintendent of Field Operations for Wiseombe in December, 1955, and was then issued a withdrawal card by said Brotherhood. The complaint alleges that, \u201cPlaintiff has been an inactive member of said Union subsequent to said date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In February 1958, the stockholders of Wiseombe organized and incorporated Wiseombe Southern Painting Company, Inc. (hereinafter called \u201cWiseombe Southern\u201d), and plaintiff was transferred to Wiseombe Southern as Vice President and later became General Manager. He acted at all times under the direction and control of one Leland M. Wiseombe, the President of both Wis-eombe and Wiseombe Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The first labor difficulties encountered by Wiseombe Southern were at Tulla-homa, Tennessee, with Local 456 of the Brotherhood. The negotiations were handled on behalf of Wiseombe Southern ostensibly by plaintiff but under explicit and detailed instructions from Leland M. Wiseombe.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In May 1958, Wiseombe and Wiseombe Southern \u201cas a joint-venture of the two corporations\u201d contracted for painting on the Jackson Lock and Dam on the Warrior River at Coffeeville, Alabama. Work started on said joint-venture in July 1959. Arrangements for labor were made through Local 779 of the Brotherhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Shortly after beginning work on the joint-venture, Wiseombe and Wiseombe Southern experienced labor difficulties in securing labor for the joint-venture and on August 26, 1959, they filed a suit, signed and sworn to by plaintiff, against the defendant Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America Local Union No. 779, Dulaney Parker, its business agent, and others, in the Circuit Court of Choctaw County in Equity, praying for an injunction and damages against said defendants by reason of said labor difficulties caused by them. In addition to said bill for injunction and damages, in October 1959 three charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board against defendant Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America and defendant Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paper Hangers of America Local No. 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The plaintiff appeared in said cases, \u201cand testified fully, freely and truthfully by oral testimony or affidavit against the defendants named therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">All of the labor negotiations pertaining to the joint-venture at Jackson Lock and Dam, the bill for injunction and the charges filed with the NLRB were handled by plaintiff under the direction, control and instructions of Leland M. Wis-eombe. Leland M. Wiseombe did thereafter falsely and maliciously represent to defendant Brotherhood at a joint meeting of the Union and an Association of Painting Contractors, known as Painting and Decorating Contractors of America, at LaFayette, Indiana, in November 1959, that the plaintiff had conducted the labor negotiations contrary to his orders and instructions and without his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">The defendant Unions threatened Wis-eombe and Wiseombe Southern with coercive measures, such as strikes and the like, wherever Wiseombe and Wiseombe Southern had contracts unless and as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>condition to not using such coercive measures the plaintiff was discharged. As a proximate consequence of the threats and coercion of the defendant Unions, the plaintiff was discharged by Wiscombe and Wiscombe Southern in December 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In February 1960, he secured employment with Earl Paint Corporation of Utica, New York, and in March 1960 was working on a job for Earl Paint Corporation in Bartow, Florida. A jurisdictional dispute arose over the question of whether or not a member of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America should apply foam insulation to certain tanks on the job. Carl Griffin, a business or area representative for the Brotherhood and its locals, investigated the incident and falsely and maliciously reported to the Brotherhood that the plaintiff was the cause of said dispute. The Brotherhood demanded of Earl Paint Corporation that it discharge the plaintiff and threatened Earl Paint Corporation that if it did not discharge the plaintiff the Brotherhood would take coercive measures against Earl Paint Corporation in the form of strikes and the like throughout the United States. As a proximate consequence of the threats and coercive measures the Earl Paint Corporation discharged the plaintiff on March 30, 1960. Plaintiff requested a hearing before the Brotherhood to present the true factual situation in connection with each of the labor difficulties in which he was involved. The Brotherhood failed and refused to allow plaintiff a hearing. The complaint alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cPlaintiff has been unable to secure work in a comparable position in the painting industry as a proximate consequence of the acts of the defendants and has been forced to secure employment in an entirely different field of endeavor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cBy reason of the said acts of defendants, plaintiff has sustained great damage to his property, and ability to work and earn a living for himself, his wife and four children, he has been deprived of the right to work in his chosen profession, he has ' suffered great loss of wages and will be deprived in the future of great loss of wages, he has been put to great expense in trying to secure employment in his field of training, and in clearing his name with said defendant Unions and their representatives, he has suffered great anxiety and worry, he has been deprived of his livelihood; and divers other damages have been sustained and will continue to be suffered, all in the sum of Fifty Thousand ($50,-000.00) Dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cWHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against defendants for the sum of Fifty Thousand ($50,-000.00) Dollars and the cost of this suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The first count bases jurisdiction on 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985, and avers that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">\u201cDefendants on, to-wit: October 3, 1959 and thereafter conspired together and with divers others to injure the plaintiff, a witness in a court of the United States within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.A., Section 1985, in his property and earning capacity on account of his having attended and testified in said court freely, fully, and truthfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">The second count bases jurisdiction on Sections 101(a) (5) and 102 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411(a) (5) and 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 412; and alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">\u201cAlthough plaintiff has withdrawn from active participation in the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America, he is an inactive member of said Brotherhood.

The National Labor Relations Board has no power to punish any person or* organization for contempt, its powers being limited to those conferred by statute, which do not include the-power to punish contempts. The-discharge of the plaintiff by threats and coercion, therefore, constituted contempt and a public offense against, the United States, though not punishable by the National Labor Relations Board. A conspiracy to commit a contempt or any other public offense is actionable and constitutes-a tort. Said acts of defendants constituted a conspiracy to commit contempt of the National Labor Relations Board, and the procurement of the discharge and the discharge of the plaintiff and the ratification \u25a0 thereof by defendants were overt acts in pursuance of said conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">The sixth count bases jurisdiction as-follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u201cJurisdiction over this claim is pendent to the claims asserted in the first through fifth claims herein. This claim is based upon State law, and is not a separate and distinct non-federal cause of action, but is a distinct ground in support of the-same causes of action made the basis-of the first through fifth claims herein. The federal questions presented\u2019 in the first through fifth claims herein are substantial, and if such federal grounds are not established on a. trial of this ease, the court may retain and dispose of this case upon the ground asserted in his sixth, claim, as held in Hum vs. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238 [53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148], and Romero vs. International' Terminal Operating Company, 358-U.S. 354 [79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d! 368].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">That count alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\">\u201c * * * that the defendants by the acts hereinabove described willfully and maliciously caused the-plaintiff to be discharged from his employment and prevented plaintiff from obtaining employment or en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>rgaging in his said employment, and \u25a0 caused plaintiff to lose much time from his work, to-wit, three months, and to lose earnings which he would have received had he not been prevented as aforesaid from working, and causing plaintiff to suffer much mental anguish, all to the plaintiff\u2019s \u2022damage as aforesaid, and plaintiff \u25a0in addition to his claim for compensatory damages, claims of the defendants such punitive and exemplary damages as are commensurate with their malicious and reprehensible conduct as aforesaid and as may seem appropriate to the jury trying this cause to punish defendants for such wrongful conduct and to deter \u2022defendants and others from committing similar wrongs in the future.\u201d 'The district court, in dismissing the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u2022action, opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cThe opinion of Judge Grooms in John F.

In the Lankford case Judge Grooms disposed of a charge similar in some respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">\u201cThis claim does not square with the requirements for a validly stated cause of action under the section referred to. Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651, 71 S.Ct. 937, 95 L.Ed. 1253; Dinniddie [Dinwiddie] v. Brown, 5 Cir., 230 F.2d 465; Schatte v. International Alliance, etc., supra. [9 Cir., 182 F.2d 158].\u201d 196 F.Supp. at 664.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Collins v. Hardyman, 1951, 341 U.S. 651, 660, 71 S.Ct. 937, 95 L.Ed. 1253, settled the principle that the kind of conspiracy covered by what is now subsection (3) of section 1985 is of a very limited character, and repeated for emphasis that such conspiracy must be, \u201cfor the purpose of <em>depriving </em>* * * of the <em>equal protection of the laws, </em>or of <em>equal privileges and immunities under the laws.\u201d </em>(Emphasis the Court\u2019s.) That opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">\u201c * * * private discrimination is not inequality before the law unless there is some manipulation of the law or its agencies to give sanction or sanctuary for doing so. Plaintiffs\u2019 rights were certainly invaded, disregarded and lawlessly violated, but neither their rights nor their equality of rights under the law have been, or were intended to be, denied or impaired. Their rights <em>under the laws </em>and to <em>protection of the laws </em>remain untouched and equal to the rights of every other Californian, and may be vindicated in the same way and with the same effect as those of any other citizen who suffers violence at the hands of a mob.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">341 U.S. at 661, 662, 71 S.Ct. at 942. There is, and can be, no claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>conspiracy charged in Count 1 of the present complaint was for the purpose of depriving plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws. Subsection (3) of section 1985 cannot therefore operate to give jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The averments of the first count are within the language of subsection (2) of section 1985. The operation of that subsection is, however, confined to \u201cany court of the United States.\u201d The criminal counterpart of subsection (2) was considered in Todd v. United States, 1895, 158 U.S. 278, 15 S.Ct. 889, 39 L.Ed. 982, where it was held that a United States Commissioner was not \u201ca court of the United States within the constitutional sense.\u201d Clearly, neither the National Labor Relations Board, nor the Circuit Court of Choctaw County, Alabama, is \u201ca court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) of section 1985 operates to vest jurisdiction of the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">That, however, is not the final answer to whether the first count states a claim within the jurisdiction of the district court. As we commented in Lewis v. Brautigam, 5 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 124, 127, 55 A.L.R.2d 505 the theory of the plaintiff in stating his claim is not so important and the complaint should not be dismissed on motion unless, upon any theory, it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts that could be proved in support of his claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">A further part of our opinion in Lewis v. Brautigam, supra, appears pertinent to our consideration of the sufficiency of the first count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cThe defendants would have us treat the complaint as filed strictly under the statute providing against conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985 * * *, which has been often held to reach a conspiracy to deprive one of civil rights only when its object is a deprivation of equality, and not to cover conspiracies to deny due process. * * * We do not think, however, that we are required so to treat the complaint. It charges that the conspiracy was actually carried into effect. If, thereby, the plaintiff was deprived of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, the gist of the action may be treated as one for the deprivation of such rights under the broader civil rights statute, 42 U.S. C.A. 1983 * * 227 F.2d at 127, 128.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">The complaint does not however, allege that the deprivation of rights was \u201cunder color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory,\u201d which is necessary to give jurisdiction under section 1983. We conclude that the first count does not properly state a claim under any provision of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">COUNT 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">The second count undertakes to state a claim under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 Sections 101(a) (5) and 102, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 411(a) (5) and 412:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">\u00a7 411(a) (5). <em>\u201cSafeguards against improper disciplinary action. </em>\u2014 No member of any labor organization may be fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise disciplined except for nonpayment of dues by such organization or by any officer thereof unless such member has been (A) served with written specific charges; (B) given a reasonable time to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>pare his defense; (C) afforded a full and fair hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">\u00a7 412. <em>\u201cCivil action for infringement of rights; jurisdiction</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cAny person whose rights secured by the provisions of this subehapter have been infringed by any violation of this subchapter may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States for such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate. Any such action against a labor organisation shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the district where the alleged violation occurred, or where the principal office of such labor organization is located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">An individual employed as a supervisor may remain a member of a labor organization. Section 14(a) of the Taft-Hart-ley Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 164(a) so provides. In commenting on that section, it is said in 1 C.C.H. Labor Law Reporter, paragraph 1675:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\"><em>\u201cParticipation of supervisors in union activities. </em>\u2014 Section 14(a) of the Act expressly gives supervisors the right to remain or to become members of a labor organization, but it does not guarantee or give supervisors the right to participate actively in the affairs of a union representing rank-and-file employees. The only right of membership guaranteed by Section 14(a) is precisely the right of nominal nonparticipating membership which will allow supervisory employees to protect their seniority and fringe benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The same section is discussed at some length in Local 636 of the United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen and Apprentices of Plumbing and Pipe Pitting Industry Plumbers v. N.L.R.B., 109 U.S.App. D.C. 315, 287 F.2d 354, 361, 362, with the conclusion reached that supervisors may retain their union membership in order that they may protect their seniority and fringe benefits. The kind of membership which the plaintiff might retain after becoming a supervisor and withdrawing from active participation, while more than merely nominal, is of a very limited type, that is, such membership as would protect his seniority and any fringe benefits. Otherwise, supervisors are excluded from the definition of employee. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(3). It would seem to follow that in order to discipline a supervisor member of a labor organization who has withdrawn from active participation and remains a mere inactive member something must be done to affect his membership insofar as it protects his seniority or fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Certainly the alleged \u201cdiscipline\u201d must have some relation to the plaintiff\u2019s men-bership in the labor organization. While the second count alleges by way of conclusion \u201cthat he has been disciplined,\u201d it continues \u201cas described hereinabove,\u201d thus bringing before the court all of the facts as theretofore alleged in the complaint, the substance of which has already been stated in this opinion. Under those facts it does not appear that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge <em>from </em>Wiscombe Southern, his discharge from the Earl Paint Corporation, or any of the other injuries which plaintiff has suffered have any relationship to his membership in the Brotherhood. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is to this good day an inactive member of the Brotherhood. We conclude therefore that, while the complaint alleges that the plaintiff has been punished, it does not show that he has been disciplined as a member of the Brotherhood, and we agree with the district court that Count 2 fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">COUNT 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\"> Count 3 is based on Section 102 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 412, which has been heretofore quoted, and upon Section 609 of said Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 529:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">\u201c\u00a7 529. <em>Prohibition on certain discipline by labor organization</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any labor organization, or any officer, agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>shop steward, or other representative of a labor organization, or any employee thereof to fine, suspend, expel, or otherwise discipline any of its members for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of this chapter. The provisions of section 412 of this title shall be applicable in the enforcement of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">To state a claim upon which relief can be granted under those sections it is also necessary that the injury to which the plaintiff has been subjected have some relation to his membership in the labor organization in order for it to constitute \u201cdiscipline,\u201d and that element is again lacking in the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">COUNT 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The fourth count is based on Section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187, which permits a suit in a district court for injuries to business or property by reason of any violation of subsection (a) of said section. Specifically, the claim under this count is based on the 1959 amendment to section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful, for the purpose of this section only, in an industry or activity affecting commerce, for any labor organization to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section 158(b) (4) of this title. As amended Sept. 14, 1959, Pub.L. 86-257, Title VII, \u00a7 704(e), 73 Stat. 545.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) defines unfair labor practices of a labor organization and, among other provisions, contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201c(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u201c(4) (i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object thereof is\u2014 \u2022*****\u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201c(B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise-dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of section 159 of' this title: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">It is the appellant-plaintiff\u2019s contention-that the labor organization caused his injury by \u201cforcing or requiring <em>any person </em>* * * to cease doing business-with <em>any other person </em>* * that is, by requiring his employers, Wiscombe Southern and Earl Paint Corporation, to discharge the plaintiff. We are cited to-no case where the language \u201cto cease doing business with any other person\u201d as used in this section has the same meaning as to discharge an employee. Literally, it could have that meaning but that would be foreign to the whole purpose of' the section which has to do with a secondary boycott ban. No secondary boycott was involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (2), specifically dealing with a union\u2019s causing an employer to discharge \u201can employee\u201d as defined' by the act, tends to indicate that the ordinary relation of employer and employee-is not contemplated by the words in sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion 158(b) (4), \u201cto cease doing business with any other person.\u201d True, supervisors are excluded from the definition of employee [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(3)] and literally supervisors can come within section 158(b) (4) as \u201cany other person.\u201d The question is not free from doubt. In our opinion, however, the purpose of the statute prevails over its literal wording. We do not think that the relation of employer and employee, including one employed as a supervisor, is that of \u201cany other person\u201d within section 158(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">COUNT 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The fifth count undertakes to state a claim under general federal jurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337. The plaintiff argues that it was his right as a citizen to report a violation of the federal law to proper federal authorities and to give affidavits and testimony concerning such violation, and that it is the inherent power and duty of the federal government to protect persons reporting and giving evidence of such violations. Whether any such duty exists and, if so, how the government\u2019s duty should be discharged are matters more properly addressed to the Congress than to the Courts. If the federal courts should assume jurisdiction on any such broad theory there would be little reason for the strict limitations imposed on the operations of civil rights acts, as heretofore discussed in our consideration of the sufficiency of Count 1. Under the principles recently and fully discussed in International Association of Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 5 Cir., 1961, 295 F.2d 209, we think that the fifth count fails to disclose affirmatively a federally-created cause of action. Hence, the action does not \u201carise under\u201d federal law for purposes of the general federal jurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">COUNT 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The sixth count is admittedly not a separate and distinct federal claim, but is a claim based on state law pendent to the claims asserted in the first five counts. Since the first five counts fail to state claims upon which relief can be granted within the jurisdiction of a federal district court, there is no basis on which the court can retain jurisdiction of the sixth count. We conclude that the district court properly dismissed the action and its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Aof\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">.
