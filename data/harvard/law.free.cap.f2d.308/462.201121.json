In July 1958, Chrysler and H. T. Pigozzi, head of a group owning approximately 49% of the outstanding stock of French Simea, entered into an agreement referred to as the \u201cBasic Agreement\u201d on behalf of Pigozzi's group of stockholders and on behalf of French Simea. The agreement was executed by Pigozzi in Paris on July 21 and by Chrysler in Detroit on August 1. Chrysler agreed to acquire all the stock of French Simea then owned by Ford Motor Company, consisting of approximately 15% of the outstanding stock of French Simea, and\u00bb to purchase an additional 10% of such stock, so that Chrysler would then own 25% of the stock of French Simea and Pigozzi\u2019s group would own 30'%, and such respective holdings would not be changed except by mutual agreement. Two directors nominated by Chrysler were to be elected to the Board of Directors of French Simea. There was attached to the Basic Agreement as Exhibit \u201cB\u201d a form of distribution agreement for Sim-ea products and for Chrysler products, under which Chrysler became the sole importer and distributor of Simea automobiles in the United States. The written distribution agreement was executed on September 22, but effective September 1, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Execution of the Basic Agreement was publicly announced throughout the Country and received wide publicity in the Dallas newspapers early in August, including the understanding that Chrysler \u201cis becoming the sole distributor of Simea products in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Prior to the execution of the Basic Agreement, French Simea advised Chrysler that the agreements with Simea distributors in the United States were terminable at will by either party. On September 2, 1958, the day it. commenced operations as the exclusive Simea distributor in the United States, Chrysler directed a letter to the ten Simea distributors in the United States and a letter. to the Simea dealers of those distributors. The letter to the Simea distributors advised them that beginning September 2, 1958 Chrysler had assumed the responsibility for the distribution of Simea products in the United States. In it, Chrysler indicated that, in order to transfer the distribution functions in a smooth and orderly fashion and to permit the distributors to wind up their affairs in the most favorable manner under the circumstances, the distributors would be granted the opportunity to order Simea automobiles based on their previous commitments through December 1958. The letter also stated that since the Simea distributors were probably interested in continuing to sell Simea products at retail, the appropriate Simea Area Sales Manager at Chrysler Motors would contact the distributors to discuss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The letter of September 2, 1958 to the Simea dealers advised them that Chrysler had assumed responsibility for distribution of Simea products in the United States; that Chrysler Motors had offered to arrange for shipments of Simea cars to the ten distributors, according to their commitments, through December of 1958; and that they should order automobiles from their distributor through that date. This letter further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\"><em>\u201cIf you desire to continue as a Simea dealer, you should apply to this office. </em>Your qualifications will be carefully and thoroughly reviewed and considered. However, this letter should in no way be considered a commitment to enter into an agreement with you as a Simea Dealer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The importation and distribution of Simea products in the United States began in 1957 and were originally handled by Simea, Inc., incorporated under the laws of Delaware, a wholly owned subsidiary of French Simea. In May 1957, Simea, Inc., and Kurland Motors of Denver, Colorado, entered into a Distributor Sales Agreement for Simea Cars, under which Kurland Motors became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>distributor of 14 states including Texas. This agreement was terminable by either party upon six months\u2019 notice. In February 1958, French Simca changed its American distribution systems and appointed two new wholesalers. Simca, Inc., notified its distributors, including Kurland Motors, that \u201call franchises which we at present have with you are cancelled, effective in accordance with the terms of our agreements.\u201d Simca Western Division, Inc., which then had charge of the importation and distribution of Simca products in states west of the Mississippi River, wrote all distributors, including Kurland Motors, that it was \u201cprepared to sell you these cars and spare parts at the established prices and under terms of payment as practiced in the past, pending negotiation of a new franchise agreement.\u201d No formal new franchise agreement was executed with Kurland Motors, but it continued to act as the Simca distributor in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Following the public announcement in August 1958 that Chrysler was becoming the sole distributor of Simca products in the United States, Kurland Motors took the position that it was entitled to reasonable but not less than six months\u2019 notice of the termination of its exclusive rights to distribute Simca cars. Eventually, however, by agreement dated November 28, 1958, Kurland Motors accepted the termination of its Simca distributorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Paul R. Gorham and L. H. Johnson, Jr., had been employees of Ranes Motors, Inc., which had been appointed by Kur-land Motors as the franchise dealer for the sale of Simca automobiles and parts in Dallas. Ranes Motors continued as the franchise Simca dealer in Dallas during the first eight months of 1958, that is, through August of 1958, when it ceased operations. Meanwhile, its two employees Gorham and Johnson had negotiated for the Simca dealership which it was relinquishing. On August 13, 1958 they incorporated the plaintiff corporation and placed property in it of the value of $1,000.00. Their total ultimate contribution- to capital came to either $10,589.00 or $11,789.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Gorham and Johnson had read the newspaper announcements in August that Chrysler was assuming the exclusive Simca distribution in the United States. However, on August 29, 1958, a representative of Kurland Motors told them that Kurland was still the distributor for Simca cars and that Chrysler\u2019s connection would be of no importance to them. The plaintiff acted on the faith of Kurland\u2019s representations and has now filed suit in Dallas against Kur-land for damages based on the claim that Kurland misrepresented its authority to give the plaintiff a Simca franchise. On August 29, 1958 plaintiff executed an application for franchise to Kur-land Motors and a form of Dealer Sales Agreement terminable by either party upon 30 days\u2019 written notice. Plaintiff received its first shipment of cars from Kurland Motors on September 4, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Plaintiff received from Ranes Motors its copy of Chrysler\u2019s letter dated September 2, 1958, addressed to all Simca dealers, and stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cIf you desire to continue as a Simca dealer, you should apply to this office. Your qualifications will be carefully and thoroughly reviewed and considered. However, this letter should in no way be considered a commitment to enter into an agreement with you as a Simca dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The plaintiff never made application to Chrysler. Mr. Johnson testified: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a contract with Chrysler.\u201d Moreover, the plaintiff made no effort to get any other dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">During September and October 1958, plaintiff purchased a total of 31 Simcas from Kurland Motors. In November Kurland advised the plaintiff that it had moved its inventory of Simca cars from Galveston, Texas, the port of entry, to Denver, Colorado. This change would require plaintiff to pay freight from Galveston to Denver and from Denver to Dallas, an increase of over $100.00 per car purchased from Kurland Motors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Mr. Gorham testified that plaintiff quit dealing with Kurland because of this increase. On November 28, 1958, plaintiff was notified by telephone that Kurland had entered an agreement with Chrysler and would no longer be a distributor. On December 8, 1958 Kurland formally notified plaintiff of the termination of its dealer sales agreement, 30 days after receipt of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Plaintiff continued in business as an unfranchised dealer securing Simca cars for resale by buying them from franchised dealers, or as, what is known in the colorful term of the automobile industry, a \u201cbootleg dealer.\u201d As such, it had to provide the franchised dealer a profit of from $50.00 to $70.00 per car. There is evidence that when one of the franchised dealers objected to this \u201cbootlegging\u201d operation, Chrysler brought pressure to have it stopped. There was, however, no separate complaint for the alleged destruction of plaintiff\u2019s business as a \u201cbootleg\u201d Simca dealer. Instead, plaintiff contended and the jury found that, by refusing to deal with the plaintiff, each of the franchised dealers joined in. and became a part of the Basic Agreement under which Chrysler became the sole distributor of Simca products in the United States. The plaintiff evidently did not consider it worthwhile to charge a separate conspiracy to destroy its business as a \u201cbootleg dealer,\u201d for Mr. Gor-ham frankly conceded that \u201cit would be pure speculation to attempt to say what 'Gorham &amp; Johnson would have made had they continued as bootleg dealers or would have made buying cars at bootleg from other dealers.\u201d In the early part of 1959 plaintiff \u201cdecided to liquidate and go out of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We have sketched only a few of the salient facts developed in this complicated case, but enough, we believe, to show that the jury\u2019s verdict on Special Issue No. 5 was amply justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The failure of plaintiff\u2019s business as a retail dealer in Simca automobiles could reasonably have been believed by the jury to have resulted from any one of numerous causes. Inadequate capitalization, plaintiff\u2019s failure and refusal to apply to Chrysler for a dealership, its failure to seek a dealership in any other cars, the increase of freight charges by Kurland, and Kurland\u2019s alleged misrepresentation of its authority are but a few of the possible causes of plaintiff\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The plaintiff filed no motion for new trial in the district court, and makes no complaint on appeal as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury. Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cFourth Point\u201d on appeal directed to the exclusion from evidence of its Exhibits 40 and 41, official publications of United States Senate Committee Reports, might go to whether the defendants actually violated the antitrust laws or to the jury\u2019s answer to Special Issue No. 4, that the contract, combination or conspiracy was not an unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce. The exclusion of those exhibits does not go to the question of whether the plaintiff was damaged as the result of the contract or conspiracy. No error of any kind is claimed which would impeach or affect the jury\u2019s verdict on that issue. It follows that the verdict must be accepted as conclusively establishing that, the plaintiff was not damaged as the result of the contract, combination or conspiracy, referred to in Special Issue No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Actually, while the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d sounds sinister, it was used in this case as synonymous with \u201ccontract.\u201d As explained in the court\u2019s charge to the jury: \u201ca conspiracy \u2014 and \u2014 \u2018contract,\u2019 \u2018combination\u2019 or \u2018conspiracy\u2019 mean essentially the same thing in this case \u2014 is an agreement between two or more persons shown either by words or by deeds.\u201d Special Issue No. 2 could be answered only in- the affirmative, for there was no .dispute about the contract in which it was agreed that Chrysler would be the sole distributor for Simca products in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Every legal theory asserted by the plaintiff \u2014 the common-law tort in Count 2; the claimed violations' of Sections 2 and 18 of Title 15 U.S.C.A., which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>district court declined to submit to the jury; as well as the claimed violation of Section 1 of Title 15, as to which the jury found that there was no unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce \u2014 each and all of these legal theories depend for their validity upon the plaintiff\u2019s having sustained damage as the result of the contract by which Chrysler became the sole distributor for Simca products in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The breadth of Special Issue No. 5 is pointed up by what occurred during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations as disclosed by a stipulation in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201c * * * that during the course of the proceedings had upon the trial on the merits of the above cause and after the jury had received the charge of the Court and retired to the jury room but prior to the time it returned its verdict, the foreman of the jury addressed a written inquiry to the Judge which was delivered to him in due course by the deputy marshal. After calling in and consulting with counsel for all parties, the Judge indorsed upon a lower part of the same paper bearing the inquiry his response thereto and thereafter in due course the paper containing the inquiry and the response was delivered by the deputy marshal to the foreman of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\u201cPrior to directing the deputy marshal to return such inquiry and his response, the district Judge read both the inquiry and the response to counsel for all parties and no objection was made upon the part of any party, and all parties agreed to the action of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cThe paper containing the inquiry made by the jury and the response of the Judge thereto has been lost or misplaced and is not available for inclusion in the record on appeal of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u201cThe substance of the inquiry so made was: since this was an antitrust case, whether it would be necessary for the jury to answer Special Issue No. 5 inasmuch as the jury had answered \u2018no\u2019 to Special Issue No. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">\u201cThe substance of the reply indorsed by the Judge immediately below such inquiry was: that the matter inquired about had been covered by the instructions contained in the charge of the Court and that no further instructions or interpretation was required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The district court carefully refrained from restricting Special Issue No. 5 to the particular claim which it submitted to the jury based on a violation of Section 1, Title 15 U.S.C.A. Instead, the court required the jury by Special Issue No. 5 to ascertain the damages, if any, as a result of the exclusive distributorship agreement inquired about in Special Issue No. 2. The jury\u2019s answer, therefore, established that the plaintiff sustained no damage under any legal theory which it had asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">That finding forecloses plaintiff from any relief on any theory of violation of the antitrust laws, for a private suit under those laws is permitted only by \u201cany person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of any thing forbidden in the antitrust laws.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15. It demonstrates that any possible error in dismissing the second count of the complaint claiming for a common-law tort \u201cupon precisely the same facts alleged in support of the antitrust violations\u201d would be error without injury. It precludes a ruling on plaintiff\u2019s \u201cFourth Point\u201d directed to the exclusion of plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 40 and 41 which are relevant to the existence of an unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce and not to the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">It results that none of the four claimed errors can amount to reversible error, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-19\">. Specifically, that its business in Dallas, Texas, for retail dealing in Simea automobiles bad been destroyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-20\">.
