After a hearing, the trial court denied this motion. Petitioner waived his right to jury trial and pleaded not guilty to the charge. After a trial, the court found him \u201cguilty as charged in the Indictment,\u201d and on June 25, 1959 petitioner was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On September 14, 1961, petitioner filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. On November 21, 1961, the district court entered an order denying petitioner\u2019s motion without a hearing. This appeal is taken from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Petitioner\u2019s motion was obviously drafted by a layman. Nevertheless, the only ground upon which he relies for vacation of his sentence is readily ascertainable from the conclusion in the motion wherein it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cTherefore, it is the conclusion of the petitioner that the search and seizure, and illegal arrest, the contraband obtained thereby, was improper evidence under the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, therefore Judgment and Commitment is Void, for want of jurisdiction to render it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cIt is the further conclusion of the petitioner, that with the elimination of the introduction of the contraband in question the government has not yet established the Corpus De-licti, of the crime nor that a crime was committed and therefore peti-ti\u00f3ner\u2019s Motion for Suppression under Rule 41 [18 U.S.C.A.], and defendant\u2019s Motion for Acquittal, at close of the entire cause, should have been sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Petitioner is clearly attempting to assert that his judgment of conviction rests on evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure and should therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">In prior decisions, this court has held claims such as petitioner\u2019s not cognizable under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Pearson v. United States, 7 Cir, 305 F.2d 34 (1962); United States v. Scales, 7 Cir, 249 F.2d 368 (1957). Petitioner urges us to reexamine our position as stated in these cases. We feel it unnecessary to do so. We are in complete agreement with the proposition that a judgment of conviction is not subject to collateral attack under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that such conviction rests on illegally obtained evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court was correct in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Petitioner claims that the court below erred in failing to appoint counsel to assist him in presenting his \u00a7 2255 motion to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">The record reveals that petitioner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, while sworn to by him on October 2, 1961, was not filed in the district court until April 30, 1962, which was after the court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. There is nothing in the record to indicate when the motion for appointment of counsel was mailed by petitioner or received by the court. Under such circumstances we must presume that petitioner\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel was filed promptly after having been received by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In any event, failure of the district court to appoint counsel to assist petitioner in the presentation of his \u00a7 2255 motion, under the circumstances of this case, was neither prejudicial to petitioner nor an abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The \u00a7 2255 motion failed to state grounds upon which petitioner\u2019s sentence could have been vacated. It is clear from this motion that petitioner was entitled to no relief. In such instance, the district court was not required to hold a hearing and may, in its discretion, as was done here, enter an order denying the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">This appeal was prosecuted <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Petitioner was ably represented in this appeal by court-appointed counsel, Mr. B. Michael Pallasch, a member of the Illinois Bar. We commend him for this unselfish and dedicated service.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Finding no error in the action of the district court, the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-23\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-24\">\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-26\">\u201cUnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.
