This court has before it as much information as the district judge who decided the allowances solely on the basis of affidavits. In view of the amount recovered and the nature and quality of the services rendered over a protracted period of time, we find the allowances as requested, and which were agreed to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the party benefited, to be very reasonable and we can see no good reason why the amount agreed upon should not be allowed. Accordingly, we modify the order of the district court and allow Mr. Rosden $58,000, and Mr. Berenson $50,-000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
