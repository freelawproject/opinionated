It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126, and \u201cit must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Columbian Enameling and Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-20\">In the instant case the majority of the board disagreed with the findings and conclusions of the trial examiner relied on for his recommendation that the complaint be dismissed. In this situation the Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>340 U.S. 474, at p. 496, 71 S.Ct. 456, 468, 95 L.Ed. 456, said: \u201cThe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard is not modified in anyway when the Board and its examiner disagree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Applying the substantial evidence test and upon examination of the entire record, this Court concludes that there was substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The petition to review and set aside the board\u2019s order is denied and enforcement of the order is decreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
