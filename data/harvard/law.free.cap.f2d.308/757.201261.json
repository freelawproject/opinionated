Bel-lanca Corporation, 7 Cir., 288 F.2d 784, we affirmed an August 30,1960, judgment order of the District Court granting judgment in favor of counter-claimant, Bellanca Corporation and against counter-defendant, Bankers Life and Casualty Company, in the sum of $1,250,000.00 plus costs and interest at the rate of 5% per annum since August 8, 1956. Bankers <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by its former appeal had sought reversal of the District Court judgment or, in any event, its modification to eliminate the pre-judgment interest awarded as part of the judgment. Bellanca by its appeal had sought an increase in the principal amount of the judgment to $4,000,-000. 00. Following the affirmance Bankers unsuccessfully petitioned this Court for a rehearing and the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The petition for certiorari was denied October 9, 1961 (368 U.S. 827, 82 S.Ct. 47, 7 L.Ed.2d 31) and on October 16, 1961, Bankers filed a motion in the District Court which, as subsequently amended, prayed that it be relieved from paying post-judgment interest on the August 30, 1960 judgment of the District Court for the period from September 28, 1960, to May 8, 1961 (amounting to $45,780.52),. the period during which Bellanea\u2019s cross-appeal was pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court denied Bankers\u2019 motion and by its formal order entered January 8, 1962, directed the clerk of the court to disburse the sum of $45,780.52 to Bellanca from funds theretofore deposited by Bankers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and upon making such payment to satisfy of record the judgment of August 30, 1960. It is from this order denying its motion and directing disbursement to Bellanca that Bankers prosecutes this present appeal. Bellanca has not cross-appealed. It filed a motion to dismiss Bankers' appeal, which motion has been taken with the ease, and in its brief on the merits urges affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">Our opinion in the previous appeals was filed April 6, 1961, and on that date this Court entered an order that \u201cthe judgment of the said District Court in this cause appealed from be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and interest, in accordance with the Opinion of this Coui\u2019t filed this day.\u201d The mandate in Bankers\u2019 appeal issued October 17, 1961, and was filed in the District Court October 18, 1961. It contained a recital of this Court\u2019s order of April 6, 1961, as above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">It is clear from the face of the District Court\u2019s judgment order of August 30,1960, and from the opinion in the previous appeals, Bankers Life and Casualty Company v. Bellanca Corporation, 7 Cir., 288 F.2d 784, 790, that the judgment order of the District Court included an award of pre-judgment interest from August 8,1956, as a part of the judgment entered. No mention of interest in the order affirming that judgment was necessary to the retention of this pre-judgment interest allowed because of unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>sonable and vexatious delay \u2014 it was an integral part of the judgment affirmed. We find no basis for a construction that our order of affirmance \u201cwith costs and interest\u201d referred to the pre-judgment interest which it would have been unnecessary to mention. Bankers concedes Bellanca\u2019s right to post-judgment interest except for the period Bellanca\u2019s cross appeal was pending \u2014 the interval from September 28, 1960 to May 8, 1961. And, it was a condition prerequisite to the allowance of any post-judgment interest that our order of affirmance and mandate .so direct. Briggs v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 334 U.S. 304, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403; Lee v. Terminal Transport Co., 7 Cir., 301 F.2d 234. We construe \u25a0our mandate to the District Court, incorporating as it does our order of affirmance \u201cwith costs and interest\u201d, as recognizing Bellanca\u2019s right to interest on the total amount of the judgment in its favor from the date of its entry until payment, and as expressly awarding such post-judgment interest in keeping with the rationale of Briggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The mandate allowed interest on the judgment without any qualification limiting it to periods exclusive of the pendency of Bellanca\u2019s cross-appeal. In the face of our mandate the District Court was without alternative but to deny Bankers\u2019 motion to be relieved from paying interest for the period during which Bellanca\u2019s cross-appeal was pending. The District Court was without power or authority to deviate from the mandate. Briggs v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"> Bankers took no timely action in this Court to request a recall and modification of the mandate for the purpose of obtaining the relief to which it \u25a0claims it is entitled. It is now too late for it to do so. Lee v. Terminal Transport Co., supra. While the power to act \u25a0on its mandate after the term expires survives to protect the integrity of the court\u2019s own processes, Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250, it has not been held to survive for the convenience \u25a0of litigants. Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, 275 U.S. 70, 48 S.Ct. 97, 72 L.Ed. 168. We therefore do not consider the merits of Bankers\u2019 contention that Bellanca\u2019s cross-appeal precludes Bel-lanca\u2019s right to interest on the judgment during the period the cross-appeal was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\">. In the interest of brevity and clarity the Counter-Defendant and Appellant will be referred to as Bankers, and the Counter-Claimant and Appellee will be referred to as Bellanca.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\">. Bellanca did not petition for rehearing nor seek certiorari. The mandate in its appeal was filed in the District Court May 8, 1061, following denial of Bankers\u2019 petition for rehearing April 28, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-15\">. On October 23, 1961, Bankers, pursuant to order of the District Court, had deposited $1,591,805.43 with the clerk, a a the full amount of the judgment plus interest thereon to that date. The clerk had made previous disbursements of $1,-455,399.57 on October 23, 1961, and of $40,625.34 on November 8, 1961, pursuant to court orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
