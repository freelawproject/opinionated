We think that petitioner has taken too narrow a view of these terms in light of the broad regulatory purpose of the statute, and we entertain no doubt about the Commission\u2019s authority to grant the present license. See Harris County, Texas v. United States and the Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 292 F.2d 370 (5th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">Petitioner further contends that the absence of factual findings to support the Commission\u2019s conclusions coupled with the denial to the city of an opportunity to make an adequate presentation constitutes a deprivation of admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>istrative due process. Our review of the record, however, indicates that adequate opportunity was given the city to make a record, and that the record supports the conclusion of the Commission that the proposed activity \u201cdoes not involve any credible possibility of contamination of the ground, air, or water * *</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Finally, petitioner asks us to remand this case to the Commission for additional findings in light of the resumption of Soviet atmospheric nuclear testing. But it makes no affirmative showing that the new conditions were not contemplated in the Commission\u2019s decision to grant the license, or that these conditions, in any way, affect the safety of the activity in question. Under these circumstances, we see no useful purpose to be served by remanding for additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The motion to remand is denied and the order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
