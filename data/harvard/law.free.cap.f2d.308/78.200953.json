Pies El-worth Russell alone signed it. Pies El-worth Russell is allegedly confined at the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, and Roy Russell at a federal institution at Terminal Island, San Pedro, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Both the motion and the petition have been referred by the Chief Judge to this panel of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"> A litigant appearing in propria persona has no authority to represent anyone other than himself. Cf. Carrigan v. California State Legislature et al., 9 Cir., 263 F.2d 560. There is, therefore, no matter presently before us presented by, or on behalf of, Roy Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We turn to Pies Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Title 28 of the United States Code \u00a7 1291 gives this Court jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States. This is not an appeal from such a decision. We have no authority, in the absence of a timely appeal, to vacate a judgment of conviction, or to modify, or correct a sentence. Tesciona v. United States (1944) 9 Cir., 141 F.2d 811. Nor may we grant probation, nor modify it. That is the function of the court entering the judgment of conviction. Rule 32(c), Fed.R.Crim.P. 18 U.S.C.; 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 3651.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Title 28 of the United States Code \u00a7 1651(a) authorizes this court to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction. With respect to a matter not within its jurisdiction, it has no power to issue writs in aid thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Title 28 of the United States Code \u00a7 2241 authorized the issuance of writs of habeas corpus by this court. That writ has been held broad enough to authorize this court to issue an order, in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, requiring that a prisoner be brought before it for the purpose of arguing his appeal. Price v. Johnston, Warden, (1948) 334 U.S. 266, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356. Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (5) permits a prisoner to be brought into court by the writ when necessary to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">There being no matter before us over which we have jurisdiction, there is no necessity for testimony in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The \u201cMotion for Probation of Sentence\u201d is denied. The \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum\u201d is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
