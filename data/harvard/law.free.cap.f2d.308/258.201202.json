These motions were denied below. His petition alleges that he was not permitted to bring to the attention of the Parole Board evidence which would excuse or disprove the charge of parole violation on which the revocation of parole was based. If this allegation is correct, the petitioner was, in effect, denied the \u201copportunity to appear before the Board\u201d provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207. Fleming v. Tate, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 156 F.2d 848 (1946); see Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The memorandum of decision filed in the district court is unclear as to what information was before the court when it issued its order. So far as can be gathered, however, it relied solely on the papers filed before it and now part of the record before us. These papers do not deal adequately with petitioner\u2019s contention. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for further findings and for the taking of such further testimony as may be necessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
