The taxable year involved was that ending November 30, 1955. The amount involved was $17,003.54. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to redetermine petitioner\u2019s alleged deficiency under \u00a7 6213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Jurisdiction here rests on \u00a7 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The opinion appears in 36 T.C. 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">The Tax Court made the following Findings of Fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-12\">\u00ab* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-13\">\u201cDeposits of pumice originate in two ways. Pumice may be blasted or blown out of a volcano into the air, and carried varied distances before settling on the earth, or it may ooze or flow from a fissure or crater of a volcano along the slopes or adjoining area. Pumice may be found in the form of little pebbles, large pieces, or in masses called flows. There are layers of pumice and layers of hard glass. Many gradations have been observed and found from time to time. Pumice of a kind is found in great quantities in the earth\u2019s crust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-15\">\u201cIn petrology, the science of rocks in its broad aspects, pumice is an excessively cellular glassy lava generally of the composition of rhyolite, a sort of volcanic froth. Its color is generally whitish or light gray, and it is very light and will float in water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-16\">\u201cCommon uses of pumice are as a light weight aggregate in the making of concrete and cement, as an abrasive and as a scouring agent. It is also used for many other purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-17\">\u201cUntil the latter part of 1943, petitioner\u2019s operations were in an area in California known as Blind Springs. * * * -* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-19\">\u201cIn the latter part of 1943, petitioner acquired an open-face pit or quarry of a volcanic deposit, and began mining its present product. This deposit was not in the form of particles which had been blown from the volcano, but was in the form of a flow of lava from the crater or a fissure or fissures of the volcano. The deposit is located about 17 miles from Lee Vining, a small town located on Mono Lake in Mono County, California, approximately 340 miles north of Los Angeles, on Highway 395. It is about 50 miles from the Blind Springs deposit. Petitioner\u2019s mill is located at Lee Vining. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-20\">\u201cThe major part of petitioner\u2019s operations is at the deposit near Lee Vining. The deposit is known as the Frank Sam Mine, but petitioner refers to it as the Lee Vining mine. The material is broken loose by crow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>bars and a bulldozer. The larger pieces are pushed to loading platforms, hand sorted, and loaded on trucks by means of a skiploader or \u25a0conveyor belts. The trucks then haul the material to the mill, which eon-.sists of a shed and several circular \u25a0saws. During the taxable year petitioner cut the usable material into rectangular blocks of two sizes, the larger size being 4x4x8 inches and the smaller 3x3x6 inches. The blocks were packaged in cardboard cartons, and were sold under the trade name of Grillmaster. In connection with the petitioner's business, the blocks are referred to as grillstones. Some of the material that had hard streaks in it was not suitable for grillstones, and was not .so used. The same was true of the pieces that were not of sufficient shape or size to be cut to the 3x3 x 6 inch dimensions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">\u201cPetitioner sells its products to restaurant supply dealers. The grill-stones are used for cleaning restau-rant grills. The blocks consist of minute glass particles which through a rubbing or scraping motion cut burnt carbon from the grill, without injuring the metal of the grill. The blocks are also permeable which permits them to absorb grease and have a lubricating quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">\u201cThe blocks produced and sold by petitioner are grayish in color and .are very light in weight, and float in water, all of which are natural \u2022characteristics of pumice. The index of refraction of petitioner\u2019s products is 1.495 plus or minus .005, .and indicates that the product is of the composition of rhyolite or rhyo-litic rock, which is consistent with .an indenti\u00f1cation thereof as pumice. \u25a0 -&gt;:\u2022 *\u25a0 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">\u201cOn its income tax returns for the fiscal years ended November 30, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1952 amended, and 1953, petitioner declared that its -principal business activity was \u2018mining and manufacturing pumice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">\u201cThe returns for 1950, 1951 and 1952 show that petitioner had inventories of pumice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">\u201cOn its return for the taxable year ended November 30, 1955, petitioner listed its principal business activity as mining and cutting dimension stone. * <em>* * </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The Tax Court concluded that the material the Company mined in 1955 \u201cwas pumice.\u201d Petitioner urges that this finding has no sufficient support in the evidence. The Company\u2019s four experts described the material as \u201cdimension stone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">The government\u2019s expert, De Grosse, testified only that he had taken two thin slices of respondent\u2019s Exhibit C (one taken parallel to the structure and one at right angles). These were marked 1-1 and 1-2 (Respondent\u2019s Ex. I). He testified the index of refraction of Exhibit C was 1.495 plus or minus .005.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">The government\u2019s expert Tunell (Professor of Geology at the University of California at Los Angeles), then testified Exhibit C \u201cconforms to the generally accepted petrologist\u2019s definition of pumice,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">\u201cAn excessively cellular glassy lava generally of the composition of rhyolite, a sort of volcanic froth. Its color is generally whitish or light grey. It is very light and will float on water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">Placed in a pail of water in the courtroom, Exhibit C floated. The witness then identified Exhibits J and K as magnified pictures of Respondent\u2019s Exhibit I; that the index of refraction mentioned, <em>supra, </em>indicated the walls between the pumice were rhyolitic rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">Petitioner concedes in its brief and conceded at the trial, and on oral argument, that it \u201chad not tried\u201d or \u201chad made no particular effort\u201d to prove its product was <em>not </em>pumice. It argues that it is \u201cdimension stone\u201d whether pumice or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\"> But petitioner states that despite its lack of effort to prove the material produced was not pumice, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>evidence in the record (from its own witnesses, Fay and King (non-experts) and expert Sehroter) that \u201ccasts substantial doubt [upon the fact] that the product is pumice.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we concede that there exists more than \u201csubstantial doubt,\u201d and even if there was a clear conflict in the evidence, the trial court has the right and power to decide what testimony he believes, and what he discards. The testimony of an expert witness is no better than the convincing nature of his reasons for his testimony. His opinion evidence becomes a question of fact, here decided adversely to petitioner. We have no power to rejudge the matter, or to second guess the trier of fact,</p>\n<p id=\"aos-dedup-0\">Section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in material part, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The material <em>\u201cpumice\u201d </em>is specifically mentioned in \u00a7 613(b) (5) (A). Also included in \u00a7 613(b) (5) (A) is: \u201cstone, except stone described in paragraph (6).\u201d Paragraph (6) includes the description: \u201cstone (used or sold for use by the mine owner or operator as dimension stone or ornamental stone)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\u201cPumice\u201d in its ordinary sense, as a noun, is defined as: \u201ca variety of volcanic glass, full of minute cavities and very light, used especially for polishing.\u201d \u201cStone\u201d in its ordinary sense, as a noun, is defined as a small piece of rock. A stone ordinarily does not float; pumice ordinarily does.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">That pumice and stone are two different materials, is recognized in \u00a7 613. Pumice used or sold as dimension or ornamental stone is not changed thereby from pumice to stone. It is stone <em>\u201csold or used </em>as dimension or ornamental stone\u201d which rates a fifteen per cent depletion base, rather than the ordinary five per cent depletion base for ordinary stone. It is not pumice used or sold as ornamental stone, that gains a fifteen per cent base. The use and purpose of sale of stone may change its tax base \u2014 it does not change the substance from stone to pumice or any other substance, or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Congress has separated \u201cpumice\u201d from the more general classification of \u201cstone\u201d in one section and provided a specific depreciation rate for it. It cannot be presumed that this distinction is to be overlooked in the next section so as to include \u201cpumice\u201d once again in the general category of \u201cstone\u201d and allow a different rate of depreciation. Where a mineral is specifically provided for at a stated rate of percentage allowance, the specific provision will govern over the allowance provided for a more general classification. This principle was recognized by the Ninth Circuit in Riddell v. Victorville Lime Rock Co., 292 F.2d 427, 433 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Had Congress intended the interpretation proposed by petitioner, there would have been no reason for distinguishing \u201cpumice\u201d from \u201cstone\u201d in subsection (5) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Secondly, the mere fact that petitioner\u2019s product is cut to certain dimensions does not make it \u201cdimension stone\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 613(b) (6). The Senate Finance Committee, in commenting on the dimension stone classification, indicated its understanding of that term by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">\u201c \u2018Dimension stone\u2019 means blocks and slabs of natural stone cut to definite shapes and sizes, such as building stone (excluding rubble), monumental stone, paving blocks, curbing and flagging.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1622, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 332, U. S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 1954, p. 4972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">This definition has been embodied in the Regulations. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.613-2(b) (3). It is clear that the intent of Congress was to provide a higher rate of depreciation for stone cut to particular size for use in various types of construction. Taxpayer\u2019s grillstones do not come within this category, and thus the fifteen per cent rate set in subsection (6) cannot be applied to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Pumice cannot become something other than pumice, even if sold or used for a purpose other than that to which pumice is ordinarily put. It was used for its usual purpose here to scour carbon and grease off grills. Congress, \u201cin its wisdom,\u201d saw fit to make an exception as to certain stone, put to a certain use and sale (as dimensional stone), and placed it in a category different from ordinary stone; but it did <em>not </em>see fit to place pumice into two categories, one depending upon its geological nature and the other depending upon its use and sale. The statute is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-5\">. As an example, petitioner states the government\u2019s expert testified pumice was common; the petitioner\u2019s non-experts testified products from its deposits are extremely rare. What evidentiary value this may have is extremely argumentative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. <em>\u201cInternal Revenue Code of 1954:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">\u201cSec. 613. <em>Percentage Depletion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 In the case of the mines, wells, and other natural deposits listed in subsection (b), the allowance for depletion under section 611 shall be the percentage, specified in subsection (b), of the gross income from the property excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property.
