His purpose in part was to protest the arrival there of Russian Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan. As he was crossing the street in a pedestrian crosswalk leading from the public parking lot to a sidewalk used by the general public, appellant was seized by appellees, police officers of the City of Los Angeles, who took the tracts from him, tearing some into pieces and keeping the others. Appellees detained appellant for ten minutes, then released him. Appellant demanded his tracts, but they were not returned. He was not told that he was under arrest, nor was any charge filed against him. Appellees had neither a search warrant nor warrant for arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Appellant further alleged that the acts of the officers were done under color of the laws of the State of California and the municipality of Los Angeles; and that these acts deprived appellant of rights secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the provisions of 42 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, including the right to free speech and free exercise of religion, the right not to be deprived of property without due process of law, the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the privilege of discussing national issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-20\">The complaint was dismissed upon the following grounds: (1) the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, in that it did not allege that the police officers acted with the purpose of discriminating between persons or classes of persons; (2) as police officers of the City of Los Angeles, ap-pellees were immune from civil prosecution; and (3) the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-22\">1. Our decision in Cohen v. Norris,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed subsequent to the ruling below, requires rejection of the first two^ grounds of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-23\">Moreover, considering only those Fourteenth Amendment rights which find their origin in the First Amendment, it cannot be said that \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under Section 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-24\">Since it is not disputed that appellees acted \u201cunder color of State law,\u201d the municipal ordinances <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and code section <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>upon which appellees rely are irrelevant. If appellees\u2019 conduct deprived' appellant .of federal constitutional rights,, it would be no defense that the conduct was authorized by municipal enactments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 1983 by its express terms imposes liability upon \u201cevery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance\u201d or other state law deprives another of his federal civil rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-25\">2. The complaint was filed January 17, 1961. The incident upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>which it was based is alleged to have occurred January 11, 1959. Since the Civil Rights Act contains no provision limiting the time within which an action may be brought under Section 1983, the applicable period of limitation is that provided by the statutes of California\u2014 the State in which the present action arose and the District Court was located.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The District Court held that the appropriate California statute of limitations is California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 340(3) and (6), which provides a one-year period applicable to actions for assault, battery, false imprisonment, and certain actions for damages for seizure of property. Appellant asserts that the appropriate California statute is Section 338(1) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that actions \u201cupon a liability created by statute\u201d must be brought within three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">There are no decisions directly in point, and those most nearly analogous are inconclusive. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, without discussion, has applied the New York \u201cliability created by statute\u201d limitation to an action under the Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has indicated that it would have applied that limitation to such an action had one been available in the statutes of Illinois.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Tenth Circuit, on the other hand, has applied the Kansas statute of limitations applicable to actions \u201cfor injury to the rights of another, not arising on contract.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">In determining which period of limitation to apply to an action under a particular federal statute, the federal court accepts the state\u2019s interpretation of its own statutes of limitations,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but determines for itself the nature of the right conferred by the federal statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">The California courts have held that an action is based \u201cupon a liability created by statute,\u201d within the meaning of Section 338(1), if the liability would not exist but for statute. Or, conversely, an action is not based \u201cupon a liability created by statute\u201d if the right is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>would exist at common law in the absence of statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Though broadly stated, the distinction drawn is sufficiently discriminating for the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act clearly creates rights and imposes obligations different from any which would exist at common law in the absence of statute. A given state of facts may of course give rise to a cause of action in common-law tort as well as to a cause of action under Section 1983, but the elements of the two are not the same. The elements of an action under Section 1983 are (1) the denial under color of state law (2) of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Neither of these elements would be required to make out a cause of action in common-law tort; both might be present without creating common-law tort liability.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As Mr. Justice Harlan recently suggested, \u201ca deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of a state right and therefore deserves a different remedy even though the same act may constitute both a state tort and the deprivation of a constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Practical considerations also support the selection of California\u2019s \u201cliability created by statute\u201d limitation. According to appellees\u2019 analysis, the single cause of action under the Civil Rights Act alleged in the complaint includes three distinct causes of action under State law and calls for the application of two distinct State statutes of limitations ;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> appellant suggests still another possibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Inconsistency and confusion would result if the single cause of action created by Congress were fragmented in accordance with analogies drawn to rights created by state law and the several differing periods of limitation applicable to each state-created right were applied to the single federal cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Reverse^ and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\">. 300 F.2d 24 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">. 300 F.2d at 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">.

This is generally the rule where Congress fails to provide a statute of limitations applicable to a federally created cause of action. See, e. g., Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 395, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1945) ; Campbell v. Haverhill, 155 U.S. 610, 15 S.Ct. 217, 39 L.Ed. 280 (1895). Compare McAllister v.

The court recognized that \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 created statutory rights of action. However, the Illinois statutes of limitation did not have a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d category, and the court therefore applied the limitation for civil actions \u201cnot otherwise provided for.\u201d But see Gordon v.
