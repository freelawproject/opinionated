The \u201cTours\u201d included \u201cfree\u201d air transportation between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The Civil Aeronautics Board, found that the \u201cTours\u201d constituted \u201cair transportation\u201d (defined in the Federal Aviation Act as \u201ccarriage by aircraft of persons * * * as a common carrier for compensation or hire\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were therefore prohibited by the Act in the absence of authorization from the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners seek review of the Board\u2019s order to cease and desist.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">1. In Las Vegas Hacienda, Inc. v. C. A. B.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we reviewed the Board\u2019s determination that \u201cFiesta Flights\u201d between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which were included \u201cfree\u201d as part of \u201cChampagne Tours\u201d sold by another hotel operator, constituted \u201cair transportation.\u201d We sustained the Board\u2019s conclusion because we found substantial evidence in the record that by selling \u201cChampagne Tours\u201d Hacienda was acting as a common carrier by air; i. e., it \u201cwas engaged as a regular business in offering air transportation to the general public in the commercial market.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Petitioners acknowledged that their flights resemble those in Hacienda. But they argue that they are distinguishable because the \u201cTours\u201d in the present case were sold only to persons who were to be patrons of the Dunes Hotel, either for the evening or as overnight guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">We agree with the Board that this distinction is not significant. The record amply demonstrates that \u201cMagic Carpet Tours\u201d were held out as available to all who wished to purchase them. The flights which were included in the \u201cTours\u201d were no less common carriage because available only to those members of the public who were interested in patronizing the Dunes Hotel. \u201cThe public does not mean everybody all the time.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On both reason and authority \u201cit is immaterial that the service offered will be attractive only to a limited group.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-18\">2. The Civil Aeronautics Aef was superseded by the Federal Aviation Act as of January 1, 1959. The provisions of each Act pertinent to the present case are identical.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The complaint alleged violation of the new Act. Over petitioners\u2019 objection the Examiner received evidence of petitioners\u2019 activities prior to January 1, 1959. Petitioners argue that this was error, and that if the evidence had been excluded the Board\u2019s order would have been without substantial support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">We think the evidence was admissible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But in any event the Examiner rejected the contention on the additional ground that there was substantial independent proof that petitioners had engaged in \u201cair transportation\u201d subsequent to Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>uary 1, 1959. We have reviewed the record, and agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">3. Petitioners further attack the Board\u2019s order as vague and indefinite. We sustained a similar order in Hacienda, though criticizing its form.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Examiner\u2019s decision, adopted by the Board, is sufficiently detailed to adequately advise petitioners of the conduct which is prohibited. Since the present order predated the Hacienda opinion, it would be inappropriate to hold the Board to the stricter standard suggested in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">4. The Board\u2019s order runs against Don Rich and Fred A. Miller, \u201cindividually, and as principals in Trans Global Airlines.\u201d Petitioners contend that the record does not support an order against the named individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The Board found that the flights were \u201coperated under the Dunes\u2019 complete direction, supervision and control,\u201d and that the \u201cphysical operation of the Dunes flights is performed by Trans Global * * * pursuant to contracts\u201d with the Dunes Hotel. The order against Rich and Miller as individuals was based upon the fact that they were principals in Trans-Global, and that they owned two aircraft which were leased to the Dunes Hotel for the flights. The Board felt that since the flights involved common carriage, those who were responsible for the physical operation of the aircraft were also engaged in common carriage. As we pointed out in Hacienda, the conclusion does not follow from the premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Trans-Global was a \u201cPart 45\u201d carrier, certificated by the Board to engage in \u201cair commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The essential distinction between \u201cair commerce\u201d and \u201cair transportation\u201d in the present c\u00e1se, as in Hacienda, was \u201cthe holding out (primarily through advertising, ticket sales, and similar activities) that the flights were available to the general public for compensation or hire.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no suggestion in the findings and conclusions, nor in the portions of the record called to our attention, that the individual petitioners participated in the activities which gave the flights the character of \u201cair transportation.\u201d On the contrary, the Board found that \u201cthe operation of the flights and advertising of the flights are in Dunes\u2019 name, [and] all of the duties and services incident thereto except the physical operation of the aircraft are performed by Dunes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">The government argues that the Board must be permitted to enjoin all those who participate in an integrated carrier operation which violates the Act, even though the participants may have agreed among themselves to a division of responsibility for various portions of the operation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree. We also agree that the circumstances of this case suggest that an inquiry directed to that issue might have developed sufficient evidence to support findings that the individual petitioners did in fact knowingly participate in a common course of conduct which constituted the furnishing of \u201cair transportation\u201d without the required certificate. But the evidence was not developed and the findings were not made, apparently on the assumption, which we have held erroneous, that furnishing the equipment and participating in the physical flight operations were alone enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">The cease-and-desist order of a \u2022regulatory body may impose a heavy although intangible burden upon an individual who must continue to make his livelihood in the regulated industry. Such an order must be supported by specific findings based upon substantial evidence that the individual enjoined has participated in the unlawful conduct. The Board\u2019s conclusion that the individ-ual petitioners were engaged in \u201cair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>transportation\u201d is not supported by the present record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The order of the Board is modified by striking the words \u201cand Fred A. Miller and Donald Reichgott a/k/a Don Rich, individually and as principals in Trans Global Airlines,\u201d and as modified is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1301(10), (21).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1371(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\">. 298 F.2d 430 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\">.
