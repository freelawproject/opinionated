The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 131 NLRB, No. 160. Georgia Rug Mill raises scarcely a murmur against the first charge, and, while not conceding that it violated the Act, does not resist enforcement of the cease-and-desist order. The controversy centers on the discharge of the two employees who, according to the Board\u2019s findings, were dismissed because of their union activities. In testing the Board\u2019s findings, we apply the same test of sub-stantiality of evidence to reinstatement cases as to other cases under the Act. N. L. R. B. v. Walton Manufacturing Co., 1962, 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed. 2d 829. The rule of review, as stated in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, is the same in all Labor Board cases, and the Board\u2019s findings will be set aside only \u201cwhen the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">Both the Trial Examiner and the Labor Board found that George Gaines was dismissed by the Georgia Rug Mill because of union activity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-18\">Gaines was an unabashed union supporter. He attended meetings, spoke in favor of the union \u201call over the mill,\u201d and persuaded employees to sign union cards. The pretext for firing Gaines arose when he purportedly over-stayed a leave he had requested. When he reported to work after three days absence, he discovered that his timecard had been removed from the rack. He was told to report to Gregg, his supervisor, in the morning. When he did so, Gregg accused him of over-staying his leave. Gaines denied this. There was a heated exchange, enlivened by obscenities. During the course of the quarrel Gregg stated that he had heard Gaines was working for the union. Gregg finally told Gaines, \u201c[Y]ou was fired yesterday when you didn\u2019t come in.\u201d Gaines ended the interview by threatening to give Gregg a beating if he ever caught him outside the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">The Company explains that Gaines\u2019s leave was for two days, not three; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>when Gaines failed to report for work on the third day, his foreman removed his timecard and instructed him to report to Gregg the next morning; that the purpose was to find out whether Gaines had a valid excuse for over-staying his leave. The Company contends that when questioned, Gaines became obscene and insubordinate and, because of this, was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">There are several flaws in the Company\u2019s interpretation of the incident. First, it assumes that Gaines unquestionably over-stayed his leave. The evidence, however, was conflicting whether he had asked for two or three days off. The Trial Examiner found that Gaines had actually requested a three-day l\u00e9ave; the Board found it unnecessary to resolve the question. The Trial Examiner\u2019s finding is supported by the evidence, at least to the extent that the Company supervisors themselves were unsure as to the length of the leave which Gaines had requested. Although Gregg, his supervisor, testified that Gaines had asked for a two-day leave and that he had written a leave-of-absence notice for such a period that same day, the testimony shows that on the following Monday, when Gaines had been gone only one work-day, Gregg asked Gaines\u2019s substitute, Reynolds, how long he was going to fill in for Gaines. Moreover, on Tuesday night, when Gaines would have been expected back had his leave been for only two days, Reynolds \u201cwas told to stay a few minutes and see if [Gaines] did come in.\u201d This evidence would indicate that there was at least some doubt in the minds of Gaines\u2019s immediate superiors as to the duration of Gaines\u2019s leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">There is testimony that the decision to fire Gaines was arrived at the day before the dispute took place between Gaines and Gregg. Another employee testified that the day before Gaines was discharged, Brooks, a foreman, asked him if he would \u201cbe interested in a hyster [fork lift] job\u201d for the third shift because they were \u201cgoing to fire a boy\u201d for \u201ctalking too much.\u201d Gaines at that time was the hyster operator on the third shift. Moreover, Gregg told Gaines during their quarrel that he had been dismissed the previous day. This interpretation of the evidence, which both the Board and the Trial Examiner apparently accepted, is strengthened by the fact that Gaines\u2019s timecard had already been removed when he reported back for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Gaines\u2019s insubordination is only the last of four explanations the Company gave at different times for Gaines\u2019s discharge. Supervisor Brooks told an employee that Gaines was going to be fired for \u201ctalking too much\u201d; Gaines\u2019s separation notice stated that he was discharged because he over-stayed his leave and because of \u201chis past record\u201d; finally, the Company took the position that Gaines was really dismissed because of his insubordination and use of abusive language on Gregg. When an employer shifts position several times in explaining why an employee has been fired, his own case is weakened, and the Board\u2019s conclusion that the true reason was for union activity is correspondingly strengthened. See N. L. R. B. v. International Furniture Co., 5th Cir.1952, 199 F.2d 648. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The evidence of the Georgia Rug Mill\u2019s general anti-union activity stands almost undisputed in the record. Although \u201ca general bias or a general hostility and interference, whether proved or conceded, does not supply the element of purpose,\u201d which must be established with respect to each discharge, \u201canti-union bias and demonstrated unlawful hostility are proper and highly significant factors for Board evaluation in determining motive.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Dan River Mills, Inc., 5th Cir.1960, 274 F.2d 381, 384. There is support for the finding that the Company\u2019s anti-union policy was directed against George Gaines specifically. When Brooks offered Gaines\u2019s job to another employee, he stated that Gaines had \u201cbeen talking too much.\u201d Several weeks later, Brooks, in threatening an employee that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t expect to get a job in that county,\u201d if he were \u201cfired on account of the union,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>used Gaines as an example. When asked if it were not \u201cagainst the law to fire people on account of the union,\u201d Brooks retorted, \u201cYes. But you don\u2019t have to put that on the papers. Look what happened to Walt Hughes, Chester Bridges and George Gaines. The law hasn\u2019t helped them any so far. * * * All they can do is file unfair labor charges.\u201d It is also noteworthy that Gregg, in his altercation with Gaines, accused him of \u201cworking for the union.\u201d These statements, reinforced by Gaines\u2019s open and active promotion of the union, clearly establish an \u201cunlawful motive\u201d on the part of the Rug Mill for Gaines\u2019s dismissal, and the employer\u2019s explanation is not \u201cso overwhelming\u201d as to make the controverting evidence \u201cunacceptable as a matter of law.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Jackson Tile Mfg. Co., 5th Cir.1960, 282 F.2d 90, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Labor Board\u2019s finding that George Gaines\u2019s union activity was the real cause of his dismissal is clearly supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">It is much less clear that Walter Hughes was dismissed because of union activity. Since 1958 Georgia Rug Mill has had a policy of dismissing any employee whose wages are garnished twice within three months. The policy permits exceptions in special extenuating circumstances. The policy is reasonable: A company has an unassailable right to avoid, if it can, harassment by creditors of its employees and the inconvenience and cost of making an appearance in court. The Company\u2019s experience with Hughes illustrates why this rule was established. As far back as early in 1958, the Company began to receive dunning letters from his creditors. On January 13, 1960, the Company received its first garnishment of Hughes\u2019s wages. At that time Dunson, the personnel manager, warned Hughes of the three-month rule and told him \u201cto look after his own credit,\u201d because the Company had been receiving complaints from other creditors in addition to the gar-nishor. The complaints continued for the next three months. Dunson testified that he was pestered by telephone calls from creditors asking him to get Hughes, to pay his debts. Written complaints also continued to flow in. Two months after the garnishment the Company received another letter from Montgomery-Ward, which had been writing to the Rug Mill since December, 1958, in an effort to collect on a debt Hughes owed. April 6, the Company received a notice from C &amp; S Jewelers, threatening a garnishment. The next day another company, the Rome Hardware Store, instituted a garnishment action. About this same time, still another creditor advised the Rug Company that it was contemplating instituting a garnishment action. Dunson, upon receiving the second garnishment, conferred with Roberts, the production manager. After reviewing the history of Hughes\u2019s bad credit relations, Roberts ordered Hughes dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Whatever the National Labor Relations Board or this Court may think of the wisdom of the Company\u2019s rule as to excessive garnishments,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\u201cmanagement is for management. Neither Board nor Court can second-guess it or give it gentle guidance by over-the-shoulder supervision. Management can discharge for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all. It has, as the master of its own business affairs, complete freedom with but one specific,, definite qualification: it may not discharge when the real motivating purpose is to do that which Section 8(a) (3) forbids.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. McGahey, 233 F.2d 406, 413 (5th Cir.1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Unless, therefore, the rule was discrim-inatorily applied to Hughes because of the Company\u2019s anti-union bias, he cannot be ordered reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">The Board insists that two factors point clearly to discrimination. First* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the rule was not rigidly enforced, the past, if there were extenuating circumstances, the employee was not dismissed; and Dunson admittedly made no effort to discuss Hughes\u2019s financial plight before firing him. But to Dunson, already exasperated by the number and perseverance of Hughes\u2019s creditors, the final batch of threats of garnishment was enough. There was no indication whatsoever of any extenuating circumstances or personal hardship in Hughes\u2019s situation; one complaining creditor was a jewelry store, and the second garnishment involved a debt which Hughes had contracted in connection with a private business he had operated. Proof that a rule is flexible is not tantamount to a showing of discrimination, if there is reason for its strict application. To Dun-son\u2019s personal knowledge, at least three other employees had been dismissed because of excessive garnishments. Thus Hughes was not alone in feeling the brunt of the company policy. In</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">Second, the Board urges that its finding of discrimination against Hughes is supported, not only by circumstantial evidence, but by direct proof in the form of statements by his supervisors. Hughes testified that \u201ca couple of months\u201d before he was dismissed, he complained to his supervisor, Petitt, that he was not receiving his share of overtime work, and Petitt had replied that Hughes was \u201cworking against the company,\u201d and \u201cworking with these union boys.\u201d Another employee, Sentell, testified that Brooks, another supervisor, had said that Walter Hughes, Chester Bridges, and George Gaines had been fired for union activity. Sentell then asked Brooks if Hughes had not been dismissed because of excessive garnishments and if other employees had not been garnished. Brooks replied that they had, but that the Company \u201ctried to take care of people that wanted to do right and were on the right side of the fence.\u201d Brooks, however, was not Hughes\u2019s supervisor. The Board has agreed with the finding of the Trial Examiner that Chester Bridges, also mentioned by Brooks as being discharged for union activity, was actually fired for incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The most telling factor against the Board\u2019s interpretation, however, is the chronology involved in the Hughes incident. Hughes\u2019s record of union activity, unlike that of Gaines, is very slim. Although Hughes apparently had always \u201cbelieved in\u201d the union, he took no part in any union activity until a union meeting on January 24. Hughes was warned about his garnishment no later than January 15 and told <em>then </em>that if he received another one within three months, he would be discharged. All of this took place prior to Hughes\u2019s participation in the union and before anything was said that could be construed as a threat about his union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> The Trial Examiner, crediting Dunson\u2019s statement that \u201cif a person gets two garnishments within a period of three months, then that is an automatic discharge\u201d and relying upon Hughes\u2019s very bad credit standing, found that Hughes\u2019s dismissal because of union activity had not been established by a preponderance of the evidence. \u201cThis conflict [between the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding and that of the Board] does not change the criterion we must follow in reviewing the decision of the Board.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Dell, 5th Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 733, 735. But the Examiner\u2019s findings must be considered along with the record as a whole in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Labor Board\u2019s decision. As the Supreme Court recently reiterated in N. L. R. B. v. Walton Manufacturing Co., 1962, 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 855, 7 L.Ed.2d 829,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">\u201cthe Examiner \u2014 the one whose appraisal of the testimony was discredited by the Court of Appeals in Florida Citrus Canners Cooper\u00e1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tive case [N. L. R. B. v. Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative, 5 Cir., 288 F.2d 630] \u2014 sees the witnesses and hears them testify, while the Board and the reviewing court look only at cold records. As we said in the Universal Camera case: &lt; * <em>* </em>* The findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.\u2019 340 U.S., at 496 [71 S.Ct. at 469], For the demeanor of a witness \u2018 * * * may satisfy the tribunal, not only that the witness\u2019 testimony is not true, but that the truth is the opposite of his story; for the denial of one, who has a motive to deny, may be uttered with such- hesitation discomfort, arrogance or defiance, as to give assurance that he is fabricating, and that, if he is, there is no alternative but to assume the truth of what he denies.\u2019 Dyer v. MacDougall [2 Cir.], 201 F.2d 265, 269.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">This, then, is a case in which the Trial Examiner\u2019s report should be given significance; for, as the Trial Examiner recognized, it \u201cpresents for the most part, if not entirely, a pure credibility problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Taking into consideration the evidence in the record as a whole, both that supporting the Board\u2019s decision and that contradicting it or from which conflicting inferences can be drawn, we find that there is not substantial evidence warranting the Board\u2019s finding that participation in union activity was the reason for Hughes\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The Board\u2019s cease-and-desist order and its order for the reinstatement of Gaines with back pay will be enforced. Enforcement of the order as to Hughes is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
