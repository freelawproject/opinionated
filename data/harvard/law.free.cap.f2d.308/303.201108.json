His indictment and trial followed a \u201cwaiver of jurisdiction\u201d by the Juvenile Court in which the judge of that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">\u201cBy the authority vested in me under Section 13 of the Juvenile Court Act of the District of Columbia of June 1, 1938, 52 Stat. 559, Ch. 309, as amended, and after full investigation, I do hereby waive jurisdiction over the following offense, which would amount to a felony if committed by an adult, charged against Jerry Lee Green, born January 23, 1944, of 918 M Street, N.W. Apt. 43, in the District of Columbia,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201c(a) Robbery (Armed-Holdup): Date of offense \u2014 on or about December 23, 1960, in the vicinity of 401 Vee Street, N.W. Complainant : Henry Albert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201c(b) And/or any other offenses, arising out of the acts or transactions set forth in (a) above, and I do hereby order said child held for trial for such offense under the regular procedure of the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">At trial, this statement was offered in evidence by the prosecution. Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel did not object. The court then suggested that the prosecution read the waiver to the jury. It specifically asked defense counsel if he objected, and he said no. After the reading, the court told the jury that \u201cthis was simply a waiver of jurisdiction by the Juvenile Court.\u201d Finally, after the jury entered upon its deliberation, it requested the exhibits in the case which consisted of a written statement which appellant gave the police and the Juvenile Court\u2019s waiver. Defense counsel stated he had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The District Court granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis and we appointed new counsel to prosecute the appeal. He urges, <em>inter alia, </em>that the utilization of the waiver was plain error affecting substantial rights. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The Juvenile Court\u2019s waiver of jurisdiction, whatever else it is, is also a judicial finding of probable cause to believe the accused guilty. Among the factors considered by the Juvenile Court in deciding whether to waive jurisdiction is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">4. The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i. e., whether there is evidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictment (to be determined by consultation with the United States Attorney).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB2\">To receive this waiver in evidence is like receiving in evidence the finding of a magistrate in a proceeding under Rule 5, Fed.R.Crim.P., that there is probable cause to believe the defendant guilty of the crime charged against him. There is danger that the jury, in both instances, would draw the inference that a judicial officer has already concluded that the accused is guilty (or at least probably guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">The Government urges that \u201cany uncertainty the jury might have about the significance of the waiver\u201d was counteracted by the court\u2019s statement to the jury that it was \u201csimply a waiver of jurisdiction.\u201d On the contrary, we think this highlighted the inference that the accused was such a \u201cbad actor\u201d that the Juvenile Court should not handle him. Nor can we agree with the Government\u2019s characterization of the trial judge\u2019s only other reference to the waiver as \u201cmatter-of-fact and non-prejudicial.\u201d The reference in question was: \u201cThe only waiver in the case is as to the defendant Green.\u201d Throughout the testimony the five alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ed participants in the robbery<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are referred to as \u201cboys.\u201d The jury, therefore, could well have believed that at least some of the five were, like appellant, juveniles. In that light, the judge\u2019s statement that the Juvenile Court waived only as to appellant intensifies the prejudicial effect of the evidence of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The jury, of course, did not state its purpose in requesting that the waiver be sent into the jury room. This purpose would be difficult to fathom except in terms of an interest in the Juvenile Court\u2019s reasons for waiving jurisdiction. The compliance with that request, considered in the circumstances under which the waiver was admitted in evidence in the first place, deprived appellant of a fair trial. The conviction must be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant also argues that his conviction should be reversed for lack of jurisdiction for the reason that the Juvenile Court\u2019s waiver to the District Court was invalid. The alleged invalidity is that the Juvenile Court failed to order the filing of a petition, to be followed by issuance and service of a summons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That procedure is said to be indispensable to the Juvenile Court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction which, in turn, is said to be indispensable to a waiver. We cannot accept this argument of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The jurisdictional interrelation of the Juvenile Court and District Court is a creature of the Juvenile Court Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 11-901 et seq. (1961). The purpose and general structure of that statute have been repeatedly explained m our opinions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For present purposes, it is enough to say that the waiver of Juvenile Court jurisdiction, upon which District Court jurisdiction attaches, depends upon a \u201cfull investigation\u201d by the Juvenile Court. The petition-summons procedure is required only when the director of social work of the Juvenile Court, after investigation, finds that Juvenile Court jurisdiction \u201cshould be acquired.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 11-908 (1961). Nothing in the statutory scheme requires the useless gesture of filing a petition and issuing a summons when the finding of the director and his recommendation to the Juvenile Court judge is that jurisdiction be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">What is required before a waiver is, as we have said, \u201cfull investigation.\u201d Such \u201cfull investigation,\u201d as we view it, is far more meaningful than the petition-summons procedure. It prevents the waiver of jurisdiction as a matter of routine for the purpose of easing the docket. It prevents routine waiver in certain classes of alleged crimes. It requires a judgment in each case based on \u201can inquiry not only into the facts of the alleged offense but also into the question whether the <em>parens patriae </em>plan of procedure is desirable and proper in the particular case.\u201d Pee v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 47, 50, 274 F.2d 556, 559 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\"> Except for appellant\u2019s representation that the petition-summons procedure was not followed in the Juvenile Court, the record before us is silent as to what transpired in that court. If it is appellant\u2019s contention that the Juvenile Court failed to make the \u201cfull investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>gation\u201d required by the statute, he is free to make that contention to the District Court upon our remand. That court, upon sufficient allegations, should conduct such proceedings as may be necessary to determine whether \u201cfull investigation\u201d was made by the Juvenile Court and, if so, whether appellant should nevertheless be afforded the <em>parens patriae </em>treatment provided in the Juvenile Court Act. See United States v. Anonymous, 176 F.Supp. 325 (D.D.C. 1959). In view of appellant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to obtain access to the records of the Juvenile Court, we deem it proper to point out that the District Court, if it adopts the procedure utilized in United States v. Anonymous, supra, should make available for inspection by appellant\u2019s counsel all pertinent records of the Juvenile Court, with due regard to the necessity of keeping secret any specific parts or sources thereof. These records may be sealed and included in the record on any further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-15\">.

Green and another were tried together, a third pled guilty, and the indictment against the fourth was dismissed. The record does not indicate the disposition of the charges against the fifth alleged participant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">. The arguments in the briefs concerning the admission of various inculpatory statements by the appellant center largely around the applicability of our decision in Harling v. United States, 111 U.S. App.D.C. 174, 295 F.2d 161 (1961). Since that decision will be applicable in any new trial, we need not now discuss the arguments. Nor need we consider other alleged errors which are not likely to occur in the new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-18\">.

United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 47, 274 F.2d 556 (1959); Shioutakon v. District of Columbia, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 236 F.2d 666 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b370-5\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqK\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">I concur in remanding for a new trial acting under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim. P., because the terms and language of the Waiver Order are such that there is grave risk of undue prejudice to appellant. Its recital that the Juvenile Judge acted \u201cafter full investigation\u201d carries with it an implication that appellant\u2019s case was so serious and his crime so grave that a \u201cyouth court\u201d could not adequately deal with him. However we as judges might view the form and language of the waiver, we cannot escape the possibility, if not probability, that jurors would attach an inordinate weight to what appears to be a \u201cfinding\u201d by the Juvenile Judge \u2014 a judicial officer experienced and skilled, as they would reasonably think, in making appraisals of juveniles. The fact that the jury called for the document after its <em>legal </em>effect had been fully and correctly explained by the District Judge, suggests a strong possibility that they wanted it for some purpose relating to their evaluation of the <em>facts </em>of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">As to the second phase of the remand I think we must leave it within the sound judicial discretion of the District Court to determine whether appellant\u2019s allegations, as now made or hereafter amended, are legally sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity in the proceedings which led to the Juvenile Court\u2019s finding \u201cafter full investigation\u201d that his jurisdiction should be waived. There is nothing which now appears to cast doubt on the adequacy of the \u201cfull investigation\u201d which the Juvenile Judge states he made.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">In United States v. Anonymous, 176 F.Supp. 325 (D.D.C.1959), Judge Young-dahl exercised undoubted power to hear a \u201cwaived\u201d case sitting, for all practical purposes, as a Juvenile Court and using the same powers. In so doing it was appropriate for him, since he was no longer treating the accused as an adult, to have before him all records available to the Juvenile Judge. This is indicated further by his action in sealing the records in the case and maintaining anonymity of the accused youth as would be done in Juvenile Court but not in the District Court in an adult criminal case. In the case now before us the District Judge acted on the waiver and treated appellant as an adult offender. Hence the procedure followed by Judge Young-dahl in United States v. Anonymous, supra, is not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">I read the opinion of the court as meaning that a District Judge treating with a defendant whose case has been waived by the Juvenile Court may properly (a) examine Juvenile Court records <em>in camera, </em>(b) make available to defense counsel such parts of the Juvenile Court records which under the statutes and Juvenile Court Rules may be viewed by counsel but without access to portions as to which the District Judge considers secrecy should be preserved, specifically the sources of information supplied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the Juvenile Court in confidence. However, our holding does not relate to a case where, as in United States v. Anonymous, supra, the District Judge exercised his power to fulfill the functions as a Juvenile Judge. When the District Judge is so acting, the records are available to the \u201caccused\u201d juvenile only to the extent they would be available to him in the Juvenile Court and no more.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
