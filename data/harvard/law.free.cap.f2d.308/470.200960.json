In the De- \u25a0 Falco case appellant further urges that the trial court erred by not including in its Findings of Fact a finding that the alleged bookmaker was engaged in bookmaking on the date alleged in the libel and in finding that on said date the respondent motor vehicle was not used in any way by him or anyone else for the purpose of accepting wagers or to aid and abet him in the business of bookmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">In the Bride case the appellee Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, as legal owner of the automobile under a conditional sales contract with the registered owner as purchaser, has presented questions of whether or not the automobile is subject to forfeiture if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>unlawfully used for the purpose of wagering by a person who did not have consent or permission to so use the vehicle, but had wrongfully used it beyond the limited consent given by the innocent owner; and whether or not the innocence of the owner is a good defense to forfeiture for wagering under Sec. 7302.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As these cases involve different factual situations and different questions presented on appeal, except for the issue of knowledge of an innocent owner as a defense to forfeiture, they will be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>The Audrey Bride Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In this case the libel was filed against a 1960 Cadillac automobile, charging that it had been used by one Jerry Lisner as an aid to him in engaging in the business of wagering without filing application for a wagering permit and without paying the wagering occupational tax, in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412. Appellee\u2019s answer to the libel and claim for return alleged that she was the registered owner of the automobile and had no knowledge of the reasons why it had been seized. The case came on for trial before the District Court, sitting without a jury. The undisputed facts were that Jerry Lisner had never paid the occupational tax nor registered his occupation as a wagerer as required by the statute; that he had been engaged in bookmaking, in that bettors were placing wagers with him and he was accepting them; that special agents of the Internal Revenue Service found an \u201cowe sheet\u201d \u2014 a record maintained by a professional bookmaker \u2014in Lisner\u2019s apartment; that Lisner used the automobile to drive to meet his bettors and make pay-offs to them or collect money which they owed him; that his wife, appellee, was the registered owner of the automobile, and the appellee bank the legal owner. The claim of the wife that the car was purchased with her own funds received by gift, that she thought her husband was a bartender and salesman and did not know that he was engaged in bookmaking, and that while she had given him permission to use the automobile, she had never given him permission to use it in bookmaking activities, was likewise not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">At the conclusion of the trial the court found in favor of the appellee, holding that the automobile was the separate property of the wife, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cWhile it is true that the evidence does show that on certain occasions he has used [the automobile], I find that she did not know of it and did not allow him to use the automobile for that purpose,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">and ordered that judgment will therefore be that plaintiff take nothing by the libel, and the Government return the automobile to appellee. This was the sole basis, of the court\u2019s decision. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment were: entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">\n<em>The Madeline DeFaleo Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A67\">In this case the libel charged that a 1960 Chevrolet automobile had been used! by Dominick DeFaleo as an aid to him in engaging in the business of wagering without filing an application for a wagering permit and without paying the occupational tax. Appellee Madeline DeFal-co\u2019s answer to the libel and claim for return likewise alleged that she was the-registered owner of the automobile and. had no knowledge of the reasons why it. was seized. The case came on for trial' before the District Court, sitting without, a jury.'</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">It was proven at the trial that Dominick DeFaleo had not paid a wagering-occupational tax nor registered as a wagerer with the Internal Revenue; and\u2019 that he had been convicted, subsequent to his arrest at the time of seizure of the automobile, in the State Superior-Court, of bookmaking, in violation of the-California Penal Code. However, the-only proof adduced as to the use by hint of the Chevrolet automobile for such purpose was that the residence occupied by the DeFalcos, husband and wife, had been kept under surveillance by deputy sheriffs, of Los Angeles County, who had seen DeFaleo leave the house and return to-it in the automobile, park it in the garage, and enter the house; that upon entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the premises they found bookmaking paraphernalia in the possession of DeFalco in a rear bedroom; that the automobile was searched with DeFalco\u2019s permission, \u25a0and that on the floor mat at the edge of the front seat on the driver\u2019s side the \u2022officers found a torn betting marker, in the trunk a package of football quiz cards, used by professional bookmakers in wagering on football games, and on the floor mat a National Daily Reporter; and that his handwriting on an exemplar card was the same as on the betting markers found in the house and the material found in the automobile. There was also proof that the automobile had been sold to Dominick and Madeline DeFalco under conditional sales contract financed by the Bank of America, but that Madeline De-Falco was the registered owner, who testified that she had no knowledge of her husband\u2019s bookmaking activities, that the automobile was in fact her own, that she had given permission to her husband to use it, but not for any bookmaking activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">At the conclusion of the trial the court \u2022observed that the Government had not produced bettors who testified to the fact that bets were collected and paid off by a person driving the automobile in question (as in the Bride case), held that the automobile was the separate property of the wife by reason of a presumption under the community property law where the husband bought the automobile for her, that appellee did not have knowledge of the bookmaking activities, and ordered judgment for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Government lodged Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to the effect that the respondent automobile was being used by Dominick DeFalco in connection with and in furtherance of bookmaking activity, but that Madeline DeFalco did not know that her husband was engaged in such activities, or was using the automobile in connection with such, and was not forfeit for this reason. The trial judge, however, rejected these proposed Findings and Conclusions, and entered instead an express finding that the automobile was not used in any way by Dominick DeFalco for the purpose of accepting wagers, making collection or pay-offs, or to aid and abet him in the business of bookmaking, \u2014 in addition to a finding that claimant Madeline DeFalco did not have any knowledge of such activity, and that the automobile was her separate property, \u2014 and concluded that for these reasons the automobile was not subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">An automobile used in violation of the internal revenue laws to transport the law violator and his gambling records in the prescribed activity, such as bookmaking or wagering, is forfeit. This use does not consist of merely using the automobile to commute to the site of illegal business operations. The burden is upon the Government of proving facts justifying forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. D\u2019Agostino v. United States, (C.A. 9) 261 F.2d 154; United States v. Lane Motor Co., 344 U.S. 630, 73 S.Ct. 459, 97 L.Ed. 622; Nocita v. United States, (C.A. 9) 258 F.2d 199; United States v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., (C.A. 5) 239 F.2d 102; United States v. One 1953 Oldsmobile Sedan, (W.D.Ark.1955) 132 F.Supp. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\"> It is well settled that in a proceeding for forfeiture against a motor vehicle for violation of the internal revenue laws the innocence of the registered owner-claimant is no defense, as the proceeding is in rem against the vehicle. United States v. One 1958 Pontiac Coupe, (C.A. 7, 1962) 298 F.2d 421; United States v. Addison, (C.A. 5, 1958) 260 F.2d 908; United States v. One 1957 Oldsmobile Automobile, (C.A. 5, 1958) 256 F.2d 931; United States v. One (1) Oldsmobile Sedan, (E.D.La.1948) 75 F.Supp. 83; United States v. One 1951 Oldsmobile Sedan (E.D.Pa.1955) 135 F.Supp. 873; United States v. Plymouth Coupe, (W.D.Pa.1950) 88 F.Supp. 93; United States v. One 1948 Cadillac Convertible Coupe, (D.C.N.J.) 115 F.Supp. 723. It is held in these cases that in order to relieve the owner from forfeiture where the vehicle was be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ing used without the knowledge or consent of the owner it must be shown that the person so using it had obtained the vehicle in violation of the criminal laws, which question is not involved in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The same principle applies to a claim by the legal owner under a conditional sale or chattel mortgage, that is, that the innocence of such legal owner is no defense to the forfeiture. Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505, 41 S.Ct. 189, 191, 65 L.Ed. 376; United States v. Andrade, (C.A. 9, 1950) 181 F.2d 42; United States v. One 1940 Packard Coupe, (D.C.Mass. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 788; United States v. One 1955 Ford Convertible, (E.D.Pa. 1956) 137 F.Supp. 830. As stated by the Supreme Court in the Goldsmith case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cIt is the illegal use that is the material consideration * * * which works the forfeiture, the guilt or innocence of its owner being accidental. * * * It is a \u2018thing\u2019 that can be used [in the violation claimed] * * * and the law is explicit in its condemnation of such things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In cases for violation of the internal revenue laws the district court is without jurisdiction to remit or mitigate such forfeiture except as provided by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3617 for violation of the internal revenue laws relating to liquor. United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 DeLuxe Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 59 S.Ct. 861, 83 L.Ed. 1249; United States v. One 1941 Plymouth Tudor Sedan, (C.A. 10, 1946) 153 F.2d 19; United States v. One 1958 Pontiac Coupe, supra; United States v. Heckinger, (C.A. 2, 1947) 163 F.2d 472; United States v. One 1946 Plymouth Sedan, (E.D.N.Y.1946) 73 F.Supp. 88; United States v. 1-1941 Ford 2 Ton Truck, (W.D.Mo.1951) 95 F.Supp. 214; United States v. One 1941 Chrysler Brougham Sedan, (E.D.Mich.1947) 74 F.Supp. 970; United States v. One 1953 Oldsmobile Sedan, (W.D.Ark.) 132 F. Supp. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">In view of these settled principles of law we conclude that the District Court erred in denying forfeiture in the Audrey Bride case. The automobile in this case was subject to forfeiture if, as the court found, it was used in aid of the illegal activity of wagering and was not in the unlawful possession of the violator. The court had no alternative under these circumstances but to declare a forfeiture, and was without authority to remit or mitigate such.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">A different situation appears in the DeFalco case for the reason that the court found that the Government had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the automobile in question had been used in the aid of bookmaking and is therefore not forfeit. The record supports this finding, which may not be set aside upon appeal unless' clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Reversed as to the Audrey Bride case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Affirmed as to the DeFalco case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">.
