It is true, as the trial examiner noted in his intermediate report, that in this case there is more than the usual contradiction of witnesses for one side by witnesses for the other, that witnesses on the same side sometimes contradicted one another and on occasion even themselves, and also perhaps, to quote the trial examiner: \u201c * * * more than one witness on one side or the other deliberately gave false testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">But questions of the credibility of witnesses are for the Board, subject to judicial review only when it oversteps the bounds of reason. That is to say, we can set aside the Board\u2019s findings of credibility only when it is evident that it has fallen into a clear mistake. We do not find that situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Giving the trial examiner\u2019s findings the \u201c * * * weight [that] in reason and in the light of judicial experience they deserve,\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 496 (1951), 71 S.Ct. 456, 469, 95 L.Ed. 456, and respecting the Board\u2019s experience and skill, we cannot say that clear error appears in its resolution of questions of credibility. On the contrary, it seems to us that the Board and the trial examiner steered an entirely rational course through unusually confused and conflicting testimony. Substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">We also agree with the Board\u2019s rejection of the respondent\u2019s contention that the trial examiner was guilty of bias and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
