Kezer, the secretary of the state, and the A Connecticut Party (ACP), unlawfully failed to recognize the named plaintiff, Mark Nielsen, a candidate for the state senate in the November 8, 1994 general election, as the ACP\u2019s endorsed candidate from the twenty-fourth senatorial district. Nielsen and the plaintiff Charles Hamad, the sole delegate at the ACP\u2019s twenty-fourth senatorial district convention, brought this action after Kezer refused to certify Nielsen as the ACP\u2019s endorsed candidate based upon the ACP\u2019s determination that Hamad\u2019s purported endorsement of Nielsen was invalid. The plaintiffs, claiming that the defendants\u2019 actions violated their rights under the federal constitution and state election laws, sought an order of mandamus against Kezer and, in the alternative, an injunction against the ACP, directing them to recognize Nielsen as the endorsed candidate of the ACP.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The trial court denied the relief requested by the plaintiffs and rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and, on the motion of the plaintiffs, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4024.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The record reveals the following facts. On July 23, 1994, the ACP held a convention for the purpose of endorsing a state senate candidate from the twenty-fourth senatorial district. Under ACP rules adopted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-382,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> each of the three towns located in that district, namely, Bethel, New Fairfield and Danbury, was entitled to select one delegate to the convention, plus one additional delegate for every ten enrolled party members in the town.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Hamad was the only ACP member in the twenty-fourth senatorial district to file the petition necessary to become a convention delegate, however;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see General Statutes \u00a7 9-407;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he was the convention\u2019s sole delegate, as well as its chairperson.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Two candidates for the state senate from the twenty-fourth district sought the recommendation of the ACP\u2019s executive committee: Nielsen, the nominee of the Republican Party and the Independent Party, and Christopher Setaro, the nominee of the Democratic Party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The executive committee recommended Setaro, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>whose nomination, under ACP rules, was thereby considered duly made and seconded upon the convening of the convention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the convention, however, Hamad nominated Nielsen, and purported to endorse him. Thereafter, Hamad and Nielsen filed a certificate of party endorsement with the secretary of the state in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 9-388.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">On July 29, 1994, Setaro submitted his formal protest of Hamad\u2019s purported endorsement of Nielsen to the ACP executive committee. Specifically, Setaro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>claimed that the endorsement was invalid because Nielsen\u2019s nomination had not received a second as required by ACP rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 9-387<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and ACP rules,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the executive committee met on August 2,1994, to resolve the dispute concerning Hamad\u2019s purported endorsement of Nielsen. By unanimous vote, the committee sustained Setaro\u2019s challenge and declared the purported endorsement of Nielsen invalid on the ground that it had not been seconded in accordance with the rules of the party. Accordingly, by letter dated August 2, 1994, Diane S. Blick, the ACP state chairperson, notified Kezer that the ACP \u201cmade no endorsement for the office of State Senator in the twenty-fourth Senatorial District.\u201d Kezer thereupon informed Nielsen that, in view of the ACP\u2019s resolution of the dispute, his name would not appear on the ballot as the ACP\u2019s endorsed candidate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The plaintiffs then commenced this action, alleging that Nielsen had been unlawfully deprived of his right to appear on the ballot as the ACP\u2019s endorsed candidate, and that Hamad had been improperly denied his right as a convention delegate to endorse the candidate of his choice. The plaintiffs sought an order of man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>damus compelling Kezer to place Nielsen\u2019s name on the ballot as the ACP candidate and, in the alternative, an injunction directing the ACP to withdraw its August 2, 1994 letter to Kezer informing her that the party had not endorsed a candidate from the twenty-fourth senatorial district. The ACP filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint because the issues raised therein were nonjusticiable political questions. After a hearing, the trial court denied the ACP\u2019s motion to dismiss, but rendered judgment for the defendants, concluding that their refusal to recognize Nielsen as the ACP endorsed candidate did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that: (1) Kezer improperly deferred to the ACP\u2019s incorrect resolution of the dispute; (2) the defendants\u2019 refusal to recognize Nielsen as the ACP endorsed candidate violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>selection of candidates by local delegates; and (3) the defendants\u2019 actions deprived Hamad of his federal constitutional right to vote for the candidate of his choice. ACP contends that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and, accordingly, that the court should have dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>trial court that although it had subject matter jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the defendants\u2019 actions violated their rights under either the United States constitution or the state election laws. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We first consider the defendants\u2019 contention that the trial court should have dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action because it did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Specifically, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are nonjusticiable because they raise political questions the resolution of which is beyond the court\u2019s authority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">It is well settled that certain political questions cannot be resolved by judicial authority without violating the constitutional principle of separation of powers. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 210, 217, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Fonfara </em>v. <em>Reapportionment Commission, </em>222 Conn. 166, 184-85, 610 A.2d 153 (1992); <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 679-80, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984). As we have stated, the \u201ccharacterization of such issues as political is a convenient shorthand for declaring that some other branch of government has constitutional authority over the subject matter superior to that of the courts.\u201d <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 680. The fundamental characteristic of a political question, therefore, is that its adjudication would place the court in conflict with a coequal branch of government in violation of the primary authority of that coordinate branch. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 217. Whether a controversy so directly implicates the pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mary authority of the legislative or executive branch, such that a court is not the proper forum for its resolution, is a determination that must be made on a case-by-case inquiry. Id., 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In deciding whether an action is nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine, we are to be guided by \u201cseveral formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the [question] arise[s] .... Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question. Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question\u2019s presence.\u201d Id., 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional claim with the observation that the defendants do not contend that the executive or legislative branch had authority to resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 claims superior to that of the judicial branch. Rather, they argue that the trial court should have declined to adjudicate the plaintiffs\u2019 action in deference to the alleged decision-making autonomy of the ACP, a political party. Thus, the defendants have failed to demonstrate that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims implicate the core constitutional principle underlying the political question doctrine, namely, the separation of powers. We are doubtful, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that the political question doctrine was intended to apply in such circumstances. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>409 U.S. 1, 11-12, 92 S. Ct. 2718, 34 L. Ed. 2d 1 (Marshall, J., dissenting), vacated as moot, 409 U.S. 816, 93 S. Ct. 67, 34 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Moreover, none of the considerations set forth in <em>Baker </em>are present in this case. First, the plaintiffs have identified no constitutional provision committing the resolution of Nielsen\u2019s disputed endorsement to a legislative or executive branch agency. Indeed, in the absence of such a provision, the legislature was free to grant to political parties broad authority to resolve such disputes. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-382 and 9-387.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims present no special obstacles to judicial ascertainment and application of appropriate standards for resolving them, and adjudication of the claims does not require judicial policy-making properly left to another branch of government. On the contrary, the controversy raises issues of constitutional and statutory interpretation of the kind regularly entertained by courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Finally, the defendants\u2019 nonjusticiability claim derives no support from the three prudential considerations enumerated in <em>Baker.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Judicial resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims may readily be accomplished \u201cwithout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government . . . .\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 369 U.S. 217. Although political parties have wide leeway to select candidates for endorsement, both as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>matter of constitutional law; see part IV of this opinion; and under state statutes; see part II of this opinion; there is no indication that the legislature sought to exclude courts completely from the adjudication of controversies relating to such matters.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Likewise, we are presented with no \u201cunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made . . . .\u201d Id. Although a court must afford great deference to a party\u2019s decision to endorse, or not to endorse, a particular candidate, if the party\u2019s determination is clearly contrary to law blind acceptance of its decision is not appropriate. Lastly, judicial review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims does not risk \u201cmultifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question\u201d; id.; because no executive or legislative branch agency has plenary authority to consider such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We are not persuaded, therefore, that the plaintiffs\u2019 action raises a nonjusticiable political question. Because the trial court properly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we now turn to their merits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that in the absence of proof by the plaintiffs that the ACP\u2019s resolution of the dispute was either illegal or irrational, Kezer\u2019s acquiescence in the ACP\u2019s resolution of the endorsement dispute was proper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ACP rules promulgated pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 9-382 and 9-387 expressly provide that the ACP executive committee shall resolve any dispute as to the endorsement of candidates. See footnote 12. Accordingly, upon receiving Setaro\u2019s complaint, the executive committee met to discuss the complaint, concluding unanimously that Nielsen\u2019s endorsement was invalid because his nomination had not been seconded as required by ACP rules. The plaintiffs contend that the ACP rules did not require Nielsen\u2019s nomination to have received a seconding motion, and, therefore, that the defendants\u2019 failure to recognize Nielsen as the ACP endorsed candidate was improper.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We first consider the proper scope of the trial court\u2019s review of the executive committee\u2019s decision to invalidate the purported endorsement. Political parties generally are free to conduct their internal affairs free from judicial supervision. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 409 U.S. 4-5; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>120 R.I. 579, 582-83, 388 A.2d 1176 (1978). This common law principle of judicial restraint, rooted in the constitutionally protected right of free association,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> serves the public interest by allowing the political processes to operate without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>undue interference. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 4-5. Because the nomination and endorsement of candidates for elective office are among the primary functions of political parties, \u201c[judicial intervention in [the selection of convention delegates] traditionally has been approached with great caution and restraint.\u201d Id., 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Consistent with the historical autonomy of political parties, \u00a7\u00a7 9-382 and 9-387 vested in the ACP broad discretion to select candidates and to resolve disputes as to endorsements in the manner prescribed by ACP rules. In accordance with the procedure set forth in the ACP\u2019s rules to resolve endorsement disputes, the ACP executive committee met and determined that, under those rules, Nielsen\u2019s nomination required a seconding motion. Because the executive committee\u2019s interpretation of party rules was an integral part of the deliberative process by which the committee resolved the endorsement dispute, the committee was entitled to wide latitude in interpreting and applying those rules. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>supra, 120 R.I. 585; see also <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco Democratic Committee, </em>489 U.S. 214, 229-30, 109 S. Ct. 1013, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1989). In view of the narrowly circumscribed role of the judiciary in such matters, we agree with the trial court that the ACP\u2019s resolution of Setaro\u2019s challenge to Nielsen\u2019s endorsement must stand unless the defendants\u2019 actions were either demonstrably unlawful<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or patently irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">As the trial court observed, ACP rules are not explicit on the issue of whether the nominations of state sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ate candidates must be seconded. Indeed, chairperson Blick acknowledged that this issue had never before been raised.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Several provisions of the ACP rules, however, by virtue of their express reference to the seconding process, suggest that candidate nominations must receive a second. In particular, the ACP\u2019s state and district convention rules set forth the number of seconding speeches permitted for any one nomination, and the maximum length of time allowed for such speeches.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In addition, article I, \u00a7 5 (e), of the party\u2019s state rules provides that the executive committee may submit to nominating conventions \u201cthe nomination(s) of qualified candidates . . . which nominations shall be considered duly made and seconded upon the convening of such conventions. . . .\u201d See footnote 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Certain other ACP documents also indicate that the seconding of candidate nominations is required by ACP convention rules and procedures. For example, a July 23, 1994 memorandum from Blick to all ACP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>convention chairpersons concerning convention procedures refers to the seconding of nominations, and the ACP form used to record the minutes of the district convention directs the secretary of the convention to list the names of all persons \u201cnominated and seconded . . . for the purpose of selecting a party endorsed candidate\u201d for the office of state senate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no indication in any ACP document that a second is optional. Finally, the requirement of a seconding motion promotes the party\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring that its endorsement decisions reflect some degree of consensus among its membership. The trial court properly concluded, therefore, that the record supported the executive committee\u2019s interpretation of ACP rules.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Because the ACP was entitled to exercise broad discretion in resolving the question of whether Nielsen\u2019s nomination required a second, the trial court was not free to substitute its judgment for that of the party. Rather, the court was obliged to accept the party\u2019s rules interpretation unless that determination was irrational. Although the executive committee might plausibly have reached a contrary conclusion, we agree with the trial court that the committee\u2019s interpretation of the ACP rules and, accordingly, its resolution of the dispute was reasonable. Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Kezer improperly deferred to the ACP\u2019s resolution of the challenge to Hamad\u2019s purported endorsement of Nielsen is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the defendants\u2019 refusal to recognize Nielsen as the ACP\u2019s endorsed candidate violated \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407, which provide for the nomination of state senate candidates by local delegates. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the ACP requirement that candidate nominations be seconded effectively disfranchised Hamad in contravention of the scheme of local control established by \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Section 9-390 (g) authorizes major political parties to select convention delegates pursuant to the direct primary method, the procedure prescribed by ACP rules. Under that method of selecting delegates, party members residing in the senate district elect delegates to the party convention. Section 9-407 requires that the candidates for delegate shall also be party members from the senate district. Therefore, those selecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>convention delegates, and the delegate candidates themselves, must all reside in the local district.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The plaintiffs acknowledge that Hamad, a resident of the twenty-fourth senatorial district, was properly elected and duly seated as a convention delegate. By their terms, \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407 require no more. Failing to identify a violation of the letter of the law, however, the plaintiffs claim that the ACP\u2019s conduct violated the spirit of \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Although we agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 general proposition that these statutory provisions create a system of local control over the selection of delegates, we fail to see how the ACP rule that required Nielsen\u2019s nomination to have received a second is inconsistent with that principle. First, under ACP rules, only Hamad, the duly elected local delegate, was authorized to endorse a candidate. Although the party rules permitted the ACP executive committee to nominate Setaro, whose nomination was thereby deemed made and seconded upon the convening of the convention; see footnote 9; the committee, which concededly included members who did not reside in the twenty-fourth senatorial district, had no authority to make an endorsement. Second, there is no claim that the seconding requirement was imposed on the twenty-fourth senatorial district convention in a discriminatory manner, because party rules require seconding motions for candidate nominations at both single and multiple delegate conventions. Finally, the lone delegate to a single delegate convention is not bound to endorse the executive committee\u2019s nominee; instead, the delegate may choose not to make an endorsement. This candidate selection method does not remove the selection process from local control in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407. Instead, it prevents a single delegate from alone controlling the candidate endorsement decision. In so doing, the rule strikes a reasonable balance between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>party\u2019s right to empower a lone delegate by authorizing single delegate conventions, and its interest in ensuring that the party endorsement reflects some minimal party consensus. We conclude, therefore, that the defendants\u2019 refusal to recognize Nielsen\u2019s endorsement on the ground that Nielsen\u2019s nomination had not received a seconding motion did not violate \u00a7\u00a7 9-390 and 9-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the ACP rule requiring a second for the nomination of a candidate who has not been recommended by the executive committee violated Hamad\u2019s federal constitutional right<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to vote for the candidate of his choice.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">It has long been held that the right to vote is a \u201cfundamental political right, because preservative of all rights.\u201d <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S.

Ed. 2d 514 (1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Classic, </em>313 U.S. 299, 318, 61 S. Ct. 1031, 85 L. Ed. 1368 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Although not every step in the electoral process necessarily is entitled to constitutional protection, there is little question that the selection of convention delegates pursuant to \u00a7 9-407 is an integral part of our elective system. Hamad does not contend, however, that the ACP violated his right to seek election as an ACP delegate, nor does he allege that he was prevented from voting as a convention delegate. He claims, rather, that his election as a delegate carried with it the right to <em>endorse </em>the candidate of his choice, and that the ACP seconding requirement deprived him of that right. We do not abase Hamad\u2019s role in the candidate selection process by concluding that, whatever the precise parameters of his rights as a delegate, the constitution does not require as much, at least not where, as here, the party\u2019s regulation of the delegate\u2019s participation in the process is of uniform application and rooted in legitimate interests of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We are not persuaded that the rule requiring a second directly implicated any constitutionally protected right to vote that Hamad may have had as a convention delegate. Because one delegate conventions are not required by state law, the ACP was free to adopt a rule prohibiting a district convention in any district where one or more of the towns comprising the district were not represented by at least one delegate. Had the party chosen to promulgate such a rule, Hamad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>would have had no right whatever to participate in the candidate selection or endorsement process. Because the ACP empowered Hamad, as a single delegate, to vote at the convention, the party retained the right to determine the extent to which, if at all, Hamad could effect the ACP endorsement. Furthermore, had Hamad been able to recruit additional ACP members in Bethel so that the town could have selected a second convention delegate, or had he persuaded an ACP member in Danbury or New Fairfield to become a convention delegate; see footnote 4; Hamad would have had the opportunity to obtain a second to his nomination of Nielsen. Finally, Hamad was not prevented from voting or otherwise participating as the duly elected convention delegate. He nominated Nielsen, and he chose not to vote for Setaro, with the result that neither candidate received the ACP endorsement.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Moreover, Hamad\u2019s claim must be viewed in the context of the ACP\u2019s constitutionally protected associational rights. \u201cThere can no longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas is a form of orderly group activity protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. . . . The right to associate with the political party of one\u2019s choice is an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom. . . . And of course this freedom protected against federal encroachment by the First Amendment is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to the same protection from infringement by the States. . . . Moreover, [a]ny interference with the freedom of a party is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of its adherents.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Wigoda, </em>supra, 419 U.S. 487-88. \u201cFreedom of association means not only that an individual voter has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>right to associate with the political party of her choice . . . but also that a political party has a right to identify the people who constitute the association . . . and to select a standard bearer who best represents the party\u2019s ideologies and preferences.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco Democratic Committee, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 224. Therefore, \u201c[fjreedom of association also encompasses a political party\u2019s decisions about the identity of, and the process for electing, its leaders.\u201d Id., 229. Finally, because the constitutional protection extends to the \u201c[pjarty\u2019s determination of the boundaries of its own association, and of the structure which best allows it to pursue its political goals\u201d; <em>Tashjian </em>v. <em>Republican Party of Connecticut, </em>supra, 479 U.S. 224; a party has broad latitude to determine how best to organize itself and to conduct its affairs; <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco Democratic Committee, </em>supra, 230; including the discretion \u201cto determine the appropriate standards for participation in the [pjarty\u2019s candidate selection process.\u201d <em>Democratic Party of United States </em>v. <em>Wisconsin ex rel.

Because the ACP has a legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>mate interest in ensuring that its endorsement decision reflects some measure of party consensus, it was the ACP\u2019s right to determine how best to promote this interest. See <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco Democratic Committee, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 230; <em>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, </em>supra, 479 U.S. 224; <em>Democratic Party of United States </em>v. <em>Wisconsin ex rel.

As the trial court stated, the letter, which had been requested by Blick, was a \u201ccandid [appraisal] of the legal situation presented by the endorsement dispute\u201d that included a summary of the arguments both for and against the rules interpretation urged by Setaro. The letter contained the following reasons why the executive committee could reasonably construe the ACP rules as requiring a seconding motion for Nielsen\u2019s nomination: \u201cCertainly, our rules and practice argue forcefully that nominations require a second. Under ACP state rules, an Executive Committee recommended nomination is deemed made and seconded when the convention convenes. Our convention rules and agendas reflect seconding remarks, with no indication that they are optional.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u201cAs a matter of policy, requiring a second would work no real injustice now or in the future. The Executive Committee recommendation gives a single-delegate convention the option to endorse the recommended candidate or make no endorsement. If supporters of other candidates seek our endorsement, they can petition for delegate positions. One delegate should not have the unilateral authority to overcome five Executive Committee votes that underlie the endorsement recommendation. Based on these arguments, a conclusion that the endorsement was improperly given Mr. Nielsen seems right and just.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> The plaintiffs claim that the executive committee allowed several other candidates throughout the state to be endorsed by single-delegate conventions.

It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 [85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1965)]. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>All Brand Importers </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 208, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). It is well established, however, that only actions that are the responsibility of the state may be held to violate a person\u2019s federal due process right\u2014in other words, only state action triggers a person\u2019s right to due process of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 43, 570 A.2d 680 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">It is clear to me that when a state gives a political party\u2019s nominee preferential access to the ballot, the conduct of that political party in choosing its nominee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>constitutes state action. L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 13-24, p. 1121 (\u201c[i]n effect, therefore, the state delegates to the political party the decidedly governmental function of determining who may gain a place on the ballot\u201d); see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright, </em>321 U.S. 649, 664, 64 S. Ct. 757, 88 L. Ed. 987, reh. denied, 322 U.S. 769, 64 S. Ct. 1052, 88 L. Ed. 1594 (1944) (holding that discrimination practiced by a political party is state action if the state \u201crequires a certain electoral procedure, prescribes a general election ballot made up of party nominees so chosen and limits the choice of the electorate in general elections for state offices, practically speaking, to those whose names appear on such a ballot\u201d); <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>National Democratic Party, </em>447 F.2d 1271, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 858, 92 S. Ct. 109, 30 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1971) (\u201clogic dictates that a state party\u2019s action in selecting <em>delegates </em>to its national convention is also invested with state action\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Under this reasoning, of course, the ACP and its executive committee must furnish the minimum procedural safeguards necessary to ensure due process of law. See generally R. Berdon, \u201cThe Constitutional Right of the Political Party To Chart Its Own Course: Defining Its Membership Without State Interference,\u201d 22 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 933, 944-46 (1988). However, General Statutes \u00a7 9-387,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which governs the manner in which political parties in Connecticut must resolve disputes over endorsements or nominations, fails to require a political party to furnish notice or give the interested parties a right to be heard. The rules of the ACP apparently do not require these safeguards, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>I am troubled by these apparent gaps in the state\u2019s obligation to provide its citizens with due process of law. Nevertheless, it is clear that in this case, the plaintiffs failed to raise this claim properly before the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 leave the resolution of this issue, therefore, to another day.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 9-387 provides: \u201cThe state rules of each party shall prescribe the manner in which any dispute as to the endorsement by such party of a candidate for state, district or municipal office or for delegate or town committee member, including conflicting claims to such endorsement, shall be resolved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\"> See footnote 28 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
