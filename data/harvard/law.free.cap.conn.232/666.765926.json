The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with the jury verdict, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the defendants appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The record reveals the following facts. The defendants, a married couple who resided in New London, began construction of a new home on property that they owned in Waterford. In the spring of 1988, while their new home was under construction, the defendants contacted the plaintiff for information regarding the installation of a swimming pool on the Waterford site. The plaintiff\u2019s sales representative, James Keenan, made several visits to the defendants\u2019 Waterford property to take various measurements and to discuss the possible pool installation with the defendants. Because the defendants\u2019 property abutted a pond, one of the issues discussed by Keenan and the defendants was the effect of the water level of the pond on the cost of the pool construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On July 15,1988, the parties signed a contract in the amount of $37,810 for the installation of a swimming pool at the defendants\u2019 new home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract expressly provided that in the event of cancellation of the contract by the defendants, the plaintiff would be entitled to liquidated damages of 20 percent of the contract price, plus costs of collection and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Although the defendants anticipated that the pool would be installed prior to the completion date of their new home, the contract did not contain either a starting date or a completion date.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>In October, 1988, the town of Waterford temporarily lowered the water level of the pond adjacent to the defendants\u2019 property. The plaintiff urged the defendants to authorize the immediate installation of the swimming pool in order to avoid an increase in the contract price once the water level of the pond was returned to normal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants, however, refused to allow the plaintiff to commence construction of the pool at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In the spring of 1989, the defendants instructed the plaintiff to proceed with the installation of the swimming pool. The plaintiff agreed to do so, but informed the defendants that the price of the pool had increased by approximately $5000 due to the return to normal of the pond\u2019s water level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants, however, refused to allow the plaintiff to install the pool at a price higher than the contract price, claiming that the parties had not contemplated a price increase due to a change in the water level of the pond. The plaintiff then initiated this action for breach of contract, seeking damages, interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The defendants filed an answer, a counterclaim and several special defenses. The defendants\u2019 counterclaim alleged, in three counts, that the plaintiff had: (1) fraudulently induced the defendants to agree to purchase the swimming pool by quoting them a contract price that the plaintiff knew to be lower than that required to construct the pool; (2) violated the Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>icut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., by virtue of its fraudulent misrepresentations regarding the price of the pool; and (3) breached the swimming pool installation contract. The defendants\u2019 special defenses claimed, inter alia, that the contract was an unenforceable \u201chome improvement contract\u201d under the HI A<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because it failed to contain a commencement date or a completion date, or the signatures of both of the defendants as owners of the property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants moved for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ment on their special defenses under the HIA. The trial court, <em>Austin, J., </em>denied the defendants\u2019 motion on the ground that the exemption under the HIA for new home construction<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rendered the act inapplicable to the contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The defendants thereafter filed certain additional special defenses, alleging that the swimming pool contract violated the provisions of the Home Solicitation Sales Act (HSSA).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendants claimed that the notice of cancellation required by the HSSA was printed in smaller typeface than that mandated by the statute, that the cancellation notice did not contain a place where it could be signed and dated in accordance with the statutory requirements, and that the page of the contract containing the notice was not easily detachable from the other contract provisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>plaintiff filed a motion in limine seeking an order precluding the introduction at trial of any evidence relating to the special defenses asserted by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ants under the HIA and the HSSA. Prior to the commencement of trial, the trial court, <em>R. O\u2019Connell, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion, concluding that the defendants\u2019 special defenses under the HIA were barred by Judge Austin\u2019s earlier determination, rendered in connection with his ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that the HIA was inapplicable to the contract,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the HSSA was also inapplicable to the contract on the ground that \u201c[t]he purpose of the . . . [HSSA] does not fit the facts as the court has seen them and as they\u2019ve been outlined . . . by the pleadings here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">At the close of the evidence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the fraud and CUTPA counts of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, concluding, as to the first count, that the defendants had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to establish the plaintiff\u2019s fraud and, as to the second count, that the defendants had failed to introduce any evidence of an ascertainable loss of money or property as required under CUTPA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>plaintiff on its complaint in the total amount of $26,292.80, awarding the plaintiff $7562 in damages, $3250.80 in interest, and $15,480 in attorney\u2019s fees. The jury also returned a verdict for the plaintiff on the third count of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly: (1) precluded them from establishing their special defenses under the HIA and the HSSA; (2) directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the fraud and CUTPA counts of their counterclaim; (3) failed to instruct the jury as to the essential factual allegations of the third count of their counterclaim for breach of contract; and (4) permitted counsel for the plaintiff to make inflammatory and prejudicial comments about Daniel Del Grosso during the trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the first claim and, accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The defendants first contend that the trial court improperly prohibited them from asserting their special defenses under the HIA and the HSSA on the ground that neither act was applicable to the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>contract. We agree with the defendants and, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court should have directed a verdict in their favor on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">A contract is subject to the requirements of the HIA if it constitutes \u201can agreement between a contractor and an owner for the performance of a home improvement.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (5). Under the HIA, \u201chome improvement\u201d includes, among other things, the construction, replacement, installation or improvement of a swimming pool in connection with any land or building used or designed to be used as a private residence. General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (4).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Among the activities expressly excluded from the definition of \u201chome improvement,\u201d however, is \u201c[t]he construction of a new home.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (4) (A). The trial court concluded that the parties\u2019 contract was exempt from the requirements of the HIA because the pool was to be installed in conjunction with the construction of the defendants\u2019 new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In construing the HIA, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). Application of these well established principles of statutory construction persuades us that the parties\u2019 pool installation contract is subject to the requirements of the HIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Our starting point is the broad language of \u00a7 20-419 (4), which defines \u201chome improvement\u201d to include the installation of a swimming pool for use at a private residence. Although construction of the defendants\u2019 new home had not been completed at the time the parties contracted for the installation of the pool, it is undisputed that the new dwelling was designed and intended for use as the defendants\u2019 private residence. Thus, the pool to be constructed by the plaintiff constituted a \u201chome improvement\u201d as defined by \u00a7 20-419 (4) unless its installation represented \u201c[t]he construction of a new home\u201d under \u00a7 20-419 (4) (A).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the planned pool installation was not a part of \u201c[t]he construction of a new home.\u201d The pool installation contract was completely separate and distinct from the defendants\u2019 home construction contract, and the two contracts were to be performed by entirely different and unrelated contractors. Moreover, the documents that comprise the contract for the construction of the swimming pool contain no indication that the pool was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to have been installed at any particular stage of the new home construction, or even that it was to have been installed prior to the completion of the new home.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In fact, the contract documents make no reference whatsoever to the construction of the defendants\u2019 new home. Thus, although the defendants anticipated that the swimming pool would be installed prior to the completion of their new home, the record does not support the conclusion that the swimming pool installation and the new home construction were so interrelated, temporally or otherwise, that the installation of the pool constituted an integral part of \u201c[t]he construction of a new home\u201d under \u00a7 20-419 (4) (A).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Our conclusion also finds support both in the legislative history of the HIA and in the policy that its passage was intended to implement. As we have previously noted, the HIA \u201c \u2018was passed for the protection of the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 323, 576 A.2d 455 (1990), quoting <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 720, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). \u201cThe objective of the [HIA] is to promote understanding by the consumer,, to ensure his ability to make an informed decision and to protect him from substantial work by an unscrupulous contractor. 22 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 1979 Sess., p. 5797, remarks of Senator Audrey P. Beck.\u201d <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 239, 618 A.2d 501 (1992). As remedial legislation, the HIA must be afforded a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit. <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 323. In the circumstances presented, the defendants, as consumers who entered into an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ment with a home improvement contractor for the installation of a swimming pool, are members of the class that the legislature sought to protect by passage of the HIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The applicability of the HIA to the parties\u2019 contract is further supported by the relationship between the HIA and chapter 827 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 47-116 through 47-121, entitled \u201cNew Home Warranties.\u201d Chapter 827 protects purchasers of new single-family homes by creating certain express and implied warranties of sale in their favor. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-117 and 47-118. Thus, if the defendants had chosen to have the swimming pool installed by their new home builder as part of the contract for the construction of their new home, the installation of the pool presumably would have been subject to the warranties established by \u00a7\u00a7 47-117 and 47-118. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-116;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> see also <em>Krawiec </em>v. <em>Blake Manor Development Corp., </em>26 Conn. App. 601, 605-606, 602 A.2d 1062 (1992) (warranties created under chapter 827 not limited to structure of dwelling unit itself). In the circumstances presented, however, the defendants would not have been entitled to the protection of the warranties created by \u00a7\u00a7 47-117 and 47-118, because the swimming pool was not a fixture or structure that had been \u201cmade a part [of the single-family dwelling unit] at the time of construction\u201d by the general contractor or a subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tractor. General Statutes \u00a7 47-116; see footnote 20. In view of the broad statutory safeguards afforded consumers who have contracted to purchase new homes and consumers who have contracted for home improvements, we see no reason to deprive the defendants of any such protection merely because they sought to have a swimming pool installed by a home improvement contractor at the site of their new home construction. We conclude, therefore, that the HIA is applicable to the parties\u2019 contract.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The plaintiff concedes that its contract with the defendants does not contain a commencement or a completion date. Because the requirements of the HIA are mandatory and must be strictly construed, the absence of these dates constitutes a violation of the HIA that renders the contract unenforceable. <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 321-22; <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 717-18. Thus, the plaintiff is precluded from recovery against the defendants unless the plaintiff can establish that the defendants\u2019 invocation of the HIA as the basis for their repudiation of the contract was in bad faith.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 238; <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Although the plaintiff raised in the trial court the claim that the defendants had invoked the HIA in bad faith,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the plaintiff had no occasion to establish the claim in view of the court\u2019s conclusion that the HIA did not apply to the parties\u2019 contract. Ordinarily, a new trial would be required to afford the plaintiff the opportunity to prove that the defendants repudiated the contract in bad faith. The bad faith exception, however, is intended to preclude a homeowner from unfairly invoking the HIA \u201c[t]o deny the contractor any opportunity of recovery after he has completed his end of the bargain . . . .\u201d <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 240. In this case, installation of the swimming pool was never commenced and, consequently, the plaintiff is not entitled to restitutionary relief based on a theory of quasi contract, quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See id., 236 n.9; <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 317 n.1. Because the bad faith exception may not be used by a contractor to recover on a restitutionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>theory when, as here, the contractor has not performed any of the home improvement services contemplated by the contract, the plaintiff cannot recover even if it can establish that the defendants repudiated the contract in bad faith. Accordingly, the defendants, having established a special defense under the HIA, are entitled to judgment on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the fraud and CUTPA counts of their counterclaim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The first count of the counterclaim alleged that the plaintiffs sales representative, Keenan, had fraudulently induced the defendants to enter into the swimming pool installation contract. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict on this count, but for a different reason than that propounded by the trial court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cThe essential elements of an action in fraud, as we have repeatedly held, are: (1) that a false representation was made as a statement of fact; (2) that it was untrue and known to be untrue by the party making it; (3) that it was made to induce the other party to act on it; and (4) that the latter did so act on it to his injury. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maturo </em>v. <em>Gerard, </em>196 Conn. 584, 587, 494 A.2d 1199 (1985).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> With respect to the last element, \u201c[a] plaintiff who has not suffered damage or injury cannot pursue an action at law or in equity for nominal damages resulting from fraudulent actions.\u201d <em>Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 329, 593 A.2d 478 (1991); see also <em>Beik </em>v. <em>Thorsen, </em>169 Conn. 593, 594-95, 363 A.2d 1030 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In directing a verdict against the defendants on the CUTPA count of their counterclaim, the trial court concluded that the defendants had failed to present any evidence of loss or harm resulting from the actions of the plaintiff. See footnote 14. We have carefully reviewed the record and concur with the trial court that there is no evidence that the defendants suffered any injury due to the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misconduct.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For that reason, the plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict on the fraud count of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The second count of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentations regarding the effect of the water level of the pond on the price of the swimming pool constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice under CUTPA. As we have discussed, the trial court concluded that the defendants had presented no evidence that they had suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and, accordingly, directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 CUTPA claim. The defendants contend, however, that they were improperly precluded from introducing evidence to establish damages under CUTPA. Specifically, they claim that the trial court should have permitted certain proffered testimony by Daniel Del Grosso, which the court excluded upon objection by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on foundation grounds, regarding attorney\u2019s fees that the defendants allegedly had incurred after the plaintiff had commenced this action against them and in defense thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Although it is doubtful that the defendants would have been able to establish that the attorney\u2019s fees they incurred in defending the plaintiff\u2019s action constituted damages recoverable under General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a); see footnote 28; the defendants neither objected to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the proffered evidence nor otherwise sought to explain why it was admissible.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, we refuse to consider the defendants\u2019 evidentiary claim. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Cuomo, </em>230 Conn. 1, 11-12, 644 A.2d 333 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 457, 442 A.2d 906 (1982). Because the defendants have raised no other claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence of any ascertainable loss under \u00a7 42-110g (a),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> they are not entitled to relief on the CUTPA count of their counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The defendants next contend that they are entitled to a new trial on their breach of contract claim because the trial court failed to explain the essential factual allegations of the claim in its instructions to the jury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The breach of contract count of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim contained nine numbered paragraphs, the first eight of which set forth the facts alleged by the defendants to support the claim. Although the trial court instructed the jury on the law regarding the breach of contract claim, the court failed to read, summarize or otherwise explain to the jury the factual allegations underlying the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>We agree with the defendants that they were entitled to an instruction that more fully apprised the jury of the nature of their action for breach of contract. The defendants, however, never requested that the trial court read or explain to the jury the pertinent factual allegations, nor did they request that the pleadings be made available to the jury.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, neither of the defendants excepted to the trial court\u2019s instructions on the counterclaim. \u201cSection 315 [of the Practice Book] provides that this court is not bound to review claims of error in jury instructions if the party raising the claim did not either submit to the trial court a written request to charge or promptly except to the charge after it was delivered. . . . The purpose of the rule is to alert the court to claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Perry v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 814, 614 A.2d 414 (1992). Because the defendants failed to bring this issue to the attention of the trial court, we decline to consider the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The defendants further contend that they are entitled to a new trial on the basis of certain inflammatory comments made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel about Daniel Del Grosso in the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendants contend that these remarks, especially those made during counsel\u2019s rebuttal to Del Grosso\u2019s closing argument,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> were so repeated and flagrant that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>court should have acted, sua sponte, to prevent the remarks and to minimize the prejudice resulting therefrom. We are not persuaded that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Although the defendants now claim that opposing counsel\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to require a new trial, the defendants themselves failed to object to all but one of the comments that they contend were objectionable.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Moreover, they interposed no objection whatsoever to counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury, they failed to seek a mistrial on account of counsel\u2019s comments, and they failed to raise the issue of counsel\u2019s improper remarks in their posttrial motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We, of course, do not condone comments by counsel that go beyond the bounds of forceful advocacy. As we have previously observed, however, the trial court was in the best position to assess the possible prejudice, if any, that may have resulted from counsel\u2019s comments, and to fashion an appropriate remedy from a range of possible alternatives. See <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 322, 430 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>Marko </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 550, 559, 364 A.2d 217 (1975); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Steck, </em>146 Conn. 114, 119, 148 A.2d 246 (1959); see also <em>Yeske </em>v. <em>Avon Old Farms School, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>1 Conn. App. 195, 204-205, 470 A.2d 705 (1984). The defendants were obliged, therefore, to raise in the trial court their objections to counsel\u2019s improper remarks. Because they failed to do so, the defendants are entitled to a new trial only if they can demonstrate that such relief is necessary to remedy a manifest injustice. See <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>74 Conn. 699, 710, 52 A. 490 (1902). We are not persuaded that the defendants have met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At worst, any prejudice stemming from counsel\u2019s comments was minimal.

We do not agree that an improvement is exempt from the requirements of the HIA solely because the construction of the home to which the improvement is contemplated has not been completed. In circumstances where, as here, the new home construction had already commenced by the date on which the contract for the installation of the improvement was signed, it would be contrary to the remedial purpose of the HIA to deprive the consumer of the otherwise applicable protections of the act.

The plaintiff further claimed that the defendants failed to coordinate the two projects as promised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> The plaintiff therefore sought recovery only under the liquidated damages provision of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\"> The trial court directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the ground that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent conduct by the plaintiff. See footnote 14. The record, however, discloses the following testimony by Daniel Del Grosso in support of the defendants\u2019 claim. Keenan visited the proposed site of the swimming pool on two occasions prior to the execution of the contract, and on both occasions the pond was at its normal high water level. On the second visit to the site, Keenan and an assistant, who were unaware that the town planned to lower temporarily the level of the water in the pond, took various measurements of the pond and the property. Upon completing the measurements, Keenan told the defendants that the pond\u2019s water level \u201cwas not a problem.\u201d According to Del Grosso, it was not until some time after the defendants had signed the pool installation contract that Keenan informed them that there would be an increase in the price of the pool if it was not installed prior to the return to normal of the pond\u2019s water level. Viewed in the light most favorable to the defendants; see <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 820, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); this testimony supports the claim that Keenan, in order to induce the defendants to sign the contract, intentionally misled them to believe that the water level of the pond would have no bearing on the price of the pool. Although the evidence adduced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>plaintiff sharply contradicted the defendants\u2019 claim of fraud, \u201c[i]t is uniquely the province of the trier of fact, in this case the jury, to determine the import of the evidence by gauging the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Id., 821. Thus, Del Grosso\u2019s testimony concerning Keenan\u2019s alleged intentional misrepresentations raised questions of fact requiring resolution by the jury. Because, however, we conclude that the defendants failed to establish that they were harmed by the plaintiff\u2019s alleged misconduct, the plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict on the fraud count of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> \u201cWe have held that a misrepresentation made without belief in its truth or recklessly made can also provide the basis for a fraud claim. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Haggard, </em>141 Conn. 668, 673, 109 A.2d 358 (1954).\u201d <em>Kilduff v.

This remedy is not limited to mere compensatory damages. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Petrazzuoli Bros., Inc., </em>10 Conn. App. 22, 34-35, 521 A.2d 212 (1987). Rather, under CUTPA, a plaintiff is entitled to have the trial court consider awarding both punitive damages; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a); and attorney\u2019s fees. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d); see <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, [184 Conn.] 617-18.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 509-10. In addition, CUTPA allows a person who has not suffered actual damages to pursue equitable relief. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to install the swimming pool deprived the defendants of the item for which they had bargained\u2014the swimming pool. The loss of the pool, therefore, was a sufficient \u201cascertainable loss\u201d to allow them to proceed under CUTPA. See <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 614. Nevertheless, the defendants never argued before the trial court or this court that their loss of the swimming pool was a sufficient ascertainable loss under CUTPA. Instead, they focused only on actual damages, which, as the majority notes, they failed to prove. The plaintiffs, therefore, failed to make out a prima facie case under CUTPA. Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; see part IIB of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
