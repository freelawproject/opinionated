Gonsalves, a former member of the West Haven police department. The plaintiff applied to the defendant West Haven police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>pension board (pension board) for benefits under the fund. The pension board denied the application, concluding that the plaintiff is not a \u201cwidow\u201d as defined by the special act (act)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> establishing the fund\u2019s eligibility criteria. The plaintiff thereupon commenced this action,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking a declaratory judgment that she is entitled to benefits under the act. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff is not entitled to benefits and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The facts are undisputed. The decedent married his first wife, Anne, in 1956. In 1963, the decedent was appointed to serve as a police officer for the city of West Haven, a position he held until May 6, 1977, when he retired due to a disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Approximately one month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>after his retirement, the decedent and Anne Gonsalves were divorced, and on September 3, 1977, the decedent married the plaintiff. The decedent died on September 30, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Following his death, Anne Gonsalves and the plaintiff each applied to the pension board for widow\u2019s benefits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under the pension fund. On October 30,1990, the pension board voted to award benefits to Anne Gonsalves and to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application. Thereafter, upon the plaintiff\u2019s request for reconsideration, the pension board affirmed its decision. The plaintiff then brought this declaratory judgment action,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming that she alone is entitled to widow\u2019s benefits under the act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties stipulated to the relevant facts, and also agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for benefits depends upon whether she is a \u201cwidow\u201d as that term is defined by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The trial court concluded that the act unambiguously limits the class of widows of department members entitled to benefits to those surviving wives who (1) were living with a department member at the time of his death, or, if not so living with him, were absent by reason of the member\u2019s fault, <em>and </em>(2) were married to the department member at the time of his retirement. Applying this test, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff is not eligible for widow\u2019s benefits because she was not married to the decedent at the time of his retirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The plaintiff contends that the trial court misconstrued the act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cwidow.\u201d Under the construction urged by the plaintiff, a surviving wife of a department member would be entitled to benefits upon proof <em>either </em>that (1) she was living with the decedent at the time of his death, <em>or </em>(2) if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault, <em>and </em>was married to him prior to his retirement. The plaintiff claims that because she is a surviving wife of the decedent who was living with him at the time of his death, she satisfies the first prong of the test and, accordingly, is entitled to widow\u2019s benefits. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff is not a \u201cwidow\u201d as defined by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Our analysis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018Our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); see also <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The plaintiff relies primarily on the language of the act\u2019s definition of \u201cwidow\u201d to support her claim that she is entitled to benefits. The definition, however, read in the light of the ordinary rules of English grammar and sentence structure, compels a contrary conclusion. See <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 852, 633 A.2d 305 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Under the act, the term \u201cwidow\u201d is \u201climited in its meaning to the surviving wife of [a department] member who was living with him at the time of his death, or, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault, and who, if such member was retired, was married to him prior to his retirement from [the] department.\u201d The parties\u2019 disagreement over the proper construction of the definition centers upon their differing views as to which phrases and clauses<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are connected by the coordinating conjunctions \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d The defendants contend that \u201cand\u201d connects a restrictive <em>clause </em>containing two predicate phrases (\u201cwho was living with him at the time of his death, or, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault\u201d) with a second restrictive <em>clause </em>(\u201cwho, if such member was retired, was married to him prior to his retirement from such department\u201d). This construction is consistent with the general rule of grammar that coordinating conjunctions are used to connect sentence elements of the same class.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>urged by the plaintiff, however, this grammatical rule is violated, because \u201cand\u201d would connect a <em>clause </em>(\u201cwho was living with him at the time of his death\u201d) and a <em>phrase </em>(\u201cif not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault\u201d) with a <em>clause </em>(\u201cwho, if such member was retired, was married to him prior to his retirement from such department\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Similarly, under the defendants\u2019 construction, \u201cor\u201d connects sentence elements of the same class, namely, two predicate <em>phrases </em>(\u201cwas living with him at the time of his death\u201d and \u201cif not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault\u201d). Under the plaintiff\u2019s construction, however, \u201cor\u201d connects a <em>clause </em>(\u201cwho was living with him at the time of his death\u201d) with a <em>phrase </em>and a <em>clause </em>(\u201cif not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault\u201d and \u201cwho, if such member was retired, was married to him prior to his retirement from such department\u201d). Here again, the defendants\u2019 construction, in contrast to that urged by the plaintiff, comports with the rules of grammar.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The plaintiff does not disagree with the general rule that coordinating conjunctions are used to connect sentence elements of equal grammatical rank, but claims, rather, that her construction of the act is consistent with the rule. Specifically, she contends that the sequence \u201cor, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault,\u201d is a clause, not a phrase, and that the subject of the clause, \u201cwho,\u201d is implied or understood. The plaintiff, however, cites nothing in the act or in its history to support this assertion. Because we will not supply language to change the clear meaning of a statute in the absence of any indication that the legislature intended such a construction; see, e.g., <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28-29, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988); <em>McPadden </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>126 Conn. 654, 13 A.2d 679 (1940); we reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The plaintiff also contends that her interpretation finds support in the legislature\u2019s 1961 rephrasing of the definition of \u201cwidow,\u201d which, she argues., changed the meaning of the term.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The plaintiff acknowledges that she would not have been entitled to benefits under the act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cwidow\u201d prior to the enactment of the 1961 amendment. She claims, however, that the 1961 revision of the definition necessarily reflects a legislative intent to change the meaning of the term \u201cwidow.\u201d Although it is generally true that when the legislature amends the language of a statute, we presume \u201cthat it intended to change the meaning of the statute and to accomplish some purpose\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>227 Conn. 534, 543, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993); we have recognized also that the legislature may modify the phrasing of a statute solely to simplify or condense the statutory language, and not to effect a substantive change. <em>See Daly v. DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 511, 624 A.2d 876 (1993); <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 87-89, 119 A.2d 732 (1955); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 393, 400-401, 161 A. 852 (1932). In revising the phraseology of the act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cwidow,\u201d the 1961 amendment made no material changes to its wording. Moreover, there is no indication in the amendment\u2019s legislative history that any change in the meaning of the term \u201cwidow\u201d was intended. Indeed, there was no mention of the term or its definition in the committee hearings on the amendment; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ings, Cities and Boroughs, Pt. 2, 1961 Sess., pp. 493-99; or in the brief discussion of the amendment on the floors of the House of Representatives; 9 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1961 Sess., pp. 3089-90; and the Senate. 9 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1961 Sess., p. 2788. Furthermore, for the reasons already discussed, application of the rules of grammar to the definition of \u201cwidow\u201d contained in the 1961 amendment leads to the firm conclusion that the legislature did not intend to make any substantive changes in the act\u2019s eligibility requirements for surviving wives.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the definition of the term \u201cwidow,\u201d as construed by the trial court, is unfairly restrictive of the rights of surviving wives of department members to receive pension benefits. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>particular, the plaintiff claims that limiting pension eligibility only to those surviving wives who were married to a department member prior to his retirement leads to an unfair result where, as here, the surviving wife married the department member shortly after his retirement and remained married to him until his death many years later. The act, however, reflects a policy determination by the legislature that benefits shall be awarded only to a surviving wife who, as a consequence of her marriage to a department member during some or all of his period of active duty, shared with him the dangers and difficulties attendant upon police work. Moreover, \u201cthis court is precluded from substituting its own ideas of what might be a wise provision in place of a clear expression of legislative will.\u201d <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>175 Conn. 463, 474-75, 399 A.2d 1280 (1978); see also <em>McPadden </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 126 Conn. 658-59 (wisdom of police relief act\u2019s unambiguous definition of term \u201cwidow\u201d is not properly concern of court). Therefore, as we have previously concluded in construing the provisions of a police pension fund containing substantially similar eligibility requirements; see <em>Heise </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>127 Conn. 359, 17 A.2d 8 (1940) (widow of police officer not entitled to pension benefits unless she was married to him prior to his retirement and at time of his death); the fact that the plaintiff was not married to the decedent prior to his retirement from the department renders her ineligible for widow\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> The police pension fund, known as the police relief fund, has its origin in the police relief fund established for the town of Orange in 1917 by special act of the legislature. 17 Spec. Acts 882, No. 180 (1917). In 1921, the town of Orange was divided into the towns of Orange and West Haven, and the provisions of the 1917 act were made applicable to West Haven. 18 Spec. Acts 1067, No. 482 (1921). The legislature has amended the act on several occasions, two of which are relevant to this case: the 1937 amendment, which authorized the award of widow\u2019s benefits; 22 Spec. Acts 645, No. 162, \u00a7 2(1937); see <em>Wilson v. West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 651-53, 116 A.2d 420 (1955) (setting forth legislative history of act); and the 1961 amendment, which is the subject of this appeal. 30 Spec. Acts 211, No. 275, \u00a7 1 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> The pertinent amendment to the act; 30 Spec. Acts 211, No. 275, \u00a7 1 (1961); provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the death of any member of the police department who has actually contributed to [the police] relief fund [of the town of West Haven] . . . the widow of such member shall receive, until her death or remarriage, out of said fund of said department, a monthly sum equal to one-half of the compensation received by such member at the time of his death, if in active service, provided such widow shall receive no less than two thousand dollars per annum, or a monthly sum equal to one-half of the pension received by such member at the time of his death, if retired, provided such widow shall receive no less than one thousand dollars per annum. . . . The term \u2018widow\u2019, as used in this section, shall be limited in its meaning to the surviving wife of such member who was living with him at the time of his death, or, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault, and who, if such member was retired, was married to him prior to his retirement from such department. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> Also named as defendants were police pension board members Joseph Borelli, Gregory Mondo, Louis D\u2019Onofrio, Alex Botte, Genevieve Canny and Edward Connelly, the West Haven board of police commissioners, and Anne Gonsalves, the decedent\u2019s first wife.

In view of the fact that [the plaintiff] has no [right] to [widow\u2019s benefits,] and in view of the fact that all parties required under [Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d)] for a determination of [the] rights of persons other than [the] plaintiff may not be before the Court, the Court, while finding no [right] to pension benefits in the plaintiff, makes no finding as to pension rights with respect to Anne Gonsalves.\u201d We need not address this issue because it has not been raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> A clause is a sequence of related words, within a sentence, that has a subject and a predicate. A phrase is a sequence of grammatically related words without a subject and a predicate. See J. Hodges, M. Whitten, W. Horner, S. Webb &amp; R.

Miller, Harbrace College Handbook (11th Ed. 1990) p. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\"> The 1937 amendment, which authorized the award of benefits to surviving wives of department members, defined \u201cwidow\u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018widow\u2019, as used in this section, shall be limited in its meaning to the surviving wife of such member, who shall have been married to him prior to his retirement from such department, if retired, and who was living with Mm at the time of his death, or, if not so living with Mm, was absent by reason of his fault.\u201d 22 Spec. Acts 645, No. 162, \u00a7 2 (1937). The definition remained unchanged from 1937 until its revision under the 1961 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> The plaintiff also argues that her construction of the act is consistent with the provision of the 1961 amendment awarding certain minimum payments to widows otherwise eligible for pension benefits. See footnote 2. Specifically, she claims that the award of minimum benefits reflects a broad intent on the part of the legislature to treat surviving wives of department members more generously than in the past, and that it can be presumed, therefore, that the legislature, in revising the definition of \u201cwidow,\u201d also sought to liberalize the act\u2019s eligibility requirements. Neither the language of the 1961 amendment nor its legislative history, however, supports this claim. As we have explained, construction of the amendment in accordance with the rules of grammar compels the conclusion that the legislature intended no substantive change to the act\u2019s definition of \u201cwidow\u201d in its 1961 revision. Furthermore, the legislative history of the amendment clearly indicates that its primary purpose was to provide for the award of minimum benefits to widows eligible for payments under the act. See 9 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7,1961 Sess., p. 3089, remarks of Representative William T. Blake (\u201cThis bill amends the special act which set up the police relief fund in the Town of West Haven. It provides that minimum pensions will be paid.\u201d); 9 S. Proc., Pt. 8,1961 Sess., p. 2788, remarks of Senator John F. Pickett, Jr. (\u201cthis bill would establish a minimum retirement amount for the persons who are pensioned under the Police Relief Fund under the terms of the West Haven Fund\u201d). Indeed, the amendment\u2019s legislative history contains no mention of the term \u201cwidow\u201d or its definition. Thus, there is no merit to the plaintiffs claim that the 1961 amendment reflects a general intent on the part of the legislature to enlarge the class of surviving wives eligible for benefits under the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
