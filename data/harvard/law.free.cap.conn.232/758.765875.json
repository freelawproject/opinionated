The chairman, Jesse M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Frankl, purportedly acting pursuant to his administrative powers under those subdivisions, transferred this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>case from the fourth to the third workers\u2019 compensation district, without prior notice to the parties. The plaintiff, Jeanine T. Dixon, the widow of the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Kenneth T.

(a) Did the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission properly deny the claimant\u2019s motion for hearing on order of transfer and motion to stay? (b) Was that denial a proper exercise of the chairman\u2019s authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-280, specifically subdivisions (6), (14) and (16) of subsection (b)? 2. Does the compensation review board have jurisdiction over appeals taken from the chairman\u2019s exercise of powers conferred to him by General Statutes \u00a7 31-280? Or in the alternative: May a party aggrieved by the chairman\u2019s ruling on a motion relating to an order of transfer seek review and redress before the compensation review board given the limitations of General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 as to the compensation review board\u2019s appellate jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>This case was reserved to this court by the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-324. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>36 Conn. App. 150, 153, 649 A.2d 538 (1994); see Practice Book \u00a7 4165.5. Under our resolution of the appeal, it is unnecessary to answer questions 1 (a) and (b). We answer question 2, in both of its formulations, in the negative. We also conclude, however, that the chairman\u2019s transfer of this case was not a proper exercise of his administrative powers under \u00a7 31-280. We therefore vacate the transfer order, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The facts and procedural history are undisputed. The plaintiffs decedent had been an employee of the defendant, the United Illuminating Company. The underlying claim concerned the compensability of the decedent\u2019s injury and death, and had been filed in the fourth district, where it had been the subject of several informal conferences before workers\u2019 compensation commissioner John A. Arcudi. Further, both the plaintiff and the defendant had noticed depositions of treating physicians, and were in the process of exchanging discovery materials. In addition, the workers\u2019 compensation file in this matter discloses the following actions. On February 9, 1994, commissioner Frank J. Verilli issued a notice to the parties for a formal hearing to be held on March 3, 1994. On February 16, 1994, the defendant moved for a continuance of that hearing until after June 2, 1994, claiming that it was premature, that the defendant needed additional time for preparation and discovery, and that there were unresolved discovery disputes outstanding. On February 17, 1994, commissioner Arcudi issued a notice canceling the March 3, 1994 formal hearing and scheduling an emergency informal hearing for February 28, 1994, for the purpose of addressing motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">By letter dated March 14, 1994, the chairman unilaterally ordered the case transferred from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>fourth district to the third district.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff then moved, in the fourth district, for a hearing \u201cconcerning the circumstances of the letter ordering transfer and that the request for transfer be stayed pending hearing and determination of the same.\u201d In her motion, the plaintiff represented that the matter was pending in the fourth district before commissioner Arcudi, who had determined or was in the process of determining certain motions and who had indicated that he would assign the matter for a formal hearing in May, 1994. The plaintiff also represented that depositions had been noticed, and that discovery materials were being exchanged by the parties. Citing General Statutes \u00a7 31-278,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff represented further that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>not been notified of a request for, and had not consented to, a transfer, and was unaware of any basis for the disqualification or incapacity of commissioner Arcudi.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The motion was referred to the chairman, who issued a written ruling denying the motion. In that ruling, the chairman explained the factual background that gave rise to the transfer as follows: \u201cIn the course of my duties as Chairman, I was approached by a representative<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the employer who claimed that <em>the employer was not being treated fairly </em>by the Fourth District in various workers\u2019 compensation cases pending in that district. When asked for specific cases, as opposed to general dissatisfactions, the employer identified this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\u201cIn the course of my duties as Chairman, I am often approached by parties, most often claimants, who are dissatisfied with the manner and/or efficiency with which their cases are being processed. When I am satisfied that this agency is not fulfilling its obligation to efficiently process cases or <em>where a litigant in a contested case raises a serious claim of lack of fair treatment, </em>I have in the past ordered that the matter be transferred to another district or that the matter be specially assigned to a commissioner-at-large to handle the disposition of the case. At all times, I have undertaken such transfers and/or special assignment of commissioners pursuant to my administrative powers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b). . . . I followed this procedure in the present case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The chairman then reviewed the extensive administrative powers granted to his office by \u00a7 31-280 (b), in the light of its legislative history and of the enactment by the legislature of No. 91-339 of the 1991 Public Acts. On the basis of that review, the chairman concluded that \u201cthe power to assign commissioners to districts, the power to allocate the resources of the commission to carry out its mission and the power to control the hearing calendars of the compensation commissioners in order to facilitate the timely and efficient processing of cases, all reside in the Chairman. General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (1), (6) and (14). In the end, <em>which commissioner hears a claim and where a claim is heard is entirely an administrative matter committed to the sound discretion of the Chairman.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs request for a hearing on the chairman\u2019s transfer of the case, the chairman reasoned that \u201cto permit the issue of the administrative transfer of a case to be the subject of a formal hearing before a single commissioner as requested by the claimant (or the subject of an appeal to the compensation review board) would defy the administrative structure created by [No. 91-339 of the 1991 Public Acts]. Through those amendments, the legislature wisely recognized that if the Chairman is to be held accountable for the operation of this statewide agency, it is the Chairman, and not the commissioners acting separately (or together) in review of the Chairman\u2019s administrative decision, who shall have the final word on the transfer of cases and their assignment for hearing.\u201d Accordingly, the chairman denied the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the board and this reservation of the case followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The plaintiff contends that the transfer order was invalid because: (1) the chairman\u2019s refusal to grant her motion for a hearing on his summary transfer of the case denied her due process of law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; (2) the specific provisions of \u00a7 31-278, rather than the general administrative powers granted to the chairman under \u00a7 31-280 (b), govern the transfer of cases from one commissioner to another; and (3) viewing the chairman\u2019s order as a ruling on a motion for disqualification of a commissioner for bias, the board has appellate jurisdiction over such a ruling. The defendant claims, to the contrary: (1) that the chairman\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a hearing was a proper exercise of his administrative power under \u00a7 31-280 (b) (6), (14) and (16), and did not deny the plaintiff due process; and (2) that the board has no appellate jurisdiction over the chairman\u2019s exercise of his administrative powers under \u00a7 31-280 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We agree with the defendant that, when the chairman acts pursuant to his administrative power to transfer a case under \u00a7 31-280 (b), no hearing is required. We also agree that the board has no appellate jurisdiction over the chairman\u2019s exercise of that power. We conclude, however, that in this case, the chairman\u2019s transfer was not a valid exercise of his administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>power under \u00a7 31-280 (b); it was, instead, the functional equivalent of the granting of a motion to disqualify commissioner Arcudi for bias. As such, it did not fall within the chairman\u2019s administrative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">We begin our analysis by noting our basic agreement with the chairman regarding the extensive scope of his administrative authority under \u00a7 31-280 (b). Indeed, our discussion that follows regarding the history and legislative genealogy of \u00a7 31-280 generally tracks that of the chairman in his written ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Historically, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act) lodged in each district commissioner \u201cjurisdiction of all claims and questions arising in such district under\u201d the act. General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5357. The geographical boundaries of the districts were legislatively defined to be coextensive with the congressional districts in the state. Thus, each commissioner had jurisdiction over the claims arising out of the injuries that occurred in his district. That \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was construed to be subject matter, as opposed to personal, jurisdiction, which could not be conferred upon a different commissioner by agreement, waiver or conduct of the parties. <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923). The only statutory exception to this rule provided that if a commissioner of one district was \u201cdisqualified or temporarily incapacitated\u201d from hearing a matter, he was required to designate a different commissioner to hear the matter. Id., 239. As the chairman noted in this case, this resulted in a \u201csystem of relatively autonomous commissioners . . . solely responsible for the processing of workers\u2019 compensation cases\u201d within their respective geographical districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The office of the chairman has evolved over time. In the statutory revision of 1930, there was no reference to a chairman. Instead, \u00a7 5243, entitled \u201cTo adopt rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>and make report as a board,\u201d provided that \u201c[a]cting together, the commissioners shall have power to adopt and change such rules, methods of procedure and forms as they shall deem expedient for the purposes of this chapter,\u201d and that they shall submit a biennial report of their doings to the governor. General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5243. Between 1930 and 1935 the governor apparently appointed one of the commissioners as the chairman of the board of commissioners, because in the 1935 supplement to the General Statutes, which was the next statutory revision, \u00a7 1610c, entitled \u201cChairman of board,\u201d provided that \u201c[tjhere shall <em>continue </em>to be a chairman of the board of compensation commissioners appointed by the governor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The duties of the chairman, who was one of the commissioners, were to prepare forms, keep the insurance coverage cards and a list of self-insurers, prepare the biennial report to the governor, and publish bulletins of the changes in the compensation law and a digest of compensation decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">These administrative duties remained unchanged until 1962, when the chairman was given the added power, when \u201cthe proper dispensation of business in any district requires it,\u201d to appoint, from among former commissioners or qualified members of the bar, commissioner s-at-large to serve on a per diem basis. General Statutes (Rev. to 1962) \u00a7 31-280. In 1969, the chairman was given the added responsibility of submitting to the comptroller the annual administrative budget for the workers\u2019 compensation commission. Public Acts 1969, No. 696. In 1979, the legislature further amended \u00a7 31-280 to provide that the chairman \u201cshall also be chairman of the compensation review division.\u201d Public Acts 1979, No. 79-540, <em>\u00a7 </em>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In 1980, the legislature expanded the role of the chairman by amending \u00a7 31-280 to provide that the \u201cduties of the chairman shall be administrative in nature,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the \u201cchairman may, at his discretion, hear any matter,\u201d and that the \u201cchairman shall have control over the hearing calendars of the commissioners whenever, in the discretion of the chairman, an adjustment in the number of hearings within a district would effect a more timely and efficient processing of claims.\u201d Public Acts 1980, No. 80-414, \u00a7 3. The legislature did not, however, amend \u00a7 31-278, which was the statutory progeny of General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5357. Thus, the legislature retained the jurisdictional language that had been the basis of our decision in <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 236. Therefore, although with one hand the legislature gave the chairman the administrative responsibility of \u201ccontrol over the hearing calendars of the commissioners\u201d in order to \u201ceffect a more timely and efficient processing of claims,\u201d with the other hand it retained the legal basis for the individual commissioners\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction\u2014and, therefore, ultimate control\u2014over the claims arising in their respective, legislatively defined districts. The practical effect of this statutory dichotomy was to frustrate what may have been a legislative purpose to create a centralized administrative system.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In 1990, the Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee undertook a comprehensive study of the workers\u2019 compensation system and, in January, 1991, issued its report entitled, \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation in Connecticut\u201d (Report). The committee \u201cfound that the system\u2019s current administrative structure is not responsive to the concerns of either employers, who pay for benefits, or employees, who receive benefits. Management is weak and accountability is lacking. District offices vary significantly in terms of outcomes and efficiency, and their operating policies and procedures are not uniform. Administrative resources for central and district office operations are inadequate, particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>larly given the dramatic growth in workload, and backlogs and delays in case processing are widespread.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Report, p. i.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In response, the 1991 General Assembly enacted No. 91-339 of the 1991 Public Acts. That act, much of which is now codified at \u00a7 31-280, made sweeping changes in the powers of the chairman. First, it eliminated the power of the chairman, first recognized in the 1980 legislation, to \u201chear any matter,\u201d and substituted the provision that the \u201cchairman may not hear any matter arising under this chapter, except appeals brought before the Compensation Review Board and except as provided in subdivision (14) of subsection (b) of this section,\u201d which empowers the chairman to \u201cpreside over informal hearings in regard to compensation ... in order to facilitate the timely and efficient processing of cases.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Second, the 1991 legislation removed the jurisdictional language from \u00a7 31-278 that had been identified as being in tension with the chairman\u2019s previous administrative power over the commissioners\u2019 hearing calendars. In its place, the legislation provided that \u201c[e]ach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>commissioner shall hear all claims and questions arising under this chapter in the district to which the commissioner is assigned.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-278. Further, the legislation abolished the legislatively established geographical districts, and granted the chairman the authority to establish districts and to assign the commissioners to those districts. General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Third, that legislation gave the chairman additional, extensive administrative powers and responsibilities, many of which are specified in \u00a7 31-280 (b). The three powers of the chairman that are at issue in this case are the powers to: \u201c(6) Allocate the resources of the commission to carry out the purposes of this chapter . . . (14) Control the hearing calendars of the compensation commissioners, and if necessary, preside over informal hearings in regard to compensation under the provisions of this chapter in order to facilitate the timely and efficient processing of cases . . . [and] (16) Direct and supervise all administrative affairs of the commission.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (6), (14) and (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The broad language of these provisions, read against the problematic administrative history of the office of the chairman and read in the context of the other twenty-three administrative powers currently granted to the chairman under \u00a7 31-280 (b), indicates clearly the extensive administrative authority granted to the chairman to manage the workers\u2019 compensation system so that cases are processed in a timely and efficient manner. There can be no doubt, moreover, that this authority includes the general power to transfer a case or cases from one district to another for that administrative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Furthermore, the legislative history of the 1991 legislation supports this broad interpretation of the chair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>man\u2019s administrative powers and responsibilities. The Report of the Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, which led in large part to the 1991 legislation, focused on the need for strong, centralized administrative authority over, and accompanying accountability for, the workers\u2019 compensation system. See Report, pp. 68-75. In addition, the hearings held on the proposed legislation before the legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Labor and Public Employees, and the debate on the floors of the House of Representatives and the Senate, indicate the same emphasis on administrative authority and accountability in the office of the chairman. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., pp. 891-904, 907-10, 918-26, 931-40, 944-67, 985-93, 1007-1008, 1014-17; 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., p. 2791, Pt. 18, pp. 6941-42, and Pt. 24, pp. 9033-84; 34 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1991 Trailer Sess., pp. 3416-21, 3435-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">This history also leads us to conclude that, when the chairman transfers a case or cases pursuant to his administrative authority under \u00a7 31-280 (b), no hearing is required. The statute does not provide on its face for such a hearing, and applicable due process principles lead us to conclude that a hearing is not constitutionally required. Unless there is <em>\u201ca </em>constitutionally protected interest, the due process analysis ceases because no process is constitutionally due for the deprivation of an interest that is not of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>226 Conn. 314, 322, 627 A.2d 909 (1993). No plaintiff has a constitutionally protected interest in having his or her claim adjudicated in one district or another, or before one commissioner or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We also conclude that an administrative transfer of a case or cases by the chairman is not within the appellate jurisdiction of the board. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u00a7 31-301 (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> defines that appellate jurisdiction, and confines it to three types of matters: (1) the \u201centry of an award by the commissioner\u201d; (2) a \u201cdecision of the commissioner upon a motion\u201d; and (3) \u201can order by the commissioner according to the provisions of section 31-299b.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An administrative transfer such as the one at issue in this case does not fall within any of these categories. It would, moreover, undermine the chairman\u2019s broad administrative authority and responsibility under \u00a7 31-280 (b) to subject his decisions on such discretionary administrative matters to appellate review by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Our conclusion that the chairman has broad administrative authority to transfer a case or cases does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>necessarily lead us to conclude that that authority is unlimited. We conclude that the transfer in this case was not a valid exercise of the chairman\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In this case, the transfer was made in response to a claim that the defendant was \u201cnot being treated fairly.\u201d We do not read that claim, or the chairman\u2019s having acted upon it, as invoking appropriate administrative considerations, such as the timely and efficient processing of claims, or the allocation of resources. Instead, we read that claim, and the chairman\u2019s subsequent action transferring the case, as a claim by the defendant and a determination by the chairman that, in some respect, the commissioner considering the matter was biased, or was acting in a biased manner, against the defendant. That is not the type of claim that falls within the chairman\u2019s administrative authority to determine. Rather, such a claim is subject to resolution pursuant to \u00a7 31-278. See footnote 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 31-278, an aggrieved party may file a motion for the commissioner to disqualify himself or herself. Prior to the 1991 legislation, General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-278 provided that \u201c[i]f a commissioner is disqualified or temporarily incapacitated from hearing any matter, or if the parties shall so request and the commissioner finds that it will facilitate a speedier disposition of the claim, he shall designate some other commissioner to hear and decide such matter . . . .\u201d Under that provision, a party who claimed that a commissioner was biased could move that the commissioner disqualify himself or herself, and the commissioner\u2019s ruling thereon would be subject to appellate review. See <em>Kirsten </em>v. <em>B. F. Goodrich Sponge Products, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 401, 423 A.2d 95 (1979) (appeal to Court of Common Pleas); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Northwind Energy Insulators, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 689, 483 A.2d 618 (1984), cert. denied, 195 Conn. 801, 487 A.2d 564 (1985) (appeal to compensation review division); <em>Romeo </em>v. <em>H &amp; L </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>Chevrolet, Inc., </em>10 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 72 (1992) (same); <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Jazlowiecki, </em>6 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 9 (1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Under the 1991 legislation, \u00a7 31-278 was amended to provide that \u201c[i]f a commissioner is disqualified or temporarily incapacitated from hearing any matter, or if the parties shall so request and the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission finds that it will facilitate a speedier disposition of the claim, he shall designate some other commissioner to hear and decide such matter.\u201d Thus, the only difference in the disqualification process created by the 1991 legislation was to lodge in the chairman, rather than the disqualified commissioner, the power to designate the other commissioner to hear and decide the claim. We read this provision to have preserved, however, the procedure under which a party raises the issue of disqualification for bias by first moving that the purportedly biased commissioner disqualify himself. This procedure is consistent with the rules that govern the disqualification of judges. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 996, 997; <em>Szypula </em>v. <em>Szypula, </em>2 Conn. App. 650, 482 A.2d 85 (1984). Similarly, the denial of a motion for a commissioner to disqualify himself or herself for bias is appealable to the board pursuant to \u00a7 31-301 (a). Thus, the chairman\u2019s transfer order in this case was an impermissible surrogate for a motion by the defendant to disqualify the commissioner, the ruling on which would have been appealable to the board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>The chairman\u2019s authority to administer the workers\u2019 compensation system under \u00a7 31-280 (b) does not include the authority to adjudicate. In this case, the chairman overstepped his authority by deciding a question, namely, whether a commissioner should be disqualified for bias, for which the normal adjudicative process provides a mechanism for resolution. The chairman had no more administrative authority to transfer this case on the basis of the defendant\u2019s claim of bias than if the defendant had claimed that the commissioner had made an erroneous legal ruling. In either situation, the appropriate remedy would have been through the normal adjudicative, rather than the administrative, process.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">With respect to the reserved questions: We decline to answer questions 1 (a) and (b).

That law states the Chairman\u2019s duties shall be administrative in nature, the Chairman shall have control over the hearing calendars of the commissioners and further that the Chairman may hear any matter. However, Sec. 31-278 gives district commissioners jurisdiction of all claims and questions arising in their respective districts. . . . That constitutes a vague and limited definition of authority.
