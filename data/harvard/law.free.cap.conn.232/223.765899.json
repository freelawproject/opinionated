The principal issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that the liability of an assignee under a lease assignment agreement, in which the assignee specifically has assumed the obligations of the original tenant, ceases when the lease is reassigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The following facts are undisputed. On June 17,1954, Gateway, as landlord, entered into a lease agreement (Gateway lease) with W. T. Grant Company (Grant), as tenant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a term of thirty years. The lease was extended by a supplemental agreement effective through January 31, 1985. The leased property was located at 41 Main Street in the town of New Milford. The terms of the lease required Gateway to construct a building to Grant\u2019s specifications and to make all repairs and replacements necessary during the first year of occupancy. Thereafter, the lease required the tenant to \u201cmake all repairs and replacements, both interior and exterior, which [may] be necessary to maintain [the building] in a safe and tenantable condition and in good order and repair.\u201d The lease also required the tenant to surrender the building in good order and condition. The landlord, upon termination of the lease, was responsible only for reasonable repairs necessitated by normal wear and tear. In addition, paragraph twelve of the lease gave the tenant the unrestricted right to assign the lease, but provided that \u201cthe Tenant shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>not thereby be relieved of any liability hereunder.\u201d Finally, the section of the lease entitled \u201cheirs, etc.,\u201d stated that \u201c[t]he Lease and all of the covenants and provisions thereof shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the . . . successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Grant retained possession of the property until January 20, 1965, when it assigned the Gateway lease to DiNoia as part of an agreement with her to lease and occupy a different property, also located in New Milford, known as the New Milford Shopping Center. The lease between DiNoia, as landlord, and Grant, as tenant (DiNoia lease) provided that \u201c[i]n order to induce the Tenant to execute this Lease, Landlord hereby assumes all of Tenant\u2019s obligations under that certain Lease and Lease Agreement dated June 17, 1954 between The Gateway Company . . . and Tenant . . . covering premises known as No. 41 Main Street, in the Town of New Milford . . . and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all of Tenant\u2019s right, title and interest thereto. . . . It is understood and agreed that the assignment set forth above shall survive the termination of this Lease and Landlord\u2019s obligations under this Section . . . shall continue throughout the term of said Lease and Lease Agreement dated June 17,1954</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On May 16, 1973, DiNoia conveyed her interest in the New Milford Shopping Center to Charles Schnier, her employer, by way of a quitclaim deed, and on April 9,1976, both DiNoia and Schnier assigned their rights, title, interests, claims and demands in the Gateway lease, set forth in the assignment agreement between DiNoia and Grant, to The Village Green Mall, Inc. (Village Green). Shortly before the expiration of the Gateway lease in 1984, the plaintiffs inspected the leased building and found it to be in need of extensive repairs. Because the last tenant, Village Green, refused to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the repairs, and the original tenant, Grant, had gone into bankruptcy, the plaintiffs demanded that the defendants repair the building.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the defendants failed to do so, the plaintiffs expended $34,822.70 to install a new roof and make other repairs. The plaintiffs then commenced this action, alleging that DiNoia and Schnier, as DiNoia\u2019s employer and principal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> remained obligated under the assignment agreement and are therefore liable for breach of the lease for failure to repair the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">After a trial, the court found that the defendants were not parties to the Gateway lease, and consequently concluded that they were not liable under that lease. The trial court also found that DiNoia\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs had been created by the DiNoia lease, under the terms of which she had assumed Grant\u2019s obligations under the Gateway lease, but that her liability as assignee under that lease had ended when the Gateway lease was reassigned to Village Green because there was no longer privity of estate between the parties. The court moreover rejected the argument that the plaintiffs were third party beneficiaries to the assignment agreement between DiNoia and Grant because it found that neither DiNoia nor Grant had intended to confer a benefit upon Gateway. Because it found that DiNoia was not liable to the plaintiffs, the trial court found that, a fortiori, Schnier was not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The trial court also concluded that, regardless of DiNoia\u2019s liability, Schnier could not be held liable for DiNoia\u2019s conduct because the plaintiffs had failed to prove that DiNoia had been acting as Schnier\u2019s agent during the course of her dealings with Grant. As a component of its proof of agency, the plaintiffs had offered portions of DiNoia\u2019s deposition into evidence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 248 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court determined, however, that because the plaintiffs had failed to show that DiNoia was unavailable to testify at trial as required by Practice Book \u00a7 248 (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> her deposition testimony could not be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) there was no contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants under the Gateway lease; (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>defendants\u2019 liability under the Gateway lease ceased when that lease was reassigned; (3) there was no evidence that DiNoia had acted as Schnier\u2019s agent; and (4) because the plaintiffs failed to satisfy Practice Book \u00a7 248 (d), DiNoia\u2019s deposition testimony was inadmissible. We conclude that the trial court improperly analyzed the parties\u2019 contractual relationship and lease obligations and improperly excluded DiNoia\u2019s deposition. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We need first resolve the question of whether DiNoia remained liable under the assignment agreement between her and Grant after the defendants subsequently reassigned the Gateway lease to Village Green. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53, 607 A.2d 424 (1992). \u201c[Wjhere there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 740, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994). In this case, the trial court refused to hear testimony concerning the intent of the parties, basing its decision exclusively upon its reading of the DiNoia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>lease. Under the circumstances of this case, because the trial court relied solely upon the written agreements in ascertaining the intent of the parties, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the documents are questions of law, rather than fact. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>supra, 53-54. Similarly, whether the trial court applied the proper test in deciding if a document created a third party beneficiary and whether privity of interest existed between parties are also questions of law. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 62, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991) (legal effect of facts is question of law); <em>Bria v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>153 Conn. 626, 632, 220 A.2d 29 (1966) (when surrounding circumstances are not in dispute, construction and legal effect of contract is question of law). Accordingly, our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling in regard to the defendants\u2019 liability in this case is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The trial court concluded that Gateway was not a third party beneficiary of the lease agreement between DiNoia and Grant and that the plaintiffs therefore were not entitled to enforce the obligations of the Gateway lease that DiNoia had assumed because there was \u201cnothing to indicate either that DiNoia and Grant [had] intended to <em>confer a benefit </em>upon Gateway, or that they [had] intended to give Gateway a right to sue DiNoia.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">A third party beneficiary may enforce a contractual obligation without being in privity<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with the actual parties to the contract. See J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed. 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 17-1 through 17-4, pp. 691-719. Therefore, a third party beneficiary who is not a named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>obligee in a given contract may sue the obligor for breach. Id. In this case, the plaintiffs argue that Gateway was a third party beneficiary of the DiNoia lease and therefore is entitled to enforce the obligations of the Gateway lease that DiNoia had assumed on behalf of Grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The proper test to determine whether a lease creates a third party beneficiary relationship is whether the parties to the lease intended to create a <em>direct obligation </em>from one party to the lease to the third party. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>New Haven Road Construction Co., </em>150 Conn. 321, 325, 189 A.2d 386 (1963) (\u201c \u2018the ultimate test to be applied [in determining whether a person has a right of action as a third party beneficiary] is whether the intent of the parties to the contract was that the promisor should assume a direct obligation to the third party [beneficiary]\u2019 <em>Congress &amp; Daggett, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seamless Rubber Co., </em>145 Conn. 318, 324, 142 A.2d 137 (1958) (whether an agreement creates a third party beneficiary depends on \u201cwhether the intent of the parties [to the contract] was to create a direct obligation from the [promisor] to the [third party]\u201d); <em>Colonial Discount Co. </em>v. <em>Avon Motors, Inc., </em>137 Conn. 196, 202, 75 A.2d 507 (1950) (to determine whether a party is a third party beneficiary, \u201cthe final test is whether the intent of the parties to the contract was that the promisor should assume a direct obligation to the third party\u201d). The trial court, as well as the defendants, therefore, focused on the wrong inquiry. The intent to confer a benefit is irrelevant to the determination of whether Gateway was a third party beneficiary. We must instead evaluate whether Grant and DiNoia intended that DiNoia assume a direct obligation to Gateway.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201c \u2018In determining the meaning and effect of the controverted language in the lease, the inquiry must focus on the intention expressed in the lease and not on what intention existed in the minds of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>&amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>230 Conn. 660, 666, 646 A.2d 143 (1994), quoting <em>Hatcho Corp. </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 21, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985). \u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contractual intent presents a question of fact for the ultimate fact finder, where the language is clear and unambiguous it becomes a question of law for the court. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>221 Conn. 530, 545, 606 A.2d 684 (1992); <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corp., </em>203 Conn. 123, 130-31, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987); <em>Kakalki </em>v. <em>Bernardo, </em>184 Conn. 386, 393, 439 A.2d 1016 (1981).\u201d <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 667. The language of the lease agreement between DiNoia and Grant is clear and undisputed in this case. The lease agreement with Grant provided that \u201c[i]n order to induce the Tenant [Grant] to execute this Lease, Landlord [DiNoia] hereby <em>assumes all of Tenant\u2019s obligations </em>under that certain Lease and Lease Agreement dated June 17, 1954 between The Gateway Company . . . and Tenant . . . covering premises known as No. 41 Main Street, in the Town of New Milford . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the plain meaning of the contract, this language created a direct obligation from DiNoia to Gateway. \u201cWhen the plain meaning and intent of the language is clear, a clause in a written lease cannot be enlarged by construction. There is no room for construction where the terms of a writing are plain and unambiguous, and it is to be given effect according to its language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 667. We conclude, as a matter of law, that the intent expressed in the plain language of the lease between DiNoia and Grant created a direct obligation from DiNoia to Gateway and that, accordingly, Gateway was a third party beneficiary of the DiNoia agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>This conclusion, however, does not end our analysis. The reassignment of the Gateway lease to Village Green by DiNoia constituted a delegation according to the law of contracts. An effective delegation refers to the act by which one owing a duty confers upon another person the power to perform that duty. E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 11.10, p. 125. In this case, the tenant\u2019s duties under the Gateway lease, that were assumed by DiNoia under the DiNoia lease, including the obligation to repair and maintain the building, were delegated to Village Green. \u201cWhen a duty is delegated . . . the delegating party (delegant) continues to remain liable. . . . [Delegation] does not free the obligor-delegant from his duty to see to it that performance is rendered, unless there is a novation.\u201d J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, supra, \u00a7 18-25, p. 757. There has been no claim that the reassignment of the Gateway lease to Village Green constituted a novation that requires proof of the landlord\u2019s specific intent to release the contractually bound party. Cf. <em>Carrano </em>v. <em>Shoor, </em>118 Conn. 86, 95-98, 171 A. 17 (1934). Therefore, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs are entitled to look to DiNoia to enforce the obligations that she had delegated to Village Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The trial court also concluded that there was no privity of interest between the plaintiffs and the defendants. This conclusion was based on its determination that once the lease was reassigned to Village Green, DiNoia was no longer in privity of estate with Gateway, and that Gateway and DiNoia had never been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>privity of contract because DiNoia was not a party to the Gateway lease. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">As we already have stated, when the explicit assumption of the obligations under a lease is effected between the original tenant and an assignee, the landlord also becomes a third party beneficiary of the agreement between the tenant and the assignee. However, the \u201clandlord\u2019s right of enforcement should not depend on his being recognized as a third-party contract beneficiary. Inasmuch as [the] landlord has an enforceable right against [the] tenant, and [the] tenant has an enforceable right on the same claim against his assignee, [the] landlord should be entitled to enforce his debtor\u2019s claim against his debtor\u2019s debtor.\u201d 1 M. Friedman, Leases (3d Ed. 1990) \u00a7 7.501d, p. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Therefore, apart from contract liability according to a third party beneficiary analysis, liability between the landlord and parties with a leasehold interest is predicated on privity of estate or privity of contract. 1 M. Friedman, supra, \u00a7 7.501a, p. 350. \u201cPrivity of contract rests on agreement, whereas privity of estate rests on an interest in the leased premises. An original tenant, i.e., one who acquires his lease directly from the owner of the property, is normally in privity of both contract and estate. His acquisition of the leasehold interest creates the privity of estate. His execution of the lease, with rare exception, includes an undertaking to pay the rent and to perform and observe the covenants in the lease on the tenant\u2019s part to be performed and observed. This creates privity of contract. If [the] tenant assigns the lease his privity of estate thereby ends but privity of contract continues, that is, his right to possession ends but his liability under the lease continues. The assignee acquires privity of estate. <em>If the assignee assumes the tenant\u2019s obligations under the lease </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>he comes under privity of contract [to the original lessee] as well.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 350-51; see also <em>Studebaker Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Savings &amp; Trust Co., </em>21 F.2d 385, 387 (7th Cir. 1927); 51C C.J.S. 127-28, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 44 (3) (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Paragraph 10 (a) of the Gateway lease obligated the tenant, Grant, to pay for all maintenance and repairs of the building, after the first year of the lease agreement and throughout the duration of the lease, until the property was surrendered to the landlord, at which time the landlord was responsible for repairs necessitated by ordinary wear and tear. Grant assigned its obligations under the Gateway lease to DiNoia by way of a written agreement that specifically provided that DiNoia agreed to assume all of Grant\u2019s obligations to Gateway as tenant under the Gateway lease. Under the terms of the agreement between Grant and DiNoia, therefore, Grant assigned, and DiNoia assumed, all of Grant\u2019s obligations under the Gateway lease. The \u201cobligations\u201d of a tenant\u2019s assignee are defined as including liability to repair, to surrender possession and for rent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1M. Friedman, supra, \u00a7 7.501c, p. 353. Accordingly, the obligations that DiNoia explicitly assumed in her agreement with Grant created privity of contract and the liability attendant thereto. \u201cIf the assignee assumes with the same force and effect as if he had executed the lease as tenant, the assumption includes all liability that had accrued at the time of the assignment, as well as the liability thereafter accruing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., \u00a7 7.501c2 (a), p. 360; see <em>Broida </em>v. <em>Hayashi, </em>51 Haw. 493, 497, 464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>P.2d 285 (1970). Therefore, \u201c[t]he original tenant and the assuming assignee or assignees are all liable to the landlord, who may recover from all or any of them.\u201d 1 M. Friedman, supra, \u00a7 7.501d, p. 364. Once an assignee fully assumes the obligation of the original tenant, that liability is not extinguished unless there is a novation. Id., \u00a7 7.501c2, p. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In this case, DiNoia expressly assumed all of Grant\u2019s obligations under the Gateway lease, including the obligation to repair and maintain the building, and there was no evidence presented, nor has a claim been made, that the reassignment to Village Green constituted a novation. Accordingly, we conclude that although DiNoia was no longer in privity of estate with Gateway, she remained in privity of contract with Gateway and, therefore, she was obligated, as a matter of law, to comply with the requirements imposed upon the original tenant by the Gateway lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Although we are reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanding the case for a new trial, we consider the plaintiffs\u2019 last claim on appeal. We do so because the issue may arise in a new trial and in the interest of providing guidance as to the proper interpretation of Practice Book \u00a7 248 (d). In denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request to introduce DiNoia\u2019s deposition into evidence, the trial court relied on \u00a7 248 (d), which provides that unless both parties agree that a deposition may be admitted into evidence, the offering party must prove that the deponent is either unavailable or unable to testify in court in order for the deposition to be admissible. Because the plaintiffs did not show that DiNoia was either unavailable or unable to appear in court, the trial court refused to admit her deposition into evidence. Although the plaintiffs argued that the deposition testimony was admissible under \u00a7 248 (c), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>trial court determined that \u00a7 248 (d) governed the admission of DiNoia\u2019s deposition. We disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Section 248 (c) provides that in a civil proceeding \u201c[t]he deposition of a party . . . may by used by an adverse party for any purpose.\u201d See footnote 4. Section 248 (d) provides that depositions can be admitted into evidence, implicitly for any purpose, if the deponent is shown to be unavailable. See footnote 5. To interpret \u00a7 248 (d) to require <em>all </em>deponents, including adverse parties, to comply with its requirements would render \u00a7 248 (c) superfluous, and the specific term \u201cadverse party\u201d meaningless. We interpret provisions of the Practice Book according to the same well settled principles of construction that we apply to the General Statutes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744, 613 A.2d 804 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 807, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992). \u201cIn determining the meaning of a statute, [it] must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 90, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). We presume \u201cthat there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 432, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 248 (c) applies exclusively to depositions of a party that are offered into evidence by an opposing party. Because DiNoia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>was a party adverse to the plaintiffs, \u00a7 248 (c) controls the admission of her deposition into evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 248 (c) is consistent with the rules of evidence. In Connecticut, a statement of a party opponent may be admitted into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. This exception generally includes any words or acts of a party opponent. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.5.1, p. 330. It is essential that such evidence be offered by the party who is the opponent to the party declarant; <em>Bell Food Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>217 Conn. 476, 489, 586 A.2d 1157 (1991); although the statement of a party opponent need not be against the declarant\u2019s interest either at the time the statement was made or at the time it is sought to be admitted into evidence. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 11.5.1, p. 331; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 249-54, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984) (defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement was admissible against him as admission of party opponent even though statement was not inconsistent with defendant\u2019s position at trial). Therefore, our finding that \u00a7 248 (c) permits the liberal admission of the deposition testimony of an adverse party for any purpose is in accord with this rule of evidence. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>We recognize that the trial court has discretion to admit or exclude deposition testimony offered as evidence under \u00a7 248. <em>Cahn </em>v. <em>Cahn, </em>225 Conn. 666, 678, 626 A.2d 296 (1993). \u201cWhile it is normally true that this court will refrain from interfering with a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion . . . this presupposes that the trial court did in fact exercise its discretion. [Discretion imports something more than leeway in decision-making. ... It means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 88, 513 A.2d 116 (1986). In this case, the trial court improperly based its decision to exclude evidence on \u00a7 248 (d) and, accordingly, failed to exercise its discretion properly. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s determination and conclude that the admission of DiNoia\u2019s deposition testimony should have been determined by \u00a7 248 (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We next must determine whether the improper exclusion of the deposition testimony was harmful error. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). Accordingly, we must determine whether the improper evidentiary ruling is likely to have affected the result of the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brawn, </em>199 Conn. 14, 25, 505 A.2d 690 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cAgency is defined as the fiduciary relationship which results from manifestation of consent by one person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act ... . Restatement (Second), 1 Agency \u00a7 1 [1958]. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>164 Conn. 317, 322, 321 A.2d 456 (1973). Thus, the three elements required to show the existence of an agency relationship include: (1) a manifestation by the principal that the agent will act for him; (2) acceptance by the agent of the undertaking; and (3) an understanding between the parties that the principal will be in control of the undertaking. Restatement (Second), 1 Agency \u00a7 1, comment b (1958).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161,184, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988); <em>Botticello </em>v. <em>Stefanovicz, </em>177 Conn. 22, 25, 411 A.2d 16 (1979). A principal is generally liable for the authorized acts of his agent; 1 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7 140, p. 349 (1958); and in certain circumstances, both the agent and the principal may be liable for the acts of the agent. 2 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7 322, p. 72. Therefore, in this case, the plaintiffs sought to prove that an agency relationship existed between DiNoia and Schnier in order to hold Schnier liable. The existence of agency is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 120, 133, 464 A.2d 6 (1983). We conclude that had the deposition testimony been properly admitted, the trial court would have had ample evidence upon which to base a finding of agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Schnier was living in Florida and was in very poor health at the time of the trial. There was no testimony presented on his behalf. The testimony of the principal, however, is not necessary to prove agency. The existence and extent of an agency relationship may be established by circumstantial evidence based upon an examination of the situation of the parties, their acts and other relevant information. <em>Kurtz </em>v. <em>Farrington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>104 Conn. 257, 269, 132 A. 540 (1926); <em>Licari </em>v. <em>Blackwelder, </em>14 Conn. App. 46, 53, 539 A.2d 609, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 803, 545 A.2d 1100 (1988). The agent also may provide evidence regarding the facts and the surrounding circumstances of a relationship that demonstrates the existence of an agency relationship. <em>Milne </em>v. <em>MacWhirter, </em>128 Conn. 683, 687-88, 25 A.2d 659 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">DiNoia provided detailed testimony regarding her relationship with Schnier in her deposition. In addition to what already was stated in her interrogatories,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which were admitted into evidence, in her deposition she stated that she was employed by Schnier during the time that she signed the lease agreement with Grant and that although she did not recall the lease in particular, she testified that many properties that Schnier actually owned were put in her name \u201cbecause [she] was an employee of . . . Schnier.\u201d She testified that although the reasons for this arrangement were never explained to her, she believed it was for Schnier\u2019s convenience because she was always in the office and available to sign documents. DiNoia did not negotiate the lease with Grant nor did she have any subsequent managerial role pertaining to the property. She testified that she received no monetary or tax benefit from any of the property that Schnier put in her name. She also testified that the quitclaim deeds to the New Milford Shopping Center and other properties were given to Schnier when DiNoia left Schnier\u2019s employment. The quitclaim deed to the New Milford Shopping Center indicates that only nominal consideration was paid for the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>It is clear that DiNoia\u2019s deposition testimony substantially bolsters the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that DiNoia acted as Schnier\u2019s agent when she signed the lease agreement with Grant. The deposition testimony also reinforces the admitted evidence. It tends to show that the quitclaim deed for nominal consideration, in effect, returned to Schnier legal title to property that he always had controlled, even when it was in DiNoia\u2019s name. It also expands upon the scant details of DiNoia\u2019s employment as stated in her interrogatories. In light of the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs had not presented evidence to establish agency, we conclude that the exclusion of the deposition testimony constituted harmful error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> Grant, now defunct, is not a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> Initially a defendant in this action, Village Green was defaulted for failure to appear. On November 18, 1994, the plaintiffs filed a motion nunc pro tunc to withdraw the action as to Village Green, which the trial court granted. Accordingly, Village Green is no longer a party to this appeal. Hereinafter, any reference to the defendants is to DiNoia and Schnier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> Schnier became subject to the lease agreement between DiNoia and Grant when DiNoia quitclaimed the New Milford Shopping Center to Schnier on May 16,1973. It does not appear that Schnier specifically assumed the obligations of the original tenant. On appeal, however, the plaintiff argues only that Schnier is liable under the agency doctrine and does not allege that Schnier is liable as an assignee for the obligations imposed under the Gateway lease as an assignee. Therefore, we do not address the question of whether Schnier may have been liable to the plaintiffs as an assignee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 248 (c) provides: \u201cThe deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of the taking of the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent or employee or a person designated under Sec. 244 (g) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 248 (d) provides: \u201cThe deposition of a witness other than a person falling within the scope of (b) hereof, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: 1. that the witness is dead; 2. that the witness is at a greater distance than thirty miles from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the state and will not return before the termination of the trial or hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; 3. that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; 4. that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; 5. that the parties have agreed that the deposition may be so used; 6. upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> \u201cPrivity\u201d in this context refers to \u201cthose who exchange the promissory words or those to whom the promissory words are directed.\u201d J.

Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 17-1, p. 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> The defendants argue that the language in the DiNoia lease providing Grant with certain \u201climited\u201d lien rights against DiNoia\u2019s property demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>strates that there was no intent to create any contractual obligations enforceable by the plaintiffs. This language protected Grant in the event it had to perform DiNoia\u2019s obligations under the Gateway lease and in no way undermined the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to pursue a direct action against DiNoia in the event of a breach of the Gateway lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> If a tenant agrees to undertake an obligation that is unrelated to the leased property, such as the payment of a note made by the landlord, this is considered a collateral covenant and unenforceable against the assignee. 1 M. Friedman, supra, \u00a7 7.501c, p. 354. There has been no claim that any such obligations existed in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> The trial court arrived at this conclusion at the urging of the defendants\u2019 counsel, who represents both DiNoia and Schnier. Although it was obviously in DiNoia\u2019s interest to persuade the trial court that she was acting as Schnier\u2019s agent so that he ultimately may be liable for any obligation undertaken by her on his behalf; see, e.g., 2 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7\u00a7 328, 432, 438 (1958); Schnier\u2019s interest, on the other hand, was best served by resisting the admission of any evidence regarding an agency relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> Our interpretation of \u00a7 248 (c) is also consistent with the federal courts\u2019 construction of the similarly worded federal rule, rule 32 (a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See, e.g., <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Capitol Cement Co., </em>571 F.2d 290, 308 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> Although \u00a7 248 (c) is analogous to the rule of evidence that permits an admission of a party opponent to be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, \u00a7 248 (d) broadens the rules of evidence by permitting otherwise inadmissible evidence to be admitted. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 2.3.2, p. 19. Because a party may not introduce its own statement under the admission of a party opponent exception; <em>Martins </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 212, 228, 645 A.2d 557, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 915, 648 A.2d 154 (1994); \u00a7 248 (d) authorizes the admission into evidence of a deposition of a nonparty or of a party\u2019s own deposition provided certain requirements are satisfied. Therefore, \u00a7 248 (c) and (d) each apply to distinct and different circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> On retrial, the trial court still has discretion to exclude DiNoia\u2019s deposition testimony as long as it is recognized that the evidence is otherwise admissible under \u00a7 248 (c). See <em>Cahn </em>v. <em>Cahn, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 678.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> In her interrogatories, DiNoia stated that she had been employed by Charles Schnier Agency, Inc., and had been asked to hold the New Milford Shopping Center in her name while she was employed there. She had received no remuneration for holding the property in her name nor had she received any of the rents paid. She had made no payments in regard to the property nor had she performed any obligations under the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> Because the deposition improperly was excluded, the plaintiffs will have a new opportunity to prove that DiNoia was Schnier\u2019s agent. Therefore, we need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 third claim that the trial court incorrectly had found that the plaintiffs had not established agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
