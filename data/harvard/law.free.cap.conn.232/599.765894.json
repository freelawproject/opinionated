J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU9\">The dispositive issue in these consolidated appeals is whether, without notice, general assistance recipients may be denied three month \u201cextensions\u201d of benefits merely because they previously have been suspended from the general assistance program. The plaintiffs, Clarence Harkless, Michelle Lawson and Rufino Pabon, are general assistance recipients who reside in the city of Meriden. The defendant Ann Whit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ney, director of social services (director) for the city of Meriden, denied each of the plaintiffs a three month extension of general assistance benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 ITh-llS,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a hearing officer appointed by the defendant Audrey Rowe, commissioner of income maintenance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (commissioner), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>affirmed the denial of these benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-64, 17b-65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed separate administrative appeals from the decisions of the hearing officer to the trial court, which reversed the decisions and remanded the cases to the commissioner for further proceedings. The defendants appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we consolidated and transferred the appeals to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). Although we affirm the judgments of the trial court remanding these cases to the commissioner for further proceedings, we do so for reasons not provided by the trial court and we remand for a different inquiry than the trial court ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The record reveals the following facts. Each of the plaintiffs was impoverished, had been classified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>commissioner as \u201cemployable\u201d and began receiving general assistance benefits on or before July 1, 1992. In late 1992 or early 1993, after determining that each plaintiff had failed to complete his or her workfare requirement, the commissioner suspended each plaintiffs general assistance benefits for ninety days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-689 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the plaintiffs brought a timely challenge to his or her ninety day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>After each plaintiffs ninety day suspension pursuant to \u00a7 17b-689 (a) had expired, the director informed each plaintiff that he or she also would be denied a three month extension of general assistance benefits pursuant to \u00a7 17b-118.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each plaintiff timely petitioned for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>review of the director\u2019s decisions in a municipal fair hearing; see General Statutes \u00a7 17b-63;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, thereafter, in a state fair hearing. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At the state fair hearings, the director contended that the applicable regulations automatically made all the plaintiffs ineligible for the three month extension of benefits, because each of them had been \u201csuspended from Workfare . . . during his/her [previous] nine months on assistance . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (8) (a) (General Assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K] [8] [a]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response, the plaintiffs argued that, notwithstanding their previous suspensions and the director\u2019s interpretation of the regulations, they remained eligible for the extensions pursuant to \u00a7 17b-ll8 itself. According to the plaintiffs, \u00a7 17b-118 made them eligible for extensions as long as they were \u201cin compliance with program requirements,\u201d and they in fact were \u201cin compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>with program requirements\u201d under the statute because they never had \u201cwilfully failed to report for work.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118. Indeed, the plaintiffs argued, because they had not \u201cwilfully failed to report for work,\u201d the suspensions themselves had been improper. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-689 (a). Each plaintiff then testified as to the allegedly nonwilful reason why he or she had failed to complete the workfare requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Without deciding whether the regulations conflicted with the statute, and without evaluating either the credibility or the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the state fair hearing officer affirmed the denials of the extensions. The hearing officer ruled that the time for contesting the propriety of the suspensions had expired and that, on the basis of the unchallenged suspensions and the regulations, the plaintiffs were ineligible per se for the three month extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The trial court reversed the decisions of the state fair hearing officer. The court first held that a state fair hearing is \u201ca de novo proceeding\u201d and that the hearing officer is required by \u00a7 17b-65 to \u201c \u2018render a final decision based upon all the evidence introduced before him . . . .\u2019 \u201d Quoting our opinion in <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 536, 525 A.2d 940 (1987), the court further held that \u201c \u2018[d]ue process of law requires . . . that at [a] hearing the parties involved have a right to produce relevant evidence . . . .\u2019 \u201d The court concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe fair hearing officer\u2019s refusal to consider [each] plaintiff\u2019s evidence concerning the validity of the previous suspension of his [or her general assistance] benefits constituted an abuse of discretion by the hearing officer and a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights.\u201d The court accordingly rendered judgments remanding each case to the commissioner \u201cfor a new decision by the hearing officer, based on all the evidence in the record, including evidence concerning the validity of the suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s General Assistance benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In these consolidated appeals, the defendants contend that, pursuant to the governing regulations, the only \u201crelevant evidence\u201d in a state fair hearing reviewing the denial of an extension is the fact of an unchallenged suspension, and not whether the recipient <em>actually </em>\u201cwilfully [had] failed to report for work\u201d; Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 17b-118; before the suspension was imposed. Urging affirmance of the trial court judgments, the plaintiffs respond that the regulations: (1) are inconsistent with \u00a7 17b-118; and (2) deprive the plaintiffs of property without due process of law. The plaintiffs further argue that, in the circumstances of these cases, the suspensions could not be used to justify the denials of the extensions, because, at the time of the suspensions, the commissioner had not notified the plaintiffs either of their rights to challenge the suspensions or of the fact that, if the suspensions went unchallenged, the plaintiffs later would be ineligible for the extensions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We conclude that each trial court judgment ordering a remand must be affirmed, but for different reasons than the trial court provided, and for a different inquiry than the trial court ordered. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s implicit holding that, whenever a general assistance recipient is denied an extension on the basis of a previous suspension, a hearing officer always must consider the recipient\u2019s evidence that the previous suspension should not have been imposed. We further conclude, however, that in the circumstances of these cases, the defendants\u2019 decision to deny the extensions based solely on the previous suspensions may have deprived the plaintiffs of property rights without due process of law. A remand to resolve this issue is, therefore, required.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">We first consider the disagreement among the parties and the trial court about the relationship between the regulations and the underlying statutes. The defendants maintain that the underlying statutes pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>vide ample authority for the commissioner\u2019s promulgation of \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (8) (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K] [8] [a]). The plaintiffs argue that the regulation is inconsistent with \u00a7 17b-118, while the trial court concluded that the regulation is inconsistent with \u00a7 17b-65. According to the plaintiffs, \u00a7 17b-118 makes recipients eligible for extensions whenever they are \u201cin compliance with program requirements\u201d and, in deciding whether a recipient is \u201cin compliance with program requirements,\u201d the defendants must decide not only whether an individual has been suspended, but whether he actually \u201cwilfully failed to report for work.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118. According to the trial court, \u00a7 17b-65 required the hearing officer to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 reasons for failing to work because that statute provides that the \u201chearing officer shall render a final decision based upon all the evidence introduced before him . . . We agree with the defendants that the regulation is consistent with both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We first address whether the regulation conflicts with \u00a7 17b-118. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument to that effect depends upon two unstated premises. First, the plaintiffs assume that, in making \u201ccompliance with program requirements\u201d a <em>prerequisite </em>to eligibility, \u00a7 17b-118 makes \u201ccompliance with program requirements\u201d the <em>only </em>criterion for eligibility. Second, the plaintiffs assume that \u201ccompliance with program requirements\u201d means <em>only </em>compliance with the requirements specified in \u00a7 17b-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The plaintiffs provide, and we can find, no support for these premises in the text of \u00a7 17b-118. Indeed, the language of that statute supports the argument of the defendants that the commissioner does have discretion to create her own eligibility criteria for extensions. Section 17b-118 nowhere mandates that \u201ccompliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>program requirements\u201d is the only eligibility criterion. The section also contains no all-inclusive definition of the term \u201cprogram requirements.\u201d Most importantly, the statute contains an express provision that \u201c[t]he commissioner of social services shall adopt regulations ... to implement the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Furthermore, even if the plaintiffs\u2019 premises were correct, there would be no textual inconsistency between the statute and the regulation at issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The regulation provides that \u201c[a] recipient would be ineligible for the extension if he/she . . . [w]as suspended from Workfare at any time during his/her nine months on assistance . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (8) (a) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K] [8] [a]). In adopting the regulation, the commissioner reasonably could have concluded that a recipient who had been \u201csuspended from Workfare\u201d was not \u201cin compliance with program requirements\u201d set out in \u00a7 17b-118. General assistance recipients may be \u201csuspended from Workfare\u201d only pursuant to \u00a7 17b-689, and that section allows suspensions only for violations of identical or substantially similar \u201cprogram requirements\u201d that make recipients ineligible for extensions under \u00a7 17b-118. See footnotes 1 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument thus devolves into the assertion that \u00a7 17b-118 requires an <em>independent inquiry </em>into whether the recipient actually has failed to comply with program requirements and prohibits the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>from relying on the fact of a previous, unchallenged suspension to justify the denial of an extension. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">A suspended recipient is entitled to challenge a suspension by proving that he or she has not violated any \u201cprogram requirement\u201d at the time the suspension is imposed. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-64; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-23 (E) (7) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 XIII [E] [7]). Although the general assistance statutes are remedial and therefore must be given a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit; see <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 696, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995); nothing in the statutes or the legislative history suggests that a recipient should have more than one opportunity to demonstrate \u201ccompliance with program requirements.\u201d Indeed, both the statute and the legislative history support \u201cthe position that the regulation is consistent with the general statutory scheme that the regulation was designed to implement. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 600, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); see also <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 129-30, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 144, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heslin, </em>215 Conn. 590, 599, 577 A.2d 1009 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1088, 111 S. Ct. 966, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (1991). The legislature expressly conferred on the commissioner broad discretion to \u201cadopt regulations ... to implement the provisions of this section\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118; see also <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 211, 603 A.2d 385 (1992); and the legislative review committee subsequently approved the regulation at issue here pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>suant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-170.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heslin, </em>supra, 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Having concluded that the challenged regulation is consistent with \u00a7 17b-118, we now turn to address the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 17b-65 required the defendants to consider the evidence that the plaintiffs proffered at their state fair hearings. We agree with the trial court that \u00a7 17b-65 (a) required the state fair hearing officer to \u201crender a final decision based upon all the evidence introduced before him and applying all pertinent provisions of law, regulations and departmental policy.\u201d This statute, however, did not require the hearing officer to consider evidence that was irrelevant to the substantive issue that he or she was called upon to decide, pursuant to the \u201cpertinent provisions of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>regulations and departmental policy.\u201d Because valid regulations provide that individuals who have been suspended are ineligible for extensions, the only relevant facts in the state fair hearings were that the plaintiffs had been suspended, and that the suspensions had not been overturned on appeal. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (8) and (10) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K] [8] and [10]). The plaintiffs\u2019 reasons for failing to work were inapposite to a determination of whether, pursuant to the regulations, the extensions properly had been denied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the statutory basis upon which the trial court ordered a remand for further proceedings before the fair hearing officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We must next decide whether constitutional constraints arising under the federal due process clause<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> require further evidentiary inquiries, even if such inquiries are not mandated by the applicable regulation and statutes. The plaintiffs argue, and the trial court held, that procedural due process required the defendants to consider the evidence that the plaintiffs had proffered at their state fair hearings. Although we reject the due process analysis provided by the trial court, we conclude that, because the record is incomplete, we cannot resolve all of the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The trial court\u2019s due process analysis was based on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 536. In that case, we held that \u201c \u2018[d]ue process of law requires . . . that at [a] hearing the parties involved have a right to produce relevant evidence . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id. As we already have explained, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was irrelevant under the governing regulations. Therefore, nothing in <em>Huck </em>required the evidence to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The plaintiffs present two due process arguments. Their broader contention is that due process always prohibits the defendants from using the mere fact of a previous suspension to justify the denial of an extension and always mandates an independent inquiry into whether a recipient actually has failed to comply with program requirements. Their narrower contention is that due process required such an independent inquiry in the circumstances of these cases. \u201cIn order to prevail on [either] due process [claim], the plaintiffs] must prove that: (1) [they have] been deprived of . . . property [or liberty] interests] cognizable under the due process clause; and (2) the deprivation of the property [or liberty] interesfs] has occurred without due process of law. See <em>Double I Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>218 Conn. 65, 76, 588 A.2d 624 (1991); <em>Connecticut Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 293, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989) (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 437, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 241-42, 610 A.2d 574 (1992) . We thus address, seriatim, the nature of the property interests at stake and whether the plaintiffs were deprived of those interests without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">We first consider the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 property interests in receiving general assistance extensions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The defendants argue that, for two reasons, the plaintiffs had no such property interests at any time. The defendants first contend that no one has an \u201centitlement\u201d to receiving an extension under \u00a7 17b-118, because that statute provides only that \u201c[a] town <em>may </em>extend the period during which assistance is granted by <em>up to </em>three months for recipients who are in compliance with program requirements. . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) The defendants next contend that even if recipients who are eligible for extensions are entitled to receive those extensions, these plaintiffs had no property interests in the extensions because, having been suspended, they did not meet the eligibility requirements. The plaintiffs argue in response that everyone who is actually \u201cin compliance with program requirements\u201d\u2014e.g., everyone who has not actually \u201cwilfully failed to report for work\u201d\u2014has a property interest in receiving an extension.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants that a recipient who properly has been suspended from general assistance has no cognizable property interest in receiving an extension of benefits. We further conclude, however, that <em>before </em>a recipient properly has been suspended from general assistance, he or she <em>does </em>have a property interest in receiving the extension. If the plaintiffs were suspended in the absence of the constitutionally required procedural safeguards, therefore, then they would continue to have protected property interests in receiving the extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201cProperty interests are more than abstract needs, desires or unilateral expectations of benefits or privileges. Rather, a person must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to a benefit or privilege to have a property interest in that benefit. <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>[408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972)]. Property interests are not created by the Constitution, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law .... <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985), quoting <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 577; see also <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 709, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L.

Partnership </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The defendants first argue that the statute creates no property interests whatsoever in the receipt of general assistance extensions. We agree with the defendants that, under \u00a7 17b-118, Meriden had the discretion not to provide the extensions to anyone. We further agree with the defendants that, under the statute, Meriden continues to have discretion to provide extensions of varying durations on a case-by-case basis. Having elected pursuant to \u00a7 17b-118 to provide extensions to its residents, however, Meriden has <em>created </em>cognizable property interests in those extensions. Pursuant to the regulations implementing the statute, Meriden\u2019s election obligates it to provide extensions of benefits to all individuals who satisfy the eligibility requirements. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K]) (\u201c[e]ach town reserves the right to grant the three-month extension . . . [but if] a town chooses to</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>fund additional aid to its employable recipients, the town will uniformly apply the criteria set-forth in subsections 7. and 8. in each and every case\u201d); see also <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>226 Conn. 314, 322-23, 627 A.2d 909 (1993) (narrow circumscription of agency discretion to deny benefit demonstrates entitlement to benefit). Moreover, both statute and regulation constrain Meriden\u2019s ability arbitrarily to limit the duration of extensions among equally needy applicants. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (agency decisions may not be arbitrary or capricious); Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-20 (K) (9) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 X [K] [9]) (duration of extension should be based on individual recipient\u2019s need). Finally, pursuant to \u00a7 17b-118 and the implementing regulations, the extensions are designed not as new benefits for which individuals must separately apply, but rather as a continuation of benefits already being provided during the first nine months of the year.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For these reasons, \u201cthe interest of an individual in continued receipt of these benefits is a statutorily created 'property\u2019 interest protected by the [Fourteenth] Amendment.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S.

Ed. 2d 287 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Although we determine that Meriden\u2019s election to provide benefits pursuant to the statute and regulations did endow some individuals with property interests in the receipt of those extensions, we nevertheless reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that all recipients are entitled to extensions as long as they have not actually violated the statutory \u201cprogram requirements\u201d in \u00a7 17b-118. We conclude, rather, that recipients are entitled to extensions only if they are eligible for such extensions pursuant to the governing regulations. Section 17b-118 provides in relevant part that \u201cfinancial assistance granted . . . to an employable person <em>shall be limited </em>to no more than nine months in a twelve-month period. A town <em>may </em>extend the period during which assistance is granted by up to three months for recipients who are in compliance with program requirements. . . . The commissioner of social services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, Meriden is authorized to provide extensions of benefits only pursuant to the implementing regulations. Thus, in electing to provide extensions, Meriden created property interests in those extensions only as to those eligible for such extensions pursuant to the regulations. Cf. <em>Lavine </em>v. <em>Milne, </em>424 U.S. 577, 586, 96 S. Ct. 1010, 47 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1976) (no constitutional right to benefits prior to determination of eligibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Finally, although we conclude, as the defendants have argued, that only eligible individuals have property interests in receiving general assistance extensions, we reject the defendants\u2019 argument that these plaintiffs lacked such property interests. Before the plaintiffs\u2019 suspensions became final, the plaintiffs <em>were </em>eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>for the extensions under the governing regulations. At the time of the suspensions, therefore, the plaintiffs <em>did </em>have property interests in receiving the extensions. These property interests could be extinguished only if the plaintiffs were afforded due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Once the plaintiffs\u2019 suspensions became final, the suspensions ordinarily would have rendered the plaintiffs statutorily ineligible for further extensions and thereby would have extinguished their constitutionally protected property interests in such extensions. Nevertheless, the suspensions could have extinguished the plaintiffs\u2019 property interests in the extensions only if the plaintiffs were afforded due process <em>before </em>the suspensions became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In other words, the issue underlying all the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claims is whether the plaintiffs were provided due process <em>before </em>the suspensions became final. We thus turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The plaintiffs argue that they were denied due process in several respects, both before and after the suspensions became final. As noted above, however, we need to consider only those arguments that relate to the adequacy of the process provided before the plaintiffs\u2019 suspensions became final. There are two such contentions. First, the plaintiffs contend that it was unconstitutional for the regulations automatically to make them ineligible for the extensions at the time their suspensions became final, because, in doing so, the regulations created an unconstitutional \u201cirrebuttable presumption.\u201d Second, the plaintiffs argue that they were not provided (a) an adequate opportunity to contest the suspensions, (b) an adequate notice of their opportunity to contest the suspensions, or (c) an adequate notice of the fact that, if they failed to challenge the suspensions, they would be ineligible for the exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sions. We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 first argument and conclude that, as to the second, the inadequacy of the present administrative record will require a remand for determination of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We first conclude that it was not unconstitutional for the regulations automatically to make the plaintiffs ineligible for the extensions because of their previous suspensions. We assume, arguendo, that it is a violation of procedural due process for the government to deprive individuals of protected property interests by way of an \u201cirrebuttable presumption.\u201d <em>See Michael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 132, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring); id., 157 (White, J., dissenting); id., 136 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201c[f]ive Justices agree that the flaw inhering in a conclusive presumption that terminates a constitutionally protected interest without any hearing whatsoever is a <em>procedural </em>one\u201d [emphasis in original]); but see id., 120 (Scalia, J., for plurality) (previous cases that \u201cstruck down as illegitimate certain \u2018irrebuttable presumptions\u2019 . . . did not . . . rest upon <em>procedural </em>due process\u201d [citations omitted; emphasis in original]). Nevertheless, the regulations here are valid because they do not create an unconstitutional \u201cirrebuttable presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">At the outset, we are unpersuaded that the regulations create a \u201cpresumption\u201d at all. According to the plaintiffs, the regulations <em>embody </em>a presumption that those who failed to challenge previous suspensions actually were not \u201cin compliance with program requirements\u201d at the time of the suspensions. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however, depends on the same unstated premises we discussed in part I of this opinion. Specifically, the plaintiffs assume that, in making \u201ccompliance with program requirements\u201d a prerequisite to eligibility, \u00a7 17b-118 both makes \u201ccompliance with program requirements\u201d the only criterion for eligibility and ordains the exclusive list of \u201cprogram require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ments\u201d with which individuals must comply. If, however, the commissioner has the independent authority to impose eligibility criteria regardless of whether those criteria reflect \u201ccompliance with program requirements,\u201d or if the regulations themselves define the \u201cprogram requirements\u201d with which individuals must comply; see part I of this opinion; then the regulations do not embody a <em>presumption </em>at all. In either case, the regulations merely create a <em>substantive rule of law </em>that suspended individuals are not eligible for extensions. See <em>Parents Opposed to Punitive Support </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>998 F.2d 764, 767 (9th Cir. 1993) (no constitutional duty to consider evidence that child support award pursuant to \u201ceconomic table\u201d fails to \u201creflect the \u2018actual\u2019 cost of rearing [a] particular child\u201d because \u201ceconomic table is the implementation of a substantive rule of law\u201d); <em>Anetekhai </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>876 F.2d 1218,1223 (5th Cir. 1989) (law denying immediate relative status to aliens who marry citizens once deportation proceedings have commenced not unconstitutional; law does not embody a \u201c[presumption] that the marriage is fraudulent\u201d but merely sets out substantive rule that \u201cthe timing of [the] marriage places [the alien] in that class of aliens for whom a two-year nonresidency is required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Moreover, even if the plaintiffs\u2019 premises were correct, and the regulations were construed to embody a \u201cpresumption\u201d that suspended individuals are not \u201cin compliance with program requirements,\u201d the presumption is not \u201cirrebuttable.\u201d General assistance recipients <em>do </em>have an opportunity to prove that they are \u201cin compliance with program requirements\u201d by contesting the suspensions at the time those suspensions are imposed. A single opportunity to contest a presumption meets constitutional requirements. See <em>Michael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D., </em>supra, 491 U.S. 136 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (five justices agree about unconstitutionality of \u201cconclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>presumption that terminates a constitutionally protected interest <em>without any hearing whatsoever\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>13 Conn. App. 400, 405, 536 A.2d 995 (1988), aff'd, 209 Conn. 609, 553 A.2d 161 (1989) (where party had one opportunity to be heard, due process was not violated \u201cby the application of a procedural rule [that] deems a party to have consented to a motion because of her failure to meet the requirement of the rule regarding timely filing\u201d of opposition papers); cf. <em>Vlandis </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 93 S. Ct. 2230, 37 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1973) (presumption of nonresidency unconstitutional because not rebuttable at any time).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 alternate argument that they were denied due process in that they did not have (1) an adequate opportunity to contest the suspensions, (2) an adequate notice of their opportunity to contest the suspensions, or (3) an adequate notice of the fact that, if they failed to challenge the suspensions, they would be ineligible for the extensions. Because neither the state fair hearing officers nor the trial court considered these issues, we lack the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>record required to resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The record does not specify whether these plaintiffs were provided an opportunity to challenge their suspensions. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-64, 17b-63; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-3a-23 (E) (7) (General Assistance Policy Manual [1993 Ed.] c. I, \u00a7 XIII [E] [7]). The record also does not specify whether the plaintiffs were notified of their right to appeal the suspensions or the fact that an unchallenged suspension would lead to ineligibility for the extension.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We must, therefore, remand these cases to the commissioner to find the facts and resolve the claims in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Once the commissioner finds the relevant facts, her review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be governed by the <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>due process test. \u201c \u2018The United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors to consider when analyzing whether an individual is constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative procedure: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>[supra, 424 U.S. 335].\u2019 \u201d <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>226 Conn. 166,174, 627 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>414 (1993); <em>Scinto </em>v. <em>Stamm, </em>224 Conn. 524, 535, 620 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S. Ct. 176,126 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Previous opinions of this court and of the United States Supreme Court provide substantial guidance as to how the <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>test should be applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. We previously have noted that, because welfare benefits are available only to those who have no other means of support, the private interest in the receipt of such benefits is very significant. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>170 Conn. 610, 617, 368 A.2d 159 (1976). The United States Supreme Court has further held that, without substantial procedural guarantees, there are significant risks that welfare recipients will be erroneously deprived of their property interests in those benefits. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 266.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, even outside the context of welfare benefits, we have held that the due process clause requires, at a minimum, that the \u201cstate actor afford individuals notice of and an opportunity for a hearing before depriving them of their property interests. <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra, [470 U.S.] 542; <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 379, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(1971); <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>[209 Conn. 352, 372, 551 A.2d 710 (1988)].\u201d <em>Connecticut Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 299. \u201cParties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified. ... It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roundhouse Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 376-77, 362 A.2d 778, vacated, 423 U.S. 809, 96 S.

Ed. 2d 172 (1976) .</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">In sum, we conclude that the defendants were authorized to deny the extensions of benefits based solely on the previous suspensions, unless, at the time of those suspensions, the plaintiffs had been deprived of their property interests in the extensions without due process of law. The trial court implied, to the contrary, that the defendants never would be authorized to deny the extensions based solely on the previous suspensions, and it remanded the cases to the commissioner \u201cfor a new decision by the hearing officer, based on all the evidence in the record, including evidence concerning the validity of the suspension^] . . . .\u201d Because the current record does not demonstrate that the plaintiffs were denied due process at the time of the suspensions, we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s remand order was misdirected. Therefore, although we also remand the cases to the commissioner, we do so with different instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">On remand, the commissioner initially must determine whether at the time of the suspensions\u2014that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 property interests in the extensions purportedly were extinguished\u2014the plaintiffs received the process that was then due. If the plaintiffs were not provided adequate process at the time of their suspensions, then the commissioner may not uphold the denials of the extensions on the basis of the suspensions alone and must grant the extensions, unless there is some other valid, properly preserved reason to deny the extensions. See, e.g., footnote 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Each judgment is affirmed insofar as it ordered a remand to the commissioner, but each case is remanded with direction to amend the terms of that order of remand to comport with the requirements stated immediately above.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In this opinion Callahan, Borden, Norcott, Katz and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118 provides: \u201c(formerly sec. 17-273b). limitations ON ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYABLE PERSONS.

Unless the plaintiffs were denied due process at the time of the suspensions, however, the plaintiffs no longer had property interests in the extensions after the suspensions had become final. See part II A of this opinion. Even if it is unconstitutional to deprive an individual of a protected liberty or property interest by way of an irrebuttable presumption; see text, supra; there is no constitutional infirmity in applying an irrebuttable presumption when no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest is at stake. <em>SeeMichael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D., </em>supra, 491 U.S. 120-22, 127; id., 132 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); id., 133 (Stevens, J., concurring); id., 136 (Brennan, J., dissenting); id., 158, 160-61 (White, J., dissenting); see also <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 772-73, 777, 95 S.

The issue before this court is whether the commissioner of social services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (commissioner), in affirming the city of Meriden\u2019s refusal to extend the plaintiffs\u2019 general assistance benefits, correctly refused to consider evidence offered by the plaintiffs as to the reasons they had failed to comply with workfare requirements. The majority holds that this depends upon whether the plaintiffs were afforded due process when they initially were suspended for their alleged workfare violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>state law entitles such plaintiffs, when contesting a town\u2019s denial of the extension of general assistance benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to have the commissioner determine whether they were in compliance with the workfare rules. Furthermore, state law entitles such plaintiffs to have the commissioner make this determination without regard to a town\u2019s previous determination on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Each plaintiff in this case was provided with a hearing before the commissioner,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-64,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> during which he or she contested Meriden\u2019s refusal to extend general assistance benefits. At each hearing, the commissioner heard evidence that the recipient had not wilfully failed to report to work earlier in the year. Clarence Harkless, for example, testified that he had been unable to work because of medical problems related to a blood clot in his leg, and he submitted supporting medical documentation at the hearing. Michelle Lawson testified that she had tried to move out of state, but had returned to Connecticut after a friend died. Rufino Pabon, who is illiterate in English, testified that the person he thought was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>his supervisor indicated he had completed his workfare hours for the month, and that he believed he had completed the necessary hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The commissioner, however, refused to consider this evidence in making her determination of eligibility for the extended \u00a7 17b-118 benefits. She concluded that \u201c[rjegardless of the correctness of this suspension, the appellant was suspended for the three month period and this action was not contested or overturned. . . . It is simply too late to argue about the suspension that the appellant accepted and served, regardless of what led to the suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">This conclusion, in my view, was incorrect. The commissioner, in deciding whether the plaintiffs were eligible for the extended general assistance benefits, was required to determine if they were \u201cin compliance with program requirements.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-118. In making this determination, the commissioner was required, under a special statutory scheme applicable to welfare benefits, to conduct a de novo hearing; see General Statutes \u00a7 17b-64; and to \u201crender a final decision based upon all the evidence introduced before him.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-65 (formerly \u00a7 17-292\u00cd). It is clear that at such a hearing the \u201cstrict rules of evidence\u201d do not apply, and that the hearing \u201cmust be conducted so as not to violate the fundamental rules of natural justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 536, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The legislature, by enacting a special process by which a poor person could appeal directly to the commissioner a town\u2019s determination that he or she was ineligible for subsistence benefits, demonstrated its deep concern about the rights that were at stake. The legislature recognized that subsistence for the poor\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>shelter, food and medical care\u2014is fundamental to life, and that the \u201cstakes are simply too high\u201d for a poor person to be denied a full and meaningful hearing before benefits are terminated or denied. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 266, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1970). The purpose of the special review process was obviously remedial, and the procedures were designed to protect the rights of the poor to assure that they were not wrongfully deprived of welfare benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The review provisions, therefore, must be liberally construed in favor of this class of poor persons. <em>See Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 395, 465 A.2d 308 (1983) (courts must apply \u201cthe rule of liberal construction in furtherance of the beneficent purposes for which the remedial legislation . . . was enacted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Accordingly, in cases such as these, where the commissioner has not previously determined whether the recipient of general assistance benefits wilfully failed to comply with program requirements, the commissioner must conduct a de novo review and make this determination. Therefore, I agree with the trial court that these cases should be remanded to the commissioner for a new decision, based upon all the evidence in the record, including evidence concerning the validity of the suspension of the plaintiffs\u2019 general assistance benefits by Meriden\u2019s welfare officials.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> The department of income maintenance was replaced by the department of social services on July 1, 1993.

See part IIB of the majority opinion. In such cases, due process requires that the recipient be provided with notice of the government\u2019s intent to act; <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314-15, 70 S.
