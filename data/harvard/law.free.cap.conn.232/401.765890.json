In a decision upholding the findings and conclusions of a hearing officer, the defendant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Timothy R.E. Keeney, commissioner of environmental protection, determined that the proposed marina, in its present configuration, would have significant adverse environmental consequences and therefore denied the application of the plaintiff, John Fraenza, for a structures and dredging permit pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 22a-361<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a tidal wetlands permit pursuant to Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>eral Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 22a-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-34 and 4-183.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of its review of the administrative record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and the arguments of counsel, the trial court rendered a judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The plaintiff then appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred his appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In this court, the plaintiff has raised eighteen issues that renew almost all the claims that he made in the trial court. He challenges the dismissal, on procedural grounds, of his appeal from the denial of a structures and dredging permit. He likewise challenges the dismissal, on substantive grounds, of his appeal from the denial of a tidal wetlands permit. He maintains, furthermore, that the defendant\u2019s actions have deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>him of any opportunity to develop his property as a marina and therefore constitute a constitutionally impermissible regulatory taking. In response to these various issues, the trial court filed a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision that thoroughly canvassed the applicable legal principles in a manner consistent with the statutes governing the regulation of tidal wetlands in statutorily designated coastal zones. Because that memorandum of decision fully states and meets the relevant arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. See <em>Fraenza </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 386, 655 A.2d 1113 (1994). No useful purpose would be served by a repetition of the discussion contained therein. See <em>Masotti </em>v. <em>Bristol Savings Bank, </em>232 Conn. 172, 175, 653 A.2d 179 (1995); <em>Advanced Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 378, 381, 650 A.2d 540 (1994); <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Refuse Gardens, Inc., </em>229 Conn. 455, 458-59, 642 A.2d 697 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\"> We will refer to the commissioner as the defendant because the commissioner apparently represents the interests of the defendant coastal resources management division of the department of environmental protection.

No sooner than thirty days and not later than sixty days of the receipt of such application, the commissioner or his duly designated hearing officer shall hold a public hearing on such application, provided, whenever the commissioner determines that the regulated activity for which a permit is sought is not likely to have a significant impact on the wetland, he may waive the requirement for public hearing after publishing notice, in a newspaper having general circulation in each town wherever the proposed work or any part thereof is located, of his intent to waive said requirement, except that the commissioner shall hold a hearing on such application upon receipt of a petition, signed by at least twenty-five persons, requesting such a hearing. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-34 provides in relevant part: \u201cappeal, (a) An appeal may be taken by the applicant or any person or corporation, municipal corporation or interested community group other than the applicant who has been aggrieved by such order from the denial, suspension or revocation of a permit . . . within thirty days after publication of such issuance, denial, suspension or revocation of any such permit to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain. If the court finds that the action appealed from is an unreasonable exercise of the police power, it may set aside the order. If the court so finds that the action appealed from constitutes the equivalent of a taking without compensation, and the land so regulated otherwise meets the interests and objectives of sections 22a-28 to 22a-35, inclusive, it may at the election of the commissioner (1) set aside the order or (2) proceed under the provisions of sections 48-12 to 48-14, inclusive, to award damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u201c(b) Such appeal shall be brought in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183, except venue for such appeal shall be in the judicial district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of Hartford-New Britain.

If the court finds such prejudice, it shall sustain the appeal and, if appropriate, may render a judgment under subsection (k) of this section or remand the case for further proceedings. For purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
