We conclude that the defendant has failed to establish such a violation and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The defendant was convicted after a jury trial of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>utes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced him to a total term of eight years imprisonment, suspended after three years, and three years probation with drug counseling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant filed posttrial motions for acquittal and for a new trial, both of which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Thereafter, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court challenging the manner in which his jury panel was selected. The Appellate Court affirmed the convictions without opinion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>31 Conn. App. 923, 626 A.2d 1 (1993). We granted certification<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and remanded the matter to the trial court for an eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>tiary hearing as to the circumstances surrounding the selection of venirepersons in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CR 89 371150 (September 12, 1991). The jurors in <em>Webb </em>were drawn from the same venire pool as the jurors in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular, we asked the trial court to determine whether a supplemental panel, requested for the <em>Webb </em>trial, was selected randomly and if the panel was not selected randomly, whether the selection process in the <em>Webb </em>case impermissibly tainted the venire panel from which the defendant\u2019s jury was selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On remand, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing and the parties filed briefs on the factual issues presented. The trial court found the following facts: \u201cAt all times pertinent to this question, as well as the second question, in the Hartford-New Britain judicial district, venirepersons were summoned for a four week period of service with a new group of venirepersons reporting for service on each Tuesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">\u201cOn May 15, 1991, <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb </em>was on trial. Mr. Webb was charged with capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54. On that date jury selection was proceeding before the Honorable Thomas H. Corrigan. Because of the nature of the case and the number of peremptory challenges, this case required a large number of venirepersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">\u201cAttorneys Fred DeCaprio and Ronald Gold had been appointed to represent Mr. Webb. On May 10, 1991, Mr. Webb began serving as his own attorney. On May 15, Webb was appearing pro se with attorneys DeCaprio and Gold as his stand-by counsel. DeCaprio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and Gold had obtained a copy of a newly released census report which indicated that 10.2 percent of the population of Hartford county was black. The attorneys, as well as Mr. Webb, were concerned by the underrepresentation of black people on the panel of venirepersons assigned to the trial. The panel which they would be working with that day consisted of thirty-six persons, two of whom were black. [Tjhis was less than the percentage indicated in the census report.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cPrior to the opening of court on the fifteenth both attorneys met with Mr. Webb. They discussed the underrepresentation and it was decided that the problem should be presented to the judge prior to the start of voir dire. There is a question as to Webb\u2019s participation in this decision. At the very least he was aware of what the attorneys intended to do and he did not object. Later in court he did object to the chambers conference without his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201cAt the request of Mr. Gold, a conference was held in chambers with Judge Corrigan. In attendance were attorneys DeCaprio and Gold as well as assistant state\u2019s attorneys Rosita M. Creamer and Dennis J. O\u2019Conner who were prosecuting the case. At this conference DeCaprio and Gold raised the issue of underrepresentation of black people on the jury and stated that Mr. Webb was considering a challenge to the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">\u201cMs. Diane Aviles was then a jury clerk for the Hartford-New Britain judicial district. Her duties included the drawing of names and the assembling of panels for voir dire using the procedure previously stated. At the chambers conference, with the attorneys present, Judge Corrigan called Ms. Aviles and inquired if there were any black jurors left in the assembly room. Ms. Aviles, who from her office could observe jurors in the assembly area, informed the judge that there appeared to be black jurors in attendance, but she could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>not tell if they were available. These were people who had been rejected or sent back from various juries. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201cAttorney Gold stated to the judge that if there were additional black persons they could simply be added to the panel. He reported that this had been done in another case in which he had been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\u201cJudge Corrigan then initiated a second telephone call to Ms. Aviles concerning additional black venirepersons. Ms. Aviles informed Judge Corrigan that she could provide an additional panel, but she could not guarantee that it would include black persons. Judge Corrigan asked Ms. Aviles to do so. The judge then informed counsel of the situation including the fact that the supplemental panel might not include minority persons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cJudge Corrigan\u2019s clerk, Lynne Williams, was then dispatched to the jury assembly room to get the supplemental panel. She observed Ms. Aviles assembling the panel by going to each individual juror rather than the usual procedure of calling the names and having the jurors report to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201cThe supplemental panel consisted of five venirepersons. Two members of the panel, Thomas Dukes and Jean Merrill were black. The supplemental panel was added to the panel which had been brought down for the morning. The voir dire oath was administered and the selection process in the <em>Webb </em>case resumed. Jean Merrill was selected for the case, Mr. Dukes was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\u201cAlthough some of the above facts are in dispute, the essential facts are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. What happened was that the jury clerk at the request of the trial judge, in response to a complaint from [the] defendant concerning the racial makeup of the panel assembled a supplemental panel hoping that it would contain [prospective] black jurors. Except for notifying the jurors individually of their assignment to the case the usual procedure before noted was used by the jury clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u201cThis conclusion was confirmed by Judge Corrigan\u2019s statement on the record addressed to Mr. Webb after the panel was administered the oath and removed from the courtroom and is supported and not directly contradicted by Ms. Aviles\u2019 testimony in 1991. If Ms. Aviles simply desired to accommodate the judge and provide more black venireperson[s] as suggested by Mr. Gold she could have done so by sending black jurors only. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\u201cIn answer to the specific question of the remand order it is found that additional venirepersons were selected for the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniel Webb, </em>[supra, Docket] No. CR89 371150, in the hope that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>make more minority venirepersons available in that case. The selection was not made on a non-random racial basis, however.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The defendant raises two issues in this appeal. He first claims that African-American venirepersons were purposefully directed to the <em>Webb </em>trial, thus depriving him of his state and federal constitutional right to a jury selected from a fair cross section of the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and on the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s finding that the selection of the supplemental panel in the <em>Webb </em>case was done in a random manner was clearly erroneous. Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings were supported by the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment requires that jury panels be drawn from a source representing a \u2018fair cross section\u2019 of the community in which the defendant is tried. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 536 [95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690] (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>788 F.2d 856, 864 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 883 [107 S. Ct. 271, 93 L. Ed. 2d 248] (1986). . . . [T]he Sixth Amendment guarantees the <em>opportunity </em>for a representative jury venire, not a representative venire itself. <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>822 F.2d 214, 229 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1052 [109 S. Ct. 1311, 103 L. Ed. 2d 580] (1989).\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>46 F.3d 1240,1244 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(2d Cir. 1995). In order to guarantee this right, Connecticut adopted General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 51-220a,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which requires that venire panels be randomly selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>In order for a defendant successfully to challenge the composition of his jury array, the \u201cdefendant must prove that: (1) the group claimed to be excluded is distinctive in the community, (2) the representation of the group in the jury pool is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of members of the group in the community, and (3) the underrepresentation is the result of systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364 [99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579] (1979).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>supra, 1245-46; see also Practice Book \u00a7 842;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 421, 481 A.2d 56 (1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because he has failed to demonstrate that any underrepresentation was \u201cthe result of systematic exclusion\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>supra, 1246; the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Our review of the factual findings of the trial court is limited to a determination of whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>228 Conn. 545, 548, 636 A.2d 1360 (1994); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061. \u201cA finding of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its <em>findings. Dalia v. Lawrence, </em>226 Conn. 51, 71, 627 A.2d 392 (1993), quoting <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency </em>v. <em>Landmark Investment Group, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 703, 708, 590 A.2d 968 (1991); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>223 Conn. 450, 458, 612 A.2d 1217 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Water Street Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Innopak Plastics Corp., </em>230 Conn. 764, 772, 646 A.2d 790 (1994). Nonetheless, because of the constitutional implications of the alleged defect in the jury selection process, we will subject the findings of the trial court to the same \u201cindependent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 259, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 294, 636 A.2d 351 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant posits four arguments that the trial court\u2019s factual determination that the supplemental venire panel drawn in <em>Webb </em>was randomly selected was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, the defendant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>because Aviles did not send to the courtroom the supplemental panel for the <em>Webb </em>case until after she had told the trial judge of its racial composition, the supplemental panel was not randomly selected. Whether a particular selection is random is determined at the time of the selection, and events occurring after that selection cannot affect its randomness. Thus, the mere fact that Aviles called the trial judge prior to sending him the selected panel could not have altered the randomness of the selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Second, along similar lines, the defendant argues that because Judge Corrigan specifically requested more African-Americans for the May 15 panel in <em>Webb, </em>the selection process could not have been random. These arguments must fail. Although it may be true that Judge Corrigan asked for additional African-Americans for the supplemental venire panel, this does not translate into a requred finding that the selection of the prospective jurors was accomplished by a nonrandom selection process simply to conform to the court\u2019s wishes. There is significant evidence on the record that the jury clerk refused purposefully to direct additional African-Americans to the panel. In addition, Judge Corrigan stated in <em>Webb </em>that the only way that he could accommodate the defendant\u2019s concerns about the array would be to call for a supplemental panel in the \u201chope\u201d that it would contain additional African-American persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Third, the defendant argues that because the five juror supplemental panel was 40 percent African-American,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the United States 1990 census report indicated that the population of Hartford county was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>10.2 percent African-American, the process could not have been random. This argument fails, however, because the fact that the selection process yielded an unlikely result, namely, an unusually high percentage of African-American venirepersons, is not proof that the process was nonrandom. \u201c[RJarity . . . itself shouldn\u2019t necessarily be evidence of anything. ... In some contexts, improbabilities are to be expected.\u201d J. Paulos, Innumeracy\u2014Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences (1988) p. 40. Indeed, \u201cit would be very unlikely for unlikely events not to occur.\u201d Id., p. 28. The defendant has not demonstrated by the occurrence of an unlikely result that the selection process was nonrandom.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that Aviles\u2019 testimony in a hearing in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendall C., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CR 89 375242 (May 31, 1991), demonstrates that the selection of the supplemental panel was nonrandom.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At this hearing, held two weeks after the selection of the venire pool in <em>Webb, </em>Aviles testified that she may have deviated from the procedure she used in other cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At the remand hearing ordered by this court, held more than two years after the <em>Kendall C. </em>hearing, Aviles testified that, although she could not specifically remember what she had done in selecting the supplemental panel in <em>Webb, </em>she would not have deviated from her usual procedure. Despite the apparent inconsistencies in Aviles\u2019 testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>mony, we are not persuaded from the record that the procedure that she used in selecting the supplemental panel was not random. The trial court reasonably could have found from the evidence that Aviles\u2019 only deviation from her usual procedure was that she approached the individual venirepersons whom she had randomly selected and inquired whether they already had been called for the <em>Webb </em>case. Although the record is not explicit as to why Aviles deviated from her routine, it was reasonable for the trial court to have drawn the inference that she saw no purpose in sending up venirepersons who had already been rejected. Nothing in the record indicates that her actions had any effect on the randomness of the selection.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We are unpersuaded that the defendant\u2019s arguments, individually or collectively, demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s finding was not supported by the record. The defendant has failed to direct our attention to any fact or portion of the record, nor have we discovered any, that demonstrates that the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding that the supplemental panel in <em>Webb </em>had been randomly selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">We next consider whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>sumption of innocence. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction reduced the state\u2019s burden of proof or shifted that burden to the accused in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and a jury trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Specifically, the defendant challenges the following sentence from the jury instructions: \u201cA reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned. . . . It is . . . such a doubt as in the serious affairs which concern you in your everyday life you would pay some strict attention to.\u201d We have repeatedly and consistently upheld identical or substantially similar instructions on reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 254 n.22, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 353, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993), and cases cited therein. \u201cIn our previous cases, we concluded that this instruction did not decrease the state\u2019s burden of proof when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole. . . . In this case, the jury charge, taken as a whole, presents an accurate definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 254 n.22. The defendant has provided no compelling reason to depart from this long line of precedent and we therefore decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s instructional caveat that \u201cyou must keep in mind that those rules were made to protect the innocent and not the guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here again, the challenged language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>identical or substantially similar to language we have recently upheld. \u201cIdentical challenges were recently resolved against defendants in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>[227 Conn. 32, 66-67, 630 A.2d 990 (1993)], <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>226 Conn. 618, 651-52, 629 A.2d 1067 (1993), and State v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674,695-96, 613 A.2d 788 (1992). Our recent line of cases is dispositive. Those instructions, and any deviation from the previously approved language of those instructions did not, when viewed in the context of the entire charge, dilute the defendants presumption of innocence or lessen the state\u2019s burden of proof . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 135, 635 A.2d 762 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s charge, when taken in its entirety, was sufficient to inform the jury that the defendant was entitled to a presumption of innocence unless and until the state proved him guilty and that it was the state\u2019s burden to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court\u2019s instructions were not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> Although the defendant asks us to review his claims under both the sixth and the fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the Connecticut constitution, our decision is limited to the United States constitution because the defendant has failed to provide an independent analysis of the state constitutional issues. \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . .

I made no count last night, but apparently your counsel did and they indicated to the Court that there were only two blacks on the panel of thirty-six, at which point I called upstairs to find out if there were any additional people who were brought in yesterday and was informed that I had them all except for four people who [had] other things to do this week, so that I was getting all the panel that was coming in yesterday.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\u201cThen I asked the jury clerk if there were any other black jurors up there who came in previously that could be added to the panel and she said there was no way of denoting that and that she didn\u2019t want to walk up to any particular black juror and ask them to sit on a particular panel. <em>So, her only avenue was then to make a selection of an additional number of people, hoping that there would be some black furors on that additional number.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">In response to a complaint by the defendant that the venire panel was still underrepresentative, Judge Corrigan explained: \u201cIn fact, even that didn\u2019t really, in my own mind, have to be done. And I feel that it was a considerable accommodation at your request to attempt to do it. And I grant that the mechanics weren\u2019t as efficient as I thought they might be, but on your attorneys\u2019 first communication it was my purpose to go out there right then and start and have you make your challenge sometime later because I didn\u2019t feel you were entitled. But, on second thought when your attorneys suggested that I call upstairs and find out whether there were black venire people available, I did so.

The defendant, however, makes no effort to connect this ruling to the randomness of the selection process. We note, however, that Judge Miano\u2019s decision to dismiss the jury was made without the benefit of testimony or evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and without firsthand knowledge of the selection process in <em>Webb.
