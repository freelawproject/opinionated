We conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to have considered the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The facts are undisputed. On May 12, 1992, the defendant, the state of Connecticut, terminated Good-son from his employment as a correction officer at the John R. Manson Youth Institution, a state correctional facility. Goodson and his collective bargaining agent, the plaintiff American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 387 (union), challenged the termination by filing a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in effect between the union and the defendant. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>On July 9, 1992, the plaintiffs brought a petition in the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 52-422, seeking an order reinstating Goodson as an employee pending the disposition of the grievance. At the time the plaintiffs brought their petition, the parties were awaiting a conference with the director of personnel and labor relations provided for by Step III of the grievance procedure; see footnote 2; which was scheduled for August 18, 1992. The parties had not yet begun arbitration, which was to be the next phase of the grievance procedure. See footnote 2. On August 6, 1992, after a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, the trial court ordered that Goodson be reinstated temporarily until September 3, 1992, and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court\u2019s order was contrary to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and to the language and purpose of \u00a7 52-422. While the appeal was pending, the Appellate Court ordered the parties to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment, mootness and the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4049 and 4053. Thereafter, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal without articulating the grounds therefor, and this court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to review that dismissal. <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>224 Conn. 926, 619 A.2d 850 (1993). We reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court, concluding that: (1) the trial court\u2019s order was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>a final judgment; (2) because the issue was capable of repetition, the controversy was not moot; and (3) the defendant was not required to seek review under \u00a7\u00a7 4049 and 4053. We thereafter remanded the case to the Appellate Court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s original claims. <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 106, 118, 635 A.2d 285 (1993). While the remand was pending, however, we transferred the appeal back to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In addition to its original claims that the trial court\u2019s order was contrary to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and \u00a7 52-422, the defendant now contends that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 petition. Although this claim was raised by the defendant for the first time just prior to oral argument before this court, a challenge to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction may be made at any time. <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>205 Conn. 290, 294, 533 A.2d 208 (1987). Because the jurisdictional issue had to be resolved before a decision on the merits could be rendered; Gal<em>land </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>204 Conn. 330, 333, 527 A.2d 1192 (1987); we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs to aid us in deciding the question of jurisdiction. We conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 petition and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 petition requesting an order reinstating Goodson pursuant to \u00a7 52-422 because the statute by its express terms applies only to <em>parties to an arbitration. </em>See footnote 1. The defendant claims that because on August 6, 1992, the date the trial court conducted its hearing and entered its order, Goodson had not filed for arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tion, Goodson could not have been a \u201cparty to the arbitration,\u201d and thus the trial court had no authority to act under the statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">An application for an order pendente lite pursuant to \u00a7 52-422 is a special statutory proceeding. \u201cThe statute confers a definite jurisdiction upon a judge and it defines the conditions under which such relief may be given .... In such a situation jurisdiction is only acquired if the essential conditions prescribed by statute are met. If they are not met, the lack of jurisdiction is over the subject-matter and not over the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Guilford Yacht Club Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northeast Dredging, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 10, 13, 468 A.2d 1235 (1984); see also <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 433-34, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Dugan v. Milledge, </em>196 Conn. 591, 595, 494 A.2d 1203 (1985). By its express terms, \u00a7 52-422 allows the trial court to issue an order only \u201cupon application of any party to the arbitration . . . .\u201d Thus, a pending arbitration is an essential condition that must exist before \u00a7 52-422 may be invoked. It is undisputed that on the date the trial court conducted its hearing and entered its order, there was no pending arbitration. The essential condition prescribed by the statute was not met, therefore, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 petition pursuant to \u00a7 52-422.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-422 provides: \u201corder pendente lite. At anytime before an award is rendered pursuant to an arbitration under this chapter, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when said court is not in session, any judge thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>upon application of any party to the arbitration, may make forthwith such order or decree, issue such process and direct such proceedings as may be necessary to protect the rights of the parties pending the rendering of the award and to secure the satisfaction thereof when rendered and confirmed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> The relevant portions of the collective bargaining agreement relating to the grievance procedure provide: \u201cARTICLE 12 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cSECTION SIX.
