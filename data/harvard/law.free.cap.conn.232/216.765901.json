Booth, a former employee of the plaintiff. The trial court concluded that the funds, which constitute payment for accumulated sick leave and for a salary increase that became payable upon the termination of the defendant\u2019s employment, are \u201cearnings\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> exempt from prejudgment garnishment, and, on that basis, denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The facts material to this appeal are undisputed. The defendant, a tenured music teacher in the town of East Hartford, resigned from his employment with the plaintiff. Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s union, the East Hartford Education Association, the defendant was entitled to payment for unused sick leave that he had accumulated as of the date of his resignation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant also was entitled to compensation for a salary increase awarded under the collective bargaining agreement but not payable until the termination of his employment with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In total, the plaintiff owes the defendant $20,031.30 as payment for salary and accumulated sick leave.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The plaintiff commenced this action seeking indemnification from the defendant for any judgment rendered against the plaintiff in two pending civil suits in which it is a defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon its filing of this action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the plaintiff applied for an order authorizing the prejudgment garnishment of $20,031.30.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied the application, concluding that because the funds constitute \u201cearnings\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a, they are exempt from prejudgment garnishment under \u00a7 52-278b.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Under \u00a7 52-350a (5), \u201cearnings\u201d are exempt from prejudgment garnishment if they constitute a debt \u201caccruing by reason of personal services, including any compensation payable by an employer to an employee for such personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus or otherwise.\u201d By the express terms of \u00a7 52-278b (2), if this exemption is applicable, the plaintiff is precluded from recourse to any prejudgment remedy. We agree with the trial court that this exemption, which affords broad protection against the prejudgment garnishment of income obtained through the performance of personal services, applies to the plaintiffs obligation to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, the defendant was entitled to payment for all of the unused sick leave that he had accumulated as of the date of the termination of his employment with the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s entitlement to payment for accumulated sick leave derived directly from the work that he had performed when he could otherwise have availed himself of the sick leave to which he was entitled under the collective bargaining agreement. Indeed, by compensating employees for accumulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sick leave, the plaintiff encouraged employees to work instead of using the leave to which they had become entitled. Therefore, because the defendant\u2019s right to payment for accumulated sick leave accrued by reason of the personal services he had performed for the plaintiff, the leave payment to which the defendant was entitled constitutes \u201cearnings\u201d as defined by \u00a7 52-350a (5). Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, payment for accumulated sick leave is exempt from garnishment prior to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The collective bargaining agreement also entitled the defendant to a salary increase, payable upon the termination of his employment. The salary payment to which the defendant was entitled constitutes deferred compensation for personal services performed by the defendant during the course of his employment. Because the term \u201cearnings,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 52-350a (5), includes <em>\u201cany compensation payable </em>by an employer to an employee for . . . personal services\u201d (emphasis added), deferred salary payments, like payments for accumulated sick leave, are not subject to prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Notwithstanding the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 52-278b and 52-350a, the plaintiff claims that the legislature intended to exempt from prejudgment garnishment only wage payments made prior to the termination of the employment relationship. The plaintiff further contends that the payments it is obligated to give to the defendant for salary and accumulated sick leave are properly characterized as a \u201cseverance payment\u201d and a \u201clump sum fringe benefit,\u201d respectively, and that the defendant\u2019s right to those payments accrued solely by reason of the termination of his employment rather than \u201cby reason of [his] personal services.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The statutory construction urged by the plaintiff is inconsistent with the language of \u00a7 52-350a (5), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>defines \u201cearnings\u201d as <em>\u201cany debt </em>accruing by reason of personal services . . . whether denominated as <em>wages, salary, commission, bonus or otherwise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Contrary to the plaintiffs claim, therefore, the definition of the term \u201cearnings\u201d under \u00a7 52-350a (5) includes periodic wage payments but is not limited thereto.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, there is nothing in the definition of \u201cearnings\u201d under \u00a7 52-350a (5) to suggest that the legislature intended to limit the exemption from prejudgment garnishment only to those debts payable prior to the termination of the employment relationship. Because \u00a7 52-350a (5) makes no distinction between payments made before the termination of the employment relationship and those made thereafter, a payment made after the termination of the relationship may constitute \u201cearnings\u201d exempt from prejudgment garnishment so long as the obligation underlying the payment accrued by reason of the performance of personal services. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the payments to which the defendant is entitled are not, as the plaintiff claims, benefits arising solely out of the termination of the defendant\u2019s employment. Rather, they constitute compensation for the performance of past personal services by the defendant that became payable at the termination of his employment with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The plaintiff also asserts that its construction of the term \u201cearnings\u201d as synonymous with wages is supported by certain testimony given during the committee hearings on the proposed amendment to \u00a7 52-278b establishing the exemption.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the testimony of two proponents of the amendment indicates that the primary purpose of the exemption was to prevent the prejudgment garnishment of wages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We cannot imply from the brief statements of these two witnesses, however, that the legislature intended to limit the exemption to wages. Moreover, during the floor debate on the proposed legislation, each of the legislators who commented on the exemption of earnings from prejudgment garnishment described the exemption in terms of \u201cearnings\u201d rather than \u201cwages.\u201d For example, Representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Douglas C. Mintz stated that \u201cthis bill makes it perfectly clear that <em>earnings </em>cannot be garnished prior to judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1990 Sess., p. 1280. Similarly, Senator Anthony V. Avallone commented that \u201c[tjhis bill clarifies that <em>earnings </em>cannot be garnished before a judgment\u201d; (emphasis added) 33 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1990 Sess., p. 484; and Senator Richard Blumenthal explained that the purpose of the exemption is \u201cto clarify that there shall be no garnishment of <em>earnings </em>prior to a judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1990 Sess., p. 2642. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim that the legislature intended to limit the scope of the term \u201cearnings\u201d to include only wages finds no support in the legislative history of \u00a7 52-278b.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly denied the plaintiffs application for a prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278b provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, no prejudgment remedy shall be available to a person in any action at law or equity . . .

Under the collective bargaining agreement, the defendant also was authorized to take sick leave for certain absences not related to illness, including absences for personal reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> In order to forestall layoffs and the elimination of programs, the defendant\u2019s union, on behalf of the defendant and the other members of his bargaining unit, agreed to defer the payment of certain salary increases awarded to bargaining unit members under the collective bargaining agreement. The salary deferral agreement provides in relevant part: \u201c1. The East Hartford Board of Education and the East Hartford Education Association agree to a fifty-nine (59%) percent reduction of the teacher salary increase for 1991-92 after step advancements. 2. The East Hartford Board of Education and the East Hartford Education Association agree to have the above money repaid in a lump sum to each teacher when they end (separation of service) employment with the East Hartford Board of Education. ... 4. The East Hartford Board of Education and the East Hartford Education Association agree that there will be no teacher layoffs and no elimination of programs for the 1991-92 school year unless, consistent with past practice, student enrollment declines. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> The record indicates only that the plaintiff owes the defendant a total of $20,031.30. The record does not reveal how that debt is apportioned between accumulated sick leave and deferred salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> The actions were brought against the plaintiff and the defendant by two former East Hartford students, who claim that the defendant had sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ually assaulted them during the course of his employment with the plaintiff. The former students seek damages against the plaintiff for alleged negligence in its hiring and supervision of the defendant.

Because the term \u201cearnings\u201d as defined by \u00a7 52-350a (5) is not limited to wages, the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on definitions of the term \u201cwages\u201d is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> Although the scope of \u00a7 52-278b is broad, we recognize that not every asset traceable to employment necessarily constitutes \u201cearnings\u201d under \u00a7 52-350a (5). Whether a payment obligation constitutes \u201cearnings\u201d exempt from prejudgment garnishment is a determination to be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> Both the plaintiff and the defendant rely on cases decided under the federal Consumer Credit and Protection Act (act); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671 et seq.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to support their claims. The act, which limits the percentage of earnings that may be subject to garnishment, defines the term \u201cearnings\u201d in language similar to that of \u00a7 52-350a (5). See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672 (a). Neither party, however, has cited to a case decided under the act involving payments for accumulated sick leave or salary payable upon the termination of the employment relationship. See, e.g., <em>Kokoszka </em>v. <em>Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 94 S. Ct. 2431, 41 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1974) (tax refund not \u201cearnings\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>International Venture Investments, Ltd., </em>622 F. Sup. 667 (N.D.

PL 1982) (vacation pay constitutes \u201cearnings\u201d subject to act\u2019s limitation on garnishment). The cases under the act on which the parties rely, therefore, do not bear directly on the issue raised by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> Senate Bill 265, introduced in 1990 as an amendment to \u00a7 52-278b and subsequently enacted as No. 90-149 of the 1990 Public Acts, established the exemption from prejudgment garnishment for \u201cearnings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> Raphael L.
