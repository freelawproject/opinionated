App. 656, 674, 630 A.2d 1340 (1993). The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (E) prohibits constitutionally protected conduct, and invalidated that provision as unconstitutionally overbroad under the first amendment to the United States constitution. Id., 668. The Appellate Court, however, concluded that, because \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (C), \u201cdoes not involve protected speech, we need not analyze either the fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>eral or state constitutional provisions that guarantee freedom of expression.\u201d Id., 672. Further, the Appellate Court stated that \u201c[b]ecause we conclude that [subdivision (2) (C)] does not involve protected speech and [subdivision (2) (E)] is void for overbreadth [under the federal constitution], we need not determine if the state constitution affords greater free speech protection than the federal constitution.\u201d Id., 672 n.13. Concurring in the judgment, Judge Schaller agreed that subdivision (2) (E) is unconstitutional and that subdivision (2) (C) passes constitutional muster, but only after he first determined that subdivision (2) (C) warranted free speech analysis and then analyzed it under the Connecticut constitution, which in his view \u201cencompasses a broader spectrum of speech protections than those afforded under the first amendment.\u201d Id., 676 (Schaller, <em>J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal on the issues of the statute\u2019s constitutionality both on its face and as applied to the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to cross appeal on the issue of whether subdivision (2) (E) is overbroad in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion as to subdivision (2) (C), but reject its determination that subdivision (2) (E) is void for overbreadth. Further, although we concur in the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion as to subdivision (2) (C), we disagree with its analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims pertaining to that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The videotape and audio cassette recording in the record of this case demonstrate the following undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The occasion was Governor William A. O\u2019Neill\u2019s budget address to the General Assembly in the Hall of the House of Representatives. The governor, Lieutenant Governor Joseph Fauliso and other state officials were on the podium. The lieutenant governor introduced the governor, and the audience applauded, with some whistling, for thirty-four seconds. The governor then spoke without interruption for approximately two minutes, when his speech was interrupted by applause and whistles for approximately twenty-two seconds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He then continued speaking without interruption for approximately four minutes, when he was again interrupted by applause and whistles for approximately seventeen seconds. He then continued speaking for approximately two minutes, when he was interrupted by applause and whistles for approximately eighteen seconds. He then continued speaking for approximately one minute, when the incident in question occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The defendant and others were in the gallery of the Hall of the House. The gallery is located directly behind and above the podium, and is the only place in the Hall where members of the public, not otherwise permitted to be either on the floor of the House or on the podium itself, are permitted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is obvious that anything of any significance that occurred in the front part of the gallery, at the railing overlooking the podium, was within the line of vision of persons in the Hall, who generally faced the podium as the governor delivered his speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The defendant unfurled a large pink banner that was tied to the railing with string or rope. Gauging by its comparison to the people behind it, we estimate the size of the banner to be approximately 6 feet by 9 feet. On the banner, within a triangle, was the legend, in large block letters: \u201cWE DEMAND LESBIAN AND GAY RIGHTS, BILL.\u201d The content of this message had nothing to do with the content of the governor\u2019s speech, either generally or at that particular moment; the speech was devoted to budgetary matters. Simultaneously, the defendant and others chanted or shouted in loud voices, \u201cgay rights lesbian rights,\u201d over and over again without stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The chanting and the presence of the unfurled banner, facing the audience in the Hall of the House, continued unabated for approximately one minute and twenty-five seconds. During this period the governor stopped speaking and the audience can be seen on the videotape looking up in the direction of the banner and the chanting. Also, at some point after the banner was unfurled and the chanting began, but after the governor had stopped speaking, the governor looked over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>his left shoulder in the direction of the banner and the chanting. At the end of the one minute and twenty-five seconds, a cap\u00edtol security officer entered the gallery, seized the banner by untying or tearing it from the railing, and arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The defendant claims that subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) of \u00a7 2-ld (a) are impermissibly vague, facially and as applied, in violation of the United States constitution. The defendant also claims that these provisions are overbroad in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution. The defendant contends that these provisions, on their face, impermissibly sweep within their proscriptions speech that may not be punished by the government. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">We first consider whether these provisions are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the United States constitution. \u201cUnder the requirements of due process of law mandated by our federal and state constitutions, a penal statute must be sufficiently definite to enable a person to know what conduct he must avoid. <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 696, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 59-60, 428 A.2d 322 (1980); <em>see Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 77, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 46, 470 A.2d 688 (1984) [overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>203 Conn. 484, 525 A.2d 1315 (1987)]. [A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 60.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 469-70, 534 A.2d 230 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201c \u2018[P]erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.\u2019 <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498-99, 102 S. Ct. 1186, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362, reh. denied, 456 U.S. 950, 102 S. Ct. 2023, 72 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 803-804, 640 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We apply these principles to determine whether subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) of the statute are vague on their face.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We turn first to subdivision (2) (C), which provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of interfering with the legislative process when he . . . [ajlone or in concert with others, with intent to do so, disturbs, disrupts or interferes with, or attempts to disturb, disrupt or interfere with, any session, meeting or proceeding of the general assembly or either house thereof or any committee of the general assembly or either house thereof, whether within or outside the presence of said general assembly, either house thereof or any such committee by . . . making unreasonable noise.\u201d The plain language of this provision, therefore, proscribes only those instances of \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d that: (1) actually interfere with the legislative process; (2) were specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cally intended to interfere with the legislative process; and (3) were causally connected to the resulting interference. Fairly and reasonably interpreted, and viewed in its entirety, this subdivision is not vague on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The defendant claims that this subdivision is vague on its face because it \u201csupplies no objective standard by which to judge whether noise is \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d She contends that \u201c[i]n many instances, \u2018reasonable noise\u2019 is undoubtedly just as disturbing to the legislative process as is \u2018unreasonable noise.\u2019 Presumably, reasonable noise is that which is acceptable to those who enforce the rules, and unreasonable noise is that which is unacceptable. It could be otherwise only if the statute defined \u2018unreasonable\u2019 by objective standards that could be applied consistently, without reference to the meaning of a person\u2019s noise or the variable sensibilities of the enforcement officials.\u201d We are unpersuaded that the scope of this subdivision bestows upon officials such unfettered discretion; instead, we conclude that the totality of the language of the statute both provides fair notice to potential noisemakers and sufficiently constrains official discretion to enforce the statute such that the subdivision does not \u201cchill\u201d free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Although the defendant cites various state and federal precedents that have invalidated statutes due to facial vagueness, she has cited to none that invalidate a statute because of the infirmities from which this subdivision of \u00a7 2-ld (a) is alleged to suffer. As the Appellate Court correctly observed, the phrase \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d lacks a vague quality because the term \u201cunreasonable\u201d denotes objectivity based on the circumstances. Because this statute is clearly related only to the disruption of official legislative proceedings, we are persuaded that an individual \u201cwould have little difficulty identifying conduct that would lead to such a result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 812; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 112, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). \u201cWe do not have here a vague, general \u2018breach of the peace\u2019 ordinance, but a statute written specifically for the [legislative] context, where the prohibited disturbances are easily measured by their impact on the normal activities of the [General Assembly]. Given this \u2018particular context,\u2019 the ordinance gives \u2018fair notice to those to whom [it] is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Groyned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 112. This is particularly true in light of the fact that conviction under the statute requires the state to prove that the defendant possessed the specific intent to interfere with the legislative process. The specific intent requirement precludes conviction based on an unintended interference. General Statutes \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (C); see <em>Houston, </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 474, 107 S. Ct. 2502, 96 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1987) (Powell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201cintent to interfere\u201d element \u201cwould make the language of the ordinance more precise, and possibly satisfy the concern as to vagueness\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Moreover, this subdivision does not employ any terms that have been found to denote a subjective standard based on the varying sensibilities of law enforcement officials. See, e.g., <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 358-60, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983) (phrase \u201ccredible and reliable identification\u201d unconstitutionally vague because it encourages \u201carbitrary enforcement\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971) (prohibiting individuals from \u201cconducting] themselves in a manner annoying to person passing by\u201d unconstitutionally vague because it creates \u201cunascertainable standard . . . in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all\u201d). On the contrary, as noted by the Appellate Court, this subdivision\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d increased the precision and objectivity of the rest of the subdivision\u2019s language, which is similar to language previously found not to be unconstitutionally vague. See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 113-14 (\u201cnoise or diversion which disturbs\u201d not unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Additionally, although the defendant has not specifically challenged the statute\u2019s use of the terms \u201cdisturbs,\u201d \u201cdisrupts\u201d and \u201cinterferes\u201d under her vagueness analysis of this subdivision of the statute, we believe that the narrow meaning of these terms helps this subdivision to pass facial vagueness scrutiny. As the Appellate Court properly observed, \u201c[t]he statute itself does not define \u2018disturb,\u2019 \u2018disrupt,\u2019 \u2018interfere\u2019 or \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 Dictionary definitions, however, clarify the meanings of these words. \u2018Disrupt\u2019 means \u2018to upset the order of,\u2019 or \u2018throw into confusion or disorder\u2019; \u2018disturb\u2019 means \u2018to break up or destroy the tranquility or settled state of\u2019; \u2018interfere\u2019 means \u2018impede.\u2019 American Heritage Dictionary (1981).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 664-65. Further, in previously concluding that the term \u201cinterferes\u201d within the disorderly conduct statute is not unconstitutionally vague, we interpreted that term to mean \u201cdisturbs or impedes the lawful activity of another person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 818, 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Construing the language \u201cdisturbs, disrupts or interferes with\u201d in light of the statute as a whole; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>189 Conn. 321, 326, 455 A.2d 1335 (1983); we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>are persuaded that the meanings of these terms do not depend on the subjective views of particular individuals. On the contrary, because \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) expressly concerns itself only with how conduct affects official legislative functions such as sessions, meetings or proceedings, rather than how such conduct may affect a particular legislator or other individual, we conclude that the subdivision is limited to actual impediments to the legislative process based on the objective qualities of the conduct. Thus, expressive conduct only \u201cdisturbs, disrupts or interferes with\u201d within the meaning of the statute if it can be characterized as doing so without reference to any particular message that it may express. Consequently, expressive conduct does not result in a violation of the statute merely because it causes a particular legislator, or legislators, to become subjectively upset, bothered or otherwise disquieted. In other words, law enforcement officials can only arrest and prosecute persons if some objective quality of their conduct, such as its timing, duration or intensity, creates an impediment to the legislature\u2019s proceedings. As a result, these terms have sufficiently definite meanings and help place individuals on adequate notice as to what conduct, expressive or otherwise, is prohibited. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1989) (\u201c[wjhile these standards are undoubtedly flexible, and the officials implementing them will exercise considerable discretion, perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We next address whether subdivision (2) (E) is unconstitutionally vague on its face. Subdivision (2) (E), like subdivision (2) (C), expressly punishes a person for interfering with the legislative process when that person \u201cwith intent to do so, disturbs, disrupts or interferes with . . . any session, meeting or proceeding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the general assembly . . . whether within or outside the presence of said general assembly . . . .\u2019\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2). The only substantive difference between these provisions is that subdivision (2) (C) prohibits an individual from creating such interference by \u201cmaking unreasonable noise\u201d and subdivision (2) (E) prohibits an individual from creating such interferences by \u201cperforming any other act which disturbs, disrupts or interferes . . . .\u201d Because we have determined that subdivision (2) (C) is not unconstitutionally vague on its face under the United States constitution, our vagueness inquiry as to subdivision (2) (E) turns on one narrow question: does the use in subdivision (2) (E) of the phrase \u201cperforming any other act,\u201d when construed in light of the statute as a whole, render it unconstitutionally vague?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The defendant argues that \u201c[a] reasonable person reading the statute is unable to determine in advance whether clapping, cheering, hanging a banner, carrying a sign, or performing <em>any other act </em>is cause for arrest. The greater concern is that enforcement authorities are vested with virtually unlimited discretion to arrest or not arrest, based on their own subjective notions of what appears to be disturbing, disruptive or interfering with the legislative process.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Further, the defendant emphasizes that \u201c[i]t strains credulity to assert that, without further statutory, regulatory or judicial guidance, the Capitol Police would alight on a proper understanding of what the statute punishes and what it does not.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the use in subdivision (2) (E) of the phrase \u201cany other act,\u201d when viewed in light of our construction of the rest of the language of the statute, does not afford law enforcement officials unlimited discretion to arrest or not to arrest. In light of our interpretation of the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cdisturbs, disrupts or interferes with,\u201d both subdivisions (2) (C) <em>and </em>(2) (E) expressly prohibit officials from making arrests on the basis of their own subjective beliefs or viewpoints. Instead, under <em>both </em>provisions, officials can make an arrest only if the nature of an individual\u2019s conduct, rather than any viewpoint expressed by the conduct, creates interference with legislative proceedings. Further, under <em>both </em>subdivisions, the \u201cparticular context\u201d of an official legislative proceeding gives individuals adequate notice as to what would constitute interference. See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Moreover, as in the case of subdivision (2) (C), any imprecision in the language of subdivision (2) (E) is tempered by the specific intent requirement of the statute. The specific intent requirement decreases the possibility that an individual will unwittingly engage in punishable expressive conduct. See <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 474 (Powell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201cintent to interfere\u201d element \u201cwould . . . possibly satisfy the concern as to vagueness\u201d). Consequently, although we may agree with the defendant that the phrase \u201cany other act,\u201d in isolation, does not limit itself in a constitutionally precise manner, we conclude that subdivision (2) (E), when read as a whole, has a meaning that places individuals on sufficient notice as to what conduct it proscribes and adequately restricts the discretion of law enforcement officials. The words of subdivision (2) (E) \u201care marked by flexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity . . . but we think it is clear what the ordinance <em>as a whole </em>prohibits.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Additionally, the defendant cites to no relevant authority in support of her claim that subdivisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(2) (C) and (E) are unconstitutionally vague as applied to the present facts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, she merely states that the statute is unconstitutional because it \u201cdid not provide the defendant with reasonable notice that her activity was illegal and because the record shows that the police decision to arrest the defendant was made, without statutory guidance, in a setting where the defendant\u2019s behavior was set apart from that of others by the disapprobative content of her expression\u2014not the fact that she was engaged in expression.\u201d Her rendition of the problems with the statute, however, ignores the fact that her conviction pursuant thereto required a finding of: (1) a specific intent to interfere with the legislative process; (2) actual interference with the legislative process; and (3) a causal connection between the two. General Statutes \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (C) and (E). We are unconvinced that she could not know her conduct would fall within the parameters of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Further, the defendant\u2019s claim that law enforcement officials singled out her speech as \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d fails to persuade us that these provisions of the statute are vague as applied to her. Even if we assume the defendant\u2019s characterization that others in the audience in attendance made \u201cloud and sustained sounds of approval at numerous points in the speech\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey were not punished,\u201d our review of the record indicates that the audience responded to the normal flow of the governor\u2019s speech with appropriately timed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>and moderated levels of expression.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In contrast, the defendant\u2019s expression halted the governor in midsentence and prevented him from resuming his address to the legislature for nearly one and one-half minutes. We therefore concur with the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he <em>noise level </em>interfered with and caused a stopping of the governor\u2019s speech.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, although the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he fact is that the defendant was prosecuted under . . . [subdivision (2) (E)] for <em>unfurling a banner </em>bearing a political slogan\u201d and that such use of a banner is specifically permitted under capitol regulations, we are unpersuaded that the defendant did not know that her use of a large banner, in a position near the governor and in conjunction with her chanting, would subject her to arrest and prosecution under subdivision (2) (E) for interfering with the governor\u2019s speech. Thus, we conclude that subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) are not unconstitutionally vague under the United States constitution as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The defendant also contends that subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) of \u00a7 2-ld (a) are overbroad in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>first amendment to the United States constitution. <em>\u201cA </em>clear and precise enactment may ... be overbroad if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct. <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, [408 U.S.] 114. A single impermissible application of a statute, however, will not be sufficient to invalidate the statute on its face; rather, to be invalid, a statute must reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>[supra, 482 U.S. 458]; <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>[supra, 455 U.S. 494]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>supra, [203 Conn.] 707.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 472. A defendant may challenge a statute as facially overbroad under the first amendment, even if the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within the permissible scope of the statute, to vindicate two substantial interests: (1) eliminating the statute\u2019s \u201cchilling effect\u201d on others who fear to engage in the expression that the statute unconstitutionally prohibits; and (2) acknowledging that every defendant has the right not to be prosecuted for expression under a constitutionally over-broad statute.

As we outlined above, the plain language of \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (C) proscribes only those instances of \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d that: (1) actually interfere with the legislative process; (2) were specifically intended to interfere with the legislative process; and (3) were causally connected to the resulting interference. Thus, on its face, this statute does not prohibit speech or other expressive conduct unless and until the character of the conduct, not its message, impedes the legislative process. Further, the statute does not attempt to punish \u201cmaking unreasonable noise\u201d unless the actor does so with the specific intent to interfere with the legislative process. Similarly, the statute does not punish simply \u201cany other act\u201d under subdivision (2) (E), but only those acts that meet the above qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Nonetheless, the defendant claims that these provisions are overbroad due to various linguistic infirmi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ties. She cites the phrase \u201cwhether within or outside the presence of said general assembly, either house thereof or any such committee\u201d as creating \u201ca locational element in the statute that makes it apply <em>anywhere.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) She contends that, consequently, \u201c[cjivil rights protestors on the cap\u00edtol lawn who refuse to comply with an order to disperse . . . and who instead seek redress of their grievances by stamping their feet, clapping and singing would be subject to arrest. That is precisely the conduct held to be constitutionally protected and <em>not </em>prosecutable as a breach of peace.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Further, the defendant contends that the phrase \u201cmaking unreasonable noise\u201d is overbroad because although the term \u201cunreasonable\u201d ordinarily is susceptible to a dictionary definition, its union with the undefined term \u201cnoise,\u201d which is susceptible to many definitions, makes the entire phrase overbroad. Consequently, she contends that we must place a \u201cfighting words\u201d gloss on the entire phrase. Without such a gloss, in her view, \u201cpolitical messages delivered that are undesired may be judged unreasonable noises while welcomed messages will seem eminently reasonable.\u201d We are unpersuaded that this subdivision casts so wide a net.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In analyzing whether these subdivisions proscribe a substantial amount of protected conduct, we note at the outset that the first amendment in all contexts \u201c \u2018forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others.\u2019 <em>City Council of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 804 [104 S.

[Such locations include] streets and parks which \u2018have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\u2019 <em>Hague </em>v. <em>CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 515 [59 S. Ct. 954, 83 L. Ed. 1423] (1939). In these quintessential public forums, the government may . . . enforce regulations of the time, place, and manner of expression which are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 45. Such close scrutiny is appropriate in these forums because such properties possess long-standing traditions of public usage. R.

In other words, \u201cthe constraint imposed upon the Government is nothing more than a rational-basis requirement.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>supra, 473 U.S. 821 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u201c[An intermediate category] consists of public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity. The Constitution forbids a State to enforce certain exclusions from a forum generally open to the public even if it was not required to create the forum in the first place. . . . Although a State is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility, as long as it does so it is bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 45-46. The government creates such a \u201cdesignated\u201d public forum \u201cby intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse. . . . [T]he Court has looked to the policy and practice of the government to ascertain whether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum. . . . The Court has also examined the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>supra, 473 U.S. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">When a government opens a nontraditional forum to public expression, it does not create a designated public forum unless it intends to permit a wide range of expressive activity; id., 804-805; and property opened to some, but not all types of speech remains a nonpublic forum. Although it must permit expression of all viewpoints within the narrow category of speech that the government has intended to authorize, it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>exclude other categories of speech. See <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School District, </em>959 F.2d 381, 387 (2d Cir. 1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 508 U.S. 384, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1993); <em>Deeper Life Christian Fellowship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>852 F.2d 676, 679 (2d Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Thus, it is clear that modern public forum analysis under the United States constitution focuses first on the category of public property at issue in the case. R. Post, supra, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1766. Only after a court has labeled a particular public property as a traditional, designated or nonpublic forum does the court then consider to what extent the government may restrict speech there. See <em>Perry, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 46. Because restrictions on speech in public forums receive the highest level of scrutiny and those in nonpublic forums are subject to the lowest; <em>Lee, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 678-79; a court\u2019s initial categorization of property, as a practical matter, necessarily determines whether a particular restriction on speech will be invalidated. See C. Dienes, \u201cThe Trashing of the Public Forum: Problems in First Amendment Analysis,\u201d 55 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 109,118 (1986). Scholars suggest that this modem categorical approach implicitly, if not explicitly, reflects the United States Supreme Court\u2019s position that a government, in its proprietary function as \u201cowner\u201d of public lands, like any owner of private property, may choose to exclude certain classes of speech. See id., 112 (\u201cseeds of the modern nonpublic forum doctrine\u201d found in court\u2019s application of private property concepts to public property); R. Post, supra, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1722-24, 1743 (notion of government acting in its proprietary function drives modern public forum analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Applying the federal forum approach to the present case, we recognize that the gallery of the Hall of the House in the capitol arguably may be classified as a pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>lie forum dedicated to specific uses by the public.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This particular area fails to qualify as a traditional public forum because, unlike parks or streets, the gallery has not historically been devoted to public debate. See <em>Act-Up </em>v. <em>Walp, </em>755 F. Sup. 1281, 1287 (M.D. Pa. 1991) (gallery of chamber of Pennsylvania House of Representatives not traditional public forum). To conclude that it is a designated public forum would be to recognize the unique nature of the gallery and the narrow type of public involvement that traditionally occurs there. See id., 1288 (describing limited \u201ccommunication\u201d between public in gallery and elected officials). This conclusion would also recognize the distinction between the specific qualities of the gallery, an area open only to public viewing and limited public expression, and the traditional nature of other areas in and around the cap\u00edtol. Compare id., 1288 (gallery had been used only for quiet observation and for passively communicating a citizen presence to legislators), with <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>384 F. Sup. 741, 744 (D.R.I. 1974) (rotunda at statehouse had followed \u201copen-door\u201d policy); see also <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 238, 83 S. Ct. 680, 9 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1963) (recognizing that grounds of statehouse appropriate for protest). If we were to determine that the gallery of the cap\u00edtol is such a designated public forum, we would then have to apply the most rigorous level of scrutiny and invalidate subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) as overbroad prohibitions unless they qualify as reasonable time, place and manner restrictions that are content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>open ample alternative channels of communication. See <em>Perry, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Because the gallery has been opened to the public only for the limited purpose of viewing and allowing minimal participation in the legislative process by moderate and timely expressions of approval or disapproval, however, it seems possible, under federal forum analysis, that this part of the capitol appropriately may be designated a nonpublic forum. See <em>Comelim, </em>supra, 473 U.S. 802. Similarly, locations other than the capitol that house official legislative proceedings, such as public hearings, may be considered to be nonpublic forums because the public likewise has only been given a limited expressive role in such places. \u201cThe government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.\u201d Id. If that were the case, we would uphold the statute \u201cas long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 46. Nonetheless, we need not conclusively categorize the forum at issue, because we conclude that subdivisions (2) (C) and (E) qualify as reasonable time, place and manner restrictions and that these subdivisions therefore pass constitutional muster even under the most stringent standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In any type of forum, from traditional public to nonpublic, it is permissible to impose content-neutral \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulations on speech that are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and that \u201c \u2018leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 791. We initially discuss the governmental interest in prohibiting interferences with the General Assembly. The legislature operates under a constitutional mandate in our democratic state govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ment. The constitution of Connecticut, article third, \u00a7 1, provides for the vesting of the legislative power in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Article third, \u00a7 2, authorizes the meeting of the General Assembly and delineates the General Assembly\u2019s power to meet in regular and special sessions as needed. Further, article third, \u00a7\u00a7 3 through 5, establish the General Assembly\u2019s role as a representative body. Equally important to this case, our state constitution requires the governor to convey to the General Assembly \u201cinformation of the state of the government, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem expedient.\u201d Conn. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Like the United States Congress, our state legislature, in order to execute this constitutional mandate effectively, must retain the power \u201cto preserve itself, that is, to deal by way of contempt with direct obstructions to its legislative duties.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>243 U.S. 521, 537, 37 S. Ct. 448, 61 L. Ed. 881 (1917); see also <em>Jurney </em>v. <em>MacCracken, </em>294 U.S. 125, 147-50, 55 S. Ct. 375, 79 L. Ed. 802 (1935) (discussing congressional power to prevent obstructions to legislative process). Thus, it must have \u201cthe right to prevent acts which in and of themselves inherently obstruct or prevent the discharge of legislative duty or the refusal to do that which there is an inherent legislative power to compel in order that legislative functions may be performed.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 542; see <em>White </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>900 F.2d 1421,1425-26 (9th Cir. 1990) (discussing city council\u2019s need to be free from disruptions). Consequently, it is clear that the state has a significant interest in ensuring that the General Assembly, whether sitting in a session, meeting, proceeding or committee, has the opportunity to fulfill its mandate free from objectively unreasonable interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In emphasizing the strength of the state\u2019s interest in maintaining a functional General Assembly, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>not suggest that such an interest may be wielded by the government to stifle completely public expression in the Hall of the House, or other locations of official legislative proceedings. The public assuredly enjoys a right to reasonable expression at government locations of all types. See, e.g., <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 514, 89 S. Ct. 733, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1969) (reversed conviction for wearing black armbands to school in protest of Vietnam war); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>supra, 372 U.S. 238 (reversed conviction of protestors who sang, clapped and stomped feet outside statehouse on its grounds). This undeniable public right to reasonable expression does not mean, however, that a member of the public \u201chas an absolute constitutional right to use all parts of [the cap\u00edtol] or its immediate environs for [that individual\u2019s] unlimited expressive purposes.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 117-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Indeed, although the defendant asserts that the phrase \u201cwhether within or outside the presence of said general assembly, either house thereof or any such committee\u201d included in \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) creates \u201ca locational element in the statute that makes it apply anywhere,\u201d we conclude that the statute, as a whole, is narrowly tailored to protect the state\u2019s interests. Under subdivision (2) (C), an individual is never subject to arrest or prosecution for \u201cmaking unreasonable noise\u201d outside the presence of an official legislative proceeding unless that person intends <em>and </em>effects an actual interference with that proceeding. This subdivision appropriately recognizes that \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d can succeed in its aim even if it is created \u201coutside\u201d the presence of the targeted proceeding. Merely critical expression outside the cap\u00edtol, however, could not be punished; <em>see Boos </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>485 U.S. 312, 318-19, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1988); instead, the state would necessarily have to prove that the characteris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tics of the expression, rather than the message it contained, intentionally and actually interfered with official proceedings inside the building. Inherently limited in this way, these subdivisions merely place reasonable constraints on the \u201ctime, place or manner\u201d of expressive conduct, and they preserve \u201c \u2018ample alternative channels for communication.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Moreover, in light of the vital state interests involved and the facially narrow language employed, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that we must place a \u201cfighting words\u201d gloss on the phrase \u201cunreasonable noise.\u201d As correctly noted by the defendant, courts often have recognized that application of a \u201cfighting words\u201d gloss can save a broad breach of the peace statute from a constitutional overbreadth claim. See, e.g., <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972); <em>In re Brown, </em>9 Cal. 3d 612, 617-19, 510 P.2d 1017, 108 Cal. Rptr. 465 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 1959, 40 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 595-97, 334 N.E.2d 617 (1975), superseded by statute as stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Unnamed Defendant, </em>22 Mass. App. 230, 492 N.E.2d 1184 (1986). These cases are irrelevant to the present context, however, because they involved statutes that were not narrowly tailored to the nature of a particular site or the needs of specific government institutions. In other words, a \u201cfighting words\u201d gloss is inappropriate here because \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d can create an interference with the legislative process regardless of whether the \u201cnoise\u201d is characterized as \u201cfighting words.\u201d For instance, if, during floor debates on a bill, a member of the gallery shouted slogans loudly in order to express her disapproval with the pending legislation, such expression could objectively be characterized as \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d even if her actual words were not susceptible to a \u201cfighting words\u201d designation. Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>sequently, we conclude that subdivision (2) (C) is not overbroad in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution because it is a reasonable restriction of time, place and manner that is narrowly tailored to serve the significant state interest in preserving a reasonably efficient legislative process and that leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">For similar reasons, we must reject the Appellate Court\u2019s observation that subdivision (2) (E) \u201cis similar to the ordinance in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, [482 U.S. 451,] that was held by the United States Supreme Court to be unconstitutional because of overbreadth,\u201d and its conclusion that \u201c[w]e discern no meaningful difference between the two statutes, and hold that [subdivision (E)] is unconstitutional as overbroad.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 668. First, \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (E) applies only to disruptions of official meetings of the General Assembly. This locational element limits the statute\u2019s restrictive effect on protected speech. See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 112, 117-18. Second, subdivision (2) (E) applies only if an individual acts with the specific intent to disturb, disrupt or interfere. We agree with Justice Powell\u2019s recognition in <em>Houston </em>that such a specific intent element can save an otherwise overbroad statute because such a requirement narrows the statute\u2019s applicability by excluding from its ambit those whose expression may have innocently or unknowingly caused a disturbance. See <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 474 (Powell, J., dissenting in part). Third, subdivision (2) (E), as interpreted above, only applies if conduct, expressive or otherwise, \u201cdisturbs, disrupts or interferes with\u201d an official legislative proceeding due to its characteristics and not because of any message it may have conveyed. The statute therefore does not permit an arrest or prosecution that is based on the subjective views of law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ment officials or the varying sensibilities of individual legislators. <em>See Boos </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>supra, 485 U.S. 318-19 (statute invalid because it grants officials too much discretion); <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 465 (statute invalidated because it \u201cprovide[s] the police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that annoy or offend them\u201d). Consequently, the state may not arrest or prosecute under subdivision (2) (E) unless: (1) the defendant had the specific intent to impede an official legislative proceeding; and (2) the defendant\u2019s conduct, rather than any message it might have contained, actually caused that impediment. Thus, subdivision (2) (E) is not overbroad in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The defendant next claims that \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) (C) and (E) are vague, both on their face and as applied, in violation of the due process provisions of the Connecticut constitution. She argues that these subdivisions fail to satisfy the independent protections against the enforcement of vague laws afforded under our state constitution because they lack \u201c \u2018minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d The defendant further claims that these statutory provisions are overbroad in violation of the Connecticut constitution because they impermissibly proscribe expressive conduct at the capitol that is protected under the expansive free speech provisions of our state constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We need not dwell on the defendant\u2019s vagueness claims under the Connecticut constitution. The defendant principally bases her independent state constitutional vagueness claims on the authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>96 Conn. 190, 113 A. 385 (1921). In <em>Coleman, </em>this court denounced indefinite criminal laws that \u201cleave the constitutional liberties of a citizen to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>defined and protected by the good impulses of a subordinate official entrusted with unlimited discretion.\u201d Id., 196. Although we acknowledge that <em>Coleman </em>buttresses the defendant\u2019s general claim that the Connecticut constitution independently protects free speech from the dangers of arbitrary and selective enforcement based on viewpoint, we cannot discern any reason for this to cause us to analyze these issues any differently under the Connecticut constitution than we analyzed them under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In short, we have considered in detail the defendant\u2019s vagueness claims under the federal constitution, and she has failed to persuade us that our state constitution mandates a different analysis or contrary result. As we discussed above, \u00a7 2-1d (a) (2) (C) and (E) give individuals adequate notice of what conduct they prohibit. Further, the language of these provisions, when read in light of the statute as a whole, sufficiently guides law enforcement officials in the execution of their duties. Thus, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Coleman </em>that gave officials <em>\u201cunlimited\u201d </em>or <em>\u201cabsolute and uncontrolled\u201d </em>discretion; (emphasis added) id., 196-97; the subdivisions of \u00a7 2-1d in question do not permit unconstitutionally unrestrained discretion under the Connecticut constitution. Moreover, because we have concluded that the defendant\u2019s specific conduct clearly falls within the statute, we are unpersuaded that these subdivisions are vague as applied to her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The defendant also claims that \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) (C) and (E) are overbroad in violation of the free speech provisions of the Connecticut constitution. Her state constitutional claim is in two parts. First, she contends that we should reject modern federal forum analysis in favor of a more flexible, fact specific approach similar to that utilized by the United States Supreme Court prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>its adoption of the <em>Perry </em>forum based model. Second, she argues that, under this more flexible approach, the subdivisions of the statute should be invalidated. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first argument but reject the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Under the prior approach, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s first amendment analysis often relied not on any consideration of the government\u2019s proprietary right to exclude, but only on whether the particular speech in issue was consistent with the uses of the specific public property involved. See C. Dienes, supra, 55 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 112; accord <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 104; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>383 U.S. 131, 86 S. Ct. 719, 15 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1966); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>supra, 372 U.S. 229. The central issue under that approach was \u201cwhether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time. . . . [I]n assessing the reasonableness of a regulation, [a court weighs] heavily the fact that communication is involved; the regulation must be narrowly tailored to further the State\u2019s legitimate interest.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 116-17. This emphasis on basic compatibility, rather than on categorization of particular \u201ctypes\u201d of public property, reflected the court\u2019s attempt \u201cto serve the first amendment value of maximizing social communication.\u201d R. Post, supra, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1731.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In deciding whether our state constitution demands such an interpretation, we acknowledge that federal constitutional law sets minimum national standards for individual rights and that states may afford individuals greater protections under their own state constitutions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 379, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). Although we often look to United States Supreme Court precedent when construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>related provisions in our state constitution, we may determine that \u201c \u2018the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 112, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 166, 537 A.2d 446 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235-36, 496 A.2d 498 (1985).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 684, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">To determine whether our state constitution affords greater rights than the federal constitution, we consider the following \u201ctools of analysis\u201d: (1) the \u201ctextual\u201d approach\u2014consideration of the specific words in the constitution; (2) holdings and dicta of this court and the Appellate Court; (3) federal precedent; (4) the \u201csibling\u201d approach\u2014examination of other states\u2019 decisions; (5) the \u201chistorical\u201d approach\u2014including consideration of the historical constitutional setting and the debates of the framers; and (6) economic and sociological, or public policy, considerations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 380-81; <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 530-31, 628 A.2d 567 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 685. Applying this analysis, we decline to follow the modern, forum based approach currently employed to resolve claims under the first amendment to the United States constitution that concern abridgement of speech on public property. Instead, we agree with Judge Schaller\u2019s concurrence in the Appellate Court and adopt the \u201ccompatibility\u201d test, as expressed in <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 116-17, for claims brought under the Connecticut constitution that involve restrictions on speech on public property. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 686 (Schaller, <em>J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The defendant\u2019s freedom of speech claims implicate various sections of our state constitution. \u201cThe state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>constitutional framework for protection of the right of free speech rests principally upon the provisions of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the constitution of Connecticut.\u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 71, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984) <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting). Article first, \u00a7 4, provides that \u201c[ejvery citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\u201d Further, article first, \u00a7 5, provides that \u201c[n]o law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d Also relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim, article first, \u00a7 14, provides that \u201c[t]he citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble for their common good, and to apply to those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It is instructive to compare the language of these sections to the corresponding language of the United States constitution. See U.S. Const., amend. I (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d). Our state constitution includes in article first, \u00a7 4, the word \u201cpublish,\u201d a term not found within the United States constitution. Other courts, construing the term \u201cpublish\u201d in the context of similarly worded state constitutions, have found that the term creates expanded communicative rights for the public. See <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Akers, </em>409 F. Sup. 978, 981-82 (D. Wyo. 1976), aff\u2019d, 565 F.2d 1166 (10th Cir. 1977) (construing Wyoming constitution); <em>South Holland </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>373 Ill. 472,479-80, 26 N.E.2d 868 (1940) (Illinois constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Moreover, as Judge Schaller noted, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 and 14, also include other language that suggests that our state constitution bestows greater expressive rights on the public than that afforded by the federal consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 678 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>concurring). \u201cArticle first, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution provides that \u2018[ejvery citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments <em>on all subjects, </em>being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) By contrast, the first amendment does not include language protecting free speech \u2018on all subjects.\u2019 Article first, \u00a7 5, provides that \u2018[n]o law shall <em>ever </em>be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Unlike the first amendment which provides that \u2018Congress shall pass no law\u2019 the use of \u2018ever\u2019 in our state constitution offers additional emphasis to the force of the provision. Finally, article first, \u00a7 14, provides that citizens have a right, inter alia, \u2018to apply to those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances ... by petition, address or <em>remonstrance. \u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Again, our state constitution offers language, i.e., \u2018remonstrance,\u2019 that sets forth free speech rights more emphatically than its federal counterpart. . . . [Tjhese differences warrant an interpretation separate and distinct from that of the first amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 678. We are persuaded that <em>Grayned\u2019s </em>fact specific, flexible approach will offer more protection to freedom of speech as envisioned in our state constitution. See <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 69-72 <em>{Peters, J., </em>dissenting) (discussing independent vitality of free speech protections under state constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The case law of this state also supports our adoption of the more speech protective <em>Grayned </em>approach. As early as 1921, this court looked to the constitution of Connecticut to protect individuals from laws that gave officials unlimited discretion to limit freedom of speech. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 96 Conn. 195-96. In doing so, the <em>Coleman </em>court looked beyond the less speech protective approach then followed by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Supreme Court in interpreting the federal constitution, and stated that \u201cin determining whether [the ordinance] violates the Constitution of Connecticut, we must be guided by our own public policy and our own precedents.\u201d Id., 195; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>73 Conn. 18, 28-29, 46 A. 409 (1900) (discussing importance of free expression in democratic society).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Moreover, we have recognized that our state constitution \u201cis an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 115. This concern for \u201ccontemporary effectiveness\u201d would be undermined if we followed federal forum analysis, which affords the most rigorous protection of speech only at \u201ctraditional\u201d forums and narrowly defines \u201ctraditional\u201d to exclude modern public gathering places often otherwise compatible with public expression. See, e.g., <em>Lee, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 680 (airport not public forum because not traditionally \u201cused for purposes of expressive activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">A body of federal case law concerning this particular issue of free speech lends considerable support to our adoption of a flexible approach. As discussed previously, prior to its return to the more rigid, forum based categorization of public property, the United States Supreme Court followed the flexible approach espoused in <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 104. This model of first amendment analysis required a case-by-case balancing of the right to free speech against the competing interest of preventing unreasonable interference with the \u201cnormal activity\u201d of a particular place. Id., 116-17. Free from the modem inquiry containing varying levels of judicial scrutiny, the <em>Grayned </em>model focused not on the labeling of property as \u201ctraditional public\u201d or \u201cnonpublic,\u201d but on whether the specific use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of particular government property compelled some level of speech regulation. Many dissents and concurrences of the United States Supreme Court have advocated for the rejection of the forum approach in favor of the unified, <em>Grayned </em>type balancing test. See, e.g., <em>Lee, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 695 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201cinquiry must be an objective one, based on the actual, physical characteristics and uses of the property\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kokinda, </em>497 U.S. 720, 737, 110 S. Ct. 3115, 111 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (public forum jurisprudence, \u201cto retain vitality,\u201d must consider objective characteristics of governmental property and its customary public use); <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 843, 96 S. Ct. 1211, 47 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring) (inquiry should have focused on Grayned\u2019s \u201cbasic incompatibility\u201d test), and 860 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (flexible approach should have been used to determine whether particular speech \u201cbasically compatible with the activities otherwise occurring at the locale\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">These justices have emphasized that the use of the unified, balancing test is necessary to preserve the value of free speech in light of the realities of public expression in modern life. See, e.g., <em>Lee, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 697 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (without unified \u201ccompatibility\u201d approach that ignores mere historical analysis, \u201cour forum doctrine retains no relevance in times of fast-changing technology and increasing insularity\u201d). Similarly, some commentators and scholars have resoundingly advocated for a return to a flexible, unified approach focused on speech \u201ccompatibility.\u201d See R. Post, supra, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1765-66 and n.213 (discussing overwhelming support for adoption of <em>Grayned </em>approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Indeed, one commentator has noted that the <em>Grayned </em>approach \u201cis designed to maximize the speech which the government is constitutionally required to tolerate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>consistent with the appropriate and needful use of its property. This design flows naturally from the first amendment\u2019s central objective of ensuring \u2018uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u2019 public debate.\u201d R. Post, supra, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1766, quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964). We are persuaded by these observations concerning the flexibility of the <em>Grayned </em>approach and the failings of the current federal model; accordingly, we believe that our adoption of the <em>Grayned </em>approach will best protect free speech under our state constitution. This conclusion finds support from the decision of at least one other state court interpreting its own state constitution\u2019s speech protections. See <em>U.C. Nuclear Weapons Labs Conversion Project </em>v. <em>Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, </em>154 Cal. App. 3d 1157, 1164-65, 201 Cal. Rptr. 837 (1984) (adopting <em>Grayned </em>test under constitution of California).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Further, our decision to adopt the more speech sensitive approach of <em>Grayned </em>under our state constitution is supported by the history of free speech in Connecticut. In <em>Cologne, </em>this court\u2019s majority opinion discussed the historical underpinnings of free speech under the Connecticut constitution and concluded that the constitutional framers were concerned primarily with curbing undue interference from the government. <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 60-62. Similarly, the dissent in <em>Cologne </em>discussed the well established importance of free speech in society and analyzed the broad protections to speech expressly incorporated into the Connecticut constitution. Id., 69-71, 76-80 <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting). Additionally, Judge Schaller\u2019s historical analysis sheds light on this state constitutional question. \u201cBefore the 1818 Connecticut constitutional convention, civil liberties in Connecticut were in their infancy, particularly freedoms of speech and press. C. Collier, \u2018The Connecticut Dec\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ration of Rights Before the Constitution of 1818: A Victim of Revolutionary Redefinition,\u2019 15 Conn. L. Rev. 87, 97 (1982). \u2018These were protected neither by statute nor by a well-articulated set of common law principles.\u2019 Id. Thus, the Connecticut constitutional convention \u2018overrode the protestations of the Federalist old republicans who still clung to their faith in legislative supremacy and the common law to uphold [speech rights in Connecticut].\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u201cMoreover, in the years immediately preceding our constitution\u2019s enactment, Connecticut citizens embraced a philosophy of greater tolerance, moving toward a more culturally diverse society. R. Purcell, Connecticut in Transition: 1775-1818 (Wesleyan Univ. Press 1963) pp. 311-35; W. Horton, \u2018Annotated Debates of the 1818 Constitutional Convention,\u2019 65 Conn. B.J. SI-1, SI-4 (1991). This is particularly evident in the struggle to separate church and state. Between 1812 and 1818, the issue of church and state deeply divided political factions. R. Purcell, supra, pp. 320-21. The Federalists continued to support established institutions both religious and secular. Id. At the same time, the Tolerationists strongly advocated the separation of church and state and, as their party name suggests, a movement toward greater tolerance. Id. The Tolerationists gained a major victory with the election of Governor Wolcott in 1817 and, a year later, with the overwhelming placement of their representatives in both houses of the legislature. Id., p. 360. By 1818, it was apparent that the political tide in Connecticut had shifted in the direction of greater tolerance and cultural diversity. Ultimately, these views culminated in the enactment of the Connecticut constitution. [We are] convinced, therefore, that our constitution\u2019s speech provisions reflect a unique historical experience and a move toward enhanced civil liberties, particularly those liberties designed to foster individuality.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 681-83 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>concurring). This historical background indicates that the framers of our constitution contemplated vibrant public speech, and a minimum of governmental interference, which would be best fulfilled by the less intrusive <em>Grayned </em>model.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Finally, it is clear that our adoption of the flexible, <em>Grayned </em>approach will best enable our courts to adapt the central tenets of free speech jurisprudence to the ever changing nature of public expression and communication in modern society. As aptly expressed by Justice Kennedy, \u201c[i]n a country where most citizens travel by automobile, and parks all too often become locales for crime rather than social intercourse, our failure to recognize the possibility that new types of government property may be appropriate forums for speech will lead to a serious curtailment of our expressive activity.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 697-98 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Further, this flexible approach prohibits the government from unilaterally and unnecessarily limiting speech at public locations; it avoids the \u201cgrant of plenary power [that] allows the government to tilt the dialogue heard by the public, to exclude many, more marginal, voices.\u201d Id., 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">With these principles in mind, we nonetheless must reject the defendant\u2019s overbreadth claims under the Connecticut constitution. As we outlined previously, the <em>Grayned </em>test requires the government, under the Connecticut constitution, to permit free speech and public expression on government property up to the point when such free expression becomes \u201cbasically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time. . . . [I]n assessing the reasonableness of a regulation, we must weigh heavily the fact that communication is involved; the regulation must be narrowly tailored to further the State\u2019s legitimate interest.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>116-17. This standard balances the vital role of free expression in a democratic society with the need for reasonably functional governmental institutions and mechanisms. \u201cThe nature of a place, the pattern of its normal activities, dictate the kinds of regulations of time, place, and manner that are reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Because subdivision (2) (C) narrowly prohibits only conduct that amounts to \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d <em>and </em>that intentionally creates an impediment to an official legislative proceeding because of characteristics such as its timing, loudness and duration, rather than any message it may convey, this subdivision facially limits itself to expression that is \u201cbasically incompatible\u201d with the business of the General Assembly. Subdivision (2) (E) is also limited so as to prohibit only an act that is intended to interfere with a legislative proceeding <em>and, </em>in fact, interferes with such a proceeding because of its characteristics rather than because of any message it conveys. Subdivision (2) (E), as does subdivision (2) (C), therefore expressly restricts itself to expression that is \u201cbasically incompatible\u201d with the business of the General Assembly. This conclusion recognizes that public expression must yield at the point where the General Assembly \u201cis prevented from accomplishing its business in a reasonably efficient manner.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 900 F.2d 1426. \u201cWhere an examination of all the relevant interests indicates that certain expressive activity is not compatible with the normal uses of the property, the First Amendment does not require the government to allow that activity.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>supra, 473 U.S. 820 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (applying <em>Grayned </em>test).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have granted her motion to dismiss because her arrest and prosecution were based on her constitutionally protected political expression. She argues that this court should adopt the three part balancing test, enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardin, </em>498 N.W.2d 677 (Iowa 1993), <em>and In re Kay, </em>1 Cal. 3d 930, 464 P.2d 142, 83 Cal. Rptr. 686 (1970), that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>defendant\u2019s view, attempts to balance \u201cthe expressive rights of speakers and dissident audience members\u201d at public events of a political nature. The defendant would have us assess: (1) the nature of the meeting involved; (2) whether the activity substantially impaired the conduct of the meeting; and (3) whether the defendants knew, or should have known, that their conduct violated an applicable custom, usage, or rule of the meeting. <em>In re Kay, </em>supra, 943. Applying this formula to her case, the defendant contends that her prosecution fails the test because the governor\u2019s address was a \u201cpolitical event,\u201d her \u201c \u2018activity\u2019 did not seriously \u2018impair\u2019 the occasion,\u201d she \u201cscarcely could have known that her chant was not as acceptable as loud, sustained applause or booing,\u201d and \u201cthe cap\u00edtol police should have requested the defendant to curtail her expression before proceeding with arrest.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Although the defendant crafts this as a claim separate and distinct from her vagueness and overbreadth claims, we are unconvinced that the so-called <em>Kay-Hardin </em>test is anything more than an adaptation of the <em>Grayned </em>model of free speech analysis to the context of a \u201cpublic meeting\u201d or \u201cpolitical rally.\u201d See <em>In re Kay, </em>supra, 1 Cal. 3d 943 (characterizing meeting as \u201clarge, public celebration held outdoors in a public park, featuring, in the course of a political campaign, a public official as the principal speaker\u201d). It is noteworthy that the specific ordinance at issue in <em>In re Kay </em>had prohibited willful disturbances at \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>assembly or meeting, not unlawful in its character\u2019 \u201d; (emphasis added) id., 937-38; and that the relevant conduct had occurred in a public park during a city sponsored Fourth of July celebration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In light of these circumstances, that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>concluded that it needed to apply such a test to determine whether the ordinance at issue really was an unconstitutionally overbroad restriction based on viewpoint. Id., 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Even if we were to agree in principle with the use of a balancing test in <em>In re Kay, </em>a determination that we need not make in this case, we have already applied this test, as tailored to the particular statute and circumstances of this case, to the defendant\u2019s claims and rejected them in part IIB of this opinion. As discussed previously, the challenged subdivisions of the statute are narrowly tailored to prohibit only conduct, expressive or otherwise, that is intended to impede and does impede an official legislative proceeding. In the words of the court in <em>In re Kay, </em>\u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) (C) and (E) pass constitutional muster because they \u201c[authorize] the imposition of criminal sanctions only when the defendant\u2019s activity itself\u2014and <em>not </em>the content [or, more accurately, the viewpoint] of the activity\u2019s expression\u2014 substantially impairs the effective conduct\u201d of an official legislative proceeding. (Emphasis in original.) <em>In re Kay, </em>supra, 1 Cal. 3d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Moreover, our independent review of the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that the government utilized the statute to punish her solely for the expression of her particular viewpoint. Unlike the circumstances underlying the decision in <em>In re Kay, </em>the defendant\u2019s conduct here impeded the governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>address because of the inappropriate timing, loudness and duration of the chanting, and because of the combined effect of the chanting and her distracting use of the banner, which was positioned immediately to the left of the governor\u2019s location and which drew away the attention of the legislators in attendance. Compare <em>In re Kay, </em>supra, 1 Cal. 3d 944 (\u201cprosecution failed to show that the activities substantially impaired the conduct of the meeting\u201d). In other words, the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutionally supports a conviction under \u00a7 2-Id (a) (2) (C) and (E) because the manner of her communication, rather than the viewpoint expressed in her message, intentionally interfered with an ongoing legislative proceeding.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, the defendant offered no evidence that others had engaged in similar intentional interferences with official legislative proceedings, but had not been punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

She claims that because she had filed her motion to dismiss prior to the time when the state narrowed its charges to allege violations only of subdivisions (2) (C) and (2) (E), she may now facially challenge \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) in its entirety. She asserts that \u201c[t]he procedural history of the case and the underlying reasons for according standing to make facial challenges to statutes that might otherwise chill freedom of expression together support the defendant\u2019s position that she is entitled to challenge the entirety of Gen. Stat. \u00a7 2-ld [(a) (2)] on the grounds of overbreadth and facial vagueness.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We agree with the defendant that in an appropriate case, the importance of free speech values may permit a defendant to attack a statute on its face, even in a case in which the defendant\u2019s conduct may clearly fall within the core meaning of that statute. This principle necessarily presupposes, however, that the defendant has actually been charged with violations of that statute. As we have stated previously, \u201c[o]ur vagueness inquiry\u2014 whether facial or as applied\u2014extends only to those portions of the statute that were applied to the defendant in this case. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>[415 U.S. 566, 581, 94 S.

The determination that a statute has a core meaning and the determination as to whether a statute is facially vague because it has <em>no </em>core meaning in essence requires the same analysis.

Those cases do not support the defendant\u2019s argument, however, because they not only rejected the vague as applied claims at issue in them, but they also provide no discernible basis for a contrary result in this case. <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 110; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 813-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> The Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[w]e need not decide [whether to conduct a de novo review of the record to make an independent determination of the facts] because here the facts are not in dispute, and an independent review by us would not result in different findings.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 661. We agree with the defendant that the nature of her \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional claims required the Appellate Court to conduct an independent review of the record. <em>See Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 458 n.6; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>K.N.D.

In reviewing the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion about whether the statute is vague or otherwise unconstitutional as applied to the defendant, the Appellate Court should have reviewed the available evidence, including the exhibits, as we do here, to determine whether the trial court ignored evidence concerning the application of the statute. See <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 458 n.6. Of course, such independent review was unnecessary for the Appellate Court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s facial vagueness and overbreadth claims because an analysis of a \u201cfacial\u201d type of claim is not dependent on the facts of a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\"> Also, it is a necessary predicate to free speech analysis that the government\u2019s action has, in some way, implicated the free exercise of speech. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>226 Conn. 265, 270, 627 A.2d 892 (1993). In other words, if the statute regulates conduct only, i.e., conduct which has no arguable expressive component, then such regulation does not impermissibly curtail freedom of speech. The Appellate Court concluded that subdivision (2) (C) does not trigger free speech analysis because the term \u201c \u2018unreasonable noise\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>as used in this statute relates to behavior and is not protected speech.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 671. The state argues that the statute does not merit free speech analysis on the additional ground that the statute proscribes only the constitutionally unprotected, \u201cinjurious\u201d element of speech. According to the state, the proscribed speech is \u201cinjurious\u201d and thus unprotected because, by interfering with the legislative process, it is incompatible with \u201cordered liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">These arguments go too far. Free speech scrutiny, in order to protect expression adequately, must be triggered by a threshold finding that particular government regulation has the incidental effect of burdening expression. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 270. Thus, although consideration of particular expressive conduct\u2019s effect on the legislature is relevant to determine, under the rubric of free speech analysis, whether the government may constitutionally prohibit that conduct, such consideration of the effect cannot be used to preclude the constitutional inquiry from ever taking place. Because the proscription of \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d by subdivision (2) (C) clearly contemplates a restriction on some types of speech and the ban of \u201cany other act\u201d by subdivision (2) (E) necessarily may include forms of speech, we conclude that free speech analysis of both provisions is appropriate here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\"> we recognize that the statute proscribes conduct in locations other than the gallery of the Hall of the House, and that, to resolve the defendant\u2019s facial overbreadth challenge, we must examine the constitutionality of the statute\u2019s proscriptions in each such location. We need not classify each such location as a particular type of \u201cforum,\u201d however, because, even in the most speech protective forum, the proscriptions contained in \u00a7 2-ld (a) (2) (C) and (E) would be consistent with the first amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\"> We therefore must qualify the defendant\u2019s broad assertion that \u201cthe state cap\u00edtol is a forum\u2014unlike a school, library or courthouse\u2014whose \u2018characteristic nature and function\u2019 <em>includes </em>being a forum in which the citizens \u2018apply to those invested with the powers of government, for redress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance.\u2019 Art. I, \u00a7 14.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The defendant\u2019s position incorrectly seems to imply that because the capitol is an appropriate place, or arguably even <em>the most </em>appropriate place, to engage in political speech, then all speech in all parts of the capitol, regardless of its type, timing or disruptive effect, is per se \u201ccompatible\u201d there. This suggestion ignores the fact that the government appropriately may enact reasonable restrictions of time, place and manner that are narrowly tailored to further significant governmental interests and that accord room for ample alternative channels of communication. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 791. Further, although we heed the defendant\u2019s citation to the constitution of Connecticut, article third, \u00a7 16 (\u201cdebates of each house shall be public\u201d), General Statutes \u00a7 2-la (a) (authorizing General Assembly to adopt, inter alia, rules consistent with public\u2019s right to free expression), and various regulations pertaining to public conduct at the capitol, we reject any implication that individuals thereby possess the right to inject their political views into official legislative proceedings in disregard of how that expressive conduct likely will disrupt those same proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">At the same time, we must reject the state\u2019s broad contention that \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s expressive activity in the House gallery either fell within the statute and impeded the functioning of the legislature or constituted protected speech should be based upon the extent to which the provisions of the state constitution and the legislature\u2019s rules, precedents, and customs permit non-members to express themselves directly in the proceeding in question.\u201d Such a position inherently reflects a narrow view of expressive rights akin to that embodied in federal \u201cpublic forum\u201d jurisprudence. The rules, precedents, and customs of the General Assembly often will help inform whether particular expression is \u201cbasically incompatible\u201d with the normal activities at the capitol. These standards, however, cannot limit, in and of themselves, the extent of permissible public expression at the capitol; if they did, the government could stifle expression that posed no risk of preventing the legislature \u201cfrom accomplishing its business in a reasonably efficient manner.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 900 F.2d 1426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> Citing <em>In re Kay </em>further, the defendant argues that the state should be required to give a warning prior to removing or arresting an individual under these subdivisions of \u00a7 2-ld. The defendant seems to contend that such a procedure is <em>necessary </em>to give individuals fair warning that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>conduct, expressive or otherwise, has the effect of interfering with the legislative process. We must reject such a broad contention because it fails to recognize that expression often may be of such a quality that it is clearly an objective interference to a legislative proceeding. In the present case, for instance, by the time law enforcement officials approached the defendant and her associates, the chanting had already prevented the governor from speaking for a significant period of time. Further, she fails to recognize that the decision in <em>In re Kay </em>required law enforcement officials to issue warnings \u201c[i]n instances in which the appropriate standard of conduct lies in doubt . . . .\u201d <em>In re Kay, </em>supra, 1 Cal. 3d 945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> The defendant attempts to show that these subdivisions permit law enforcement officials to enforce them in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner by alluding to the doctrine of \u201cdesuetude,\u201d the concept that a statute may be unconstitutional because of its lack of use. We agree with the Appellate Court that, because the defendant did not raise this doctrine at the trial level, we have an insufficient record upon which to evaluate its potential application to her case.
