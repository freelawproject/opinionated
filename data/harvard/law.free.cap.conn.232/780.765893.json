Sup. 1939) \u00a7 13306<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> bars the workers\u2019 compensation claim of the decedent, Carl Rice (claimant), against the named defendant, Ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>milyn Brown, Inc. (Vermilyn Brown).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The compensation commissioner (commissioner) concluded that the claimant was entitled to certain benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for an occupational disease caused by his exposure to asbestos in 1942 during the course of his employment with Vermilyn Brown. On appeal, the compensation review board (review board) reversed the finding and award of the commissioner, concluding that the claimant\u2019s receipt of benefits was barred by \u00a7 1330e. Angela J. Rice, executrix of the claimant\u2019s estate, appealed from the decision of the review board to this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The commissioner found the following facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The claimant was employed as a carpenter by Vermilyn Brown for several months in 1942.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While so employed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>he frequently was required to cut and install sheets of asbestos, resulting in his inhalation of asbestos particles. Although the claimant continued to work as a carpenter until his retirement in 1981, his only significant exposure to asbestos occurred in 1942 during the months that he was employed by Vermilyn Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In December, 1986, the claimant, after experiencing difficulty breathing, consulted with Robert Keltner, a physician specializing in pulmonary medicine. Keltner diagnosed the claimant as suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with mild asbestosis, and concluded that the condition had been caused by the claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos in 1942. Keltner also concluded that the claimant\u2019s pulmonary disease had resulted in a 25 percent permanent loss of the use of his lungs. Thereafter, Keltner determined that the claimant had become totally disabled as of January, 1989, by which date he was suffering from a 50 percent permanent disability of the lungs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On November 27, 1989, the claimant filed a claim under the act for benefits on account of his lung condition. The commissioner found that the claimant suffered from an occupational disease resulting from his exposure to asbestos in 1942 during the course of his employment with Vermilyn Brown. The commissioner further found that the claimant had suffered a 25 percent permanent disability of the lungs as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>December 12,1986, and that the claimant\u2019s permanent lung disability had increased to 50 percent by January 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The defendants contested the claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits on, inter alia, the ground that his compensation claim was barred by \u00a7 1330e, which required him to have filed the claim within five years from the termination of his employment with Vermilyn Brown. The commissioner rejected this argument, concluding instead that the claim was governed by the limitation period set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-294,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the pertinent provision of the act in force on December 12,1986, when the claimant\u2019s lung disease first was diagnosed. The commissioner also concluded that the claimant had suffered a compensable injury on that date, and that he had filed his compensation claim within three years thereafter as required by \u00a7 31-294. On the basis of these findings, the commissioner awarded the claimant partial disability payments of $28.46 per week commencing on December 12,1986, such payments to continue for a period of 87.5 weeks, and total disability payments of $28.46 per week commencing on January 1,1989, such payments to continue for as long as the claimant remained totally disabled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The defendants appealed to the review board from the commissioner\u2019s finding and award. The defendants claimed, inter alia, that the rights and obligations of the parties were governed by \u00a7 1330e and that the claimant therefore was not entitled to compensation because his claim had not been filed within five years from the last date of his employment with Vermilyn Brown. The review board agreed with the defendants that the claim was barred by \u00a7 1330e and, accordingly, reversed the decision of the commissioner and dismissed the claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The plaintiff contends that the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim is governed by \u00a7 31-294 rather than by \u00a7 1330e<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, consequently, that the review board incorrectly determined that the claim was not timely filed. The plaintiff posits two alternative bases to support her argument: first, that \u00a7 31-294 applies retroactively to the contract of employment between the claimant and Vermilyn Brown; and second, that even if \u00a7 31-294 applies prospectively only, its application is otherwise mandated by the common law rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the rights and obligations of the parties under the act are determined by the statutory provisions in force on the date of injury. Because we conclude that the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim is barred by \u00a7 1330e, we affirm the decision of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the legislature intended \u00a7 31-294 to apply retroactively. \u201cThe rules of statutory construction that govern the applicability of new legislation to preexisting transactions are well established. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: \u2018No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect.\u2019 The \u2018obligations\u2019 referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The Legislature only rebuts this presumption when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467-68, 556 A.2d 145 (1989); see also <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175-76, 588 A.2d 189 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The plaintiff acknowledges that the limitation period for the filing of claims under the act is a jurisdictional requirement that affects substantive rights. <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>143 Conn. 571, 580-81, 124 A.2d 526 (1956); <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>A. Waldron &amp; Sons, </em>112 Conn. 579, 583-84, 153 A. 298 (1931); <em>Schmidt </em>v. O. <em>K. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 220, 96 A. 963 (1916). We presume, therefore, that the legislature intended \u00a7 31-294 to have prospective applicability only. <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 175; <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 467-68. Because there is nothing in the language of \u00a7 31-294 to suggest a contrary intent by the legislature, the plaintiff has failed to overcome the presumption against retroactivity. Furthermore, the legislative history of the precursor of \u00a7 31-294; see footnote 1; supports the conclusion that the legislature intended the limitation period contained therein to be applied prospectively only.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 31-294 applies retrospectively is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The plaintiff also contends that even if \u00a7 31-294 is not applied retroactively, the claimant\u2019s right to seek compensation benefits nonetheless is governed by \u00a7 31-294 under the common law rule that gives effect to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes in force on the date of the injury. We conclude that the date of injury rule has no applicability in the circumstances presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">As the plaintiff correctly asserts, we have adhered to the date of injury rule since 1916 to determine which of two or more successive amendments to the act governs the employment relationship. Under this common law rule, the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the provisions of the act in effect at the time of the injury. <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>231 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>287, 293 n.8, 649 A.2d 523 (1994); <em>Kluttz </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>228 Conn. 401, 404 n.3, 636 A.2d 816 (1994); <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222-23, 550 A.2d 640 (1988); <em>Quilty </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>96 Conn. 124, 127, 113 A. 149 (1921); <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>supra, 90 Conn. 220-21. In cases involving claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on account of occupational disease, we have stated that the time of the injury is the date on which the claim first becomes compensable. See, e.g., <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>120 Conn. 456, 460, 181 A. 539 (1935); <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Bieber-Goodman Corp., </em>118 Conn. 299, 301, 172 A. 95 (1934); <em>Rousu </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>114 Conn. 24, 28, 157 A. 264 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The plaintiff contends that the application of these principles to the present case compels the conclusion that the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by \u00a7 31-294, the provision of the act in force on December 12, 1986, when the claimant suffered a compensable injury. The plaintiff further contends that the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was timely filed because it was brought within three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of his occupational disease as required by \u00a7 31-294. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument, however, because the date of injury rule has no applicability when the claimant\u2019s rights have already expired under the terms of the act that governed the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The plaintiff acknowledges that \u00a7 1330e was the relevant provision of the act in force from the inception of the claimant\u2019s employment relationship with Vermilyn Brown in 1942, until 1959, when \u00a7 1330e was amended. Under \u00a7 1330e prior to its amendment, the claimant was required to have filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on account of his job related exposure to asbestos not later than five years from the date that he left the employ of Vermilyn Brown. The parties\u2019 employment, relationship having terminated in July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>1942, the claimant\u2019s right to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim for his lung disease expired in July, 1947, twelve years before the legislature amended \u00a7 1330e to remove the prohibition against claims brought more than five years from the termination of the employment relationship. Thus, as of July, 1947, there would have been no workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction for any claim by the claimant. Although the plaintiff concedes that the claimant\u2019s right to file a claim on account of his occupational disease expired in 1947, she nevertheless contends that the date of injury rule should be applied to revive the claimant\u2019s right to seek compensation for his lung ailment. We have never applied the date of injury rule to restore a right that had expired under the applicable provisions of the act, however, and we decline the invitation to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As we have stated, the purpose of the date of injury rule is to determine which of two or more successive amendments to the act governs the rights and obligations of the parties. <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 293 n.8; <em>Kluttz </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 404 n.3; <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 222-23. In this case, however, it is undisputed that \u00a7 1330e governed the parties\u2019 rights and obligations as of July, 1947, when the claimant\u2019s right to file a claim under the act expired.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The issue of the claimant\u2019s right to bring a compensation claim having been resolved decades ago under \u00a7 1330e, there remains no choice of law question requiring the application of the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>injury rule. The rule has no application when, as here, the parties\u2019 rights and obligations have been so finally concluded under the provisions of the act governing the employment relationship that no subsequent amendment without retrospective effect can alter them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 579 (\u201cSince the [subsequent] amendment applied only in cases which arose from and after its enactment, it furnishes no aid to the plaintiff. Her rights had already expired under the old law, which governed her contract of employment. . . . Likewise, no other amendment to the compensation act effective more than three years after she left the defendant\u2019s employ can help her.\u201d);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>supra, 120 Conn. 463 (\u201cSince [the subsequent] provisions [of the act] only applied in cases which arose from and after their enactment, they furnish no aid to this employee. His rights had already expired under the old law, which was the one governing his contract of employment.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>supra, 90 Conn. 221 (\u201cWhatever inchoate right, arising from his injuries, [the claimant] may have lost by noncompliance with the conditions precedent to a definite and enforceable claim, was then lost. Whatever that loss was, it could not be restored to him by subsequent legislation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Although the legislature effected a policy change in 1959 when it amended \u00a7 1330e to eliminate the bar against claims filed more than five years after the termination of the employment relationship, we have concluded that the legislature intended that change to have prospective applicability only. See part I. Moreover, the legislative history of the 1959 amendment indicates that the legislature, in removing the prohibition against claims not filed within five years of the last date of employment, did not intend to revive claims that had already expired under \u00a7 1330e.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the date of injury rule to revive the claimant\u2019s right to file a claim would nullify the five year limitation period of \u00a7 1330e, thereby altering the settled rights and obligations of the parties, contrary to the intent of the legislature.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kirshner, </em>225 Conn. 185, 203-204, 621 A.2d 1326 (1993); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 22, 513 A.2d 660 (1986); <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Ulysses, </em>149 Conn. 396, 401-402, 180 A.2d 632 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We need not, and do not, reject the date of injury rule as it has been applied since 1916 to determine the rights and obligations of the parties under the act. We conclude, however, that the date of injury rule has no applicability under the facts of this case, in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>claimant\u2019s right to seek compensation already expired under the provisions of the act governing the employment relationship. Accordingly, the review board properly determined that the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, filed more than forty years after his right to seek compensation benefits had expired under \u00a7 1330e, was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The decision of the review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Borden and Norcott, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1939) 5 1330e provided in relevant part: \u201c(a) The first sentence of section 1613c is amended to read as follows: No proceedings for compensation under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation shall be given within one year from the date of the accident or from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury . . . provided no claim on account of an occupational disease shall be made by an employee or his dependents against the employer in whose employ the disease is claimed to have originated, except while the employee is still in such employ, or within five years after his leaving such employ. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Section 1330e was amended in 1959, at which time the prohibition against compensation claims filed more than five years after the termination of employment was eliminated. Public Acts 1959, No. 580, \u00a7 8, codified at General Statutes (1959 Sup.) \u00a7 31-168. In 1980, the legislature further amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to extend the period for the filing of a claim due to an occupational disease from one year after the first manifestation of a symptom of the disease to three years thereafter. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-124, \u00a7 5, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 31-294; see footnote 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> The Second Injury Fund and Travelers Insurance Company are also defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\"> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act can be found at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 through 31-355a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> The claimant died prior to the decision of the review board, and the original appeal from that decision was taken by the claimant\u2019s attorney in the claimant\u2019s name.

This appeal by the executrix followed. References to the plaintiff are to Angela Rice in her capacity as executrix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\"> The defendants, in their appeal to the review board, raised objections to certain of the commissioner\u2019s factual findings. Because the review board concluded that the claimant\u2019s application for benefits was barred by \u00a7 1330e, the board did not reach the defendants\u2019 claims concerning the commissioner\u2019s factual findings and, therefore, those claims are not the subject of this appeal. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the commissioner\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record.

Representative Michael J. Vernovai, who opened the debate on the amendment removing the five year limitation period, stated as follows: \u201cFinally the bill changes the [statute] of limitations to prevent people from being barred from obtaining benefits because they discovered their conditions too late to be able to make claims. The law as proposed would permit notice being filed within a year of the date of injury or disability; it provides that the present [five year] statute [of limitations] be eliminated; that prevented workers from making [a] claim after they had been out of the employ of an employer against whom they claimed more than [five years]. This prevented people at the [New Haven Clock Company] from obtaining benefits for [radium] poisoning.

The legislature, however, was concerned only with the latter bar to recovery and, consequently, the debate focused entirely upon the elimination of that provision. In amending the act to eliminate the five year limitation period for the filing of claims, the legislature, as Representative Satter indicated, intended the amendment to apply only to those compensation claims that, unlike the claim in <em>Vegliante, </em>had not expired under the prior law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\"> The plaintiff suggests that because the legislature is presumed to have been aware of the date of injury rule; see <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 221-23; application of the rule to revive the claimant\u2019s right to file a claim would not be inconsistent with the intent of the legislature. As we have discussed, however, the date of injury rule is inapplicable in circumstances where, as here, there is no choice of laws issue to be decided. Thus, a presumption that the legislature was aware of the rule provides no support for the plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b813-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIua\">dissenting. For more than three quarters of a century, Connecticut law has been clear that the workers\u2019 compensation statute in effect on the date of an employee\u2019s injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governs that employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. \u201cThis date of injury rule was first referred to in 1916, in <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 220-21, 96 A. 963 (1916). In 1921, we stated that \u2018[t]he obligations of the employer to dependents of an employee in case of the death of an injured employee are . . . fixed and determined by the statute in force <em>at the time of injury.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Quilty </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>96 Conn. 124, 127, 113 A. 149 (1921).\u201d <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988). The majority, however, now layers an exception on this longstanding date of injury rule. According to the majority, the date of injury rule does not apply if (1) the statute \u201cgoverning the employment relationship\u201d provided that the employee must file a claim for injury within a specified time, and (2) that claim period has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>For several reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to engraft this novel exception onto what has been an unquestioned substantive rule of law in Connecticut for seventy-nine years. First, the position taken by the majority is inconsistent with the important policy considerations underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act). Second, the majority\u2019s recognition of this exception is based upon a faulty interpretation of our case law and the legislature\u2019s intent. Finally, this exception results in an anachronistic approach to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">It is beyond dispute that our act is remedial in nature and must be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purposes. <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992); <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992); <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 32, 602 A.2d 560 (1992); <em>Ash </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>207 Conn. 665, 672, 541 A.2d 1233 (1988). Moreover, \u201c[bjecause the [a]ct is a remedial statute, this court should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u201d <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990). The position taken by the majority, however, seems to disregard these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In this case, no one disputes the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s finding that Carl Rice, the claimant, suffered \u201cfrom an occupational disease which was caused by his exposure to asbestos\u201d in 1942 while he was employed by the named defendant, Vermilyn Brown, Inc. Furthermore, no one disputes that the claimant\u2019s occupational disease first manifested itself and became compensable in 1986, and that he gave timely notice of the occupational disease to his employer in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00a7 31-294, the statute then in effect. Applying its newly discovered date of injury exception to the facts of this case, however, the majority concludes that the estate of the claimant and his widow are ineligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. According to the majority, the claimant\u2019s right to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim expired in 1947, thirty-nine years before he even discovered he suffered from the disease. Such a conclusion clearly does not comport with the humanitarian purposes underlying the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Aside from policy considerations, the assumptions upon which the majority has based its date of injury exception are flawed. The majority relies primarily on certain case law and an interpretation of legislative history for its conclusion that the date of injury rule \u201chas no application when, as here, the parties\u2019 rights and obligations have been so finally concluded under the provisions of the act governing the employment relationship that no subsequent amendment without retrospective effect can alter them.\u201d Neither of these sources, however, provides support for the majority\u2019s position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The majority purports to rely on three early cases of this court for its decision to recognize an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>to the date of injury rule. Far from providing support for the majority's newly crafted exception, however, these cases in fact represent pure judicial applications of the date of injury rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>143 Conn. 571, 579-80, 124 A.2d 526 (1956), the plaintiff was a former employee of the New Haven Clock Company. Between 1922 and 1928, her job at the factory consisted of painting clock dials with radium, a radioactive substance. Id., 573. \u201cIn the fall of 1928, the plaintiff knew that she was suffering from radium poisoning owing to her employment by the defendant.\u201d Id., 574. She received medical care for her condition in 1928 and left the company in 1931. Id. Thus, the date of injury for her occupational disease was 1928. She did not file a claim against her employer, however, until 1941, when symptoms of the disease reappeared. Id., 575-76. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner denied her claim on the basis that she had failed to file a written notice of claim within one year after the first manifestation of the disease or within three years after leaving her employment, as required by the statute in effect in 1928.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The plaintiff appealed to this court, arguing that the commissioner, who heard her claim in 1941, should have disregarded the law in effect in 1928 and instead should have applied the law in effect in 1941.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 578-79. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>court, however, rejected her argument. \u201cIn the present case, the amendment . . . did not become effective until nearly seven years after the symptoms of the disease first were manifest.\u201d Id., 579. Concluding that the law in effect on the date of her injury governed her claim, this court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. Thus, contrary to the interpretation of the majority, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 571, represented a pure and unadulterated application of the date of injury rule to the precise issue presented by this case: the date by which notice was required to be provided to the employer, and the period of limitation on the filing of a claim, were determined by the statute in effect on the date that the injury first became compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">This court took the same approach in <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>120 Conn. 456, 181 A. 539 (1935), the second case relied upon by the majority. In <em>Rossi, </em>the plaintiff was employed as a granite cutter. In 1924, he began to have trouble breathing, an ailment several doctors diagnosed, incorrectly as it turned out, as bronchitis and asthma. Id., 459. It was not until 1932, however, that doctors correctly diagnosed him as suffering from the occupational disease pneumoconiosis. Id., 460. The law in effect in 1924 required an injured worker to provide notice to his employer of his compensation claim within one year from the \u201cdate of the injury.\u201d General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5360, as amended by Public Acts 1921, c. 306, \u00a7 8. The compensation commissioner, concluding that the date of injury was 1924,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> therefore denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim because he had failed to furnish notice by 1925. On appeal, however, the plaintiff urged this court instead to apply the law in effect in 1932,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>which this court had interpreted to mean that notice must be provided one year from the time that \u201ca symptom of that disease should plainly appear, not when it was merely suspected or doubtful.\u201d <em>Bremner </em>v. <em>Eidlitz &amp; Son, Inc., </em>118 Conn. 666, 669-70, 174 A. 172 (1934). The plaintiff argued, therefore, that because doctors had not discovered his pneumoconiosis until 1932, the <em>Bremner </em>rule required the one year period to start running then. <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>supra, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">This court rejected the plaintiffs claim, concluding that his claim was governed by the statute in effect in 1924, his date of injury. \u201cA compensable injury having occurred in 1924, the respective rights and obligations of both parties to the contract of employment were fixed and determined by the statutory provisions in force at that time. It was then required by General Statutes, 1918, \u00a7 5360, that notice of claim for compensation must be given by the employee within one year from the \u2018date of [the] injury,\u2019 and we have held this term to mean the \u2018date of the compensable injury\u2019 .... There was no provision in the statute (\u00a7 5360) to protect the employee under such circumstances by extending the time for filing his claim, for a period of seven years after the one-year period fixed by the statute.\u201d Id., 460-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Finally, this court took the same approach to the date of injury rule in the third case cited by the majority, <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>supra, 90 Conn. 217. In that case, the plaintiff was injured on September 15, 1914, while lifting a heavy barrel during the course of his employment. Id., 218-19. He did not serve notice of his injury on the defendant, however, until April 13, 1915. Id., 219. Chapter 138, \u00a7 21 of the 1913 Public Acts required an employee to provide notice to his employer of an injury within thirty days. The plaintiff argued, however, that chapter 288 of the 1915 Public Acts, which did not go into effect until May 20, 1915, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>trolled his claim instead. That act extended the period during which the employee could provide notice to his employer from thirty days to one full year. Public Acts 1915, c. 288, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">This court rejected both his argument and his compensation claim: \u201cThe Act of 1913 was in force <em>when this claimant\u2019s injuries were received, </em>when the thirty days provided by it for notice thereof to be given to his employer had run, when notice was in fact given to his employer, and when the attempt to enforce his claim was begun. Whatever right of compensation he might have had thus became fixed, and the extent of it determined, or, rather, the elements to be considered in its determination became fixed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>supra, 90 Conn. 220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In each of these three cases, therefore, the plaintiff suffered a known and compensable injury that, according to the date of injury rule, triggered the statute or act in effect at that time. The statute or act in effect on the date of injury dictated a period of limitation, which each plaintiff failed to satisfy. Under the circumstances of these three cases, therefore, this court properly applied the date of injury rule to reject their compensation claims, even though the claims would have been enforceable under the law in effect on the date the claims were filed. In the present case, the claimant first suffered a known and compensable injury in 1986, which triggered the statute in effect at that time. That statute required only that a claimant provide notice of claim to the employer \u201cwithin one year from the date of the accident or within three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease,\u201d and did not include any five year period of limitation. General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-294. For the majority to hold that we must instead look to the statute in effect in 1942, more than forty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>before the claimant\u2019s injury became known and compensable, defies our unwavering precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s primary justification for its holding\u2014that the decedent\u2019s \u201cright to seek compensation already expired\u201d in 1947\u2014suffers from a fatal flaw. It is plain that no employee has a \u201cright\u201d to receive workers\u2019 compensation until he or she has suffered a compensable injury. <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>supra, 120 Conn. 460; see <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>132 Conn. 81, 89-90, 42 A.2d 697 (1945) (\u201ccircumstances of the injury are such that the employee would have a right to recover workmen\u2019s compensation\u201d); see also <em>Balkus </em>v. <em>Terry Steam Turbine Co., </em>167 Conn. 170, 180-81, 355 A.2d 227 (1974) (\u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation to pay compensation became fixed on the date of injury\u201d). To the extent that the claimant possessed a \u201cright\u201d to compensation, therefore, he could not have acquired that right until 1986, when his occupational disease first manifested itself. Thus, it is impossible for the majority to defend its position by arguing that the claimant\u2019s right to compensation had \u201cexpired\u201d in 1947. At that time, he had no right that could expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s assertions that, in this case, \u201cthere is no choice of law issue to be resolved\u201d and \u201cthere remains no choice of law question requiring the application of the date of injury rule,\u201d reflect a circular approach to this issue. As the majority correctly recognizes, the date of injury rule exists as a means to determine which of two possibly conflicting statutes should apply to an employee\u2019s compensation claim. Here, the choice is between two: the 1939 statute, which included a period of limitation, and later statutes, which did not. This case, therefore, presents a classic illustration of the need to apply the date of injury rule. In a flourish of circuitous reasoning, however, the majority turns this rule on its head: The majority first determines that the 1939 statute applies, and then con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>eludes that because the 1939 statute applies, \u201cthere is no choice of law\u201d issue in need of the date of injury rule\u2019s application. It is the majority, therefore, that suffers from \u201ca fundamental misunderstanding of the issue presented by this case\u201d and of the purposes of the date of injury rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The majority also concludes that the legislative history of \u00a7 31-294 precludes our application of the date of injury rule in this case. In reaching this conclusion, the majority disregards our longstanding rules of statutory construction, and, indeed, misinterprets the very legislative history upon which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">When the legislature amended the workers\u2019 compensation statute in 1959 to eliminate the statutory requirement that an employee bring a workers\u2019 compensation claim against his employer \u201cwithin five years after his leaving such employ\u201d; General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1939) \u00a7 1330e; the date of injury rule had already been the law in Connecticut for forty-three years. We may presume that the legislature was mindful of this judicial construction and knew of its practical effects. <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 196 Conn. 192, 200 n.14, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985). We must conclude, therefore, that the legislature realized and intended that the amended statute, \u00a7 31-294, which did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>include the five year limitation, would apply to any injury arising in the future. We similarly must conclude that if the legislature did not intend the 1959 amendment so to apply, it would have made this intention clear in explicit terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Indeed, this court made exactly this point in <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 223, when it applied this rule of construction to <em>restrict </em>the right of the worker\u2019s dependents to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In <em>Iacomacci, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s husband had suffered a heart attack in 1974 as the result of a compensable injury. Id., 221. At the time of this injury, the workers\u2019 compensation statute provided that if death later resulted from the injury, no death benefits would be awarded until a \u201cwaiting period\u201d had passed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The legislature repealed this provision in 1978, and the plaintiff\u2019s husband died in 1981. The plaintiff argued that the legislature\u2019s repeal of the waiting period should be deemed \u201cto apply to all future surviving dependents without regard to the date of injury which brought them within the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">This court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim, concluding \u201cthat the legislature intended that the applicability of the 1978 revisions was to be controlled by the traditional date of injury rule, thereby requiring that claims arising out of injuries occurring prior to October 1, 1978, would be subject to the previously specified reduction in benefits.\u201d Id., 224.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This same reasoning applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>to this case, and requires us to apply the law in effect in 1986, when the claimant\u2019s occupational injury first manifested itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The majority, however, asserts that the legislative history of the 1959 amendment indicates that the legislature intended the change to have prospective effect only, and that the legislature \u201cdid not intend to revive claims that had already expired.\u201d The majority purportedly bases this conclusion upon the remarks of one legislator, Representative Robert Satter, during debate on the bill in the House of Representatives. The majority not only has misinterpreted Representative Satter\u2019s remarks, but also places undue emphasis on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">First, the majority misconstrues Representative Satter\u2019s remarks. The provision of the bill in question was a direct response to the radium poisoning problem addressed by this court in <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 571. As indicated earlier, in <em>Vegliante, </em>this court had refused to allow an employee who had contracted radium poisoning while working at the New Haven Clock Company to bring a workers\u2019 compensation claim under the act because she had failed to satisfy the three year requirement. It was noted in that case that medical knowledge suggested that the \u201cresiduals\u201d of radium poisoning, such as body lesions, could manifest themselves ten to fifteen years after an employee\u2019s exposure to the radium. Id., 575. The legislative history clearly shows that the 1959 legislators considering the amendment to the act were deeply concerned about occupational diseases that could lie dormant for years without any overt manifestations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>During debate on the House floor, legislators expressed concern over which law would govern workers\u2019 compensation claims, arising in the future, of workers who had been exposed to radium in the past. Specifically, they wanted to know whether workers who had been exposed to radium prior to 1959, but who had not yet manifested symptoms of the disease, would be covered by the 1959 amendment. The exchange on the House floor, upon which the majority apparently relies, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">\u201c[Representative Robert] Satter: I would say that this law consistently provides that any manifestations of an injury which occur sometime later is nevertheless compensable even if it is after the [one year] statute of limitations. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">\u201c[Representative J. McCullough] Turner: Would this cover a case of radiation illness? The gentleman from Watertown referred to radiation poisoning among workers in the [New Haven Clock Company] and I know well this is a latent disease which doesn\u2019t develop until up to [twenty-five] years after exposure. Would this bill cover those persons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">\u201c[Representative] Satter: Under the present law those people who received that illness in the [New Haven Clock Company] would not be compensated; the present bill would enable them to be compensated, because the statute of limitation doesn\u2019t start until there is a manifestation of the symptoms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">\u201c[Representative] Turner: The gentleman from Newington, a technicality. I would like to be assured that this bill before us would cover those cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">\u201c[Representative] Satter: Those cases that have occurred previously would not be covered by this law; the law would become effective on its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Representative Satter, therefore, correctly informed the House that the New Haven Clock Company workers who had suffered known and compensable injuries prior to 1959 but who had failed to comply with the statutory requirements then in effect would not be able to use the amendment to revive their claims. Representative Satter, however, did <em>not </em>say that workers at the clock company who would suffer known and compensable injuries <em>after </em>1959 would similarly be prevented from filing claims. On the contrary, he stated that with respect to clock company workers who had been exposed to radium in the past, when the applicable statute included a period of limitation, but whose occupational disease had not yet manifested itself, the bill <em>\u201cwould enable them to be </em>compensated, <em>because the statute of limitation doesn\u2019t start until there is a manifestation of the symptoms.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 8 H.R. Proc., Pt. 12, 1959 Sess., p. 5083. In other words, the statute in effect on the date of injury would apply even though the occupational disease was the result of exposure to the disease-causing agent during employment prior to 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Second, even if Representative Satter\u2019s remarks were ambiguous, this court should not allow that ambiguity to justify the denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for an occupational disease that the decedent undeniably had contracted during his employment. Indeed, the majority must not be allowed to concede that the legislative history is \u201cnot a model of clarity,\u201d and in the next breath rely upon that very ambiguity to defeat the compensation claim of an injured worker and his widow. Such an interpretation of the legislative history does not comport with the remedial purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that I identified in the first part of this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Finally, even if Representative Satter somehow had intended the connotation that the majority attributes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>to him, that statement would not necessarily control the outcome of this case. We have recognized that some statements that appear in the legislative history are not controlling \u201cbecause we recognize that legislative discussions may only be expressive of the views and motive of individual members and may not be a safe guide to views of the law making body.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 9,434 A.2d 293 (1980). It seems incredible to me that, against a date of injury rule from which we have not wavered in more than seventy-five years, the majority should find the remarks of one legislator\u2014which, from the viewpoint of the majority, are at best ambiguous\u2014 to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Finally, construing the workers\u2019 compensation laws to deny benefits to an employee whose occupational disease clearly is job related, but the symptoms of which do not manifest themselves until after the required notice period, is clearly anachronistic. Professor Larson makes this point in his treatise, in which he criticizes statutes that essentially require an employee to furnish notice of or file a claim before the employee even knows of the injury. \u201cIt is odd indeed to find, in a supposedly beneficent piece of legislation, the survival of this fragment of irrational cruelty surpassing the most technical forfeitures of legal statutes of limitation. Statutes of limitation generally proceed on the theory that a person forfeits his or her rights only when there is an inexcusable delay in the assertion of them, and any number of excuses will toll the running of the period. But here no amount of vigilance is of any help. The limitations period runs against a claim that has not yet matured; and when it matures, it is already barred. For good measure, the exclusive remedy provisions of the Compensation Act also abolish claimant\u2019s common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>law remedies.\u201d 2B A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1994) \u00a7 78.42 (b), p. 15-299.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">On the basis of the beneficent purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, our unwavering precedent, legislative history and plain logic, the date of injury rule must be applied to determine which period of notice or claim limitation applies to an employee\u2019s compensation claim. In spite of this longstanding and clear directive, however, the majority today creates a judicial exception that has the effect in this case of depriving a worker and his widow of compensation benefits because they failed to file a claim at a time when they could not have had any knowledge of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\"> The date of an employee\u2019s injury \u201cis not the time of the accident or occurrence causing injury, but the time . . . when the right to compensation accrues.\u201d <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Marlin-Rockwell Corp., </em>96 Conn. 414, 418-19, 114 A. 92 (1921). In other words, the date of injury refers to the date of the first manifestation of the occupational disease. <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>143 Conn. 571, 580-81, 124 A.2d 526 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> Moreover, the majority does not attempt to explain which of several workers\u2019 compensation statutes and amendments\u2014which may contain slightly different limitation periods during which notice to the employer must be provided or claims must be brought\u2014in effect during a person\u2019s lengthy period of employment \u201cgoverns the employment relationship.\u201d The majority, for example, does not explain whether a statute in effect on the first day of employment \u201cgoverns\u201d the relationship, whether the statute in effect for the majority of the relationship \u201cgoverns,\u201d or whether the statute in effect on the last day of employment \u201cgoverns.\u201d Indeed, it is precisely to eliminate such distinctions that the date of injury rule exists. By looking simply to the statute in effect on the employee\u2019s date of injury, we eliminate the task of picking and choosing among several potentially applicable statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> The statute provided that \u201cno claim for an occupational disease shall be made by an employee . . . against an employer in whose employ the disease is claimed to have originated, except while the employee is still in such employ, or within three years after leaving such employ.\u201d General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5360, as amended by Public Acts 1921, c. 306, \u00a7 8, and by Public Acts 1927, c. 307, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\"> The statute in effect in 1941 provided that the one year notice requirement would not be a bar to recovery \u201cif within said period of one year an employee shall have been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Cum Sup. 1935) \u00a7 1613c. Because the plaintiff had received treatment for her condition in 1928, the year she discovered the disease, she argued that this provision applied to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> This court concluded that the commissioner was justified in so finding. <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>supra, 120 Conn. 459-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> The statute in effect in 1932 provided that the one year period did not start to run until the appearance of \u201cthe first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease . . . .\u201d General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> Furthermore, I do not understand the basis for the majority\u2019s contention that it is not carving an exception into the date of injury rule. The majority, as I have pointed out, acknowledges that the date of injury rule is a means to determine which of two possibly conflicting statutes should apply to an employee\u2019s compensation claim. Indeed, we have applied this rule for this purpose since 1916. Logic and consistency of our decisions dictate that we should follow this approach in this case as well. The majority\u2019s refusal to do so, therefore, is quite accurately captioned as an exception to the rule. Moreover, the majority cites no case of this court or of any other court as direct support for its proposition that the date of injury rule \u201chas no applicability\u201d when the statute \u201cgoverning the employment relationship\u201d contains a period of limitation and that period has expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> The length of this \u201cwaiting period\u201d was equal to the amount of time that the decedent had collected benefits while alive. <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 220 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> The court pointed out that the \u201cpresumption that the legislature was aware of those tenets is further supported by its passage of two workers\u2019 compensation revisions that specifically stated that new benefits were to accrue to previously injured workers.\u201d <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 223.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> See 8 S.

Larson, supra, \u00a7 78.42 (e), pp. 15-302-304. This issue, however, was not raised by the parties in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
