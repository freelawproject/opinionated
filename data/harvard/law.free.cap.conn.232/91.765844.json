On October 27, 1986, the complainant, Susan Frederick, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a complaint with the defendant commission on human rights and opportunities (CHRO) alleging that her former employer, the plaintiff, Bridgeport Hospital, had unlawfully terminated her employment because of her mental condition, depression, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CHRO made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the plaintiff had committed a discriminatory employment prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>tice and, upon the failure of conciliation, certified the matter to a public hearing. A hearing was held on May 5,1992, before hearing officer John F. Daly, who rendered a final decision in favor of Frederick. The damages awarded by the CHRO hearing officer included $5000 for \u201cpain, humiliation and emotional damages\u201d and an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Frederick\u2019s private counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The plaintiff appealed CHRO\u2019s decision, challenging, inter alia,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the $5000 award to Frederick for emotional distress and the award to her private counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>sustained the appeal as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees but dismissed the appeal as to the award of damages for emotional distress. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, contesting the validity of the $5000 award for emotional distress, and CHRO appealed, challenging the validity of the trial court\u2019s determination on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. We transferred these appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and conclude that \u00a7 46a-86 does not permit either of these awards for a violation of \u00a7 46a-60. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and affirm its judgment in CHRO\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Although the issues are discussed in separate briefs because they were raised in two separate appeals, whether CHRO, following a finding of a discriminatory employment practice, is authorized to award damages for emotional distress or attorney\u2019s fees depends on an examination of the same statute, which we consider in its entirety to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, and a discussion of overlapping policy considerations underlying the statute. CHRO has presented four primary arguments in support of its hearing officer\u2019s award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>both damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees to Frederick. First, CHRO argues that the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language contained within \u00a7 46a-86 (a) is sufficiently broad, by its very nature, to authorize the award of damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees. Second, CHRO argues that the judiciary should defer to the interpretation of \u00a7 46a-86 by the agency charged with its enforcement and that the twelve year history of CHRO of awarding damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees reflects sound construction of legislative intent. Third, to demonstrate the reasonableness of its decision to apply a broad interpretation of the statute, CHRO points to other state and federal employment legislation pursuant to which similar awards have been made. Finally, CHRO claims that a decision by this court that \u00a7 46a-86 does not authorize damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees will render it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Although CHRO advances some important policy reasons why damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded, our function is to ascertain what the legislature intended and to enforce that intent rather than to \u201csubstitut[e] [our] own ideas of what might be a wise provision in place of a clear expression of legislative will.\u201d <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>175 Conn. 463, 474-75, 399 A.2d 1280 (1978). In other words, absent express statutory authorization for the awarding of such damages, the policy arguments of CHRO are an insufficient basis upon which to award them.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We begin our discussion by focusing on the language of the statute. <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>226 Conn. 579, 590, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993) (\u201c[i]n construing a statutory provision, we first look to its language, and if that language is plain and unambiguous, \u2018we need look no further\u2019 \u201d). Section 46a-86 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) If, upon all the evidence presented at the hearing conducted pursuant to section 46a-84, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>presiding officer finds that a respondent has engaged in any discriminatory practice, the presiding officer shall state his findings of fact and shall issue and file with the commission and cause to be served on the respondent an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory practice and further requiring the respondent to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the presiding officer will effectuate the purpose of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u201c(b) In addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a discriminatory employment practice, the presiding officer may order the hiring or reinstatement of employees, with or without back pay, or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, provided, liability for back pay shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing or issuance of the complaint and, provided further, interim earnings, including unemployment compensation and welfare assistance or amounts which could have been earned with reasonable diligence on the part of the person to whom back pay is awarded shall be deducted from the amount of back pay to which such person is otherwise entitled. The amount of any such deduction for interim unemployment compensation or welfare assistance shall be paid by the respondent to the commission which shall transfer such amount to the appropriate state or local agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201c(c) In addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a discriminatory practice prohibited by section 46a-58, 46a-59, 46a-64, 46a-64c, 46a-81b, 46a-81d or 46a-81e, the presiding officer shall determine the damage suffered by the complainant, which damage shall include but not be limited to the expense incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternate housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs and other costs actually incurred by him as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>a result of such discriminatory practice and shall allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u201c(d) In addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a discriminatory practice prohibited by section 46a-66 or 46a-81f, the presiding officer shall issue and file with the commission and cause to be served on the respondent an order requiring the respondent to pay the complainant the damages resulting from the discriminatory practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Subsection (a) is the only subsection of \u00a7 46a-86 to which CHRO cites as authority to award damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees following a finding of a discriminatory employment practice. It is the remaining language of \u00a7 46a-86, however, that is more instructive. The plaintiff argues that the general language authorizing the hearing officer to issue an \u201corder requiring . . . the respondent to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the presiding officer will effectuate the purpose of this chapter\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (a); cannot include an authorization to award compensatory damages, other than what is expressly authorized in subsection (b), or attorney\u2019s fees because of the express restriction on the availability of such awards to cases brought under the specific statutes enumerated in subsections (c) and (d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature \u201cdid not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. See <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 418, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990) (\u201c[a] statute should be read as a whole and interpreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions\u201d); <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>180 Conn. 474, 476, 429 A.2d 952 (1980) (it is a \u201cwell established principle that statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d). If compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees are authorized within the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language of \u00a7 46a-86 (a), subsections (c) and (d) are superfluous. Both expressly delineate the availability of compensatory damages. Statutes prohibiting employment discrimination are not included. \u201cIt is an axiom of statutory construction that legislative intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation.\u201d <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). \u201c \u2018Unless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). Thus, the legislature\u2019s express exclusion of \u00a7 46a-60 from \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d) evidences its intent not to authorize compensatory damages, other than back pay as provided for in subsection (b), and attorney\u2019s fees for employment discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Legislative history also supports our determination that, unless expressly authorized, compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees cannot be awarded under \u00a7 46a-86. Section 46a-82, formerly \u00a7 31-127, was amended by No. 334 of the 1959 Public Acts, requiring CHRO, when it has found an unfair employment practice, \u201cto take such affirmative action, including, but not limited to, hiring or reinstatement of employees, with or without back pay, or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, as in the judgment of the tribunal will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the absence of any mention of either general compensatory damages or attorney\u2019s fees in the discussions surrounding this enactment, it appears that neither was contemplated. Back pay is the only monetary component contained within the statute. Moreover, then Representative Robert Satter, the sponsor of the legislation, responding to an inquiry about the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language, stated that \u201csuch further action might mean where a man has been taken off one job and put on another job to ask to be returned to the first job for which he was taken off, or such similar action which within the general employment area cannot be specifically stated in a general statute of this nature.\u201d 8 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7,1959 Sess., p. 2594. Representative Satter\u2019s explanation, which suggests that the scope of the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is more limited than that proposed by CHRO, carries particular weight and deserves careful consideration as the statement of the legislator who reported the bill out of committee. <em>Manchester Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>South Windsor, </em>203 Conn. 267, 275, 524 A.2d 621 (1987). We further note that CHRO originally had virtually identical powers in housing and employment cases. General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1961) \u00a7 53-36, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>housing discrimination statute, provided that CHRO had \u201cthe same powers as provided in chapter 563 in the case of unfair employment practices . . . .\u2019\u2019In 1967, the legislature amended \u00a7 53-36 to authorize CHRO to award an expansive list of damages and attorney\u2019s fees in cases of housing discrimination. Public Acts 1967, No. 756. Once again, if the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language had encompassed compensatory damages or attorney\u2019s fees, this amendment would have been unnecessary. To adopt CHRO\u2019s interpretation of this phrase would require us to presume that this 1967 legislative enactment was meaningless, a presumption contrary to accepted principles of statutory construction. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The enactment of No. 91-58 of the 1991 Public Acts (P.A. 91-58) (Sexual Orientation Discrimination Act) further demonstrates the legislature\u2019s continuing intent to limit CHRO\u2019s authority to award compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees. That enactment amended \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to grant CHRO the authority to make awards of compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees to persons discriminated against based on sexual orientation in the areas of associations of licensed persons, public accommodations and housing. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81b, 46a-81d and 46a-81e.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>also amended \u00a7 46a-86 (d) to grant CHRO the authority to make awards of compensatory damages to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ons discriminated against based on sexual orientation in credit practices. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81f.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>This recent effort to add particular types of discrimination to \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d) is significant. As an initial matter, it reinforces the conclusion that the legislature did not intend the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d to encompass compensatory damages or attorney\u2019s fees, and that it was necessary to include these provisions explicitly within the protective scope of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d). Of even greater import is its obvious exclusion from the coverage of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d) of any discriminatory practice prohibited by \u00a7 46a-81c, which prohibits sexual orientation discrimination in employment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By differentiating among the various provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81b, 46a-81c, 46a-81d, 46a-81e and 46a-81f, all of which became law upon the passage of P.A. 91-58, \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d) reflect a clear intention by the legislature to restrict the scope of both subsections to only certain types of discrimination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 766 (statutory itemization indicates legislative intent to exclude unenumerated items).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Moreover, the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d is a term of art used to describe possible steps for employers to take in recruitment and hiring to eliminate employment barriers to minorities. <em>Mele </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>395 F. Sup. 592, 595 (D.N.J. 1975), aff'd sub nom. <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, </em>532 F.2d 747 (3d Cir. 1976). When the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d was used in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it did not mean compensatory damages, other than back pay, or punitive damages. <em>Cosby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>472 F. Sup. 547, 553 (S.D. Ohio 1979).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It referred to prospective relief that goes beyond make whole remedies and requires employers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to undertake such efforts in hiring minority employees to enforce equal opportunity fully. <em>Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Assn. </em>v. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, </em>478 U.S. 421, 448-49, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 92 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1986). Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, in which Congress expressly authorized the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages, such damages were not available for violations of Title VII. Because \u201cwe are properly guided by the case law surrounding federal fair employment legislation\u201d; <em>Civil Service Commission </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 226, 230, 487 A.2d 201 (1985); particularly when the federal provision is so similar, we recognize the federal decisions concluding that neither compensatory damages, other than back pay, nor emotional distress damages were available under Title VII as originally enacted. See <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1491, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>504 U.S. 229, 238-39, 112 S. Ct. 1867, 119 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The trial court did not independently conduct this type of analysis in concluding that damages for emotional distress were included within the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d in \u00a7 46a-86 (a). Rather, the court deferred to the construction of the statute given by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement and remarked upon the consistency with which CHRO has awarded such damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Citing to one of its own deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>sions in which it had found that CHRO\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 46a-86 (a) was \u201csomewhat strained but not implausible,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the trial court acquiesced in CHRO\u2019s determination that the statute authorizes compensatory damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This deference was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">We recognize our usual rule of according deference to the construction given a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). Deference may be appropriate when the issue is the application of general statutory language to a particular fact-bound controversy. As we have stated many times, \u201cthe factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts; see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g); <em>Board of Aider-men </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Community Antennae Television Co., </em>168 Conn. 294, 298-99, 362 A.2d 529 (1975); <em>Westport </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>167 Conn. 151, 355 A.2d 25 (1974); 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7\u00a7 645, 675; [however,] it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S. Ct. 980, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1965); <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B., </em>487 F.2d 1143, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1170-71 (D.C. Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>417 U.S. 790, 94 S. Ct. 2737, 41 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1974); 73 C. J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure \u00a7 69.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 698-99, 519 A.2d 41 (1986). We recently modified this rule in <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 376, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993), wherein we stated that a trial court may properly give deference to the agency charged with enforcement of a statute when there are two equally plausible interpretations of the statutory language. Based upon our reading of the statute as stated earlier in this opinion, it is not plausible that the legislature intended the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d to include compensatory damages or attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Finally, special deference was improper because CHRO\u2019s determination that the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d included compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees confronted the trial court with a question of law that had not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. De<em>pt. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 679, 628 A.2d 957 (1993) (\u201cwhen a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency is not entitled to special deference\u201d); <em>Quinnipiac Council, Boy Scouts of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>204 Conn. 287, 295, 528 A.2d 352 (1987) (\u201cdeference [to an administrative decision] is unwarranted when the question is the construction of a statute on an issue that has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny\u201d). The trial court\u2019s reliance on CHRO\u2019s interpretation was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>While we recognize that a hearing officer has broad authority to construct remedies for employees who have suffered discrimination in the workplace, this power can be exercised only to accomplish the remedial purpose of the statute, which is to \u201c \u2018restore those wronged to their rightful economic status absent the effects of the unlawful discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>211 Conn. 464, 484, 559 A.2d 1120 (1989). We agree with the well expressed limitations placed on \u00a7 46a-86 (a) by the trial court in <em>Fenn Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV92-509435 (February 8,1994), aff\u2019d, 232 Conn. 117, 652 A.2d 1011 (1995). The trial court stated: \u201cThis language does not confer on the CHRO the power to impose exemplary or punitive damages on a discriminating employer, nor even to compensate the employee for any consequential or incidental damages he or she may have suffered by reason of the employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct. Instead, it directs the CHRO to ensure that whatever remedy is fashioned for the employee be designed to return him or her to the same economic status he or she would have had in the workplace if unlawful discrimination never occurred. This, of course, requires that consideration be given to placing the employee in a position which is \u2018the functional equivalent of the position\u2019 he or she would have occupied had there been no unlawful discrimination, and that he or she be \u2018accorded all the rights and privileges appertaining thereof . . . including] the right to be considered for additional promotional possibilities on the same footing as\u2019 other similarly situated persons who have suffered no discrimination. <em>Civil Service Commissions. CHRO, </em>supra, [195 Conn. 231].<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>requires . . . that consideration be given to awarding monetary relief to any employee who cannot otherwise be restored to the economic status he or she would have had were it not for the discriminatory conduct in question. Apart, however, from closing any financial gap which is directly related to workplace status, such as pay rates, bonuses and benefits . . . [and] absent express statutory authorization for the awarding of such [monetary relief] damages, as is explicitly made for public accommodations cases in General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c), no such damages can be awarded in an employment discrimination case under the \u2018affirmative action\u2019 clause of \u00a7 46a-86 (a).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">CHRO also argues that because of the remedial nature of \u00a7 46a-86, we should look to other related statutes and to the common law governing wrongful termination of employment in order to provide that which is conspicuously absent from the provision in issue. CHRO, in effect, asks us \u201cto borrow\u201d the authority from these other related sources because there is \u201can overlapping of remedial purpose in wrongful discharge situations which should logically extend to the award<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ing of emotional distress damages for claimed violations of ... \u00a7 46a-60 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">CHRO points to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-104 as an example of a statute that reflects the legislature\u2019s concern that employees who have suffered discrimination receive full compensation. The enactment of this statute strongly indicates, however, that the legislature did not intend to authorize CHRO to award such damages. Section 46a-104, entitled \u201cCivil action for discriminatory employment practice: Relief,\u201d provides: \u201cThe court may grant a complainant in an action brought in accordance with section 46a-100 such legal and equitable relief which it deems appropriate including, but not limited to, temporary or permanent injunctive relief, attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.\u201d This express authorization to the court was given by the legislature in 1991, at the same time that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d) were amended to provide for compensatory damages, and attorney\u2019s fees for certain specific forms of discrimination. Had the legislature intended to give CHRO that same power, it was certainly free to do so. Its continued silence shows it had no such intent. \u201cStatutory analogies may furnish guidance in filling a void in the law, but cannot be utilized to extend a statute tailored for a precisely defined situation to others not included within its terms.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 27, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987). Therefore, we cannot simply interpolate one statute into another to include \u201cwhat might be a wise provision in place of a clear expression of legislative will.\u201d <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 475. The passage of a separate act granting the power to the court to award compensatory damages provides no justification for reading into \u00a7 46a-86 (a) the authority for CHRO to award such damages.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Finally, CHRO argues that the denial of compensatory damages, other than back pay as expressly authorized by \u00a7 46a-86 (b), and attorney\u2019s fees to Frederick would violate the equal protection clause of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It claims that because a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 is included in the list of statutes within \u00a7 46a-86 (c) for which compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded, CHRO must be authorized to award the same relief for a violation of \u00a7 46a-60 based upon mental disability in order to withstand constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Section 46a-58 (a) makes it unlawful to subject any person \u201cto the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the . . . laws of this state or of the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability.\u201d In that statute, the legislature has provided protections for all classes of persons enumerated in the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7 20, as amended, with the exception of ancestry and mental disability. Applying the strict scru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tiny test,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> CHRO argues that there is no compelling state interest to provide fewer remedies for persons based on ancestry or mental disability than for other classes appearing in the state equal protection clause. We consider the challenge as raised to be directed to \u00a7 46a-58, which is not before this court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Certainly, if \u00a7 46a-58 included ancestry and mental disability, there could be no claim by CHRO that suspect classes of persons were being treated in a disparate fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">CHRO\u2019s argument also presupposes the application of \u00a7 46a-58 to employment cases. If \u00a7 46a-58 does not apply to employment cases, then we are not even presented with \u201cpersons similarly circumstanced.\u201d <em>F. S. Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L. Ed. 989 (1920). Nevertheless, CHRO has not bothered to brief this underlying premise. Where an issue is merely mentioned, but not briefed beyond a bare assertion of the claim, it is deemed to have been waived. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66 n.12, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). In this case, CHRO\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment derives from a premise the validity of which has not been tested. Without the benefit of adequate briefing, we will not decide whether \u00a7 46a-58 has the sweep that CHRO ascribes to it. Thus, we leave for another day the question of whether a violation of employment laws is also a violation of \u00a7 46a-58, thereby creating liability for compensatory damages, other than back pay as expressly authorized by \u00a7 46a-86 (b), and attorney\u2019s fees by virtue of its inclusion within \u00a7 46a-86 (c), or whether the omission of \u00a7 46a-60 from \u00a7 46a-86 (c) reflects the legislature\u2019s intent that \u00a7 46a-58 not pertain to employment claims. Under these circumstances, we see no reason, and therefore reject CHRO\u2019s invitation, to expand \u00a7 46a-86 (a) to include compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees because of a perceived, but unclaimed, defect in \u00a7 46a-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">CHRO also suggests that we apply to this case the due process analysis we utilized in <em>Fair Cadillac-Oldsmobile Isuzu Partnership </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>229 Conn. 312, 640 A.2d 101 (1994). CHRO argues that because the legislature authorized compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 46a-86 (c) for victims of discrimination involving housing, public accommodation, cross-burning, and desecration of public property, private property or house of religious worship, these same remedies must also be made available to victims of \u00a7 46a-60 in order to satisfy substantive due process concerns. Because of the lack of specificity in CHRO\u2019s brief, however, we are unable to discern whether we are being asked to apply an analytical framework under the state or federal constitution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Regardless, CHRO\u2019s reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Fair Cadillac-Oldsmobile Isuzu Partnership </em>involved the legislature\u2019s exercise of its police powers, a fundamentally different situation than the one presently before the court. In that case, we examined legislation that policed the operation of a legitimate business. \u201c \u2018The court\u2019s function in examining the constitutional aspect of police legislation is to decide whether the purpose of the legislation is a legitimate one and whether the particular enactment is designed to accomplish that purpose in a fair and reasonable way.\u2019 \u201d Id., 318-19. Although this case involves statutes that afford protection to someone who has been the victim of discriminatory conduct, CHRO has not demonstrated, because it has not briefed, that Frederick is otherwise entitled to certain kinds of damages or attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 66 n.12. Therefore, CHRO has failed to show that our interpretation of \u00a7 46a-86 (a) renders it an act of legislative infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal; on CHRO\u2019s appeal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 provides: \u201ccomplaint: determination; orders; dismissal, (a) If, upon all the evidence presented at the hearing conducted pursuant to section 46a-84, the presiding officer finds that a respondent has engaged in any discriminatory practice, the presiding officer shall state his findings of fact and shall issue and file with the commission and cause to be served on the respondent an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory practice and further requiring the respondent to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the presiding officer will effectuate the purpose of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u201c(b) In addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a discriminatory employment practice, the presiding officer may order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>hiring or reinstatement of employees, with or without back pay, or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, provided, liability for back pay shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing or issuance of the complaint and, provided further, interim earnings, including unemployment compensation and welfare assistance or amounts which could have been earned with reasonable diligence on the part of the person to whom back pay is awarded shall be deducted from the amount of back pay to which such person is otherwise entitled.

Rather than force the employer to create a new position or bump the innocent beneficiary of their employer\u2019s unlawful conduct, and because the complainant in the interim had been promoted, we recognized the appropriateness of awarding back pay or pay differentials to remedy employment discrimination when such relief is needed to restore the complainant to the position in which he would have been had the discriminatory practice not taken place. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 481, we upheld the decision to award monetary relief to a male retiree whose pension benefits in the early years of his retirement had been unlawfully made lower than those of similarly situated female retirees by the employer\u2019s use of a sex-based actuarial table. Payment of all monies the retiree would have received had his benefits been calculated properly by the use of a unisex actuarial table was \u201cplainly commanded]\u201d by General Statutes \u00a7 31-127, now codified at \u00a7 46a-86 (a).

See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (1) and (2) (employee alleging discrimination on basis of exercise of rights under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act may collect compensatory and/or punitive damages before court but may not collect either before workers\u2019 compensation commission); General Statutes \u00a7 31-68 (aggrieved employee of department of labor able to get double damages only if civil action is brought). CHRO also points to decisions of the state board of labor relations interpreting the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language in General Statutes \u00a7 31-107 (c) to provide for attorney\u2019s fees.
