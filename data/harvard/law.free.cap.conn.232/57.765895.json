That court affirmed the board\u2019s decision, and the plaintiff appealed from that judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">The underlying dispute between the transit district and the union involved the transit district\u2019s revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>attendance policy for its employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The revised policy was instituted unilaterally by the transit district on January 1, 1987. At that time, a collective bargaining agreement, entered into between the transit district and the union in 1979, was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On January 12,1987, the union filed a complaint with the board pursuant to the State Labor Relations Act; General Statutes \u00a7 31-101 et seq.; alleging that the transit district had implemented the revised attendance policy without negotiating with the union in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-105 (6), 7-469 and 7-470 (a) (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, the union filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association on February 13,1987. On the union\u2019s motion, the arbitration was held in abeyance pending the outcome of the dispute before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The union also filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging a violation of \u00a7 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. The NLRB concluded that the transit district was a political subdivision of the state of Connecticut and, therefore, was exempt from its jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 2 (2) <em>of </em>the NLRA. Accordingly, the NLRB dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On September 15,1987, the union filed a second complaint with the board, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 7-471 (4)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Municipal Employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Relations Act (MERA); General Statutes \u00a7 7-407 et seq.; alleging that the transit district had violated \u00a7\u00a7 31-105 (6), 7-469 and 7-470 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">On November 16, 1987, the day before a scheduled hearing before the board on the two complaints,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the transit district filed in the Superior Court an application for a temporary and permanent injunction and an order to show cause to halt the hearing. The court dismissed the transit district\u2019s action on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the transit district had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. This court affirmed the dismissal. <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>Local Union 1336, </em>211 Conn. 436, 559 A.2d 1113 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The board thereafter held a hearing on the union\u2019s two consolidated complaints. Two years after the hearing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the board rendered a decision concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>transit district had violated MERA,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and ordered the transit district to cease and desist from refusing to bargain with the union \u201cover the unilateral changes in the sick leave, discipline for late attendance and discipline for absences.\u201d In addition, the board ordered the transit district to \u201c[t]ake the following affirmative steps which the [b]oard finds will best effectuate the purposes of the [a]ct: (a) Reinstate Ezell Robinson, Pamela Davis, and any other employees who were discharged under the unilaterally changed provisions . . . and make whole said employees together with all accruing back pay and associated benefits . . . (c) Report to the [board] within thirty (30) days of this Decision and Order of the steps taken by [the transit district] to comply therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The transit district appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court claiming that the board\u2019s decision was illegal, arbitrary and an abuse of discretion in that: (1) the board\u2019s decision had not been timely rendered; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 7-273j, concerning collective bargaining for transit districts, rather than MERA, was controlling and therefore, the board had lacked jurisdiction; (3) the board had erred in failing to defer to arbitration, which was the primary remedy between the parties in the collective bargaining agreement; (4) the transit district had been given inadequate notice of the nature of the remedies and orders issued by the board; and (5) the board had erred in determining that the new attendance policy was a mandatory subject of bargaining rather than a work rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The trial court resolved each of these issues in favor of the board, and dismissed the transit district\u2019s appeal. The transit district has raised the same issues on appeal before this court. We will briefly summarize seriatim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the trial court\u2019s reasoning in resolving each issue. First, the trial court found, based on precedent; <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 95, 596 A.2d 374 (1991); that the transit district had waived its right to challenge the timeliness of the board\u2019s ruling by not applying to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-180 (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for an order requiring the board to issue its decision. Second, the trial court found that \u00a7 7-273j<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would be relevant only if there was a labor dispute \u201cwhere collective bargaining does not result in agreement.\u201d Because the parties in this case had not collectively bargained the disputed issue, the court concluded that application of \u00a7 7-273j would not be appropriate. Third, the court found that the plain language of the collective bargaining agreement provided for arbitration only when a dispute is over \u201cthe application or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement.\u201d The dispute in this case, however, was over the unilateral implementation of a revised attendance policy in violation of the duty to bargain, which is a prohibited labor practice. Therefore, the board did not have to defer to arbitration. Fourth, the court relied on <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 536, 560 A.2d 403 (1989), citing <em>Harwinton Drilling &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>188 Conn. 90, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>95-96, 448 A.2d 210 (1982), to conclude that the transit district had waived its right to question the sufficiency of the notice of the relief requested by not requesting a more definite and detailed statement as permitted under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-177 (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, based on both Connecticut and federal case law, the trial court found that the revised attendance policy, which included disciplinary measures,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was a \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d and therefore a mandatory subject of bargaining pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7-469 and 7-470 (c). <em>See Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>White, </em>171 Conn. 553, 560, 370 A.2d 1070 (1976) (defining the term \u201cconditions of employment\u201d as that which \u201cis intended to include the entire spectrum of conditions and benefits which apply to public employment, in addition to the commonly understood basic provisions relating to pay and hours of work, including but not limited to . . . discipline and discharge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u201cJudicial review of the [board\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>eral Statutes, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the [board]. . . . The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [board] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of [its] discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986); see also <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 371, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heslin, </em>215 Conn. 590, 596, 577 A.2d 1009 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1088, 111 S. Ct. 966, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Our examination of the record and the briefs and arguments of the parties on appeal persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues raised on appeal were resolved properly in the court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 340, 653 A.2d 229 (1993). Because that memorandum of decision fully states and meets the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>Advanced Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 378, 380-81, 650 A.2d 540 (1994); <em>Van Dyck Printing Co. </em>v. <em>DiNicola, </em>231 Conn. 272, 273-74, 648 A.2d 877 (1994) ; <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Refuse Gardens, Inc., </em>229 Conn. 455, 458-59, 642 A.2d 697 (1994); <em>Daw\u2019s Critical Care Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>225 Conn. 99,101-102, 622 A.2d 518 (1993).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-4\"> The revised policy provides for \u201cattendance-related discipline\u201d in addition to suspension and termination, where the original policy only provided for warnings, suspension and termination. The revised attendance policy provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u201c1. 6 absences\u2014Warning, counseling and notification to employee in writing . . . that for all subsequent absences a doctor\u2019s certificate will be required</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201c2. 8 absences\u20143 days foot-of-list for operators, 3 days shift change for maintenance</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u201c3. 10 absences\u20145 days foot-of-list for operators, 5 days shift change for maintenance</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u201c4.12 absences\u201410 days foot-of-list for operators, 10 days shift change for maintenance</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201c5. 14 absences\u20145 days suspension</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u201c6. 16 absences\u2014Termination. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u201cFoot-of-list\u201d refers to a disciplinary measure in which operators must report for duty and remain at work to back up the scheduled operator should an operator miss his shift. According to the policy, \u201cOperators assigned for attendance-related discipline to the foot-of-list will report without guarantee,\u201d that is, without pay unless they actually substitute for another operator. \u201cShift change\u201d for maintenance employees refers to a disciplinary measure in which they must work a shift that they did not select and do not wish to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">The preexisting attendance policy provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">\u201c1.

Public Acts 1991, No. 91-255, \u00a7 2. Thus, subdivision (4), which was alleged in the union\u2019s complaint in 1987, became subdivision (5) in 1991 with the addition of the new subdivision, which is irrelevant to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> The board had consolidated the complaints on September 21, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\"> The briefs of the parties were submitted to the board on March 27,1989, after evidentiary hearings had been conducted on September 22,1988, and December 7, 1988.

In case of any labor dispute involving a district and its employees <em>where collective bargaining does not result in agreement, </em>the parties shall submit such dispute to arbitration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-177 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the agency or other party is unable to state the matters in detail at the time the notice is served, the initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved. Thereafter upon application a more definite and detailed statement shall be furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Although <em>Levinson v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 536, is controlling, we note that the complaint form issued by the board states that the complaint is brought \u201c[pjursuant to Section 7-471 (4) [Rev. to 1987] of the Municipal Employees Relations Act.\u201d Section 7-471 (4) (currently \u00a7 7-471 [5]) provides that \u201c[i]f, upon all the testimony, the board determines that a prohibited practice has been or is being committed, it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the party committing the prohibited practice an order requiring it or him to cease and desist from such prohibited practice, <em>and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of sections 7-US7 to 7-U77, inclusive, including but not limited to </em>. . . <em>(ii) reinstatement of an employee discriminated against in violation of said sections with or without back pay </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This appears to have been sufficient to put the transit district on constructive notice of the power that the board possessed should the union have been successful on the merits of its claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> In response to the board\u2019s order, the transit district rescinded its unilaterally implemented attendance policy and eliminated the discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>imposed on employees pursuant to that policy. It did not, however, reinstate or reimburse any discharged employees. There is no indication that the transit district reported to the board the steps that it had taken to comply with the board\u2019s order. It presumably would have to do so now. In attempting to demonstrate compliance, the transit district should be allowed to present evidence in mitigation of its damages.
