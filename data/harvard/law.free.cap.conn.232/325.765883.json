J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOS\">In this tax appeal, the dispositive issue is whether, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-218 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a multistate corporation\u2019s pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ments for warehouse space should be taken into account in determining the fraction of corporate net income apportioned to Connecticut. The plaintiff, Foodways National, Inc. (Foodways), appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 12-237, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a decision of the defendant, Allan A. Crystal, the commissioner of revenue services (commissioner), in which the commissioner had assessed an additional corporate business tax against Foodways for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the tax years 1985 and 1986. The trial court rendered judgment for the commissioner. Foodways then filed an appeal with the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The parties stipulated to the relevant facts. Foodways is a multistate corporation that is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Idaho. It is engaged in the business of processing and distributing prepared frozen food products throughout the country. It entered into contracts for warehouse space with public refrigerated warehouses around the country in order to preserve its products while making them available for distribution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The warehouse storage contracts did not afford Food-ways control over any specific part of the warehouse premises but instead entitled it to a stated number of cubic feet of storage space. In return for Foodways\u2019 promise to maintain a certain average monthly level of inventory of its products in storage at the warehouse, the warehouse agreed to reserve the necessary floor space. Foodways paid a stated \u201crate\u201d per gross hundredweight of the products that it had stored in the warehouse. In addition, Foodways paid the warehouse separate fees for handling, including a commitment by the warehouse to load rail cars and trucks in accordance with schedules provided by Foodways.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">During the tax years 1985 and 1986, Foodways conducted sufficient business in Connecticut to be subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax. In filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>its tax returns, Foodways calculated the amount of its income to be allocated to Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 12-218 (b) by including, as \u201cgross rents,\u201d the amounts it had paid for warehouse fees but not the amounts it had paid for handling costs. The commissioner issued a corporate business tax assessment against Foodways, which, after Foodways\u2019 unsuccessful protest of the assessment, was found to be $124,199.26 plus interest of $106,793.08 for a total amount of $230,992.34. With regard to all Connecticut taxpayers, the commissioner has consistently taken the position that \u201c[wjarehouse storage fees are not considered a rent expense under the definition of [\u00a7 12-218].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The trial court upheld the validity of the commissioner\u2019s assessment. Despite the definition of \u201cgross rents\u201d in \u00a7 12-218 (b) as \u201cmoney . . . payable . . . by the taxpayer . . . for the use or possession of the property,\u201d the court ruled that fees paid for warehouse space do not qualify for inclusion within the property factor unless the taxpayer has rented property that is tangible. Characterizing the transactions between Foodways and the warehouses as bailments rather than as leases, the court concluded that the warehouse contracts did not involve the rental of tangible property. On that basis, the court held that Foodways\u2019 warehouse fees could not be included within the property factor of the apportionment statute. The court also rejected Foodways\u2019 alternate claim that the commissioner could not rely on his interpretation of the statute on a case-by-case basis but was required, instead, to implement his interpretation through the promulgation of a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Foodways has raised three issues on this appeal. It argues that the trial court: (1) used an incorrect standard of construction in its analysis of \u00a7 12-218; (2) misapplied \u00a7 12-218 in the circumstances of this case; and (3) improperly permitted the commissioner to rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>an interpretation of \u00a7 12-218 for which the commissioner had not promulgated a regulation. Because we agree with Foodways\u2019 first two claims, the judgment of the trial court must be reversed. We therefore need not consider Foodways\u2019 third claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The basic contours of the state\u2019s exercise 'of its taxing power with respect to multistate corporations are not at issue. The underlying tax is the Connecticut corporation business tax; General Statutes c. 208; which is \u201cin the nature of an excise tax levied against domestic and foreign corporations alike, for the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity within this State.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 243, 247, 423 A.2d 883 (1979). \u201cSection 12-214 (a), which imposes the corporation business tax, provides that the tax is \u2018to be measured by the entire net income . . . from business transacted within the state during the income year,\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while \u00a7 12-218 provides a measure to determine the taxable net income of multistate corporations to be apportioned to this state. <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>[224 Conn. 426, 432-33, 619 A.2d 443 (1993)]; <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>[202 Conn. 583, 589-91, 522 A.2d 771 (1987)]; <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>[202 Conn. 412, 415-16, 521 A.2d 569 (1987)].\u201d <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Bajorski, </em>228 Conn. 137, 142, 635 A.2d 771 (1993). Within the constraints that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>commerce clause and the due process clause of the United States constitution impose on state tax powers, \u00a7 12-218 serves to quantify the presence of a multistate corporation in this state and elsewhere. See id., 143; <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In construing \u00a7 12-218, we have consistently held that apportionment of a multistate corporation\u2019s taxable income between other states and Connecticut involves the imposition of a tax rather than the availability of an exemption. Accordingly, any ambiguity in the application of \u00a7 12-218 must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the commissioner. <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Bajorski, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 143; <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The trial court questioned the validity of this principle of construction in light of the possibility that different multistate corporate taxpayers might find it in their interest to advocate different constructions of \u00a7 12-218 depending on the nature of their business in Connecticut and elsewhere. On the present record, however, such a consideration is purely speculative. Foodways has sought a construction of \u201cgross rents\u201d which, according to the stipulation between the parties, the commissioner has consistently rejected. There is, therefore, no discernible reason to fear that resolution of this ambiguity in \u00a7 12-218 in accordance with our well established principles creates a risk of inconsistent interpretations of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The property factor is one of the three factors that, under \u00a7 12-218 (b), must be calculated for the purpose of allocating the income of a multistate corporation to this state. The property factor requires the taxpayer to compute the value of \u201ctangible property\u201d in Connecticut that is \u201cheld and owned by the taxpayer\u201d or \u201crented to the taxpayer,\u201d and then to compare that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>value to the value of <em>all </em>tangible property that is held and owned by, or rented to, the taxpayer. In conjunction with rentals to the taxpayer, \u00a7 12-218 (b) defines \u201cgross rents\u201d as \u201cthe actual sum of money or other consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer or for its benefit for the use or possession of the property, excluding royalties, but including interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other amount required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The trial court agreed with Foodways that the warehouse space that is the subject of the warehouse contracts in this case could, in some circumstances, qualify as \u201ctangible property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-218 (b). The court nonetheless concluded that the warehouse fees paid by Foodways were not rental payments under \u00a7 12-218 (b) because, in the absence of control over a specific part of the warehouse premises, Foodways was merely a bailor and, in that capacity, had not rented any \u201ctangible property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The specific issue raised by this appeal, therefore, is whether \u00a7 12-218 (b) includes, as rental payments, fees that a taxpayer has agreed to pay to a warehouse that commits itself to make available a specific <em>amount </em>of space rather than a specific <em>location </em>for the space. As a matter of statutory construction, this issue requires us to reconcile the prefatory language of \u00a7 12-218 (b) that the property factor measures \u201cthe value of tangible property rented to the taxpayer\u201d with the subsection\u2019s subsequent capacious definition of \u201cgross rents\u201d to include payments for \u201cthe use or possession of the property\u201d pursuant to \u201cthe terms of a lease or other arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">On its face, the statutory definition of \u201cgross rents\u201d includes Foodways\u2019 warehouse storage fees. Foodways is paying for the \u201cuse\u201d of space, and such \u201cuse,\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the statute, need not arise out of a possessory interest. Foodways\u2019 contracts are \u201carrangements,\u201d and such \u201carrangements,\u201d under the statute, need not take the form of leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The force of this facial analysis of \u00a7 12-218 (b) is not diminished by the fact that the contracts between Food-ways and its warehouses have some of the features of a bailment. Although Foodways\u2019 warehouse storage contracts resemble bailments because the contracts do not reserve specific space to Foodways, the contracts nonetheless have the essential characteristics of rental arrangements with respect to the fees that Foodways pays for storage, because these fees do not include handling costs associated with the storage of Foodways\u2019 products. For tax purposes, it is significant that, unlike ordinary contracts of bailment, Foodways\u2019 contracts \u201cunbundle\u201d storage fees from handling fees. There is no automatic carryover from the common law attributes of a bailment, which were largely designed to allocate risks of loss, to the implications of such a business relationship for the apportionment of a multistate corporation\u2019s income to this state. See <em>McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>132 Conn. 158, 162-63, 42 A.2d 841 (1945).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The storage contracts between Foodways and its warehouses fall literally within the definition of rental arrangements contained in \u00a7 12-218 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The commissioner argues, nonetheless, that the express language of the statutory definition of \u201cgross rents\u201d must be limited in accordance with the statutory requirement that the taxpayer\u2019s payments qualify as \u201ctangible property rented to the taxpayer.\u201d Undesignated space, the state maintains, cannot be \u201ctangible property.\u201d The commissioner, however, cites no text, legislative history or policy that supports his interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tation. Indeed, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s argument, the text of \u00a7 12-218 suggests that the legislature may have used the term \u201ctangible property\u201d not to distinguish between definite space and undesignated space, but to distinguish tangible property from \u201cintangible assets\u201d such as stocks, bonds, bank accounts and the like. Such a distinction arguably is reflected in the fact that, in describing the receipts factor, \u00a7 12-218 lists \u201cintangible assets\u201d and \u201ctangible property\u201d separately. Moreover, while there may be a policy reason for excluding intangible assets from the property factor\u2014 that such assets often cannot be said to be located in a particular state; see J. Warren, \u201cIncome Taxes: Principles of Formulary Apportionment,\u201d Tax Management Multistate Tax Portfolio Series \u00a7 1150.05.B (1994)\u2014 that policy reason does not apply to warehouse space, which, even if undesignated, is located in a particular state. The best that can be said for the commissioner\u2019s argument is that the juxtaposition of the various phrases used by the legislature in describing the property factor creates an ambiguity about the meaning of the \u201cuse\u201d of property by an \u201carrangement\u201d that is not a lease. Such an ambiguity must, however, be resolved in favor of the taxpayer, Foodways. See part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We note finally that a construction of \u00a7 12-218 (b) to include warehouse storage fees as rental payments is consistent with the view taken in other jurisdictions. The parties have cited no judicial decision that is directly on point and we have found none.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Regulations issued elsewhere, however, support the result that we have reached. We have recognized that \u00a7 12-218 to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>significant extent parallels the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA); <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>215 Conn. 134, 141-42 n.6, 574 A.2d 1293 (1990); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 417 n.5; and regulations published pursuant to UDITPA treat payments for the use of warehouse storage space as rental payments.
