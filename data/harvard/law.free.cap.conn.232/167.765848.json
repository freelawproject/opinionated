The plaintiff, Eklof Marine Corporation, a judgment creditor of National Oil Service, Inc. (National Oil), filed a two count complaint against the defendant American National Bank (bank), alleging that the bank had violated \u00a7 52-367a and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by refusing to pay funds properly garnished by the plaintiff. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. After denying the plaintiffs motion, the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the bank. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff recovered a valid judgment for $32,471.21 against National Oil in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. After this judgment had been registered with the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, a clerk of that court issued a \u201cbank execution order\u201d for the collection of the amount of the judgment from any Connecticut banking institution. National Oil maintained a deposit account with the bank. On June 18,1992, when the execution order was served on the bank, the National Oil account had a balance of $21,556.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On August 8, 1986, National Oil had borrowed $100,000 from the bank. This debt was in the form of a demand note. On June 18, 1992, the note was in default. Within an hour of receipt of the execution order, the bank exercised a right of setoff in accordance with express terms in its deposit account agreement with National Oil. The bank thereafter responded to the execution order by informing the sheriff that there were no funds in the National Oil account.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On the basis of this factual record, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that the bank had exercised its right of setoff within the time frame established by \u00a7 52-367a and, accordingly, that the bank\u2019s setoff took priority over the plaintiff\u2019s execution order. In this appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the bank, the plaintiff renews its claim that service of its execution notice on the bank established the plaintiff\u2019s legal right to the funds in the National Oil account and that thereafter the bank could no longer exercise any right of setoff. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot succeed in light of the reasoning of our decision, during the pendency of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, in <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994). In that case, we concluded that \u201c\u00a7 52-367a imposes a midnight deadline on a bank served with an execution. The midnight deadline arguably was intended by the legislature to apply directly even in transactions not governed by [General Statutes] \u00a7 42a-4-303. Alternatively, if \u00a7 52-367a has no express time limitation for transactions that are not governed by \u00a7 42a-4-303, the bank must act within a reasonable time, and that reasonable time period is, by analogy, defined as the midnight deadline that is the baseline generally . . . governing payouts by banks.\u201d Id., 503. The term \u201cmidnight deadline\u201d is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-104 (a) (10) as \u201cmidnight on [a bank\u2019s] next banking day following the banking day on which it receives the relevant . . . notice . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-4-301 and 42a-4-302<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> establish the midnight deadline as the standard time frame within which a payor bank must act on demands for payment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 502-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 507-508, we held that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>once a bank has been served with a valid execution order, the bank violates \u00a7 52-367a if it fails to execute its right of setoff within the applicable midnight deadline. A fortiori, we hold today that a bank does not violate \u00a7 52-367a if, as in this case, it executes its right of setoff before the expiration of its midnight, deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Because the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claim was predicated on the bank\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 52-367a, the plaintiff cannot succeed on either count of its complaint. The trial court, therefore, correctly granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-367a provides in relevant part: \u201cexecution AGAINST DEBTS DUE FROM BANKING INSTITUTION. DEBTOR OTHER THAN NATURAL person. As used in this section and section 52-367b, the term \u2018banking institution\u2019 means a state bank and trust company, national banking association, savings bank, industrial bank, credit union, federal credit union, savings and loan association and federal savings and loan association. Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any banking institution to a judgment debtor which is not a natural person. If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall so notify the clerk, and the clerk shall issue such execution containing a direction that the officer serving the same shall make demand (1) upon the main office of any banking institution having its main office within the county of such officer ... for the payment of any debt due to the judgment debtor, and, after having made such demand, shall serve a true and attested copy thereof, with his actions thereon endorsed, with the banking institution officer upon whom such demand is made. If any such banking institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made is indebted to the judgment debtor, it shall pay to such officer, in the manner and at the time hereinafter described, the amount of such indebtedness not exceeding the amount due on such execution, to be received and applied on such execution by such officer. Such banking institution shall act upon such execution according to section 42a-4-303 before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104. If such banking institution fails or refuses to pay over to such officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such banking institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution, and the amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-104 provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions and index of definitions, (a) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires . . .
