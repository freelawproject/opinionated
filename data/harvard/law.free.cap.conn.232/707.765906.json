App. 184, 634 A.2d 1193 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>228 Conn. 928, 640 A.2d 116 (1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to the Appellate Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The following facts were elicited at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 30, 1990, the victim was at the Pembroke Grill on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Pembroke Street in Bridgeport. She left the grill at approximately 11:45 p.m., walked down Pembroke Street and turned left onto East Main Street. While on East Main Street, she heard someone following her. She stopped at a phone booth and was approached by a man who tried to initiate a conversation with her. While the man spoke with a third person, however, the victim walked away and turned down Seymour Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">On Seymour Street, the victim saw the same man following her, so she turned down Kossuth Street. As she reached a highway underpass, however, the man accosted her, grabbing her and punching her in the mouth. He then pulled a knife from his coat, placed it at her neck and pushed her down on her knees, telling her not to move or say anything. He also told her that if she did not keep her head down, he would kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The man told the victim to unbutton and unzip her pants. He then removed her pants and underwear, moved behind her and held her around the neck. From that position, he penetrated her, ejaculating in her anus. He withdrew his penis and wiped it on the victim\u2019s leather jacket, leaving ejaculate \u201call over\u201d the jacket. He then pulled off her necklaces and bracelet and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">After the assault, the victim went immediately to Bridgeport police headquarters, where she signed a statement narrating what had happened. The police then took her to Park City Hospital. At the hospital she repeated to the treating physician what she had told the police, i.e., that her assailant had sodomized her and that he subsequently had wiped his penis on her jacket. She told a nurse, however, that her assailant had sodomized her and also had raped her vaginally. The physician conducted several tests, including taking a swab and smear of the victim\u2019s anus and anal area, as well as her vagina. The police seized the victim\u2019s jacket as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Laboratory tests revealed the presence of partial spermatozoa on the anal swab and the presence of intact spermatozoa on the anal smear. Tests also revealed the presence of sperm on the vaginal swab. In accordance with established procedures, laboratory personnel did not attempt to conduct blood grouping tests on the anal swab or anal smear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Blood grouping tests conducted on the vaginal swab, however, revealed an antigenic substance that could only have been deposited by a person with type A blood. The victim, who was type 0, could not have been the source of that antigenic substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Sometime early in 1991, the victim, who did not have another winter jacket, sought to have the police return the jacket they had seized. The police, after repeated requests from the victim, finally returned her jacket on February 13, 1991, some six weeks after she had been attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Three and one-half weeks after the police had returned the jacket, on March 11, 1991, the victim was a passenger on a bus in Bridgeport and saw the defendant standing on the corner of Stratford Avenue and East Main Street. She stayed on the bus for a few stops, then disembarked and called the police. The police transported the victim back to the corner of Stratford and East Main, where she identified the defendant as her assailant and the police arrested him. Tests subsequently conducted on the defendant revealed that his blood was type 0, and that he could not have deposited the foreign antigenic substance found in the victim\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Prior to trial, the court granted the defendant\u2019s timely motion for general discovery and inspection, which required the police to produce exculpatory infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>mation, materials and tangible objects. The defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that both he and prior defense counsel knew then of the existence of potential semen stains, but failed to ask specifically that the police produce the jacket.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">At trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him because the police had failed to preserve the victim\u2019s jacket as evidence. The defendant did not argue that the police, in returning the jacket to the victim, had acted in bad faith or that they had any motive for doing so other than accommodating the victim. Rather, the defendant argued that the fact that the jacket was unavailable had irreparably harmed his ability to defend himself in two ways. First, he argued that the defense could have conducted tests on the jacket to determine if semen was present. If tests showed no semen on the jacket, the defense could have used that result to attack the credibility of the victim. Second, if the tests showed that semen was, in fact, present on the jacket, the defense could have evaluated any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>DNA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contained in the semen to prove that the defendant had not been the assailant. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 280-86, 604 A.2d 793 (1992). The trial court, however, denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the trial court, he argued to the Appellate Court that the failure of the Bridgeport police to preserve the victim\u2019s jacket had violated his right to due process of law under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The Appellate Court, however, determined that the standard adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1988), reh. denied, 488 U.S. 1051, 109 S. Ct. 885, 102 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (1989), under the federal due process clause also was the proper standard under the state constitution\u2019s due process clause. In <em>Youngblood, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a criminal defendant must prove that the police acted in bad faith in failing to preserve potentially useful evidence. Id., 58. The Appellate Court, noting that the defendant in this case had failed to show bad faith on the part of the police, concluded that his right to due process of law provided by article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution, similarly had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We now consider (1) what degree of protection the due process clause of our state constitution offers to criminal defendants when the police fail to preserve potentially useful evidence, and (2) what remedy should follow if the defendant has established that a failure to preserve such evidence has violated his state constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by setting forth the relevant legal background of \u201cwhat might loosely be called the area of constitutionally guaranteed access to evidence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S. Ct. 3440, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (1982). Under the federal constitution, the state\u2019s failure to provide evidence within its control to a criminal defendant may violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law in two types of situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The first situation concerns the <em>withholding of exculpatory evidence </em>by the police from the accused. The United States Supreme Court has held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the [government].\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 126, 571 A.2d 686 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 495, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 539-40, 539 A.2d 80 (1988). This type of violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights is commonly referred to as a <em>\u201cBrady </em>violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The second situation, and the one at issue in this case, concerns <em>the failure of the police to preserve evidence that might be useful </em>to the accused. The United States Supreme Court discussed this situation in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 51, a case in which the facts are remarkably similar to those in this case. In <em>Youngblood, </em>the child victim had been sodomized and the state had failed properly to preserve the child\u2019s clothing, which was stained with semen, and a swab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>taken of the victim\u2019s rectum after the assault. The defendant claimed that, had the state properly preserved this evidence, test results might have completely exonerated him. The United States Supreme Court, however, held under the federal constitution that a criminal defendant carries a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a conviction based on the failure of the police to preserve evidence: \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Brady, </em>makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence. But we think the Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant. . . . [UJnless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d Id., 57-58; see also <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S. Ct. 2528, 81 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The defendant in this case, accordingly, does not claim that the state\u2019s failure to preserve the jacket of the victim constituted a violation of his rights under the federal constitution. Rather, raising an issue of first impression for this court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he claims that, under the Connecticut constitution, a criminal defendant need not show that the police acted in bad faith in failing to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>serve potentially useful evidence. Because the defendant has raised this issue in a principled manner, furnishing us with a detailed analysis under a format that we have urged in raising state constitutional issues; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">It is beyond debate that \u201cfederal constitutional and statutory law establishes a <em>minimum </em>national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 546, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). <em>In State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 579 A.2d 58 (1990), in which this court rejected the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule that the United States Supreme Court had adopted in <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), we stated: \u201cWe have frequently relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the fourth amendment, as well as other amendments to the United States constitution, to define the contours of the protections provided in the various sections of the declaration of rights contained in our state constitution. We have also, however, determined in some instances that the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>tections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 112, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 166, 537 A.2d 446 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235-36, 496 A.2d 498 (1985). In so doing, we have recognized that [i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties\u2014which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014we sit as a court of last resort, subject only to the qualification that our interpretations may not restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter. In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut residents have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641-42, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Indeed, we have long abandoned the notion that our state due process clause; article first, \u00a7 8;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> has the same meaning and imposes the same limitations as its federal counterpart.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, we have held that \u201c[t]he due process clause of the Connecticut constitution shares but is not limited by the content of its federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>counterpart. <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 374, 362 A.2d 778 [vacated, 423 U.S. 809, 96 S. Ct. 20, 46 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975), on remand, 170 Conn. 155, 365 A.2d 393, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 889, 97 S. Ct. 246, 50 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1976)].\u201d <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>173 Conn. 473, 475, 378 A.2d 553 (1977); see also E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 588 (1986) (\u201c[s]tate courts . . . must be empowered to determine, in light of state interests and state history, what meaning to attribute to provisions contained in state constitutions\u201d). The question then becomes, what degree of protection, independent of the federal constitutional right, does our state constitutional right to due process provide in a case such as this?</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">A criminal defendant\u2019s right to present evidence and bring facts to light in order to prove his innocence has been historically recognized in Connecticut.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift, a prominent scholar as well as a jurist, wrote the first American treatise on the law in 1796. See 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796). He pointed out that many years earlier in England, and in the early days of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Connecticut colony, an accused was denied the opportunity even to question evidence presented as \u201cfacts\u201d by the prosecution. According to Swift, \u201cby the common law of England, no witnesses could be adduced on the part of the prisoner, to manifest his innocence, for he could then make no preparation for his defence.\u201d Id., p. 399. The courts, he wrote, guided by \u201ccruel and illiberal principle[s] of the common law of England,\u201d would prevent counsel for an accused from investigating facts or examining witnesses. Id., p. 398. Instead, the court would allow the attorney only to plead points of law. Id. By the time Swift wrote in 1796, however, the Connecticut legislature and courts had long abandoned \u201cthe impropriety and injustice of shackling and restricting a prisoner with respect to his defence.\u201d Id., p. 399. Recognizing that it \u201cis manifest that there is as much necessity for counsel to investigate matters of fact, as points of law, if truth is to be discovered,\u201d Swift explained that prisoners were allowed not only to present evidence in their own defense, but also to call into question those \u201cfacts\u201d presented by the prosecution. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Prior to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Youngblood, </em>we consistently had applied a balancing test in determining whether the failure of the police to preserve potentially useful evidence had deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law under either the federal or state constitution. Relying on decisions of federal courts interpreting the federal constitution\u2019s due process clause,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we had required a trial court, in determining whether the defendant had been deprived of his rights under either the federal or state constitutions, to weigh several factors. These factors included \u201cthe materiality of the missing evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by witnesses or the jury, the reason for its nonavailability to the defense and the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 724, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985) (federal due process clause); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 327, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978) (federal and state due process clauses);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>McIver, </em>201 Conn. 559, 565, 518 A.2d 1368 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 365; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 516, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 229, 506 A.2d 125 (1986). We refer to this test as the <em>Asherman </em>test. Although the United States Supreme Court in <em>Youngblood </em>held that due process under the federal constitution does not require a trial court to apply such a balancing test, we are persuaded that due process under our state constitution does.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Indeed, we frequently have rejected a litmus test that consists of only one factor, and instead have required courts to employ a balancing test, when ruling on issues that concern due process or fundamental fairness. In <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 521, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984), for example, we held that a court must employ a balancing test in determining whether the state\u2019s failure to provide a criminal defendant with timely access to appellate review had violated his state constitutional right to due process. \u201cThat test requires a consideration of four factors: [ljength of delay, the reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Similarly, we have employed a balancing test in determining the scope of due process to be afforded an individual before the government may deprive him or her of liberty or property interests. Borrowing from the federal constitutional standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), we have held that due process under the Connecticut constitution requires us to \u201cconsider three factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 662, 591 A.2d 101 (1991) (article first, \u00a7 10); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 178, 579 A.2d 484 (1990) (article first, \u00a7 9); <em>Kinsella </em>v. <em>Jaekle, </em>192 Conn. 704, 730, 475 A.2d 243 (1984) (article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 10); see <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 656 n.12, 661 n.17.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In deciding <em>Youngblood, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court discounted the value of a balancing test in cases of unpreserved evidence, indicating instead that a litmus test of bad faith more accurately reflects the concerns of due process. The court advanced two principal arguments for its position: (1) in cases of unpreserved evidence, \u201ccourts face the treacherous task of divining the import of materials whose contents are unknown and, very often, disputed\u201d; <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 57-58; and (2) a test that did not require the defendant to show bad faith might impose \u201con the police an undifferentiated and absolute duty to retain and to preserve all material that might be of conceivable evidentiary significance.\u201d Id., 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, however, accommodates and addresses both of these concerns. It is true that if evidence has not been preserved, a court may not be able to ascertain with scientific precision what that evidence would have revealed at trial. Such certainty, however, is rarely required. Instead, an explanation or description of the type of evidence that is missing and what that evidence <em>may </em>have shown will allow the court to determine its relative importance to the defendant. The <em>Asherman </em>factors, which include balancing the materiality of the missing evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by witnesses or the jury, the reason for its nonavailability to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>defense and the prejudice to the defendant caused by its unavailability, allow the court to perform this task while preserving the defendant\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Moreover, the <em>Asherman </em>test does not require the police to preserve every shred of physical evidence, every object it seizes from a crime scene, no matter how remote or tangential to the case the item seems to be. The trial court should include on its <em>Asherman </em>scale the reason for the unavailability of an item of evidence, as well as the motivation and good or bad faith of the police in failing to preserve that evidence. For example, if the police have discarded or failed to preserve an item of evidence which at the time appeared to be completely irrelevant to the case but which later proved to be important to the defendant, the good faith of the police at the time of the evidence\u2019s destruction is one of the factors the trial court may consider in determining whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Fairness dictates that when a person\u2019s liberty is at stake,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the sole fact of whether the police or another state official acted in good or bad faith in failing to preserve evidence cannot be determinative of whether the criminal defendant has received due process of law. Rather, our constitution imposes certain obligations on the state to ensure that the criminal trial is \u201ca search for truth, not an adversary game.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>471 F.2d 1057, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>87 Wash. 2d 783, 786, 557 P.2d 1 (1976). As Justice Stevens pointed out in his concurring opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>in <em>Youngblood, </em>\u201cthere may well be cases in which the defendant is unable to prove that the State acted in bad faith but in which the loss or destruction of evidence is nonetheless so critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 61; see note, \u201cThe Role of Police Culpability in <em>Leon </em>and <em>Youngblood,\u201d </em>76 Va. L. Rev. 1213, 1223 n.59 (1990) (\u201cOf course, there is the additional difficulty of proving that the police knew the evidence to be exculpatory. New officers will be willing to admit they destroyed evidence they knew to be exculpatory.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87, a court that truly seeks justice ought not to be concerned about the punishment of society for the misdeed of its agents and employees, but rather the \u201cavoidance of an unfair trial to the accused. Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Sister states have rejected <em>Youngblood\u2019s </em>\u201cbad faith\u201d test as the sole criteria for determining whether the state has violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights by failing to preserve evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In Massachusetts, for example, the Supreme Judicial Court has declared that \u201c[t]he rule under the due process provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution is stricter than that stated in the <em>Youngblood </em>opinion\u201d; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 Mass. 309,311, 582 N.E.2d 496 (1991); and requires a trial court to \u201cconsider and balance the degree of culpability of the government, the materiality of the evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendant in order to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process right to a fair trial.\u201d Id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In Vermont, the Supreme Court has held that the <em>Youngblood </em>rule is \u201ctoo narrow because it limits due process violations to only those cases in which a defendant can demonstrate bad faith, even though the negligent loss of evidence may critically prejudice a defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delisle, </em>162 Vt. 293, 310, 648 A.2d 632 (1994). Instead, the court has adopted, under the Vermont constitution, a balancing test that requires the trial court to conduct a \u201cpragmatic balancing of three factors: (1) the degree of negligence or bad faith on the part of the government; (2) the importance of the evidence lost; and (3) other evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In Delaware, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[w]e remain convinced that fundamental fairness, as an element of due process, requires the State\u2019s failure to preserve evidence that could be favorable to the defendant [to] be evaluated in the context of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>record. . . . When evidence has not been preserved, the conduct of the State\u2019s agents is a relevant consideration, but it is not determinative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>State, </em>569 A.2d 81, 87 (Del. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In Alabama, the Supreme Court refused to apply the <em>Youngblood </em>bad faith test to a case in which the state, during scientific testing of hazardous waste materials, had destroyed all the samples. <em>Ex Parte Gingo, </em>605 So. 2d 1237 (Ala. 1992). The court concluded that, although the state did not act in bad faith, \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair to allow the State to use the results of the . . . tests on the destroyed samples.\u201d Id., 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Other states recently departing from the <em>Youngblood </em>approach include Hawaii; <em>State </em>v. <em>Matafeo, </em>71 Haw. 183, 187, 787 P.2d 671 (1990) (trial court must inquire not only into bad faith of police, but also \u201cinto the favorableness of the evidence or the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of its loss\u201d); and Alaska; <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>774 P.2d 1326, 1330 n.9 (Alaska 1989) (\u201c[w]e have construed the Alaska Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause to not require a showing of bad faith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Like our sister states, we conclude that the good or bad faith of the police in failing to preserve potentially useful evidence cannot be dispositive of whether a criminal defendant has been deprived of due process of law. Accordingly, we, too, reject the litmus test of bad faith on the part of the police, which the United States Supreme Court adopted under the federal constitution in Youngblood.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Rather, in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>whether a defendant has been afforded due process of law under the state constitution, the trial court must employ the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, weighing the reasons for the unavailability of the evidence against the degree of prejudice to the accused. More specifically, the trial court must balance the totality of the circumstances surrounding the missing evidence, including the following factors: \u201cthe materiality of the missing evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by witnesses or the jury, the reason for its nonavailability to the defense and the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 724.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In a case such as this, where the crucial issue for which the evidence would have been offered was the identity of the assailant, the court must weigh the factors in that light. If, for example, the evidence could have been tested to demonstrate immutable characteristics of the assailant,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> then the prejudice factor would weigh heavily in favor of the defendant. On the other hand, if the evidence would have been merely cumulative or would have failed to rebut evidence that was already available, the defendant may have suffered little prejudice, and his right to due process of law under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution may not have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Our inquiry, however, does not end here. We still must determine whether, in a case in which the failure of the police to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights, the trial court\u2019s only remedy is to dismiss the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">It is true that a defendant may raise the issue of the failure of the police to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence by filing a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendant in this case challenged the actions of the Bridgeport police by filing just such a motion. Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>less, if the trial court concludes that a defendant\u2019s due process rights have been violated, the court is not required to dismiss the charges, even if the state\u2019s failure to preserve evidence has adversely affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 269-71, 576 A.2d 139 (1990); see <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 518. The trial court is not faced with the Hobson\u2019s choice of either dismissing all criminal charges or denying any relief whatsoever to a criminal defendant who possibly has been prejudiced as a result of the negligence of the state. See <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>340 U.S. 206, 209-10, 71 S. Ct. 262, 95 L. Ed. 215 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Rather, the trial court may fashion another remedy that appropriately ameliorates or offsets the prejudice that the defendant has suffered as a result of the unavailability of the evidence. See <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 517-18 (\u201c[pjroof of unconstitutional impairment of the right to appeal empowers a court to fashion an order conditionally discharging the petitioner or otherwise fashioning the appropriate relief, short of immediate release, to which the petitioner may be entitled\u201d). In some extreme cases, the trial court may have no choice but to dismiss the charges against the defendant. In another case, however, the appropriate remedy may differ, depending on the circumstances and the degree and type of prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Put simply, a trial court must decide each case depending on its own facts, assess the materiality of the unpreserved evidence and the degree of prejudice to the accused, and formulate a remedy that vindicates his or her rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaster, </em>99 Wash. 2d 44, 52, 659 P.2d 528 (1983). The ultimate question for the trial court in such a case is: What remedy best serves the interests of justice? See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fain, </em>116 Idaho 82, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>96-97, 774 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 917, 110 S. Ct. 277, 107 L.

In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant argued that, although the trial court had applied a balancing test, it had not applied that test correctly. Because the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court should have applied the <em>Youngblood </em>test, and not a balancing test, the Appellate Court never reached the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument. We therefore must remand this case to the Appellate Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to reconsider the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the state\u2019s loss of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">In this opinion Peters, C.

If the answer to question (1) is yes, did the Appellate Court properly conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that: (a) a motion to dismiss was a proper remedy for the alleged failure of the state to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence; and (b) a different standard would apply to a motion to suppress evidence based on the same conduct of the state?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">With respect to issue 2 (b), see footnote 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-12\"> We limit our narrative to those facts that are necessary to decide and place in context the legal issues before us.

This argument, however, does not take into account the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">First, the state ignores the fact that the police returned the jacket to the victim nearly one month before the defendant was arrested on March 11, 1991, and, therefore, well before his attorneys knew about the existence of the jacket. Thus, even if the attorneys had specifically requested that the police turn over the jacket to the defendant or otherwise preserve it, the fact remains that the police no longer had the jacket in their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Second, in addition to filing a general discovery motion, the defendant\u2019s attorneys did ask to inspect the victim\u2019s jacket.

As noted previously, for example, trial courts in Vermont must take into account not only the importance of the missing evidence and the fault of the government, but also \u201cother evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delisle, </em>supra, 162 Vt. 310..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> Neither party has raised the issue of whether it would have been scientifically possible for the defendant to conduct tests for semen or DNA matter even if the police had properly preserved the jacket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\"> We reject the suggestion of the Appellate Court that the nature of the motion filed by the defendant determines both the substantive test the court must apply and the remedy it may order. The Appellate Court held that the bad faith test of <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 58, applies only \u201cto allegations of due process violations arising out of a motion to dismiss the prosecution for failure by the state to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence. The four-prong test still applies to claims of due process violations arising out of a motion to suppress the admission of testimony about destroyed evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 516].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 193 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">We recognize that previous decisions of this court have not been entirely clear on this point, and that the Appellate Court, in reaching its decision, was attempting to discern the correct rule of law from conflicting authority. Nevertheless, we now hold that such a distinction is untenable, and that a defendant may challenge the police\u2019s failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence by filing <em>either </em>a motion to dismiss or a motion to suppress. Moreover, as we point out in the text of this opinion, the nature of the motion the defendant chooses to file does not dictate the remedy the trial court may craft in order to ameliorate the prejudice to the accused. In other words, a trial court confronted with a motion to dismiss is not limited to dismissing all charges against the defendant, and a trial court confronted with a motion to suppress is not limited to suppressing testimony about the unpreserved evidence. Rather, in either case, the trial court has discretion to craft an appropriate remedy that ameliorates the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the loss of the evidence. Of course, if the trial court contemplates a remedy different than that proposed by either of the parties, the court should provide the state and the defendant with prior notice of its proposed remedy and an opportunity to comment on the appropriateness of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\"> Indeed, one of the factors that prompted Justice Stevens to concur, rather than dissent, in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 59, was the trial court\u2019s instruction to jurors in that case that they might draw an adverse inference against the state for failing to preserve the evidence. Certain situations, in fact, might <em>require </em>the trier of fact to \u201cpresum[e] that the [evidence] would have been favorable to [the accused].\u201d <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 774 P.2d 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b750-10\">Borden, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANP\">concurring. I agree with the conclusion of the majority opinion, and with much of its reasoning. More specifically, I agree that the bad faith of the police, in failing to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, is not the sole determinant as to whether the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law under article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution has been violated by that failure. Thus, for the reasons aptly stated by the majority, I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the federal constitutional bad faith test, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1988), reh. denied, 488 U.S. 1051, 109 S. Ct. 885, 102 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (1989), and with the adoption of the balancing test under the state constitution, as articulated by the majority. I write separately, however, to elaborate further some aspects of the majority opinion. Also, with respect to part II of the majority opinion, I think that the discussion of the possible remedies once a due process violation is found to have occurred in a specific case requires more than the majority provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">I believe that the majority\u2019s statement of the relevant facts is unduly truncated. Because the balancing test we adopt requires an assessment of the strength or weakness of the state\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s cases, the majority opinion should disclose all of the evidence on the basis of which that assessment should be made. In addition to those facts stated by the majority, I therefore add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The only evidence linking the defendant to the crimes charged was the testimony of the victim identifying him as her assailant. According to that testimony, she had several opportunities to view the defendant. The first was at the phone booth, where he first approached and conversed with her. The second was as she was walking on the street and he was following her; she looked at him face to face as he was \u201cacross the street\u201d from her while she walked in the middle of the road. The third was when, according to her testimony, he punched her in the mouth before sexually assaulting her. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>fourth was shortly after the attack, while she was in a car being driven by her girlfriend\u2019s husband, who had been passing by and picked her up and drove her to the police station. The fifth was some time after the assault, when, according to her testimony, she was riding on a bus and saw the defendant on the sidewalk; the victim was with her boyfriend, but told him not to accost the defendant, to \u201cjust leave it alone.\u201d The sixth was at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, when she saw the defendant on the corner of Stratford Avenue and East Main Street, as described by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The victim positively identified the defendant in the courtroom as her assailant. Furthermore, in her written statement to the police on the day after the assault, she described the defendant as follows: \u201cHe was P/R [Puerto Rican] male about 30 or 31 years old about 5 [feet] 7 [inches] tall [medium] build, he had brown eyes and brown hair. His hair was curly and short to his head. He was top heavy and had skinny legs. <em>He had a mustache that came below his top lip. </em>He had short stubby hands and his nails were all black like he was a mechanic, his finger nails were all covered with grease. He had a wedding band on his left hand that was diamond cut and it had three stars in it. <em>His front teeth were straight but he had like a fang in the middle of the front teeth.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Her testimony was consistent with this description. She described the defendant\u2019s tooth as \u201clike a fang. It was like it came in the middle of his mouth, straight down in the middle of his two front teeth.\u201d A photograph of the defendant, taken on March 8, 1991, is consistent with this description, particularly indicating a mustache that falls below the outer edges of the defendant\u2019s lips, and a distinctively pointed tooth in the center between his two top teeth. The victim identified this photograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>as indicating what she meant by her description of the defendant\u2019s front tooth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">On the other side of the ledger, the victim\u2019s credibility was not unassailable. She had been convicted of failure to appear in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, larceny in the first degree and larceny in an unspecified degree. Furthermore, before encountering the defendant, she had been drinking in a bar for approximately three and one-half hours, and had consumed five or more drinks consisting of \u201cforty-three liquor and milk.\u201d Although she denied being drunk, she admitted that she was \u201cfeeling good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">There were, moreover, some inconsistencies in her testimony. Although she testified that she had never seen the defendant before, she told the police in her statement that, when he had approached her at the phone booth he had told her his name, that he knew her father, and that he knew that her father had been shot, which was in fact true. Also, although she testified that the defendant had punched her in the mouth, causing \u201cbad\u201d bleeding, the hospital report did not confirm that injury. Furthermore, although she testified that the defendant had penetrated her anally, and not vaginally, and had described the assault that way to both the police and the examining physician, the nurse\u2019s notes also indicated her having reported a vaginal penetration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Ultimately, the trial court, having heard all of the evidence, believed the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant. In finding that the state had proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt . . . that the defendant was responsible for the attack,\u201d the court stated: \u201cHer description was a very accurate and detailed one. There was plenty of opportunity, both outside the restaurant, at the phone booth and subsequently, for her to have seen this individual. The court heard her testimony, watched her as she identified the defendant very, very quickly and very adamantly as the person that was responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In footnote 7 of the majority opinion, the court correctly rejects the state\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s failure to seek inspection of the victim\u2019s jacket reflected a total pretrial indifference by the defendant to the possible inspection and testing of any stains on the jacket. As it stands, however, the footnote ignores a valid consideration on the other side of the equation that ought to be mentioned, a factor that the trial court in fact did take into consideration in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The police returned the jacket to the victim on February 13, 1991, approximately one month before the defendant was arrested on March 11, 1991. A public defender was appointed to represent the defendant at his arraignment on that day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant, however, did not take any procedural step specifically regarding the jacket until he moved to dismiss the state\u2019s case at the end of the state\u2019s presentation of evidence at trial on April 27, 1992, more than one year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Thus, although the state is properly faulted for returning the jacket to the victim, the defendant is not entirely without fault. It is at least possible that, had the defendant asked for the return of the jacket for testing as early as March, 1991, when the defendant was arrested and counsel was appointed to represent him, or, at the latest, in February, 1992, when his special public defender was appointed, the jacket could then have been retrieved from the victim. If the jacket had not been cleaned or otherwise irreparably contaminated, at that time it could have been tested for the presence of semen and for any forensic evidence that any semen would have yielded. My point is that, although certainly the greater fault is attributable to the state for the unavailability of the jacket, some fault may be attributable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In analyzing the issue before the court under the state constitution, the majority opinion cites and quotes from Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift, presumably as support for the \u201chistorical approach\u201d that we have identified as a tool of analysis for interpreting our state constitution. See footnote 13 of the majority opinion; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). I agree that the historical approach is one of the applicable tools of analysis for such questions of interpretation, when that history sheds light on the constitutional question involved. I also agree that Chief Justice Swift\u2019s writing can at times be a useful source for that inquiry. I decline to join the part of the majority opinion referring to Swift in this case, however, because the particular passage from Swift has nothing to do with the question of state constitutional law that this case poses.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">In the passage that the majority quotes, Swift pointed out that Connecticut had wisely expanded counsel\u2019s role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>from arguing points of law to include the investigation and presentation of facts. That is an important historical point with respect to the history of the right to counsel in this state, but I fail to see how that expansion of counsel\u2019s role sheds any historical light on the question before us in this case, namely, the contours of the state\u2019s obligation to preserve important evidence. It is true that both the expanded right to counsel and the preservation of evidence\u2014by anyone, the state, the defendant, or a third party\u2014aid in the search for truth. The same is true, however, for the rules of evidence, the right to cross-examine, the right to argue to the jury, and most other trial procedures. The fact that both the right to counsel and the obligation to preserve evidence serve the same general end does not mean that we can draw any useful historical lesson in this case from the writings of Chief Justice Swift.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">I decline to join the majority\u2019s overly broad statement that \u201cas <em>the United States Supreme Court observed in Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, [373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)], a court that truly seeks justice ought not to be concerned about the punishment of society for the misdeed of its agents and employees, </em>but rather the \u2018avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused. Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) I fully agree with the propositions that courts must ensure that an accused is given a fair trial, that society wins when criminal trials are fair, regardless of their outcomes, and that justice suffers when an accused is treated unfairly. I am not quite sure, however, what it means to say that \u201ca court that truly seeks justice ought not to be concerned about the punishment of society\u201d for its agents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>misdeeds. It seems to me to be a rhetorical flourish that is open to many interpretations, from the benign to the mischievous.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Furthermore, whatever it means, it is not what the United States Supreme Court \u201cobserved\u201d in <em>Brady. </em>The court was discussing its holding that suppression of material exculpatory evidence that the defendant had sought to discover violated his due process rights. The court had drawn this holding from its earlier decision in <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791 (1935), and the progeny of that decision. In <em>Mooney, </em>the court reversed a conviction that had been based on knowingly perjured testimony, and in <em>Brady </em>the court was analogizing those cases to its holding regarding the suppression of exculpatory evidence, regardless of the good faith of the prosecution. The court then stated: \u201cThe principle of <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan </em>[supra] is not punishment of society for misdeeds of a prosecutor but avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused. Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87.1 agree fully with this principle, but I disagree that it means what it is characterized to say in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Finally, those statements in <em>Brady </em>were made in a different factual and legal context from this case. The <em>Brady </em>situation involves the suppression of exculpatory evidence. In that situation, we know that: (1) the evidence was suppressed\u2014the state had it, and did not make it available to the defendant despite his request therefor; and (2) the evidence was in fact exculpatory, and the state knew it. In this case, by contrast: (1) the evidence was not suppressed, but was negligently given back to the victim by the state, and thus was just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>unavailable to the state as it was to the defendant; (2) the nature of the state\u2019s conduct, in the sense of whether it was done in good or bad faith, in losing the evidence <em>is </em>a factor to be weighed; and (3) we do not know, and can never know, whether the evidence was exculpatory or inculpatory\u2014whether tests of the semen stains on the jacket would have exculpated or inculpated the defendant. Thus, we have no way of knowing whether the return of the jacket to the victim hurt the defendant or the state. I therefore think that the majority\u2019s rhetorical flourish, which mischaracterizes the <em>Brady </em>court\u2019s \u201cobservation,\u201d is inappropriate, and I decline to join it.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">My final remarks concern part II of the majority opinion, which is devoted to the remedies available to the trial court upon a conclusion that the state\u2019s failure to preserve evidence amounted to a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. I think that some of the majority\u2019s discussion warrants further elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">I agree with the majority opinion that a trial court, having determined on a motion to dismiss or a motion to suppress that the state\u2019s failure to preserve evidence violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights, is not limited to the specific remedy sought by the defendant. I think, however, that the proposition is too broadly stated by the majority, because it implies that, even absent some suggestion by the defendant, the trial court has a sua sponte <em>obligation </em>to consider a remedy other than that sought by the defendant. I agree that, if a trial court does think of a different remedy than that sought by the defendant, it certainly has the power to impose it. I am loathe to imply, however, that a trial court, faced with a specific remedy sought in a specific motion, cannot also simply take the motion as presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>and either grant or deny it. This point is particularly significant in this case because, when the defendant moved to dismiss after the state\u2019s presentation of all of its evidence he asked only for dismissal, and did not ask for any other, less extreme sanction. He had not moved to suppress any evidence based on the loss of the jacket, and he did not request the court to employ the less drastic remedy of an adverse inference against the state in the court\u2019s final determination of guilt or innocence. Thus, the trial court was never presented with a request to do anything but dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">I also agree with the majority opinion that the appropriate remedy is a matter for the trial court in the first instance, and that the ultimate test is: \u201cWhat remedy best serves the interests of justice?\u201d Since we are, appropriately in my view, giving guidance to the trial courts regarding this issue, however, I would also suggest that the available remedies fall on a spectrum. At the least drastic end of the spectrum would be a remedy or combination of remedies such as affording the defendant unusually broad latitude on cross-examination, or employing an adverse inference against the state, or both. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 515-16, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992). Another, more severe, remedy would be the suppression of some or all of the other evidence that the defendant was arguably hampered in challenging as a result of the loss of the evidence. The most drastic remedy would be dismissal of the prosecution. There could, of course, be other remedies, or combinations thereof, at different points along the spectrum.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">With respect to the remedy of dismissal, I would make it clear that, because it is the most drastic remedy available, it ought to be reserved for those cases in which no lesser remedy can plausibly vindicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We have referred to dismissal of the prosecution as a drastic remedy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 662, 574 A.2d 164 (1990). Although I agree that there may be cases in which dismissal of the prosecution would be the only appropriate remedy for the violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights, I would reserve that most drastic remedy for the most drastic and prejudicial violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">This principle is particularly important in a case such as this because we are dealing with the unknowable. We can never know whether the loss of the evidence, the jacket in this case, in fact harmed the defendant or helped him. This is so because, as plausible as it is that forensic tests on the jacket could have exonerated him, it is equally plausible that they could have inculpated him. Thus, the trial court, in dismissing the case, would be dismissing a case in which the fact finder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence that <em>was </em>available. Indeed, in the case at hand, the trial court found precisely that.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> In final argument to the trial court, which was the fact finder in this case, the defendant\u2019s counsel, although arguing that the state had failed specifically to prove that this was an unusual dental configuration among the general population, conceded the inculpatory value of the victim\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s tooth: \u201cand, in fact, you have the tooth for my defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\"> There was also testimony, however, that could explain the presence of semen in the victim\u2019s vagina that, by the scientific tests, could not have been deposited by the defendant. That evidence was that such tests could be the result of the presence of seminal fluid in the vagina for as long as seventy-two hours after intercourse. The victim was not asked whether she had engaged in sexual intercourse within the previous seventy-two hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> A special public defender was appointed for the defendant on February 26, 1992, and he conducted the defendant\u2019s defense at trial. Nonetheless, the defendant was represented by the public defender until that appointment took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
