J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnG\">This appeal concerns the effect of the affordable housing land use appeals act; General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>utes \u00a7 8-SOg;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on an application for a zone change. The defendant, the zoning commission of the city of Dan-bury (commission), denied the application of the plaintiff, Robert J. Kaufman, to amend the zoning map of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the city of Danbury to change the classification of the plaintiffs property from RA-40 (1 single-family dwelling per acre) to RA-8 (5 single-family dwellings per acre). The plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>decision to the Superior Court, which rendered judgment reversing that decision and remanded the case to the commission with direction that the application be approved. After the commission successfully petitioned the Appellate Court for certification to appeal from the judgment of the trial court; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8, 8-9 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8-30g; we transferred the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. In his modified application for a zone change, the plaintiff, a developer, sought to change the zoning of 27.4 acres of his Dan-bury property to an \u201cRA-8\u201d classification, which, if granted, would permit him to build 102 houses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time the plaintiff purchased the land, the entire parcel was zoned \u201cRA-40,\u201d a zoning classification that allowed construction of twenty-seven houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The plaintiff filed his application for a zone change on a form provided by the defendant. In response to an inquiry on the form asking the applicant to \u201c[sjtate briefly why this petition should be granted,\u201d the plaintiff wrote, \u201c[t]he property is to be developed as an affordable housing project in conformance and pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes relating to affordable housing projects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">After several public hearings on the plaintiffs original and modified applications, the commission voted by a margin of five to three to deny the modified application. In its letter, dated February 10, 1992, notify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ing the plaintiff of the denial, the commission stated the following four reasons for its decision: \u201c[1] The proposed density is too high for the proposed area, it was in the Plan of Development as an RA-40 zone and it should remain that way. [2] The increase in traffic and the detrimental effect on fire safety would make an adverse situation. [3] The environmental issue that there could be considerable impact on the Lake Kenosia watershed. [4] The need for affordable housing does not clearly outweigh the need to preserve the neighborhood as it presently exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s timely appeal from the decision of the commission. After making a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s zone change application had been made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g; and that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal therefore would be governed by the substantive and procedural standards set out in \u00a7 8-30g, the trial court concluded that the commission had failed to sustain the burden of proof imposed upon the commission by \u00a7 8-30g. The trial court concluded that the commission was required to approve the plaintiff\u2019s application, but ordered a remand to give the commission the opportunity to impose reasonable conditions and changes with respect thereto.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On appeal from the judgment of the trial court, the commission makes three claims. The commission argues that: (1) the trial court improperly held \u00a7 8-30g <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>to be applicable, because the plaintiffs application for a zone change was not an \u201caffordable housing application\u201d; (2) even if \u00a7 8-30g is applicable, the trial court improperly determined that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s conclusion that the zone change would threaten the Lake Kenosia watershed; and (3) even if \u00a7 8-30g is applicable, the trial court improperly rejected the commission\u2019s conclusion that it was necessary to deny the zone change to prevent increased traffic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to oral argument, this court sua sponte raised a fourth issue, whether the trial court\u2019s judgment ordering a remand was a final judgment that would sustain an immediate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We conclude, as both parties have argued in their supplemental briefs on the jurisdictional issue, that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. On the merits, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The first issue before us is whether the judgment of the trial court, remanding the case to the commission, was an appealable final judgment. Because the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> do not govern a zoning appeal; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (o), 8-9 and 8-30g (b); it is the scope of the remand order in this particular case that determines the finality of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Eastern Connecticut Cable Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>214 Conn. 609, 613, 573 A.2d 311 (1990). A judgment of remand is final if it \u201c \u2018so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); see also <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 409-11, 521 A.2d 566 (1987). A judgment of remand is not final, however, if it \u201crequires [the agency to make] further evidentiary determinations that are not merely ministerial.\u201d <em>Eastern Connecticut Cable Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 614. In light of the terms of the trial court\u2019s remand order, as explained in the court\u2019s response to the commission\u2019s motion for articulation, we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s judgment meets the test for finality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We attach significance to the fact that the trial court\u2019s judgment did not order further evidentiary determinations on remand. Although the trial court\u2019s remand may have <em>allowed </em>the commission to hear additional evidence in order to determine whether to impose \u201creasonable conditions\u201d on or to make \u201creasonable changes\u201d in the application, the remand in no way <em>required </em>the commission to conduct such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Even more important, the trial court\u2019s judgment required the commission to approve the plaintiffs application. With respect to this central issue, the trial court\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastern Connecticut Cable Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 613, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31. After explicitly resolving <em>\u201call </em>[of] the issues in favor of the plaintiff\u201d (emphasis added), the trial court remanded the case only for the limited purpose of allowing the commission to impose reasonable conditions on or make reasonable changes to the development, if it so chose. Because the proceedings on remand cannot deprive the plaintiff of the zone change that the trial court has ordered to be approved, the trial court has rendered a final judgment and this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the commission\u2019s appeal. See generally <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 409-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We turn now to the merits of the commission\u2019s claims. The commission first argues that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s application for a zone change had been an \u201caffordable housing application,\u201d such that \u00a7 8-30g applied to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The commission\u2019s argument is in two parts. First, the commission contends that the plaintiffs application was not an \u201caffordable housing application\u201d because the application failed to include specific development plans. Second, the commission contends that the plaintiff failed to provide adequate evidence that, if the zone change were granted, he would build affordable housing. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The commission first argues that \u00a7 8-30g governs a zoning appeal only if, at the time of an application for a zone change, the applicant submitted specific affordable housing plans. This contention must be placed in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Apart from \u00a7 8-30g, local zoning commissions have discretion to prescribe the materials that must be submitted in connection with a zone change application. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although zoning commissions may require the submission of site plans for all zone change applications, Danbury\u2019s zoning regulations contain no such requirements. The commission therefore conceded at oral argument that the plaintiffs zone change application contained all the information that Danbury regulations normally require. Compare Dan-bury Zoning Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 9.C, 10.A (Rev. to June 24, 1991) (governing applications for amendments to zoning map; not requiring submission of site plans), with Danbury Zoning Regs. \u00a7 3.P (Rev. to June 24, 1991) (governing applications for special permits and special exceptions; requiring submission of site plans).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Without regard to \u00a7 8-30g, zoning commissions, before acting on a zone change application, may also ask an applicant to submit additional information during the course of hearings on the application. Concededly, the commission in this case never asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>plaintiff to submit site plans during the course of the hearings. It is undisputed, furthermore, that whenever the commission did request additional information, the plaintiff responded to the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The commission\u2019s argument, therefore, devolves into the proposition that \u00a7 8-30g, by itself, required the plaintiff to submit site plans at the time of his application, and that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to submit such plans deprives him of the benefits of \u00a7 8-30g on appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The interpretation of \u00a7 8-30g \u201cis a question of law for the court. . . . We approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>North Haven </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 556, 561-62, 600 A.2d 1004 (1991); accord <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507-508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The commission does not argue that \u00a7 8-30g explicitly requires the submission of site plans in connection with a zone change application. The commission contends, rather, that we should infer such a requirement from four requirements that the statute does contain. The commission maintains that the applicant must submit specific plans because the statute requires that the application: (1) be made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development\u201d (emphasis added); General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); and, in the view of the commission, the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d means a <em>planned </em>scheme for construction in a particular area; (2) be reviewed by the commission and the trial court to determine whether the proposed housing is \u201caffordable\u201d within the meaning of the statute;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (3) be considered by the commission to determine the effect of the proposed affordable housing on \u201cpublic interests\u201d such as health, safety and the environment; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2) through (4); and (4) be assessed by the commission to determine whether affected public interests could be protected through \u201creasonable changes\u201d to the proposal. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (4). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We can discern no reason, as a matter of statutory construction, why the commission and the trial court, on appeal, were unable to fulfill their respective statutory obligations without the submission of site plans with the plaintiff\u2019s zone change application. First, the commission has failed to identify any specific information about the nature of the development or the housing\u2019s affordability that the plaintiff, upon the commission\u2019s request, could not or did not furnish. Second, in reviewing other requested zone changes without specific site plans, this commission regularly discharges its responsibility for considering the \u201cpublic interest\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-2;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and can equally do so here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Finally, in responding to the zone change application, in light of the evidence on the record at that time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>commission was not obligated to anticipate \u201creasonable changes\u201d that might subsequently be required in conjunction with the site plans.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>We note, moreover, that nothing in \u00a7 8-30g requires a departure from Danbury\u2019s decision to separate \u201czone change\u201d review from \u201csite plan\u201d review, and to entrust these reviews to two different agencies, respectively, the Danbury zoning commission and the Danbury planning commission. The language of \u00a7 8-30g strongly implies that the legislature intended not to interfere with the local discretion to apportion land use powers among various agencies. The statute assumes that many different types of applications will be brought to many different types of agencies, as it broadly applies to <em>\u201cany </em>application made to <em>a </em>commission <em>in connection with </em>an affordable housing development\u201d (emphasis added); General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); and as it defines \u201ccommission\u201d as any \u201czoning commission, planning commission, planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or municipal agency exercising zoning or planning authority.\u201d General Statutes $f-30g(a)(4)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We also disagree with the commission\u2019s claim that the legislative history of \u00a7 8-30g supports its contention that an applicant must submit detailed plans to support a zone change for affordable housing. The commission relies on the remarks of two state legislators and one committee witness. First, the commission quotes then Senator Richard Blumenthal, who remarked on the Senate floor that \u201cit is important to understand that these decisions involve specific projects on particular pieces of land and do not provide for any kind of general zoning override.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., p. 4048. Next, the commission quotes then Representative William J. Cibes, Jr., who remarked on the House of Representatives floor that \u00a7 8-30g \u201cis a narrow procedure which is available only to a few kinds of developers, developers who propose to build affordable housing . . . .\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1989 Sess., pp. 10663-64. Finally, the commission quotes Attorney Raphael Podolsky, who had helped to draft the bill that became \u00a7 8-30g while serving as a member of the governor\u2019s blue ribbon commission on housing. Podolsky testified before the planning and development committee that \u201c[t]his bill addresses a situation where there is an actual developer whether for profit or nonprofit with actual access to land, whether owned or optioned, who wants to build something, who has plans to build it, who\u2019s gone through a zoning board of appeals and has been turned down. . . . [Yjou\u2019re not dealing with theoretical zoning. You\u2019re dealing with actual practical applications to build units, and that is [a] very, very important part of this proposal.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Planning and Development, Pt. 1, 1989 Sess., p. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We are unpersuaded that any of these statements sufficiently manifests a legislative intent that \u00a7 8-30g requires the submission of site plans with affordable housing applications for zone changes. None of the quoted individuals specifically expressed such an intention. In our view, the plaintiff in this case satisfies the definitions offered by both legislators: he is a \u201c[developer] who propose[s] to build affordable housing\u201d; 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30,1989 Sess., pp. 10663-64, remarks of Representative William J. Cibes, Jr.; see part IIB of this opinion; and his proposal is a specific project on a particular piece of land; see 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12,1989 Sess., p. 4048, remarks of Senator Richard Blumenthal. The testimony of Podolsky is insufficient, in light of the silence of the statute and the silence of the legislators, to support the inference for which the commission contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We turn finally to the commission\u2019s contention that, to implement the legislative policy embodied in \u00a7 8-30g, we must interpolate into the statute a requirement that site plans be submitted in conjunction with zone change applications for affordable housing. The commission contends that, in the absence of such a requirement, developers regularly would submit affordable housing applications that failed to provide adequate information for zoning commissions to decide whether to change the zone. Such applications would impose costs on commissions to defend their zone change denials \u201cwithout any assurance that, if the developerfs] prevailed [on appeal], affordable housing developments that comply with legitimate public interests would be built.\u201d The commission concludes: \u201cThis law is already revolutionary enough. The statute does not require the overly broad interpretation suggested by the trial court . . . .\u201d We are again unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">First, we reject the commission\u2019s premise that \u00a7 8-30g should be construed narrowly because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>changes the existing legal structure. As a remedial statute, \u00a7 8-30g \u201cmust be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board Of Tax Review, </em>229 Conn. 618, 623, 642 A.2d 1186 (1994); see also <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Second, we can discern no policy reason why site plans must be submitted to the commission as part of the zone change process to ensure that \u201caffordable housing developments that comply with legitimate public interests [are] built.\u201d As we discussed above, the commission regularly determines whether zone changes affect the public interests without having access to site plans. As we explain below, the commission does not need site plans to ensure either that the new zone is used only for affordable housing; see part II B of this opinion; or that the actual development complies with the public interest. Other land use agencies will have the opportunity to consider whether subsequent specific site plans comport with legitimate public interests,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the commission can make the zone change conditional on the future approvals of those other agencies. See part III B 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Finally, a strong policy consideration counsels against the commission\u2019s interpretation: the commission\u2019s interpretation would waste financial resources. To draw up formal site plans, developers must incur considerable expense. Moreover, because site plans are site-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>specific, such plans cannot be reused if a zone change is denied. Because many affordable housing developers are nonprofit organizations; see, e.g., <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 503; we decline to interpolate into \u00a7 8-30g a requirement that would impose significant site planning expenses on developers who have not yet secured a zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 8-30g does not independently require an affordable housing developer to submit to the commission, at the time of his initial application in connection with an affordable housing development, any more detailed \u201cplans\u201d than an applicant who requests a zone change for a purpose other than affordable housing. A zoning commission undoubtedly is entitled to enact regulations requiring all zone change applicants, including applicants for zone changes in connection with affordable housing developments, at the time their applications are filed, to submit information that the commission will need to fulfill its duties. In addition, during the hearings on an application, a zoning commission undoubtedly is entitled, within the constraints imposed by its regulations, to require an applicant to provide whatever additional information the commission needs to fulfill its duties. The provisions of \u00a7 8-30g require nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We next address the commission\u2019s argument that the plaintiff is not entitled to invoke \u00a7 8-30g on this appeal because he failed to provide adequate evidence to the commission that, if the zone change were granted, he would build affordable housing. We agree with the commission that an applicant cannot claim the benefits of \u00a7 8-30g in a zoning appeal without providing \u201csome meaningful assurance\u201d that he will build affordable housing. As the commission correctly argues, \u00a7 8-30g <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>applies to appeals only if the application was made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development\u201d; General Statues \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); i.e., only if the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff proposed a \u201chousing development (A) which is assisted housing or (B) in which not less than twenty percent of the dwelling units will be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that such dwelling units be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1); see also <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 522. We disagree, however, that the plaintiff failed to meet his evidentiary burden in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">This issue comes to us within the constraints of the specific procedural record in this case. When the commission informed the plaintiff that his zone change application had been denied, the commission did not claim that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence that the plaintiff would build affordable housing. Indeed, the commission at all times treated the application as a valid \u201caffordable housing application\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); and it denied the application for four specific reasons unrelated to the evidence of affordability. \u201c[WJhere a zoning commission has formally stated the reasons for its decision, the court should not go behind that official collective statement . . . [and] attempt to search out and speculate upon other reasons which might have influenced some or all of the members of the commission to reach the commission\u2019s final collective decision.\u201d <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 513; <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>159 Conn. 534, 541, 271 A.2d 105 (1970). We need not determine, therefore, either whether the commission reasonably could have found, on the basis of the record before it, that the plaintiff would not build <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>affordable housing, or whether the commission would have had power to deny the application because of such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The only issue now before us is whether the <em>trial court </em>improperly determined that the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to the commission that the application had been made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2). Because the trial court made its determination on the basis of the administrative record, without evaluating the credibility of witnesses or assessing the intent of the parties in light of additional evidence first presented at trial, \u201cour review of the ruling of the trial court in this case is plenary.\u201d <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 54, 607 A.2d 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In support of its determination that the plaintiffs application had been made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); the trial court relied on the following facts that are contained in the record before the commission. \u201c[T]he application in this case [states that] \u2018[t]he property is to be developed as an affordable housing project in conformance [with] and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. relating to affordable housing projects.\u2019 This statement is broad enough to embrace both assisted housing under subsection (a) (1) (A) or restricted housing under subsection [(a) (1) (B)]. The record reveals that at the hearing the applicant declared his election to build [deed] restricted housing. In addition he stated that \u2018a minimum of twenty percent would be devoted to affordable housing as that term is defined by law\u2019 and finally he stated that \u2018the maximum cost per unit would be $128,000.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The commission challenges both the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its ultimate conclusion. The commission disputes the factual finding that the housing would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>be affordable because there was other evidence in the record that $128,000 was the <em>\u201cstarting price\u201d </em>(emphasis added) per unit rather than the maximum price per unit. The commission disputes the factual finding that the housing would be deed restricted because proposed deed covenants and restrictions submitted by the plaintiff did not contain language restricting future sales prices of the homes. Finally, the commission disputes the legal conclusion that the application had been made \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2); on the ground that an applicant cannot \u201cmeet the definitional test of \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B) when the record contains no concrete evidence of the likelihood of compliance with the statute other than the applicant\u2019s representations.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial court properly found that the proposed housing would be \u201caffordable.\u201d As the trial court noted, the plaintiff had testified before the commission that at least 20 percent of the houses would be sold below the maximum price qualifying as \u201caffordable\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g and that \u201cthe maximum cost is a hundred-twenty-eight thousand [dollars].\u201d The commission attempts to cast doubt on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony by referring to a sentence that was not uttered by the plaintiff, but that was contained in a marketing study prepared for the plaintiff\u2019s use. That study concludes that the affordable units would be marketable, because, \u201c[g]iven the proposed price range of $128,000 starting price (for eighteen of the total 90 units) for 1,600 square feet of living area for a single family house, a comparable condominium would have to sell for not more than $96,000.\u201d We find nothing in the quoted sentence that clearly contradicts the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. Although inartfully drafted, the phrase \u201cproposed price range of $128,000 starting price (for eighteen of the total 90 units)\u201d can be interpreted to mean exactly what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the plaintiff promised: a \u201cproposed price range of $128,000 (for eighteen of the total 90 units) and up.\u201d Notwithstanding the sentence in the marketing study, therefore, the trial court properly found that the plaintiff had intended to sell at least 20 percent of the units at $128,000 or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We also concur in the trial court\u2019s finding that the housing would be appropriately deed restricted. As the trial court noted, the plaintiff clearly expressed his intention to build deed restricted housing pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2) in his application, his testimony, and the testimony of his attorney. The commission never asked to review the specific language that would be incorporated into the deed restrictions. Admittedly, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney voluntarily placed into the commission\u2019s record copies of deed restrictions that had been used in a previous housing project and that related to wetlands preservation, but not to affordable housing. At the time he introduced those deed restrictions, however, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was not talking about the affordable housing component of the application, but instead about the environmental concerns that had been raised by Danbury\u2019s environmental impact commission. Nothing in the record suggests that the wetlands-related deed restrictions were to be the only deed restrictions. In addition, no other evidence casts doubt on the plaintiff\u2019s intentions to impose affordable housing-related deed restrictions; indeed, the commission admitted at trial that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s assurances . . . were made in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff had proved all facts necessary to meet his legal burden of establishing an intent to build affordable housing. In the face of unchallenged representations with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s intention, the statute does not require specific additional evidence that the dwelling units \u201cwill be conveyed by deeds con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>taining covenants or restrictions . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B). Indeed, we previously have affirmed a trial court\u2019s determination that an applicant\u2019s \u201cproposed housing units would be deed restricted within the definition of \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B)\u201d on the basis of evidence that the \u201cplaintiff <em>indicated its intent </em>to use a . . . declaration, containing restrictions and covenants that run with the land\u201d similar to a declaration that had been used by other developers in the past. (Emphasis added.) <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 524, 524-25 <em>(West Hartford).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The commission argues, however, that this case is distinguishable from <em>West Hartford, </em>because there is a risk that this plaintiff may renege on his promise to build affordable housing. The commission fears that, if it grants the plaintiff\u2019s- zone change, it, unlike the West Hartford town council, will be powerless to prevent the newly created zone from being used for purposes other than affordable housing. The commission points out that in <em>West Hartford, </em>the applicant had sought not only a zone change but also a special development district designation, which incorporated the condition that, if the applicant failed to record the affordable housing deed restrictions in the town\u2019s land records, the designation would be rescinded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The commission here maintains that it has no authority to impose a similar condition, because its regulations do not permit the granting of conditional zone changes and because, in the absence of authorizing regulations, the imposition of such conditions would violate the statutory injunction contained in \u00a7 8-2 that zoning regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tions must be uniformly applied throughout each district. We disagree with the commission\u2019s arguments and conclude that the evidentiary standard enunciated in <em>West Hartford </em>applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As a general matter, we may assume that zone changes may be conditionally granted only when regulations authorize conditions to be imposed in specific circumstances, and when the regulations are uniformly applied. See <em>Bartsch </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>6 Conn. App. 686, 690-91, 506 A.2d 1093 (1986); see also <em>Summ </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>150 Conn. 79, 85-86, 186 A.2d 160 (1962); <em>Pecora </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 435, 441, 144 A.2d 48 (1958). A general rule requiring uniform regulations serves the interests of providing fair notice to applicants and of ensuring their equal treatment. See <em>Bartsch </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 689; see also <em>Veseskis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>168 Conn. 358, 360, 362 A.2d 538 (1975). It is not necessary to apply such a rule to this case, however, because the interests served by the rule would not be adversely implicated by granting the zone change on the condition that the new zone be used only for affordable housing. The plaintiff has not complained of lack of notice that the newly created zone could be used only for affordable housing. The plaintiff\u2019s application itself stated the purpose of the desired zone; his testimony before the commission confirmed his intent to use the zone for affordable housing; and the filing of his appeal from the commission\u2019s decision under \u00a7 8-30g constituted a judicial admission that the zone change was sought \u201cin connection with an affordable housing development.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2). Moreover, allowing a conditional approval of the plaintiff\u2019s application does not discriminate among similarly situated applicants for zone changes. Affordable housing applicants, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>other zone change proponents, may invoke specific appellate rights pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g <em>because </em>they will use the new zones to build affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We conclude, therefore, that whatever the commission\u2019s regulatory authority may be in other circumstances, it can condition its granting of an affordable housing zone change application on the use of the new zone only for affordable housing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s order of remand will afford the commission the opportunity to craft an appropriate condition in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The scope of the commission\u2019s authority is therefore indistinguishable from that which governed our decision in <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 524-25. The trial court properly determined that \u00a7 8-30g applies to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The commission maintains that, even if \u00a7 8-30g applies, it was justified in denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for a zone change. The commission argues that the trial court improperly rejected two separate justifications for the commission\u2019s decision by: (1) imposing upon it too high an evidentiary burden; and (2) mischaracterizing the substantive evidence in the record. We agree with the commission\u2019s argument about the evidentiary burden, but we disagree with its contentions about the evidence in the record. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The commission first argues that the trial court improperly required it to show that there was \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence in the record to support its denial of the plaintiffs application. The commission contends that the traditional principles governing appeals from legislative decisions of zoning commissions, as well as the terms of \u00a7 8-30g itself, require a commission only to show \u201csufficient\u201d evidence in the record to support its decision. Although it is not entirely clear whether the trial court applied the \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence test in this case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we will exercise our supervisory authority to review this issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree with the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>sion that the correct test is whether it met the lesser burden of adducing \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In traditional zoning appeals, the scope of judicial review depends on whether the zoning commission has acted in its \u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cadministrative\u201d capacity. \u201cThe discretion of a legislative body, because of its constituted role as formulator of public policy, is much broader than that of an administrative board, which serves a quasi-judicial function.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 527, 543, 600 A.2d 757 (1991); <em>Malafronte </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>155 Conn. 205, 209, 230 A.2d 606 (1967). \u201cActing in such legislative capacity, the local [zoning] board is free to amend [or to refuse to amend] its regulations whenever time, experience, and responsible planning for contemporary or future conditions reasonably indicate the need for [or the undesirability of] a change. . . . Zoning must be sufficiently flexible to meet the demands of increased population and evolutionary changes in such fields as architecture, transportation, and redevelopment. . . . The responsibility for meeting these demands rests, under our law, with the reasoned discretion of each municipality acting through its duly authorized zoning commission. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 543-44; <em>Malafronte </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>supra, 208-209. \u201cIn contrast, when acting in an administrative capacity, a zoning commission\u2019s more limited function is to determine whether the applicant\u2019s proposed use is one which satisfies the standards set forth in the <em>[existing] </em>regulations and the statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). <em>West Hart</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>ford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 505-506 n.10. In fulfilling its administrative function, a zoning commission is less concerned with the development of public policy than with the correct application of law to facts in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">These well established principles are reflected in the evidentiary rules governing appeals from zoning decisions. Appeals from legislative zoning decisions require a showing that the commission has acted \u201carbitrarily . . . illegally ... or in abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 543-44.

Significantly, the legislative history suggests that the legislature chose to impose a \u201csufficient evidence\u201d standard specifically because it thought that standard would be lower than the administrative \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In this case, when the commission rejected the proposed amendment to its zoning map, the commission was acting in its legislative capacity. <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 505 n.10; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>189 Conn. 261, 265, 455 A.2d 339 (1983). In the appeal from the commission\u2019s decision, therefore, neither our traditional rules nor \u00a7 8-30g itself required the commission to demonstrate \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support of its decision. The commission\u2019s only burden was to show that \u201cthe record before the [commission] supported] the decision reached\u201d; <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 513; and that the commission did not act \u201carbitrarily . . . illegally . . . or in abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Applying this standard to the evidence of record before the commission, the commission contends that, in two respects, the trial court improperly overturned the commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application. The commission maintains that the record contains sufficient evidence to sustain its determination that the application: (1) would create environmental problems because of the risk of a \u201cconsiderable impact on the Lake Kenosia watershed\u201d; and (2) would create traffic problems because of the intensity of use of the proposed development and because there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>that other agencies would approve the road work necessitated by such intensity of use.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">To justify its denial of the plaintiffs affordable housing application, the commission was required to show that, on the basis of \u201cthe evidence in the record . . . the decision [was] necessary to protect substantial public interests . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2). Section 8-30g (c) (2) therefore imposed two. burdens on the commission. First, the commission was required to establish that it reasonably could have concluded that \u201csubstantial public interests\u201d were implicated by the zone change, in light of the record evidence as to both the level of harm that could result from the zone change and the probability that the zone change would cause that harm. Second, the commission was required to establish that, on the basis of the record, it reasonably could have concluded that the decision to deny the zone change was \u201cnecessary\u201d\u2014i.e., that any such public interests could not be protected if the zone change were granted. We agree with the trial court that the commission failed to satisfy its burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We first examine the commission\u2019s contention, which the trial court rejected, that the zone change would threaten the Lake Kenosia watershed. The commission challenges the decision of the trial court in three respects. First, it argues that the trial court improperly required evidence that the zone change would result in a \u201cdefinite or reasonably likely harm\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>watershed, when the commission merely needed to show record evidence that the harm was a \u201cpossibility.\u201d Second, it argues that the trial court improperly gave too much weight to the fact that the \u201cexpert evidence\u201d supported the plaintiffs application, because the commission had not been required to find that evidence credible. Finally, it argues that the trial court improperly determined, on the basis of the record, that the zone change denial had not been necessary to protect the watershed. Although we agree in part with two of the commission\u2019s three arguments, we are nevertheless persuaded that, as the trial court concluded, the record does not support the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">First, the commission argues that the trial court applied an incorrect standard by requiring a showing that the proposed zone change would lead to \u201cdefinite or reasonably likely\u201d harm, when the law entitled the commission to reject an application even if the harm was merely \u201cpossible.\u201d In particular, the commission challenges the trial court\u2019s reliance on an earlier statement of this court that \u201c[cjertainly a local legislative body may consider the effects that are <em>likely </em>to flow from proposed amendments to its zoning regulations, and may decide, within the proper statutory parameters, that it would be unwise policy for the town to countenance those effects.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 548. The commission argues that, contrary to the analysis of the trial court, the quoted language does not mean that a commission may consider <em>only </em>\u201ceffects that are likely . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Rather, the commission argues, quoting the immediately preceding sentence of this court\u2019s opinion, a zoning commission also is \u201centitled ... to consider [a proposal\u2019s] <em>potential </em>effects on the town . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We agree with the commission that a zoning authority, acting in its legislative capacity, is not limited to considering only the effects of its actions that are definite or more likely than not. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>225 Conn. 731, 756, 626 A.2d 705 (1993) (holding that commission reasonably could reject zoning amendment because of \u201crisks\u201d of environmental degradation); see also <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 549 (upholding agency decision to deny wetland permit because, inter alia, \u201cthe record does contain evidence that there <em>could </em>be pollution\u201d [emphasis added]). We disagree, however, that the commission was entitled to reject this plaintiff\u2019s application based on the mere possibility that the zone change would harm the Lake Kenosia watershed. As we explained above, the commission was required to show a reasonable basis in the record for concluding that its decision was necessary to protect substantial public interests. The record, therefore, must contain evidence concerning the potential harm that would result if the zone were changed from RA-40 to RA-8 and concerning the probability that such harm in fact would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The commission next argues that the trial court improperly gave too much weight to the fact that all the \u201cexpert evidence\u201d in the record supported the plaintiff\u2019s application. We agree with the commission that it was not required to give credence to any witness, including an expert. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 542. We also assume without deciding that the commission was entitled to reject this application on the basis of its own members\u2019 testimony or the testimony of other lay witnesses, without additional expert testimony.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>mission would have been entitled to deny an application because it did not believe the expert testimony, however, the commission had the burden of showing evidence in the record to <em>support </em>its decision not to believe the experts\u2014i.e., evidence which undermined either the experts\u2019 credibility or their ultimate conclusions. See generally <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 544-50. Moreover, in the absence of expert testimony, the commission was required to point to other probative evidence in the record showing that the zone change implicated substantial public interests. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Bearing in mind that the commission bore the burden of establishing, with or without expert evidence, that the zone change threatened substantial public interests, we now turn to the evidence of record to determine whether the trial court properly ruled, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the basis of that record, that the commission had failed to carry its burden. We agree with the trial court that the record does not support the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">As the trial court properly determined, the record contains the following evidence. \u201cThe City Superintendent of Public Utilities, William Buckley, testified that both public utility water and municipal sewerage facilities were readily available to the site. This obviated any risk associated with either degradation of the underground water supply by the installation of on site wells or contamination of the Lake Kenosia watershed as a result of underground leaching of septic effluent. ... He concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s proposal would not threaten the water supply any more than it is threatened by the kind of activities that are already there.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u201cJack Kozuchowski, the City Environmental Coordinator, advised the commission that requiring that the sewers be placed on both the north and south side of the property \u2018would reduce the nutrient loading on the lake which is really relevant to the commission\u2019s interest and would eliminate many of the problems.\u2019 Although it does not appear as part of any of the reasons, the principal concern of the commission appeared to be the possible harmful effect on the lake caused by nutrient loading from the development. The issue was explored extensively at the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u201cHenry Moeller, a soil scientist, called by the plaintiff, testified that \u2018essentially all practical and suitable measures have been incorporated into this project to protect the wetlands soils and also the water quality coming off the property.\u2019 He further opined that because the developer could be required to install detention basins to catch most of the nutrients, the flow [off] the property would be less than it is now. He said that \u2018even with the [worst] case of an overwatered, highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>fertilized lawn, that the total nitrogen in both surface runoff and subsurface seepage coming from the plot, the amount of nitrates in the water in terms of concentration remain below drinking water standards.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201cJeanne Williamson, the plaintiff\u2019s engineer . . . testified that she was \u2018confident that the plan will protect the . . . wetlands and therefore discharge no phosphates to the downstream receiving watercourses.\u2019 She stated that \u2018with the erosion and sedimentation controls and storm water management practices proposed and previously approved by the Environmental Impact Commission, this project will have no adverse impact upon Lake Kenosia. The impact upon Lake Kenosia from this property will be reduced [compared to its undeveloped state] by lessening the amount of siltation from the site with erosion and sedimentation control measures and detention/sedimentation basins.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u201cSometime in the middle 1980\u2019s the City of Danbury created the Lake Kenosia Commission to protect the lake. . . . Through its chairperson, R. A. Carlson, it recommended against approval of the initial application but did not take a formal position with respect to the modified application. The recommendation is found in a letter dated November 12,1991, in which the commission advised that the \u2018increased potential housing density <em>can </em>have a significant adverse impact on surface and ground water quality of the Kenosia Aquifer Watershed.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) The chairperson attached reports and correspondence which generally discuss conditions in the watershed and lake. The commission did not submit a report relating specifically to the plaintiff\u2019s development proposal nor did it offer any expert testimony. In fact it failed to point to any definite or even reasonably likely harm that . . . would befall the lake and its watershed. Not only was the fear generalized but it was highly problematical. No effort was made to evaluate the modified proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The commission contends that two aspects of the record support its decision to deny the zone change. First, the commission focuses on the letter and documents submitted by the Lake Kenosia commission, which, according to the commission, tended to show that \u201cincreased potential housing density can have significant adverse impact on surface and groundwater quality of the Kenosia aquifer watershed.\u201d Second, the commission points to a document in the record that the trial court did not explicitly address, a 1989 draft of the Danbury watershed protection plan. Specifically, the commission quotes the section of the watershed protection plan that sets out a \u201chierarchy of low to high risk land use categories based on the potential for contaminating\u201d ground water and surface water. In this \u201chierarchy,\u201d the watershed protection plan characterizes \u201cmedium density residential (density ranges from one dwelling unit per 1/2 acre to one unit per 2 acres)\u201d as a \u201cslight to moderate risk,\u201d but characterizes \u201chigh density residential (more than one dwelling unit per 1/2 acre site)\u201d as a \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d The commission also contends that the watershed protection plan contradicted the testimony that sewers could be used to avoid the risks of the development, because that document contained a general recommendation that sewers not be extended into watershed areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We agree with the trial court that none of the evidence from the Lake Kenosia commission provided a reasonable basis on which to deny the application. That agency\u2019s letter did not express an opinion either as to how great an effect the zone change would have or as to the probability that the effect would occur. None of the documents presented by that agency, moreover, provides any reasonable basis for the conclusion that a change to the RA-8 zone, allowing construction of five houses per acre, would be more harmful than the existing RA-40 zone, allowing construction of one house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>per acre. Although the documents suggest that any development in the watershed may cause harm, the documents do not support the commission\u2019s assumption that higher density development would be more harmful than lower density development.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Similarly, we agree with the trial court that the watershed protection plan provided no reasonable basis for the commission\u2019s conclusion. Immediately before setting out its \u201chierarchy\u201d of land use risks, that document explicitly cautions that \u201cthis hierarchy is not based upon empirical data but on subjective judgment. Therefore, it . . . should not be used as a regulatory framework without further research or evaluation.\u201d Because the record contains no \u201cfurther research or evaluation\u201d comparing the environmental effects of the current RA-40 zone to the proposed RA-8 zone, the watershed protection plan\u2019s hierarchy, by its own terms, had no probative value. In addition, the watershed protection plan\u2019s general recommendation against sewers was irrelevant to this case. As the trial court found, all the testimony in the record indicated that \u201cLake Kenosia is an <em>exception </em>to the sewer avoidance policy of the city because the Lake Kenosia watershed is already occupied by uses which are 55% industrial or commercial\u201d (emphasis added) and because the use of sewers would actually decrease the nutrient loading and resulting eutrophication of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In sum, we agree with the conclusion of the trial court that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that supports anything but a mere possibility\u201d that the requested zone change would harm the environment. The record contains no evidence quantifying the potential level of harm to the Lake Kenosia watershed or estimating the probability that the harm would occur if the zone change were granted. We agree, therefore, that the commission failed to carry its burden to show that its decision was necessary to protect substantial public interests in the Lake Kenosia watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The commission argues, in the alternative, that the evidence of record supports its decision to deny the application because the affordable housing development would cause too much traffic on existing roads. The trial court rejected this argument in part because it determined that the record before the commission showed that the traffic problem could be solved if one or more existing roads were improved. The commission does not dispute the potential viability of this solution to the traffic problem. The commission argues, rather, that because the <em>planning </em>commission has sole jurisdiction to approve road improvements, and because there was no evidence in the record that the planning commission would approve the new roads, protection of the public interest in traffic control required a denial of the plaintiffs zone change application. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The commission bases its argument on <em>Faubel </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>154 Conn. 202, 224 A.2d 538 (1966), in which, on somewhat similar facts, this court held that \u201ca change of zone which is dependent for its proper functioning on action by other agencies and over which the zoning commission has no control cannot be sustained unless . . . the necessary action appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>a probability.\u201d Id., 211. This holding reflects the policy concern that, in the face of evidence of impending harm to the public interest, zoning commissions should not grant zone changes without assurances, in the record, that preventive steps will be taken to minimize the risk of harm. See also <em>Brustein </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 101, 105, 193 A.2d 523 (1963); <em>Luery </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>150 Conn. 136, 145, 187 A.2d 247 (1962); <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>146 Conn. 321, 326-27, 150 A.2d 312 (1959); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>145 Conn. 597, 603-604, 145 A.2d 746 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The concerns that underlay <em>Faubel </em>do not, however, control the decision in this case if the commission has the authority to grant the application for a new zone on the condition that the planning commission approves, and the plaintiff makes, the necessary road improvements. If the roads are not built, the existing zone will continue in place, and the public interests in traffic control will remain protected. If the roads are built, on the other hand, the public interests in traffic control will not be adversely affected. In other contexts, therefore, we have allowed zoning commissions to approve a proposed development project on the condition that the applicant take other action, even when the other action required another agency\u2019s approval, and even when there was no \u201cevidence that the other agency will act favorably on the future request.\u201d <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 471, 482, 562 A.2d 1093 (1989); <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 295, 278 A.2d 799 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The commission maintains, nevertheless, that it is not empowered conditionally to grant this zone change application because, in our prior cases, the conditional zoning approvals that we allowed did not involve <em>zone changes,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The commission argues, further, that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>if it had been empowered <em>conditionally to grant </em>the zone change to protect the public interests, it also was empowered simply <em>to deny </em>the zone change to protect those interests. In the context of an application to build affordable housing, however, we agree with the trial court that, on the present record, the conditional granting of a zone change was not only authorized but required.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">As long as a conditional zone change approval protects the public interest in traffic control, a proposition that the commission does not contest, such an approval advances the legislative purpose of encouraging the construction of affordable housing. \u201c \u2018[P]ublic officials are expected to cooperate in helping [affordable housing] to [be] locate[d] in their community\u2019 . . . but it is hardly reasonable to expect that a highway authority or traffic authority would make the necessary expenditures and changes without knowing that when such work was completed the . . . zoning commission would approve and permit the project which the work was designed to make possible, nor, logically, should the commission grant an unconditional permit for a project when in its judgment the project was impermissible unless off-site work were done. In such circumstances it is entirely reasonable and logical that the . . . zoning commission which is entrusted with large powers . . . should be the agency to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>first move and the decision as to the conditions under which it would approve the [project]. This is so even though the project may subsequently fail to materialize because one or more of the conditions has for any reason not been met.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In principle, this issue is no different from that which we considered, earlier in this opinion, about the authority to condition any change in zone for the plaintiffs property on the actual use of that property for affordable housing. The plaintiff had adequate notice that the road improvements, which he agreed were necessary, would require planning commission approval; see footnote 13; and there has been no argument that conditioning the zone change on approval and implementation of the road improvements would discriminate against the plaintiffs application. Indeed, the plaintiff conceded in his brief to this court that it would be fair and appropriate to allow the commission in this case to impose a condition on the zone change that incorporated the relevant traffic concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The conclusion that the commission was empowered to grant the plaintiff an appropriately conditioned zone change does not, of course, demonstrate that the commission was, as the trial court held, required to do so. In our past cases approving conditional zoning, we have described conditional zoning not as an obligation, but as a means of achieving \u201cgreater flexibility in zoning administration . . . .\u201d <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In light of the statutory requirements of \u00a7 8-30g and the specific facts presented in this case, however, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s holding was proper. For the commission to demonstrate that its denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s affordable housing application had been \u201cnecessary to protect substantial public interests\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2); the commission was required to show that, on the basis of the evidence in the record, it reasonably could have concluded that it could not simultaneously grant the zone change and protect the public interest. In this case, however, all the evidence in the record showed that the potential traffic problem would be solved by making certain road improvements. The plaintiff, furthermore, agreed to make those improvements. On this record, therefore, the commission\u2019s decision to deny the zone change was not \u201cnecessary to protect substantial public interests.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In sum, we affirm the conclusion of the trial court that the commission failed to prove, on the evidence in the record, that its denial of the plaintiff\u2019s affordable housing application was necessary to protect substantial public interests.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In accordance with the judgment of the trial court, the case will be remanded to the commission, with direction that \u201cthe modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>application be approved under such terms and conditions as the commission might reasonably prescribe within the parameters of\u201d the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g provides: \u201caffordable housing land use appeals procedure, (a) As used in this section: (1) \u2018Affordable housing development\u2019 means a proposed housing development (A) which is assisted housing or (B) in which not less than twenty per cent of the dwelling units will be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that such dwelling units be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a, for persons and families whose income is less than or equal to eighty per cent of the area median income, for at least twenty years after the initial occupation of the proposed development; (2) \u2018affordable housing application\u2019 means any application made to a commission in connection with an affordable housing development by a person who proposes to develop such affordable housing; (3) \u2018assisted housing\u2019 means housing which is receiving, or will receive, financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing, and any housing occupied by persons receiving rental assistance under chapter 138a or Section 1437f of Title 42 of the United States Code; (4) \u2018commission\u2019 means a zoning commission, planning commission, planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or municipal agency exercising zoning or planning authority; and (5) \u2018municipality\u2019 means any town, city or borough, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201c(b) Any person whose affordable housing application is denied or is approved with restrictions which have a substantial adverse impact on the viability of the affordable housing development or the degree of affordability of the affordable dwelling units, specified in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, contained in the affordable housing development, may appeal such decision pursuant to the procedures of this section.

All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings, structures or use of land throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in another district, and may provide that certain classes or kinds of buildings, structures or uses of land are permitted only after obtaining a special permit or special exception from a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals, whichever commission or board the regulations may, notwithstanding any special act to the contrary, designate, subject to standards set forth in the regulations and to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values. In adopting such regulations the commission shall consider the plan of development prepared under section 8-23. Such regulations shall be designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population and to facilitate the adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration as to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such municipality. Such regulations may, to the extent consistent with soil types, terrain, infrastructure capacity and the plan of development for the community, provide for cluster development, as defined in section 8-18, in residential zones. Such regulations shall also encourage <em>the </em>development of housing opportunities, including opportunities for multifamily dwellings, consistent with soil types, terrain and infrastructure capacity, for all residents of the municipality and the planning region in which the municipality is located, as designated by the secretary of the office of policy and management under section 16a-4a.

To fulfill its burdens under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (4), therefore, the commission was required to show only that, on the basis of evidence in the record, it reasonably could have concluded that the public interests could not be protected by \u201creasonable changes\u201d to the size of the zone, the density of the zone or the specific designs presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> In this respect, \u00a7 8-30g is unlike affordable housing statutes in some states, which explicitly consolidate the powers and duties of various land use agencies.

The commission did not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> As we observed in <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 524, the West Hartford town council was empowered to \u201c \u2018attach any conditions to its approval [of a special development district plan] as it considers necessary in order to assure continued conformance to the approved plan and zoning regulations <em>....\u2019\u201d </em>(Brackets in original.)

In its brief, the defendant acquiesces in the application of this standard because it believes that it has sustained its burden of proof under the statute but suggests nevertheless that it may not be the correct standard. This court likewise perceives that other possible interpretations exist but that this case is not an appropriate vehicle in which to make that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">After this brief statement, the trial court did not again refer either to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard or to our analysis in <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 539. Moreover, the trial court rejected the commission\u2019s arguments not for lack of \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence in the record, but for lack of <em>any </em>evidence in the record. On the basis of both the trial court\u2019s express statement that \u201cthis case is not the appropriate vehicle in which to\u201d analyze the proper evidentiary standard and the contents of its analysis, we conclude that the trial court would have held that there was not \u201csufficient evidence\u201d in the record even under the narrower test we describe in the following text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> Because we are exercising our supervisory authority to review the evidentiary standard imposed, we need not directly address the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the commission waived its right to challenge the evidentiary standard by acceding to the application of that standard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 397, 645 A.2d 535 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 162-64, 540 A.2d 679 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> We do not here attempt exhaustively to analyze the difference between the two standards of review.

As Representative Richard D. Tulisano explained, the term \u201csufficient evidence\u201d in \u00a7 8-30g means \u201c[e]nough evidence for one to reach a particular conclusion. . . . [A]s the body knows . . . court decisions have in fact left it to the findings ... of the Boards of Planning and Zoning Commissions .... I think that they will have to have something on the record that third parties can look at in an objective manner and reach the same conclusion. It is not a very high standard whatsoever, and so I think the Representative is correct that [it] is just a matter of fact that something has to be there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and they will have sustained their burden.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1989 Sess., p. 10579.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Because the question is not here presented, however, we express no opinion as to whether the legislature intended courts to apply the lower \u201csufficient evidence\u201d standard in appeals from <em>administrative </em>zoning decisions, and if so, whether it intended courts to do so in all or only some aspects of such appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> The commission conceded in its appellate brief that it had failed to sustain its burden of proof under \u00a7 8-30g as to its first reason, namely that the land \u201cwas in the plan of development as a[n] RA-40 zone and it should remain that way.\u201d Moreover, the commission has provided no arguments in support of its fourth concern\u2014the \u201cneed to preserve the neighborhood as it presently exists\u201d\u2014other than its arguments about the need to protect the Lake Kenosia watershed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> In <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 427, 429 A.2d 910 (1980), we considered the question of \u201cwhether, on a subject as tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>nically sophisticated and complex as pollution control, commissioners who have not been shown to possess expertise in this area may rely on their own knowledge, without more, in deciding to deny a license to conduct a regulated activity.\u201d We noted that \u201c[t]he question in this precise form is one that we have not previously had the occasion to consider. We have in the past permitted lay members of commissions to rely on their personal knowledge concerning matters readily within their competence, such as traffic congestion and street safety . . . and local property values. . . . We [also] have permitted a commission composed of experts to rely on its own expertise within the area of its professional competence . . . but in that case we recognized as well that expert testimony may be required when the question involved goes beyond \u2018the ordinary knowledge and experience\u2019 of the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 427-28. After setting out the question presented in <em>Feinson, </em>however, we went on to resolve the case without answering it. We held that even if the commission had been entitled to rely on its own knowledge and experience, it had been required \u201cto reveal publicly its special knowledge and experience, to give notice of the material facts that are critical to its decision, so that a person adversely affected thereby has an opportunity for rebuttal at an appropriate stage in the administrative proceedings.\u201d Id., 428-29. We therefore sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal in that case on the limited ground that the plaintiff had not been \u201cafforded a fair opportunity to hear the commission\u2019s fears and to attempt to allay them.\u201d Id., 428.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> The commission was particularly precluded from making such an assumption in light of the other evidence in the record that the denser zone would in some ways cause a smaller environmental impact. The plaintiffs engineer, for example, testified that because the denser zone would include smaller houses and require fewer roads and shorter driveways, the total \u201cimpervious surface area\u201d in the RA-8 zone would be slightly <em>less </em>than that in the RA-40 zone. The plaintiff\u2019s engineer further explained that a reduction in impervious surface area allowed for more absorption and filtration of waste products. Additional evidence in the record showed that the higher density development, which would require the installation of sewers, would be less harmful than a lower density development that relied on septic systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> In <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 307, we held only that \u201cwhere <em>an exception or a special permit </em>is granted and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>grant is otherwise valid except that it is made reasonably conditional on favorable action by another agency or agencies over which the zoning authority has no control, its issuance will not be held invalid solely because of the existence of any such condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cf. <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 471 (upholding without discussion conditions that had been attached to simultaneous applications for special permit and zone change). Indeed, in <em>Lurie, </em>we allowed zoning commissions to grant special permits and exceptions on the condition that other agencies act favorably in part because zoning commissions already were entitled to impose other types of ad hoc conditions in connection with special exceptions and special permits. <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 304-306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the commission failed to meet its burdens under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2), we need not address the commission\u2019s argument that the trial court also improperly determined that the commission had failed to meet its burdens under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3). The commission contends that, in determining if \u201cthe public interests\u201d clearly outweighed the \u201cneed for affordable housing\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3), the trial court improperly looked to the statewide need for housing, rather than to \u201cthe need for affordable housing\u201d in Danbury itself. We offer no opinion, however, as to the propriety of the commission\u2019s argument, as to how the \u201cneed for affordable housing\u201d should be defined, or as to the kind of evidence, if any, that would suffice to show that there was less \u201cneed\u201d for affordable housing in a particular place.
