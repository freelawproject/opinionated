Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">\n<em>Koyle\u2019s execution of the Note</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">On February 7, 2003, Koyle executed an adjustable rate note (Note) in the amount of $139,400, and a Deed of Trust encumbering a parcel of real estate located at 389 E. 1090 N. in the Mountain Green Subdivision of Orem, Utah (the Property). The TLP Funding Corporation (TLP) was the beneficiary named in the Deed of Trust and Stewart Title Company (Stewart Title) was the trustee. On February 21, 2003, the Deed of Trust was recorded in the official records of the Utah County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">\n<em>Assignment of the Note to Wells Fargo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARH0\">On or about May 1, 2003, TLP assigned its interest in the Deed of Trust to Option One Mortgage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which then immediately assigned the same interest to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association (Wells Fargo).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These May 1, 2003 transactions were registered by Stewart Title with the Utah County Recorder on December 12, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">\n<em>Koyle\u2019s default on the Note</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Koyle failed to make timely payments on the Note. As a result of Koyle\u2019s default, Wells Fargo caused two documents to be recorded with the Utah County Recorder on October 16, 2003. First, Wells Fargo caused to be filed with the Utah County Recorder a Substitution of Trustee naming Scott Lundberg as successor trustee to replace Stewart Title.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dist. Ct. Docket No. 2, Ex. 1 at 3. Second, Scott Lundberg, as successor trustee, filed with the Utah County Recorder a Notice of Default and Election to Sell (Notice of Default) against the Property. Id. The Notice of Default \u201cdeclare[d] all sums ... immediately due and payable,\u201d but also noted that the \u201cdefault [wa]s subject to reinstatement in accordance with Utah law.\u201d Dist. Ct. Docket No. 15, Ex. 4 at 1,.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">\n<em>Koyle\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">On March 24, 2004, Koyle filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah. Koyle\u2019s filing resulted in an automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 that prohibited Wells Fargo from taking further action in connection with the Notice of Default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">On October 19, 2004, the bankruptcy court overseeing Koyle\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding signed an order and payment plan that was agreed to and signed by the parties. Under the terms of the payment plan, the parties agreed that the automatic stay would remain in effect subject to Koyle making specific monthly payments pursuant to the terms of the Note and Deed of Trust, and curing his post-petition arrearage on the Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">Soon thereafter, however, Koyle failed to comply with the terms of the plan. Consequently, on December 20, 2004, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>bankruptcy court dismissed Koyle\u2019s Chapter 13 petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">On February 17, 2005, Koyle filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Once again, that filing resulted in an automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. On July 18, 2005, the bankruptcy court signed an order and payment plan that was agreed to and signed by the parties (the 2005 Agreed Order). Similar to the order issued in Koyle\u2019s first bankruptcy proceedings, the 2005 Agreed Order stated that the automatic stay would remain in effect subject to Koyle making specific monthly payments pursuant to the terms of the Note and Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Koyle failed to comply with the 2005 Agreed Order. In particular, Koyle failed to make a July 19, 2005 payment that was called for in the 2005 Agreed Order. Consequently, on October 7, 2005, the bankruptcy court dismissed Koyle\u2019s second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">\n<em>Koyle\u2019s state court proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">On February 3, 2006, Koyle filed a complaint (the 2005 Complaint) in Utah\u2019s Fourth District Court alleging numerous causes of action against Option One Mortgage and Wells Fargo, including violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 through 2617, as well as state law claims for breach of contract, fraudulent notice of default, and improper foreclosure proceedings. Koyle also, on that same date, recorded a <em>lis pendens </em>on the Property. The 2005 Complaint remained pending in state court for nearly seven years, until January 12, 2012, when the parties entered into a stipulation to dismiss the matter with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">Prior to dismissing the 2005 Complaint, Koyle filed a second state court complaint on April 19, 2011 (the 2011 Complaint). Like the 2005 complaint, the 2011 Complaint alleged claims against Wells Fargo for violations of RESPA, breach of contract, and improper foreclosure practices. In addition, the 2011 Complaint alleged that the Notice of Default was fraudulent because Wells Fargo did not record its interest in the Note until after the Notice of Default was filed. As he did when he filed the 2005 Complaint, Koyle recorded a <em>lis pendens </em>on the Property on the same day that he filed his 2011 Complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Wells Fargo removed the 2011 Complaint to federal court and then moved to dismiss it for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The federal district court granted that motion and dismissed the complaint. Koyle appealed and this court affirmed in an unpublished order and judgment issued on July 16, 2012. Koyle v. Wells Fargo Bank Minn., 470 Fed.Appx. 712 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">\n<em>Wells Fargo\u2019s cancellation of the Notice of Default</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">On September 27, 2011, Scott Lundberg, as trustee, filed with the Utah County Recorder a Cancellation of Notice of Default (Cancellation) which stated, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe undersigned hereby cancels the Notice of Default filed for record October 16, 2003.\u201d Dist. Ct. Docket No. 34, Ex. 17 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">\n<em>Wells Fargo\u2019s steps to foreclose on the Property and Koyle\u2019s response</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">On or about October 15, 2014, a Corrective Assignment of Deed of Trust was recorded with the Utah County Recorder. This corrected the December 12, 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Deed of Trust and clarified that the beneficiary of the Deed of Trust was Wells Fargo in its capacity as Trustee for Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-4 Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-4. Dist. Ct. Docket No. 15 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">On December 19, 2014, Paul M, Halli-day, Jr, (Halliday), who would soon thereafter be substituted as trustee for Scott Lundberg, filed with the Utah County Recorder a second \u201cNotice of Default and Election to Sell\u201d (Second Notice). Dist. Ct. Docket No. 15, Ex. 4 at 1. Like the first Notice, the Second Notice \u201cdeclare[d] all sums secured\u201d by the Note and Deed of Trust \u201cimmediately due and payable.\u201d Id. A trustee\u2019s sale was subsequently scheduled for April 20,2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">On January 5, 2015, Koyle responded by filing with the Utah County Recorder a Notice of Fraudulent Notice of Default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">\n<em>Substitution of trustee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">On January 23, 2015, a Substitution of Trustee (which was executed on January 20, 2015) was filed with the Utah County Recorder indicating that Halliday was appointed as successor trustee by Wells Fargo, in its capacity as trustee for Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-4 Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-4. Dist. Ct. Docket No. 2, Ex. 1 at 5. This Substitution of Trustee was filed more than a month after Halliday was officially substituted as trustee and filed the Second Notice with the Utah County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">On March 18, 2015, Koyle filed suit against Sand Canyon and Wells Fargo in the Fourth Judicial District Court of Utah County. Koyle\u2019s complaint stated at the outset that it was Koyle\u2019s \u201cunderstanding and belief that\u201d defendants were barred by the applicable Utah statute of limitations from \u201cenforc[ing] the ... Note.\u201d Dist. Ct. Docket No. 2, Ex. 1 at 2. The complaint in turn alleged six purported claims for relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">1) <em>Fraudulent Assignment of Deed of Trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">The first cause of action alleged in the complaint was for fraudulent assignment of the deed of trust. In support, Koyle alleged that at the time the Corrective Assignment of Deed of Trust was filed with the Utah County Recorder on October 15, 2014, Sand Canyon \u201chad no beneficial interest in the\u201d Deed of Trust and was thus \u201cprohibited to attempt to reassign any claimed interest in\u201d the Deed of Trust. Id. at 6-7. Therefore, Koyle alleged, the Corrective Assignment of Deed of Trust was \u201cinvalid and fraudulent in nature.\u201d Id. at 7. And in turn, Koyle alleged, Sand Canyon was \u201cnot permitted by law to instruct a trustee or successor trustee to commence foreclosure proceedings\u201d against him. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">2) <em>Fraudulent Notice of Default.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">The second cause of action alleged that because the Corrective Assignment of Deed of Trust \u201cwas recorded by an entity,\u201d Sand Canyon, \u201cthat no longer had a legal interest in and to the\u201d Deed of Trust, \u201cthe Notice of Default recorded on December 19, 2014\u201d was \u201calso invalid, illegal and fraudulent in nature,\u201d Id. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">3) <em>Improper Foreclosure Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">The third cause of action alleged that because the Notice of Default was \u201cinvalid, illegal and fraudulent, the foreclosure procedure commenced by ... Halliday ... should immediately cease and the Court order a Cancellation of Notice of Default be issued and recorded by ... Halliday.\u201d Id. at 9. The third cause of action also alleged that because the \u201cNote was accelerated with the filing of a Notice of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>fault on October 16, 2003, ... the statute of limitations ha[d] long-since expired making enforcement of the ... Note and the Defendant\u2019s ability to foreclose on the ... [Pjroperty well past the prescribed time allowed\u201d under Utah law. Id. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">4) <em>Demand for Proof of Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The fourth cause of action alleged that Utah law required defendants to \u201clocate and prove the existence of and their right to enforce\u201d the original Note. Id. at 11. The fourth cause of action further alleged that defendants \u201cha[d] previously admitted that they ha[d] no idea where the ... Note [wa]s.\u201d Id. at 12. The \u201closs of possession\u201d of the Note, the fourth cause of action alleged, \u201cwas the result of\u2019 Koyle\u2019s mortgage \u201cbe[ing] transferred at least six (6) times,\u201d and defendants were \u201ctherefore barred from enforcement of said instrument which includes proceeding with foreclosure against the ... [Property.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">5) <em>Statute of Limitations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">The fifth purported cause of action, entitled \u201cSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,\u201d alleged that under Utah law, \u201ca beneficiary of an \u2018instrument in writing1 securing any indebtedness may bring an action including foreclosure against the debtor within six (6) years,\u201d and \u201c[ajfter that time, an action is barred.\u201d Id. at 12-13. The fifth cause of action in turn alleged that \u201c[defendants ha[d] well exceeded the statute of limitations to enforce the obligation\u201d and thus \u201cthe foreclosure proceedings [we]re both invalid and fraudulent having exceeded the statute of limitations.\u201d Id. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">6) <em>Defendants\u2019 Cause of Action Against the Lender\u2019s Policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">The sixth purported cause of action alleged in the complaint was captioned \u201cDEFENDANT\u2019S [sic] HAVE A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE LENDER\u2019S POLICY.\u201d Id. at 14. It alleged that \u201c[a]n erroneous address was certified by Stewart Title Guaranty Company as the correct trust property address when in fact it was not.\u201d Id. at 14-15. It in turn alleged that \u201c[t]he legal beneficiary of the Deed of Trust and Plaintiff therefore ha[d] a claim for damages against the Lender\u2019s Policy issued by the underwriter, Stewart Title Guaranty Company, on February 21, 2003.\u201d Id. at 15. \u201cThis information,\u201d the complaint alleged, \u201c[wa]s being provided to the legal beneficiary for them to act upon \u2022in order to recover damages where they have exceeded their six (6) year statute of limitations\u201d under Utah law. Id. at 16. Lastly, the complaint alleged that \u201c[i]n the event the legal beneficiary fail[ed] to bring a claim for damages against Stewart Title Guaranty Company, Plaintiff w[ould] bring another action separate from this action in order to protect his interest in the trust property.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-13\">On April 8, 2015, Wells Fargo removed the complaint to federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b) \u201cbased on the diversity of citizenship of Parties,\u201d Dist. Ct. Docket No. 2 at 3. In particular, Wells Fargo\u2019s notice of removal indicated that Koyle was a Utah resident, Wells Fargo was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in South Dakota, and Sand Canyon was a California corporation with its principal place of business in California. Id. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-14\">On May 8, 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, which was subsequently converted by the magistrate judge to a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Koyle responded with a memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>randum in opposition and a cross motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">On March 8, 2016, the magistrate judge issued a memorandum decision and order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Koyle\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the magistrate judge concluded that by agreeing to and signing the 2005 Agreed Order, \u201cKoyle acknowledged the debt during his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy resulting in a renewal of the six year statute of limitations period\u201d under Utah law. Dist. Ct. Docket No. 52 at 7. The magistrate judge further concluded that \u201cKoyle\u2019s acknowledgment of the debt in conjunction with tolling under the bankruptcy court\u2019s automatic stay provision extended the statute of limitations period to six years after the bankruptcy was discharged to October 7, 2011.\u201d Id. at 11. In addition, the magistrate judge concluded that Wells Fargo\u2019s cancellation of the Notice of Default decelerated the debt and cancelled the Notice of Default. More specifically, the magistrate judge concluded that \u201c[t]he effect of the cancellation was that the acceleration was voided and the statute of limitations was tolled until the filing of a new Notice of Default.\u201d Id. at 15. Together, the magistrate judge held, these conclusions meant that \u201cKoyle\u2019s acknowledgment of the debt and bankruptcy tolling provisions extended the statute of limitations period on the October 16, 2003, Notice of Default to October 7, 2011,\u201d and, \u201c[a]s a result, the September 27, 2011 Cancellation was within the statute of limitations period and a new statute of limitations period began running upon issuance of the December 19, 2004, Notice of Default.\u201d Id. Finally, the magistrate judge concluded that even if the six-year statute of limitations period expired, \u201cWells Fargo could still foreclose on the deed of trust and Koyle [wa]s not entitled to any relief quieting title to the [Pjroperty in his name.\u201d Id. The magistrate judge explained that \u201cpublic policy\u201d supported this conclusion, given the fact that \u201cKoyle ha[d] frustrated the legal system and stymied foreclosure, despite his non-payment on the Note, through the pursuit of multiple court actions, bankruptcies, and other legal petitions.\u201d Id. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Koyle filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">In his appeal, Koyle challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. \u2018We review summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standard as the district court.\u201d Phila. Indem. Ins. Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 845 F.3d 1330, 1336 (10th Cir. 2017). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), a court \u201cshall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Further, we \u201creview legal questions de novo, including the district court\u2019s interpretation of\u2019 applicable state law. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., 845 F.3d at 1336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">\n<em>Was the Trustee\u2019s sale barred by the statute of limitations?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">Koyle begins by asserting that summary judgment should not have been granted because Wells Fargo\u2019s proposed sale of the Property was barred by the applicable Utah statute of limitations. In support, Koyle makes two separate arguments, each of which we address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">Koyle first asserts that Utah law required Wells Fargo to hold a trustee\u2019s sale of the Property within \u201csix years from the date the debt [was] due under the Note was accelerated.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 6. He in turn asserts that \u201cthe 6-year statute of limitations for all debt due under the Note started to run on October 16, 2003, the date the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Notice of Default accelerated all debt due under the Note.\u201d Id. at 7. He concedes, as the magistrate judge concluded, that the 2005 Agreed Order, which was filed in his second bankruptcy proceeding, \u201cwas a \u2018written acknowledgement [sic] of the debt,\u2019 ... that,\u201d under Utah law, \u201creset the start date for the running of the 6-year statute of limitation[s].\u201d Id. (citing Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-2-113(l)(b) (West 2008)). But he argues that, contrary to the conclusion reached by the magistrate judge, \u201c[t]he bankruptcy stay\u201d that was in effect during his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding \u201cwas lifted when [he] failed to make the July 19, 2005 payment\u201d that was called for in the 2005 Agreed Order. Id. at 10. In other words, he argues that \u201cany \u2018tolling\u2019 of the 6-year statute of limitations by [his second] Chapter 13 bankruptcy ended when the automatic stay was terminated as a result of [his] failure to make the July 19, 2006 payment.\u201d Id. And, he argues, \u201c[i]t is more than 6-years between July 19, 2005 and September 27, 2011.\u201d Id. \u201cAccordingly,\u201d he argues, \u201cany trustee\u2019s sale to foreclose on the Trust Deed, or any other action to enforce the Note, is barred by the 6-year statute of limitations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Thus, the question posed by Koyle is whether the magistrate judge, in granting summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo, correctly concluded that the statute of limitations was tolled during the entire period of Koyle\u2019s second Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding (i.e., until October 7, 2005) or whether, as now asserted by Koyle, his failure to make the scheduled July 19, 2005 payment on the Note effectively overrode the automatic stay associated with his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding and triggered the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">We need not resolve this question, however, because Koyle failed to adequately raise it below. To be sure, in the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d section of his cross motion for summary judgment, Koyle noted that the 2005 Agreed Order expressly provided that Koyle\u2019s failure to make timely payments would \u201c \u2018result in termination of the automatic stay without further notice or hearing.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dist. Ct. Docket No. 33 at 3 (quoting Ex. F thereto). But nowhere did Koyle argue in that motion or any other pleading that, his failure to make timely payments as anticipated by the 2005 Agreed Order resulted in the immediate and automatic termination of the automatic stay or, in turn, triggered the running of the statute of limitations. Instead, Koyle consistently argued in all of his district court pleadings that the statute of limitations began running again on October 7, 2005, the date that his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed. Dist. Ct. Docket No. 32 at 12 (memorandum in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss); Dist. Ct. Docket No. 33 at 12 (cross motion for summary judgment); Dist. Ct. Docket No. 43 at 6, 9 (supplemental brief in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in support of cross motion for summary judgment); Dist. Ct. Docket No. 44 at 6, 9 (corrected supplemental brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">During the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Koyle men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tioned in passing that he never made the scheduled July 2005 payment and that, as a result thereof, \u201cthe automatic stay was gone and they had six years ... to foreclose.\u201d Hearing Tr. at 15. Notably, Koyle made no mention of the fact that his argument derived from the language of the 2005 Agreed Order. Nor did Koyle file any type of supplemental pleading after the hearing discussing this new theory. Consequently, we conclude that the arguments made by Koyle during the summary judgment hearing were insufficient to adequately raise the issue and thereby preserve it for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">In sum, because defendants had no opportunity to respond in their pleadings to Koyle\u2019s new argument, nor was it ever squarely presented to, let alone ruled on by, the district court, we conclude that Koyle has forfeited this argument. See Varnell v. Dora Consol. Sch. Dist., 756 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2014); Lyons v. Jefferson Bank &amp; Trust, 994 F.2d 716, 721 (10th Cir. 1993) (\u201cWe have ... repeatedly stated that a party may not lose in the district court on one theory of the case, and then prevail on appeal on a different theory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Secondly, Koyle argues that \u201c[e]ven if the [magistrate judge\u2019s] analysis was correct, by April 20, 2015, the date of the new trustee\u2019s sale set by Wells Fargo, at a minimum the 6-year statute of limitations would have run on all installment payments that came due more than 6-years before April 20, 2015 (i.e., all installment payments due before April 20, 2009).\u201d Aplt. Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">As with his first argument, Koyle never made this argument in his district court pleadings and, thus, we conclude it is forfeited. Moreover, we note that the argument is irrelevant because there is no indication in the record that Wells Fargo has previously attempted, or is currently attempting, to seek a judgment against Koyle for the unpaid payments on the Note. Rather, Wells Fargo is seeking to foreclose on the Property and the applicable Utah statute of limitations does not preclude it from doing so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 57-1-34 (West 2016) (\u201cA person shall, within the period prescribed by law for the commencement of an action on an obligation secured by a trust deed ... commence an action to foreclose the trust deed.\u201d); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-2-309(2) (West 2008) (\u201cAn action may be brought within six years :.. upon any contract, obligation, or liability founded upon an instrument in writing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">\n<em>Did cancellation of the Notice of Default violate Wells Fargo\u2019s contractual duties?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">Koyle next argues that \u201cWells Fargo violated its contractual duties to [him] by unilaterally recording its September 27, 2011 Cancellation of Notice of Default.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 11. \u201cThis,\u201d Koyle argues, \u201coccurred eight years after the original Notice of Default was recorded on October 16, 2003, and over six years after [he] failed to make the July 19, 2005 payment.\u201d Id. at 11-12. \u201cThe Cancellation,\u201d he argues, \u201cwas filed without any payment by [him] to cure the default under the Note,\u201d and indeed \u201c[n]o payment had been made by [him] since the Notice of Default had been recorded eight years earlier.\u201d Id. at 12. Koyle in turn argues that \u201c[u]nder the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Note and Trust Deed, Wells Fargo could not file the cancelation [sic] unless [he] paid the debt due' under the Note.\u201d Id. In other words, he argues that \u201c[t]he Note and Trust Deed do not permit Wells Fargo to decelerate the debt unless the debt has been paid in full.\u201d Id. at 14-15. \u201cTherefore,\u201d Koyle argues, \u201cWells Fargo breached its contractual duty to Koyle under the Note and Trust deed by recording the Cancelation [sic].\u201d Id. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">We reject Koyle\u2019s arguments. To be sure, the Note and Deed of Trust carefully restricted the borrower\u2019s, i.e., Koyle\u2019s, right to reinstate after acceleration occurred; in particular, they required the borrower to cure the default. But nothing in either of those documents expressly or implicitly precluded the lender, i.e., Wells Fargo, from cancelling the acceleration. Moreover, as Wells Fargo notes in its appellate response brief, Koyle makes no attempt to challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling that Utah law does not bar Wells Fargo\u2019s cancellation of the 2003 Notice of Default. Aplee. Br. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Koyle also argues that \u201c[e]ven if Wells Fargo could unilaterally file a Cancellation under the Note and Trust Deed, without the default being cured, the law requires that the Cancellation be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u2019 after the Notice of Default was filed.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 16 (quoting Cooper v. Deseret Fed. Savings and Loan Assoc., 757 P.2d 483, 485 (Utah Ct. App. 1988)). And, Koyle argues, it was not reasonable for Wells Fargo in this case to \u201c[w]ait[ ] eight years to cancel the Notice of Default.\u201d Id. at 17. \u201cTherefore,\u201d he argues, \u201cthe Cancelation [sic] was unenforceable and did not stop the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">Because Koyle failed to present this argument to the district court, it is forfeited.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Varnell, 756 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">\n<em>Foreclosing on the Deed of Trust after the statute of limitations has run</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">In granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, the magistrate judge concluded, in an alternative holding, that \u201ceven if the statute of limitations to enforce the note ha[d] expired, Wells Fargo [wa]s still entitled to foreclose on the deed.\u201d App. at 58. In support of this conclusion, the magistrate judge distinguished between Well Fargo\u2019s ability to obtain a deficiency judgment against Koyle and its ability to foreclose on the Property. Id. at 57-58. The magistrate judge also concluded that \u201cpublic policy supported]\u201d that \u201cconclusion in this case\u201d because \u201cKoyle ha[d] frustrated the legal system and stymied foreclosure, despite his non-payment on the Note, through the pursuit of multiple court actions, bankruptcies, and other legal petitions.\u201d Id at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Although Koyle challenges the alternative holding in his appeal, we need not address his arguments for the simple reason that he has failed to establish that the statute of limitations has run as to him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">Both Koyle and defendants, citing language from the Note, request an award of fees. We reject Koyle\u2019s request but grant defendants\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\n<em>Koyle\u2019s request for fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Koyle argues that he \u201cshould be awarded his attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the district court proceedings below and on , appeal.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 22. In support, Koyle asserts that \u201c[u]nder the Note, [he] is liable to Wells Fargo for all costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Wells Fargo in \u2018enforcing this Note.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 21 (quoting App. at 11). He in turn asserts that \u201c[u]nder Utah Code \u00a7 78B-5-826, since Wells Fargo may recover its attorney\u2019s fees from [him] for successfully enforcing the Note, [he] may also recover his attorney\u2019s fees from Wells Fargo for successfully defending against enforcement of the Note.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. at 21-22.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Koyle\u2019s arguments fail, however, because he has not established that the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 request for fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Defendants argue that, under the terms of the Note, they are entitled to an award of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees. Aplee. Br. at 30. Specifically, they cite to Paragraph 7(E) of the Note, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-9\">If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ago-dedup-0\">App. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">We agree with defendants. The Second Notice that was filed by trustee Halliday on December 19,2014, \u201cdeclare[d] all sums secured\u201d by the Note and Deed of Trust \u201cimmediately due and payable.\u201d Dist. Ct. Docket No. 15, Ex. 4 at 1. Halliday in turn effectively sought to enforce the Note by scheduling a trustee\u2019s sale of the Property. Koyle attempted to stop the foreclosure by initiating this action. By defending against this action, defendants have, in essence, incurred \u201ccosts and expenses in enforcing th[e] Note,\u201d and thus are entitled to an award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d as authorized by Paragraph 7(E) of the Note. We therefore direct defendants to submit, within thirty days of the date of this Order and Judgment, a statement of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for which they seek reimbursement. Koyle shall then have thirty days from the date defendants submit their statement to file any objections to defendants\u2019 requested fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">Koyle\u2019s amended motion to supplement the record is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Defendants shall file, within thirty days of the date of this Order and Judgment, a statement of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Koyle shall have thirty days from the date defendants file their statement of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to file any written objections to defendants\u2019 requested fees and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1034-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. .It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed.

Because Koyle\u2019s claims in this case challenge only Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to foreclose on the Property, it is important to emphasize that we are not addressing Wells Fargo's ability to seek a personal judgment against Koyle for any unpaid balance on the Note. In other words, nothing in this decision is intended or should be interpreted as precluding Wells Fargo from seeking such relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"ag2-dedup-0\">. We note, in passing that the Utah cases cited by Koyle in support of the argument have nothing to do with the ability of a lender to cancel acceleration. Rather, they address the time in which a lender may accelerate after a default. And, in doing so, they rely on the \"principle of good faith and fair dealing\u201d in reaching their conclusions. Cottage Capital, LLC v. Red Ledges Land Dev., 345 P.3d 642, 648 (Utah 2015).
