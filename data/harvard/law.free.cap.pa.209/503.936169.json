After the death of the husband, the wife denied the validity of her assignment, and an issue was framed between her as plaintiff and the assignee as defendant to determine the ownership of the policy. A notary who was present at the execution, but who was not shown to have been in any way the agent or representative of the assignee, stated that he explained to her that she was transferring her right to the assignee, and that her manner and responses indicated that she fully understood what was being done. A daughter of the plaintiff testified that she was present at the execution of the assignment, and that as her mother could not speak English, she translated to her all the notary said, and told him what her mother said in reply. Neither daughter nor mother, however, were permitted to testify as to what was said between them in German, the notary not understanding that language. <em>Held, </em>that the daughter was the only witness in contradiction of the notary\u2019s clear statement, and of the plain words of the writing, and that the mother could not be made a second witness in the manner proposed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b533-8\">In the above case an offer was made to prove that some months after the execution of the assignment the notary called on the plaintiff, and in the presence of her family requested a ratification of the assignment; that when in reading the assignment he came to the name of the assignee, she became excited and angry and said : \u201c He deceived me before ; if you had read that name to me, I would have known something was wrong, and I would not have signed the paper ; \u201d that she left the room while the notary was reading, and that he said he was very sorry, and never would forgive himself for what he had done. <em>Held, </em>that the offer was insufficient to establish fraud in procuring the original transfer, and that the words of the notary were not in any way corroborative of the single witness against the validity of the assignment.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b533-9\">Argued May 18, 1903.

The witness replied to her daughter in German, \u201c I need no interest, I have the money I need. You can let it stand.\u201d Her daughter Bertha then said something to Mr. Heitshu in English, which the witness did notunderstand; then Mr. Pleitshu said, \u201c What' your daughter said is true.

She conducted him to the dining room and called her mother, Sarah Pioso, from the kitchen to the dining room, and that no one but her mother, Mr. Heitshu and herself were present; that Mr. Heitshu had not come with her father ; that Mr. Heitshu said to her in English that he came up because he had the insurance papers in his possession and the interest was due the mother; he wanted to know whether the mother wanted the interest. The daughter then communicated this in German to her mother, who answered her in German that she was in no need of money now and preferred to let it stand with the principal. That she then translated this to Mr. Heitshu, who said if that was the case she was to sign the papers he had. That he did not read the papers to them, and that she, the witness, should tell her mother that what he had said was the truth, and that she need not fear to sign her name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>This to be followed by proof by Sarah Pioso, that Sarah Pioso executed the paper C.

Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">This was a feigned issue to determine the ownership of a policy of insurance on the life of Moses Pioso, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and the right to a fund that had been paid into court by the New York Life Insurance Company after his death. The plaintiff was the beneficiary named in the policy if she survived her husband, and the case turned on the validity of an assignment made by her nearly four years before her husband\u2019s death to one of his creditors. Both husband and wife joined in the assignment, which was \u201c made as collateral security for the payment of indebtedness to the said Uriah Bitzer, now and hereafter to accrue to him, by reason of his indorsement of the notes of M. Pioso &amp; Sons.\u201d Mr. Bitzer paid three annual premiums that became due after the assignment to him, and he assigned the' policy to his wife, the defendant in the issue, in part payment of a debt largely in excess of the amount of the policy, for money he had borrowed from her to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>notes lie had indorsed for Pioso &amp; Sons. The specifications of error relate to the refusal of the court to admit certain testimony offered by the plaintiff, and the direction to the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The execution and acknowledgment of the writing by the plaintiff were not disputed. The notary who took the acknowledgment testified that Moses .Pioso, the insured, called at his office and acknowledged the assignment, and that they went together to his home; that he there explained to the plaintiff the character of the assignment and told her that she was transferring all her right, title and interest in the policy to Mr. Bitzer; that her manner and her responses indicated that she fully understood what was being done, and that she had expected him to come. The plaintiff attempted to nullify and set the assignment aside onvthe ground of fraud in its procurement. Her daughter, called in her behalf, testified that the notary who took the acknowledgment called at the house alone, asked for her mother, and stated that he had brought papers sent by the insurance company, and that his purpose in calling was to know whether she wanted interest on the money ; that she acted as interpreter, because her mother could not speak English and understood it very imperfectly ; that she translated to her mother all the notary said and told him what her mother said in reply, which was to the effect that she had no need of the money and preferred letting the interest remain with the principal. She was allowed to testify fully as to what took place between her and the notary, what he said to her, and what she said to him in reply in translating for her mother. She was not, however, permitted to state what she had said in German to her mother and what her mother had said in German to her. Nor was the plaintiff allowed to testify to statements she had made in German to her daughter in the presence of the notary who did not understand the language spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This testimony was offered to meet the requirements of the rule that two witnesses or one witness and corroborating circumstances are necessary to warrant the setting aside of a written instrument. The plaintiff\u2019s daughter was acting for her and it was not competent to show what she said to her mother in a language not understood by the notary. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tiff did not understand what the' notary said, and she was no more competent to testify to it than if she had not been present. But had this testimony been admissible a second witness could not have been made or corroboration shown in this way. If it be assumed that the notary was the agent of Mr. Bitzer, and of this there is no evidence whatever, the important inquiry relates to what he said at the time. As to this there was only one witness, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, in contradiction of the notary\u2019s clear statement and of the plain words of the writing. These offers would not, if established, have made out the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The other offers of testimony overruled were to prove that eight months after the assignment of the policy the notary at the instance of the defendant called on the plaintiff for the purpose of obtaining a ratification or re-execution of the assignment ; that when in reading the assignment he came to the name Bitzer she became excited and angry and said: \u201cYou deceived me before; if you had read the name Bitzer to me, 1 would have known something was wrong, and I would not have signed the paper; \u201d that she left the room while the notary was reading, and that he said he was very sorrj- and never would forgive himself for what he had done. These offers were rejected on the ground that the testimony was insufficient to establish fraud in procuring the original transfer. They would have contradicted the testimony of the notary only as to his statement that he had mentioned the name of Mr. Bitzer when explaining the nature of the assignment. But if they had bem contradictory of all that he said and would have overthrown his testimony completely, they would have been unavailing, b - cause the case would have stood with the writing on one sid \u2022 and the testimony of a single witness on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Nor would the testimony have had appreciable weight as tending to show an admission by the notary which corroborate 1 the plaintiff\u2019s witness. Unless it was of value as corroboration, it was of no value at all. The circumstances connected wit'the visit of the notary were set out in the offers and ma le part of them. The visit was made after a dispute had aris\" concerning the policy. There was nothing clandestine or underhand about it. One of the plaintiff\u2019s sons, at the request of the notary, went with him, and explained the object of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>visit. Her husband, her son, three of her daughters, and her son-in-law were in the room. On this visit as in all of his connection with the case the notary appears to have acted with entire fairness, and his expression of regret that he had done anything in the matter was entirely consistent with his honesty of intent and purpose. It is inconceivable that if he had deceived her, he would have gone in the most public manner and in the presence of all of her family and after a dispute had arisen asked her to reaffirm the acknowledgment. The substance of her accusation was not that he had made any misstatement but that he had not read the assignment and that she did not know that Mr. Bitzer was to get the policy, and to this his expression of regret related. This testimony would have been insufficient to raise a suspicion of fraud, much less to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The rules of evidence which the court correctly applied in the case have been so repeatedly stated that it is unnecessary to do more than briefly refer to them. Where parties without fraud or mistake have put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing not only the best but the only evidence of their agreement. While parol evidence is admissible to prove fraud and mistake, it is insufficient for thatpurpose unless clear, precise and indubitable. Testimony in contradiction of a written agreement amounts to nothing unless it is sufficient to warrant a chancellor in reforming it. In Phillips v. Meily, 106 Pa. 536, it was said : \u201cIt is only where a chancellor would reform the instrument that parol evidence is admissible to contradict it. It is true, under our practice in Pennsylvania, it is accomplished under common-law forms. But the fact remains that the defense set up is purely equitable, and the judge ought not to submit the case to the jury unless the evidence is such that he would feel himself bound as a chancellor to reform the instrument. With our modification of the English rule, nowtoo firmly imbedded in our system to be disturbed, and our act of assembly which makes every defendant a competent witness, the principle above stated is about all that is left to preserve the sanctity and force of an instrument of writing whether that instrument be a deed, which is the evidence of a man\u2019s title to his home, or an obligation for the payment of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
