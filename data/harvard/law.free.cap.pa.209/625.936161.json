The forfeiture clause is inserted for his benefit and on a default he ought to have asserted his rights under it: Brown v. Vandergrift, 80 Pa. 142; Galey v. Kellerman, 123 Pa. 491; Springer v.

Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The language of the agreement is that the party of the first part (plaintiff) \u201c agrees to sell,\u201d but there is no agreement of the other party to buy, and any obligation to do so is negatived by the last sentence, \u201c If the second party accepts the coal . ... he also agrees to take the McKee farm,\u201d etc. The vendor was to make a deed \u201c on fifty days\u2019 notice in writing by the party of the second part,\u201d but there was no obligation to give such notice. The agreement ivas clearly an option and time was of its essence: McMillan v. Phila. Co., 159 Pa. 142; Neill v. Hitchman, 201 Pa. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The duration of the option is somewhat uncertain, but as it was provided that a failure to make the first payment within fifty days from the date should render the agreement void, that was the apparent limit of the time for acceptance. It is admitted that no payment was ever made and no notice of acceptance given up to the filing of this bill, nearly two years and a half after the date of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Decree affirmed at costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
