On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion when it denied his petition for certification to appeal from the habeas court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, wherein he\n   alleged that (1) his counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at trial provided ineffective assistance by failing to take curative measures to remedy prosecutorial impropriety that occurred during closing arguments, and (2) his counsel on direct appeal provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise a claim of prosecutorial impropriety. We conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petition for certification to appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by this court on direct appeal, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"On September 3, 2004, police officers from the New Britain and Waterbury police departments, aided by two United States marshals, executed an arrest warrant for the [petitioner] at an efficiency apartment at 636 Riverside Avenue in Waterbury. The officers entered the apartment and found the [petitioner] sitting on the couch in the living room, which was located directly in front of the door, and the [petitioner's] brother, Josue Williams, lying on the floor next to the couch. The [petitioner] was arrested and handcuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Detective Mark Santopietro removed the cushions from the couch where the [petitioner] had been sitting and discovered a pistol. Santopietro immediately notified the other officers of the presence of a firearm. Shortly after Santopietro's discovery, Sergeant Harold Setzer noticed a box of what he believed to be ammunition. Concerned that there might be other individuals in the apartment, Setzer moved to do a protective sweep of the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Setzer walked six to eight feet from where the [petitioner] was located to a kitchen counter. At the counter, he saw Styrofoam cups filled with numerous bags of a substance he believed to be heroin. He next moved to the bedroom, where he opened a closet door and saw\n   narcotics packaging and a narcotics sifter. Setzer did not seize any of the items he discovered but instead left them in place for the forensic staff. Setzer's entire sweep took less than one minute.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058748\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/110/329/#p331\">\n    110 Conn.App. 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331-32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20A.2d%20878\">\n    954 A.2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner subsequently was convicted following a jury trial of possession of\n   narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b), and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217.

In his second amended petition filed at the habeas trial on April 2, 2015, the petitioner claimed, inter alia, that the acts and omissions of counsel at trial denied him his right to effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he alleged that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge, inter alia, improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments.

Specifically, the petitioner cites comments in which the prosecutor contrasted the credibility of Setzer and Josue. He takes issue with the prosecutor's description of Setzer as \"a man with twelve years narcotics experience, who doesn't know this [petitioner], doesn't know his brother, has never seen them before, has no interest in this case and was such a trusted person he was a guard on Air Force One for President Reagan.\" The petitioner argues that through this statement the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the credibility of Setzer by asserting that he was a trustworthy person because he was a guard on Air Force One for President Reagan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the claim of prosecutorial impropriety regarding the statements\n   about Josue was not explicit\n   in the petitioner's appellate brief, he clarified at oral argument before this court the nature of his claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner argues the following statements made about Josue during rebuttal were improper: \"Then you have a two time convicted felon out to protect his brother ... who knows full well there was no evidence against him but now he can say other things. Now he can say [the drugs are] his because he knows he won't be prosecuted and he shouldn't be prosecuted. There is no true evidence, I submit to you, against Josue.\" The petitioner claims that these statements offered information to the jury not in evidence that there was \"no evidence\" or \"no true evidence\" against Josue. Additionally, he claims that the prosecutor improperly sought to influence the jury by contrasting Josue's motives and testimony with Setzer's impressive credentials rather than contrasting his motives and testimony to the officers as a group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before addressing the petitioner's claim, we set forth the standard of review and law governing claims of prosecutorial impropriety. \"[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that\n   may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sinvil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5302664\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/270/516/#p522\">\n    270 Conn. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522-23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=853%20A.2d%20105\">\n    853 A.2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[P]rosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments.... When making closing arguments to the jury, [however] [c]ounsel must be allowed ... generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument.... Thus, as the state's advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state's case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.... Moreover, [i]t does not follow ... that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper.... The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury's attention from the facts of the case. [The prosecutor] is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent....

Although Setzer did not testify, nor did\n   anyone else, to the qualifications required for an assignment to guard Air Force One and the president, it is a reasonable inference that such a position requires a degree of trustworthiness. The prosecutor's statements summarized the evidence and asked the jury to make a reasonable inference therefrom.

Consequently, the habeas court correctly concluded that counsel was not ineffective at trial for failing to challenge these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The petitioner also argues that the prosecutor improperly introduced facts not in evidence. Essentially, he contends that when the prosecutor stated that there was \"no evidence\" or \"no true evidence\" against Josue, he effectively conveyed that the court had dismissed the charges against Josue because there was no evidence against him although the only evidence presented was that the charges against Josue had been dismissed. The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a written statement to police read into evidence by the clerk, the petitioner stated that his address was 691 Osgood Avenue, New Britain. He stated that on\n   September 3, 2004, \"I went out on the back porch of where I had been staying at [636] Riverside Avenue, Apartment 2B, in Waterbury. The next thing I knew was that the cops were yelling at me. I went back into [my]\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   apartment and the cops smashed in the front door of the apartment.\" The petitioner also stated, \"I have been staying in this apartment with a girl named Maria Gonzales. I have been staying with Maria for about three weeks ever since I met her at the Club Blu in Hartford. I knew that I had warrants in New Britain and I wanted to stay out of New Britain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Josue's testimony at trial conflicted with the petitioner's written statement. Josue testified, inter alia, that he, Josue, was married but had been having a romantic or sexual relationship with Gonzales since meeting her at Club Blu several weeks\n   before the date in question and that the drugs were his and Gonzales'. He also testified that the petitioner had been living with him at 691 Osgood Avenue in New Britain, not at the Waterbury apartment, that the petitioner did not know about the drugs, was not in a relationship with Gonzales, and that the petitioner only came to the apartment with him. Additionally, he testified that, contrary to Setzer's testimony, law enforcement officers did not find the drugs on the kitchen counter but in a bedroom. Josue also testified that law enforcement asked him to \"pin\" the drugs on the petitioner so that Josue could avoid prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The state challenged Josue's credibility during cross-examination. Josue admitted that he had two prior felony convictions and that he loved his brother, that he did not want to see anything happen to him, and that he wanted to protect him. Additionally, Josue testified that the charges against him in a related case concerning\n   the drugs found in the apartment had been dismissed and that his attorney had told him that the charges would not come back against him. He later equivocated and testified that his attorney was uncertain about whether the charges could come back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The prosecutor stated the following, inter alia, about Josue during rebuttal summation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Furthermore, [Josue] knows nothing can happen to him because, as he said, the charges were dismissed and he admitted, he didn't want to do it, but he reluctantly admitted [his attorney] told him nothing could happen to him. And I submit to you the charges against Josue were dismissed because there was no evidence [that] pointed to Josue. He didn't live there for three weeks. This [petitioner] lived there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"But contrast the credibility of Josue, a man who is a two-time convicted felon, has no reason to believe he'll be charged in this case because none of the evidence points to him, loves and protects-wants to protect his brother and acknowledges he doesn't want anything to happen to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Then you have the two-time convicted felon out to protect his brother, who [would rather] not see anything happen to his brother, who knows full well there was no evidence against him but now he can say other things. Now he can say it's his because he knows he won't be prosecuted and he shouldn't be prosecuted. There's no true evidence, I submit to you, against Josue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"A prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record....

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The petitioner's argument requires one to restrictively isolate the following statements made by the prosecutor: \"And I submit to you the charges against Josue were dismissed because there was no evidence [that] pointed to Josue.... Then you have the two-time convicted felon ... who knows full well there was no evidence against him .... There's no true evidence, I submit to you, against Josue.\" Once isolated, the argument would proceed that either the prosecutor was providing unsworn testimony that there was no evidence against Josue or that, because the charges were dismissed, there was no evidence against him. The former would be improper unsworn testimony; the latter would improperly ask the jury to speculate because there are multiple reasons that criminal charges can be dismissed. See Practice Book \u00a7 41-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This overly constrains the prosecutor's statements and removes them from the larger context of his rebuttal summation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There was ample, and conflicting, evidence in the record concerning Josue leading up to and after law enforcement's entry into the apartment on September 9, 2004, to weigh his potential exposure to criminal liability. Reading the prosecutor's statements about Josue in the full context of the state's rebuttal, the prosecutor summarized the available evidence and asked the jury to draw reasonable inferences from that evidence. Specifically, the prosecutor asked the jury to conclude, based on the evidence\n   presented that conflicted with Josue's testimony, that there was no evidence against Josue and that is why the charges against him were dismissed. Accordingly, the prosecutor's statements regarding Josue were not improper and, consequently, counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel at trial by not challenging such statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because the challenged statements of the prosecutor were not improper, there was no prosecutorial impropriety. Curative actions by counsel at trial were not required, and his actions at trial were not deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court improperly denied his petition for certification to appeal because there was merit to his claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance on direct appeal by failing to raise a claim of prosecutorial impropriety. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our standard of review for this claim is similar to the standard set forth in part I of this opinion, with the exception of the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . \"In regard\n   to the second prong, our Supreme Court distinguished the standards of review for claims of ineffective trial counsel and ineffective appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960705\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/707/#p721\">\n    286 Conn. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    946 A.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied sub nom.\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lantz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20975\">\n    555 U.S. 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20481\">\n    129 S.Ct. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20336\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).
