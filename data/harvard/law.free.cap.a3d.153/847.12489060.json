We are first asked to determine whether the Police Department, the Club, and an adjoining parking lot's owner and operator may be liable for actions prior to the shooting. For a variety of reasons described below, we affirm the trial court's rulings in favor of those appellees. We are then asked to determine whether the trial court erred in granting judgment in favor of the four police officers who fired their guns at the shooter. We affirm the trial court's finding that no reasonable juror could find that the officers were grossly negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 9, 2011, the BPD was called to the Select Lounge nightclub, located on Baltimore City's North Paca\n   Street, after several fights had broken out inside the nightclub. On arrival, Major Marc Partee decided to close the club early and send its patrons home. Police set up a perimeter around the club and an adjacent parking lot frequently used by guests of, although not owned by, the Select Lounge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the closing, Jazzmin Graves, a patron of the Select Lounge, was walking across the parking lot when she was hit by a car pulling out of the lot. Although Ms. Graves was not harmed, an argument\n   erupted between occupants of the car and Ms. Graves and her friends. Because the car was blocking traffic, a man in dark clothing-specifically in black jeans, hat, boots, and a black \"hoodie\" sweatshirt-approached the group. The man told the two groups to stop arguing and to leave the parking lot. The car drove off the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Another patron, later identified as Sean Gamble, however, took exception to the dark-clothed man's actions. Gamble \"got up in\" the dark-clothed man's face and expressed his view that the man shouldn't be \"putting [his] hands on a female.\" The dark-clothed man told Gamble to \"mind your own fucking business.\" While they argued, another man, later identified as Darrell \"Rico\" Baker, sucker-punched the dark-clothed man. More men joined the fray, knocking the dark-clothed man to the ground and began \"stomping[,] kicking[,] and punching\" him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The dark-clothed man then pulled and fired a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Harry Pawley testified that the dark-clothed man fired a few shots, paused briefly, and then resumed shooting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q: When did you withdraw your service weapon?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A: I was putting my mace away, I heard gunshots. I looked up, more gunshots. I saw an individual on the ground shooting and that's at which time I withdrew my weapon and fired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q: When you witnessed [the dark-clothed man] shooting, he was laying on his back shooting up into the air, wasn't he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A: No. He was laying on his back shooting, like, his arm moving from side to side, discharging.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Harry Dodge testified that, after hearing initial shots, he looked up and saw the dark-clothed man fire shots toward Franklin Street, a cross street of North Paca:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: Was the individual firing his weapon ... into the air indiscriminately?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: He was firing towards Franklin Street indiscriminately with his arm parallel to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: It wasn't into the air?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A: Not the second time he started shooting, no. The first time he started shooting, I don't recall which direction he was firing. The second time he began firing again, he was indiscriminately [shooting] towards Franklin street where a group of people were.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Officer Latora Craig testified that she heard several initial shots, saw the men who had attacked the dark-clothed man begin to run, and saw that the dark-clothed man began to fire again indiscriminately:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: ... And the shots that were fired by that person that you saw they were all going towards Franklin Street. Correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: They were going in different directions, he had no aim. Some were straight up, some were down. They were back-and-forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Officer Craig further testified that the initial shots \"went past [her] legs and [her] feet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Officer Toyia Williams testified that she heard rapid gunfire nearby, observed about 20 to 30 people between her and the shooter, identified a muzzle flash from the shooter's gun, and then fired her weapon at the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both the dark-clothed man and Sean Gamble were fatally wounded. Jazzmin Graves and two other patrons, Katrina Harris and Jamie Jordan, suffered minor gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The dark-clothed man was later identified as BPD Officer William Torbit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Several lawsuits were filed and consolidated in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Plaintiffs were Katrina Harris, Jazzmine Graves, Jamie Jordan, the Estate of William Torbit, and the Estate of Sean Gamble. Defendants were the Select Lounge, its owner and manager,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parking lot owner Shell Realty, Inc., the parking lot operator PMS Parking, Inc., the BPD, former Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld, Major Partee, Lieutenant Charles Clayton (Torbit's partner), and BPD Officers Pawley, Dodge, Craig, and Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Claims against Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD were dismissed. Summary judgment was entered in favor of Select. A jury trial commenced regarding the remaining claims but the trial court, at the conclusion of the plaintiffs' case, granted motions for judgment in favor of the remaining defendants. The plaintiffs noted this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We have reorganized the appellate issues according to their procedural posture. Pursuant to that organization, Appellants first argue that the trial court erred in granting Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD's motions to dismiss. Next, they argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Select. Finally, they argue the trial court erred in granting motions for judgment in favor of PMS, Shell, Major Partee, Lieutenant Clayton, and the four police officers who fired their guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motions To Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Appellants assert the trial court erred in dismissing their tort claims against Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD. Appellants argue that Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD owed a duty to protect the public from harm. That duty, they claim, arises out of a special relationship between the\n   public, the BPD, and Commissioner Bealefeld. Appellees argued below and in this Court that Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD owed no duty of care to Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The standard of review of a grant of a motion to dismiss is \"whether the trial court was legally correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Litz v.

Thus, Appellants can recover against Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD only if they plead and prove the existence of a special relationship. \"[F]or a special relationship between police officer and victim to be found, [a plaintiff] must [show] that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   victim or a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim's\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   reliance upon the police protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Fried v.

They try to bridge that gap by alleging that Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD failed to act. Thus, Katrina Harris and Jazzmin Graves alleged that Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD \"\n   <em>\n    fail[ed]\n   </em>\n   to establish and/or implement adequate policies, rules and/or guidelines, and/or adequately train and/or prepare its ... employees in operational realities ... relating to ... crowd control.\" Sean Gamble similarly alleged that Commissioner Bealefeld \"\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   ... to use proper care in selecting, supervising, training, and or retaining their employees.\" But failure to act, by definition, cannot satisfy the requirement of an \"affirmative act.\" As a result, because there was no affirmative act to create such a relationship, no special relationship existed between Commissioner Bealefeld and Appellants nor between the BPD and Appellants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently,\n   Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD owed Appellants no duty of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Appellants have not provided allegations and facts that, if proven, would be sufficient to afford relief,\n   we hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing claims against Commissioner Bealefeld and the BPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Select because Select violated a duty of care owed to nightclub patrons. Appellants claim that Select's knowledge of criminal activity in the neighborhood, over-promotion, allowance of overcrowding, and lack of security created a dangerous condition that was the proximate cause of Appellants' injuries. Select disputes that it owed a duty of care but also argues that, even if it did and violated that duty, the police shooting was a superseding cause of Appellants' harm. The trial court found that \"even if [the] Court is to consider [Select] a tortfeasor, [the] ensuing chain of events\n   was not foreseeable.\" Moreover, \"the end result of a fatal police shooting was clearly not foreseeable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A trial court \"shall enter [summary] judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Md. Rule 2-501(f). We apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review in determining whether the trial court correctly entered summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Roy v.

That is because an intervening act-Torbit's firing of his gun-broke the causal link between any action by Select and Appellants' injuries. A \"defendant's negligence is not deemed the proximate cause of the injury, when the connection is thus actually broken by a responsible intervening cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Sindler v.

Even if Select knew of crime in the area, knew that the nightclub was overcrowded, knew that the nightclub was over-promoted, and failed to hire adequate security, it could not foresee that Torbit, a plainclothes BPD officer, would fire his weapon in a nearby parking lot. Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Torbit firing his gun was an intervening force and superseding cause, we hold that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in Select's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

We take the Appellees separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    i. Major Partee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Appellants contend Major Partee was grossly negligent in the manner in which he managed the nightclub's early closing. They produced an expert witness, Dr. Tyrone Powers, who testified: (1) that a supervising officer has a duty to give orders and make sure those orders are carried out; (2) that, in his opinion, no perimeter was set up outside the club and; (3) that Major Partee failed to give adequate instruction to Officer Torbit as a plainclothes police officer. Appellants argue that each of these failures violated the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The question here, however, is not whether Major Partee violated a standard of care, but rather whether a reasonable juror could conclude that Major Partee's conduct strayed so grossly from the ordinary standard of care as to support a finding of utter indifference to the rights of others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568703\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/157/#p187\">\n    402 Md. at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568703\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/157/#p187\">\n    935 A.2d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We necessarily focus, therefore, on whether, under the circumstances, Major Partee's actions showed utter disregard for the safety and rights of others. We affirm the trial court's finding that Appellants' did not present sufficient evidence to support any inference of\n   gross negligence. Major Partee may have failed to properly command his subordinate police officers, but there was no evidence that he didn't instruct them because he didn't care. He may have failed to set up a perimeter, but there was no evidence that this failure amounted to gross disregard for the lives of Appellants. He may not have adequately instructed Officer Torbit on how to behave while Torbit was in plainclothes, but there is no evidence that this was because he had reckless disregard for Torbit's safety. Thus, even if we were to accept Appellants' factual assertions that Major Partee failed to act in these\n   several respects, we agree with the trial court that no reasonable juror could find his conduct constituted gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Appellants make an incomplete argument that Major Partee violated their constitutional rights-protected by Articles 16\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 25\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Maryland Declaration of Rights-against \"cruel and unusual pains and penalties\" and \"cruel or unusual punishments.\" Maryland courts have historically treated these provisions as providing the same protection as the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

In support of this contention, Appellants insist that a jury could have decided that the police officers' alleged violation of police training and policy, and decision to fire their guns, amounted to gross negligence. Appellees generally argue that the officers acted reasonably in response to an active shooter situation. The trial court found that appropriate deference must be given to police-especially when they are making \"difficult and extremely quick decisions in split second circumstances of high stress and of an emergency nature\"-and therefore entered judgment in favor of the four police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland has, following United States Supreme Court precedent, explained that excessive force claims against police officers are to be analyzed under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

Appellants allege that Lieutenant Clayton \"abandoned Officer Torbit almost immediately once [Clayton and Torbit] entered the nightclub\" and thus failed to supervise his partner, knowing that Torbit was in plainclothes. As the trial court explained, however, \"there was no evidence that it was against any police procedure for Officer Torbit to work alone.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Appellants' further argue that the trial court failed to consider the individual reasonableness of each police officer in firing their weapons. In support, Appellants point to the fact that several other police officers on the scene did not fire their weapons. This argument is unavailing. As the trial court explained, even if other police officers didn't fire their weapons, \"what each of the other officers independently perceived in those few moments\" has no bearing on the question of the reasonableness of these four officers. We agree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
