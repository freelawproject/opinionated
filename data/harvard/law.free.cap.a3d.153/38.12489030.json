We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts reasonably could have been found by the jury. On May 10, 2012, the defendant arranged to purchase $6150 worth of cocaine from the victim, David Caban. Caban lived at 127 Proctor Street in Waterbury with his girlfriend, Lourdes Santana, and Santana's mother. On May 12, 2012, at approximately 9 p.m., the\n   victim was inside his home with his close friend and cousin, Angelo Caban (Angelo). Santana and her mother also were present in the home. Another friend, Anthony Jackson, was sitting in a chair on the front porch of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 9:30 p.m., the defendant, accompanied by his close friend, Solomon Taylor, drove in a white Mitsubishi Gallant (vehicle), which was owned by Taylor's girlfriend, Alexia Bates, to the home of the victim to purchase the cocaine. The defendant parked the vehicle directly in front of the house so that the passenger's side of the vehicle was facing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim left the house and approached the vehicle. The victim momentarily leaned into the rear passenger's side of the vehicle, and then returned to the inside of his house, where he went into his bedroom. When the victim walked by Angelo as he again exited the house to return to the vehicle, he stated: \"Cuz, stand right here and make sure ... I'm good.\" Angelo proceeded to stand on the steps outside of the house, where he talked with Jackson. As the victim approached the vehicle, he was carrying the crack cocaine in a brown paper bag, which was tucked in his waistband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim again leaned into the rear passenger's side of the vehicle, with his feet hanging out. Shortly thereafter, a struggle began between the victim and the occupants of the vehicle. One of the occupants of the vehicle had a revolver, and the victim was attempting to hold his arm in an effort to avoid being shot; that occupant then fired a shot through the roof of the vehicle. After hearing the shot, both Angelo and Jackson ran toward the vehicle, but, by the time they reached it, more shots had been fired, and the victim had been hit twice, once in the arm and once in the head. As a\n   result of his injuries, the victim was slumped over with his body only partially inside the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jackson then began striking the front passenger's side window of the vehicle\n   with a child's Razor scooter that he found near the house. After breaking the window, Jackson fought with the man in the passenger's seat. Meanwhile, Angelo tried to pull the victim out of the vehicle, but, as he did so, more shots were fired. Jackson then retreated from the immediate area by jumping over a fence and hiding behind a building. Angelo then went to the driver's side of the vehicle, where he encountered the defendant, who was pointing a revolver directly at him. The barrel of the revolver was within arm's reach of Angelo's face. Taylor then yelled to the defendant to \"forget it,\" and both men reentered the vehicle and drove away with the rear passenger's side door open and the victim only partially inside the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Angelo retrieved his car keys from inside the house, and he and Santana drove after the defendant and Taylor. Within approximately one quarter of a mile, Angelo and Santana saw the victim's body in the street. Angelo stopped the car, and Santana called for help. Santana also dialed the victim's cell phone number. When someone answered her call, she began yelling into the phone, and the person on the other end hung up. The victim was transported to Saint Mary's Hospital, where he died from his wounds. The victim had approximately $40 in cash on his person when he was transported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meanwhile, the defendant drove to the home of Taylor's girlfriend, Alexia Bates. Upon his arrival, the defendant went upstairs into Bates' apartment and proceeded to go into the bathroom to treat a gunshot wound to\n   his hand, which he had suffered during the struggle with the victim. Taylor, who appeared frantic as he was pacing back and forth, encountered Bates and her roommate in the roommate's bedroom. Taylor then asked Bates to go into her bedroom, which she did. Bates could see blood on Taylor's boxer shorts, which later DNA analysis determined belonged to the victim. While they were in Bates' bedroom, a red slide-style cell phone in Taylor's possession began to ring. When Taylor answered the phone, Bates heard a woman screaming on the other end. Taylor quickly hung up the phone; he did not appear to know who was calling him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Taylor then ordered Bates to go to her vehicle to retrieve the revolver. Bates went to the vehicle, where she saw many different sized pieces of crack cocaine mixed with blood and glass on the floor. She also saw blood on the door, on the front seat, in the middle console, on the dashboard where the airbag is contained, and in the back passenger's seat. She saw broken glass on the floor and on the front seat, and bullet holes in the roof. Bates also discovered the revolver, which she then brought upstairs to Taylor, who put it in his waistband. Taylor then told Bates to gather cleaning supplies to clean the vehicle; Bates grabbed a bucket that she filled with water and \"cleaning stuff,\" \"sponges, rags ... [and] Clorox spray.\" She also used a bottle of Febreze that already was in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Bates and Taylor cleaned the vehicle, Taylor told her that \"\n   <em>\n    they were in New Britain, and they started shooting up the car trying to rob them\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) When Bates looked under the seat, she found Taylor's red slide-style cell phone, which looked identical to the cell phone that Taylor had answered while in the house. Taylor then realized that the red slide-style phone he had in his possession was not his phone, and he threw it into a treed area near Bates' driveway, where it later was recovered by police. Bates also took\n   bags out of the trunk of the vehicle, and she and Taylor then removed all of the items from the inside of the vehicle, which included Bates' makeup, her wallet, her coat, the Febreze bottle, a New York\n   Yankees cap, and other things that she could not remember specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, the defendant telephoned his childhood friend, Julian Warren, asking him to come to Bates' home. When Warren arrived, he saw that the defendant was bleeding from his hand. The defendant told Warren that he needed to go to the hospital because he had been shot, but that he did not want to go to a local hospital because he was on parole. Warren, along with another individual, then took the defendant to Queens, New York. During the ride to Queens, Warren heard the defendant say something about being on the news and about \"a dude fighting back\" and \"somebody fighting back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 12, 2012, the police arrested the defendant in New York. After a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of all charges against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See also footnote 1 of this opinion. The court sentenced the defendant as follows: (1) for the charge of murder, sixty\n   years incarceration, twenty-five years of which were mandatory; (2) for the charge of conspiracy to commit murder, twenty years incarceration; (3) for the charge of robbery in the first degree, twenty years incarceration, five years of which were mandatory; (4) for the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, twenty years incarceration, five years of which were mandatory; and (5) for the charge of criminal possession of a firearm, five years incarceration, two years of which were mandatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ordered all sentences to run concurrently, resulting in a total effective sentence of sixty years incarceration, twenty-five years of which were mandatory. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant first claims that \"[t]here was no evidence from which jurors could reasonably infer that there was a robbery or an agreement to commit robbery.\" He argues: \"[T]he state's evidence proved only that something went wrong during a planned drug deal between the parties that [led] to the shooting of [the victim]. The state did not introduce any evidence at\n   trial from which the jury could reasonably infer that [the defendant] intended to rob [the victim], or that there was an agreement between him and Taylor to rob [the victim].\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We employ the following standard in our analysis of the defendant's claim: \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to\n   sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.... Moreover, [w]here a group of facts are relied upon for proof of an element of the crime it is their cumulative impact that is to be weighed in deciding whether the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been met and each individual fact need not be proved in accordance with that standard. It is only where a single fact is essential to proof of an element, however, such as identification by means of fingerprint evidence, that such evidence must support the inference of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"As we have often noted, however, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that\n   supports the jury's verdict of guilty.... Furthermore, [i]t is immaterial to the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial rather than direct evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20408\">\n    311 Conn. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%201101\">\n    87 A.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant argues that the state failed to introduce any evidence that the defendant robbed, or intended to rob, the victim. He contends: \"It is undisputed that something went wrong during the [drug] transaction, but there was no evidence presented at trial that [the defendant] agreed or intended to take drugs from [the victim] without paying for them.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"A person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. \"A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery ... he or\n   another participant in the crime ... is armed with a deadly weapon ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134(a)(2). \"A person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"To establish the crime of conspiracy under \u00a7 53a-48... it must be shown that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct\n   constituting a crime and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. The state must also show intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed.... Conspiracy is a specific intent crime, with the intent divided into two elements: (a) the intent to agree or conspire and (b) the intent to commit the offense which is the object of the conspiracy.... Thus, [p]roof of a conspiracy to commit a specific offense requires proof that the conspirators intended to bring about the elements of the conspired offense.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Danforth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20518\">\n    315 Conn. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531-32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201060\">\n    108 A.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[T]he existence of a formal agreement between the conspirators need not be proved [however] because [i]t is only in rare instances that conspiracy may be established by proof of an express agreement to unite to accomplish an unlawful purpose....

The defendant challenges only the larceny element of these\n   charges, arguing that there was no evidence that he intended to take drugs from the victim without paying for them or that he agreed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The evidence in this case demonstrated that the defendant made an agreement to buy cocaine from the victim for the sum of $6150. As the victim approached the defendant's vehicle, the victim was carrying crack cocaine in a brown paper bag, which was tucked in his waistband. He then leaned into the rear passenger's side of the vehicle, with his feet hanging out. A struggle ensued, and the victim attempted to hold the defendant's arm in an effort to avoid being shot. Shots, however, were fired, ultimately resulting in the death of the victim. Jackson and Angelo both ran to help. Jackson grabbed a child's scooter and broke the front passenger's side window of the vehicle, and he engaged Taylor, who was sitting in that seat, in a fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the meantime, Angelo ran to the rear passenger's side of the vehicle to help the victim, but soon more shots were fired. Angelo then went to the driver's side of the vehicle, where he encountered the defendant, who was standing outside of the vehicle, holding a revolver then pointed toward Angelo's face. Taylor indicated to\n   the defendant that they should leave. The defendant and Taylor reentered the vehicle and fled the scene with the crack, with the rear door open, and with the dying victim only partially inside the vehicle. The victim later fell out or was pushed out of the vehicle, and was left to die on the street. When the victim was transported to the hospital, he had approximately $40 on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Later, as Bates and Taylor were cleaning the vehicle, which was littered with broken glass, blood, and many different sized pieces of crack cocaine mixed with blood and glass, Taylor specifically told Bates that \"\n   <em>\n    they were in New Britain, and they started shooting up the car\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    trying to rob them\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Additionally, when Warren was driving the defendant to Queens, the defendant said something about being on the news and about \"\n   <em>\n    somebody fighting back\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Bates' statement that Taylor told her that \"\n   <em>\n    they were in New Britain, and they started shooting up the car trying to rob them\n   </em>\n   \" could be viewed as ambiguous, it is within the province of the jury to ascertain the reasonable meaning of that statement.

Furthermore, it would have been reasonable for the jury to have found that when Warren heard the defendant say that \"\n   <em>\n    somebody\n   </em>\n   \" fought back, the defendant was referring to the victim in this case having fought\n   back an attack. There also was evidence that the victim had only $40 on him when he was transported to the hospital, despite the defendant stating that he had given the victim $6000. Thus, on the basis of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant and Taylor coaxed the victim to produce 150 grams of crack cocaine by telling him that they would pay him $6150, and, once he produced the crack, they forcibly took it from him without ever paying him the agreed upon $6150. The victim resisted being robbed and fought back. The defendant and Taylor then killed the victim, dumped his body in the street, and simply drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Our case law is clear: \"[I]t does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.... It is not one fact ... but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.... In evaluating evidence, the [jury] is not required to accept as dispositive\n   those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence....

Accordingly, we find no merit to the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the elements of conspiracy to\n   commit robbery in the first degree. Specifically, he argues in his principle brief that because the court failed to instruct the jury that the coconspirators had to agree that a firearm would be used, his conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree must be vacated. In response, the state agrees that this conviction must be vacated, but for a different reason than the defendant offers. The state argues that because the conspiracy to commit robbery and the conspiracy to commit murder conviction arise from the same agreement, a double jeopardy violation exists.
