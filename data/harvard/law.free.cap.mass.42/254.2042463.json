Chapell, to be taken where said Matthew should \u201c choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>or select, at its just or proportionable value, according to its quality,\u201d &amp;c. On the 24th of February, 1825, the demandant attached said Matthew\u2019s right and interest in said homestead, and having recovered judgment, levied his execution, on the 29th of March, 1828, upon the demanded premises, by metes and bounds. Said premises are much less than one fifth of said Richard\u2019s homestead. The residue of said Matthew\u2019s right and interest in said homestead was afterwards set off, by metes and bounds, upon executions that issued on judgments recovered against him by his other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">In June, 1828, a petition for partition of the estate of Richard Chapell was preferred by D. Chapell, one of his sons, alleging that the petitioner was entitled to one fifth of said estate, and that the other four fifths belonged to four other sons of said Richard, viz. John, Seth, Richard, and Matthew S. Chapell. At the September term, 1830, of this court, partition of said estate was ordered, and commissioners were appointed to make partition, who were directed first to set off to Matthew S. from the homestead, in such place as he should select, so much as would satisfy his share, pursuant to the terms of his father\u2019s will. Said Matthew S. appeared before the commissioners, by his attorney, and they set off' and assigned to him, in severalty, his shaie of said homestead, as selected by his attorney, including the demanded premises, and the other parts of the homestead which had been levied on by his other creditors, as above mentioned. The report of the commissioners\u2019 said proceedings was accepted and ordered to be recorded, at the May term 1831.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The tenant claimed possession of the demanded premises under a demise from Hiram Baldwin, who defended this suit. Said Baldwin claimed title, first, under a release from Abner Sage, Jr., to whom Matthew' S. Chapell, on the 2d of March, 1825, gave a deed purporting to convey all his right in the real estate devised to him by his father ; and secondly, under a levy of an execution, made on the 26th of July, 1831, upon a judgment against said Matthew S., recovered by T. Phillips, administrator, with the will annexed, of the estate of Richard Cha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>poll, and a deed of release to said Baldwin, purporting to be made by said Richard\u2019s heirs at law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-5\"><em>Jones </em>and <em>G.

Such selection was a condition precedent to the vesting of the estate ; or if not a condition precedent, yet it was a right which the demandant could not acquire by attachment, and which the debtor by his deed to Sage, prior to the levy, had transferred with his title to tire estate devised</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">A levy, by metes and bounds, on part of a cotenant\u2019s estate, has never yet been held to estop his other creditors. <em>Smith </em>v. Benson, 9 Verm. 138. [See also <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>2 Connect. 243.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-8\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADX\">The question is upon the validity of the title acquired by the demandant by his attachment, and the levy of his execution upon the premises, as the estate of Matthew S. Chapell. The estate of Chapell was derived under the will of his father, Richard Chapell, giving him an equal share, being one fifth part, of his real estate, \u201cto be taken where he shall choose or select, at its just or proportionable value.\u201d These words do not constitute a condition precedent to the vesting of the estate, but a right or privilege superadded to the devise, to be exercised or not, at the will of the devisee, upon partition. Consequently Matthew became entitled as tenant in common, under the devise, upon the decease of his father. Immediately after the decease of the devisor, and before the intervention of any other title or claim, this estate was attached by the demand-ant, and, if followed up by a valid levy, constituted a good title, eldest in time, and therefore prior in right.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The objection to the demandant\u2019s levy is, that it was a levy on a specific portion of the devised estate, by metes and bounds; whereas k should have been levied upon the debtor\u2019s undivided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>share in whole or in part. This would undoubtedly have been a valid and fatal objection, had it been made by any of the co-tenants before partition, because it would be an encroachment upon, their right to have partition of the whole tenement. <em>Porter </em>v. Hill, 9 Mass. 34. <em>Bartlet </em>v. Harlow, 12 Mass. 348. <em>French </em>v. Lund, 1 N. Hamp. 42. But as this rule is adopted for the protection of the rights of the other cotenants, it shall not be extended further than the accomplishment of that object requires ; and it is therefore held, that a conveyance of part by metes and bounds, by a cotenant, is not void, but voidable only by the other cotenants. And the same rule applies to a levy on part by metes and bounds, as the estate of a tenant in common, which is in the nature of a statute conveyance. <em>Varnum </em>v. <em>Abbot, </em>12 Mass. 474. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>22 Pick. 316. Such conveyance or levy, therefore, is good against the grantor and all claiming under him. If then the other cotenants release, or if upon a partition, their full shares are set off in other parts of the common estate, and the part conveyed or levied on is assigned to the party whose share has thus been conveyed or levied on by metes and bounds, such partition operates by way of estoppel and release, because no one has any longer a right to contest its validity. <em>Bartlet </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>12 Mass. 354. That is precisely the present case. After the levy, a partition was made, in which the premises levied upon by the demandant were assigned to his debtor, Matthew S. Chapell. This was done by the full consent of the latter, by which the right of choice, given to him by the will, was' fully secured to him, and exercised by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The case then shows that the estate in common vested in the debtor on the decease of the devisor, and was first well attached by the demandant, as his creditor ; that the levy, made in pursuance of the attachment, was voidable only by the other co-tenants ; that it was never in fact avoided by them, but on the contrary, by the partition, their claims were fully satisfied out of other parts of the estate, and from and after such partition, they were precluded from avoiding or contesting the demandant\u2019s tide ; and that this title relates back to the attachment, and su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>persedes all subsequent conveyances and attachments, and is therefore valid and indefeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
