Stearns on Real Actions, 409, 410. <em>Bigelow </em>v. Jones, 10 Pick. 161. <em>Allen </em>v. Thayer, 17 Mass. 299,302. The plaintiff was disseized, at the time of the trespass alleged in her declaration. Seizin of the <em>locus in quo </em>was delivered to Davis, when his execution was levied thereon ; and so far as it regarded Meriam, the mere levy, even if defective, was a disseizin. See Rev. Sts. c. 73, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16. <em>Gore </em>v. Brazier, 3 Mass. 538, 539. <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Pot</em>ter, 3 Mass. 215. It was decided in <em>Bott </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>9 Mass. 99, that a levy is not incontrovertible evidence of seizin as against a third person, the true owner, without an actual entry, though it is so as to all others. In the present case, there was an actual entry under the levy, before the alleged trespass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\">A levy on the land of a grantee under a defective deed operates as a disseizin of the grantor, so that nothing passes by his subsequent conveyance. <em>Gookin </em>v. <em>Whittier, 4 </em>Greenl. 16. The case of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 Shepley, 87, was precisely like the case at bar, except that the judgment debtor was in possession ; and it was held that the true owner was disseized by the ,evy, though the trespass sued for was the first entry after the levy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">One who enters under a record title is treated as a disseizor, for his own protection, when without such title he would be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>garded as only a trespasser. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Megquier, 2 </em>Greenl. 176. <em>Proprietors of Kennebec Purchase </em>v. <em>Laboree, 2 </em>Greenl. 275.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">In <em>Robison </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>3 Greenl. 316, it was held that where acts of ownership would amount only to trespasses, if unknown to the true owner, they may constitute a disseizin, when known by him. The facts in the case at bar show that the plaintiff had knowledge of Davis\u2019s levy. In <em>Proprietors of Kennebeck Purchase </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>4 Mass. 416, the party in possession had no record title, and the court held that his occupation was not so notorious as to raise a presumption of notice to the true owner. See also <em>Higbee </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>5 Mass. 344. <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>7 Mass. 381. Such occupation, as if continued twenty years would bar a writ of entry, is a disseizin in its inception. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>15 Mass. 446. Here Davis had such an occupation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">Disseizin is a fact, to be found by a jury. <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>7 Mass. 381. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Horde, </em>1 Bur. 113. If a jury, therefore, on the evidence reported, could find a disseizin, without such an abuse of discretion as would induce the court to set aside their verdict, the defendant has a right to a new trial, in order to submit that question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-7\">Is the disseizin, in the present case, only at the election of the \u2022plaintiff ? The leading case on this point is <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Horde, </em>1 Burr. 107, where Lord <em>Mansfield </em>came to the conclusion that in every case, except that of fines, and a statute bar, a party, whose entry is not tolled, may consider himself as not disseized, at his election.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-8\">It is submitted that this doctrine cannot be supported : 1. Because the doctrine of disseizin by election originated in extending the benefits of the assize of novel disseizin, and was intended to multiply cases of disseizin, by including some which were not strictly so at common law; and never to exclude real cases of disseizin. 2. The cases cited do not support this doctrine. They are all, except two, not cases of actual ouster, but where the disseizin obviously only existed at the election of the owner; as of a tenant conveying a larger estate, and the like. The two cases are <em>Bunter </em>v. <em>Coke, &amp; Pouseley </em>v. <em>Blackman </em>\u2014both cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>upon the validity of a devise; and in one there had been a reentry after the disseizin, upon which point that case turned ; and in the other, the only disseizin was the grant of an estate 'or years-by tenant at will. 3. His lordship\u2019s conclusion cannot be reconciled with the numerous cases in England and this country, where a deed has been held to pass no estate, by reason of the disseizin of the grantor; and those cases, like the one at bar, where trespass was held not to lie after a disseizin, before a re <em>entry. 4. But however </em>the case might have been between the plaintiff and Davis, the election cannot be made to the prejudice of an innocent third person, who came in by title, as the defendant did. He held no estate in the land, but entered under a mere revocable license, which required of him no other caution or inquiry than to see who was in the actual possession. Especially should the plaintiff not be allowed her election, when, by neglecting to put her deed on record, she had given no legal notice of her title. Her previous possession was ambiguous ; it might have been held under Meriam, or it might have terminated, and the land have passed to Meriam before Davis\u2019s levy. If a deed, when recorded, has relation back to the time of its execution, it ought not to have such relation to the injury of third persons, acting honestly in ignorance of its existence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-5\">Hopkinson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWO\">A distinction was early taken between the effect of a levy of an execution, under our statutes, on the land of the judgment debtor, and the land of a third per son. This is shown by cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Thus in <em>Gore </em>v. Brazier, 3 Mass. 539, <em>Parsons, </em>C. J. says, if a creditor levies on land not his debtor\u2019s, he is not protected by his execution; but the true owner may maintain trespass against him. But if the levy necessarily operated as a disseizin of such owner, he could not maintain trespass. S. P. <em>Bott v. Burnell, </em>11 Mass. 165, and 9 Mass. 99. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Brigden, </em>4 Mass. 155. It is not to be denied that this distinction was not clearly stated in <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>3 Mass. 215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-6\">If, however, this were not so, yet by the principles of the common law, the owner of land on which an execution is levied without legal authority, may treat the judgment creditor as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>mere trespasser, or as a disseizor, at his election. Disseizin by election extends to all cases in which there is not an actual ouster or amotion. <em>Taylor </em>v. Horde, 1 Bur. 60. The decisions cited by Lord Mansfield, in that case, fully sustain the doctrine which he there asserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-5\">The acts done in this case, by Davis, after his levy, did not work a disseizin of the plaintiff. Stearns on Real Actions, 5, 39. <em>Proprietors of Kennebeck Purchase </em>v. Call, 1 Mass. 483. <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Long Wharf 5 </em>Pick. 131. <em>Bates v. Norcross, </em>14 Pick. 224. <em>Sparhawk </em>v. <em>Bullard, (ante, 100.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">The evidence is insufficient to prove that the plaintiff had notice of Davis\u2019s levy, or of his acts and of those acting under him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b541-7\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anr\">In an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>the question is, supposing the plaintiff has proved a good title by deed, whether she was disseized at the time of the alleged trespass.' A preliminary question ivas indeed suggested, but not much pressed, founded on the fact, that although the plaintiff\u2019s deed purports to have been executed in 1834, it was not registered until October, 1839. But as no other title, derived from the same grantor, intervened, the want of registration is immaterial, and it is sufficient that it was registered at any time before it was offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The question of disseizin, when it is set up to defeat the possessory interest of the true owner, and where the owner does not elect to treat himself as disseized, for the sake of his remedy, is one of considerable difficulty, depending upon technical law, and in regard to which the authorities are in some conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The cause has been ably argued on both sides, and the authorities carefully examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">There is no doubt that if the plaintiff was disseized, and so continued at the time of the alleged trespass, the action will not lie ; but the question is, upon the facts, whether she was so dsseized.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The disseizin is placed upon two grounds : 1. The levy of the execution of Davis upon the premises as the estate and property of Meriam, which, it is insisted, vested the seizin <em>de facto </em>in Davis, and operated as a disseizin of all others. 2. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>actual entry under a claim of title, openly advertising and selling the crop, and the taking and carrying away of the crop of grass under a claim of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As to the first ground, it is undoubtedly now well settled, that the levy of an execution, under the statute, vests an actual seizin in the creditor, and ousts the debtor ; so that the creditor may enter and retain possession as against the debtor, or may maintain trespass against him, or maintain a real action counting on his own seizin. <em>Gore </em>v. Brazier, 3 Mass. 523. But the consequence of the creditor being seized by force of the levy, and delivery of seizin by the officer, follows only in case the land was liable to the extent, and belonged to the debtor at the time of the levy. If it did not belong to the debtor, the officer acted without authority. In the leading case on this subject, <em>Gore </em>v. Brazier, it is stated that if the right owner be dispossessed, the act is tortious, and he may maintain trespass against the creditor and the sheriff, or he may bring his writ of entry against the creditor as a disseizor. Now it is very obvious that if he could bring trespass, he is not absolutely disseized ; for, if disseized, he cannot maintain trespass, till reentry. It is also added, that he may have his writ of entry against the creditor, as a disseiz- or ; that is, he may elect to consider himself disseized, for the sake of his remedy, and with a view to try his title with the execution creditor ; and the creditor, having elected to levy on the estate, and take seizin of the officer, would be estopped to deny the legal consequences of such act. The levy may be considered, as between the parties, as devesting the seizin of the debtor, and giving seizin to the creditor, but has no effect to disseize any other person, who is the true owner, unless accompanied with such acts as would amount to an actual ouster. <em>Bott </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>9 Mass. 96. 11 Mass. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">2. Then the question is, whether the acts detailed in the report, independent of the supposed legal effect of the levy, constituted such a disseizin of the owner as to compel her to enter, before she could bring an action of trespass. In one respect, the levy of an execution, if returned and recorded, may have the same effect as a deed recorded, in ascertaining the extent of a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>seizin. If a party, without claim of title, does acts amounting to an actual ouster, it will ordinarily operate as a disseizin only to the extent of such actual ouster; but if he enter and do the same acts under color of a deed recorded, such deed, being evidence of his intent, may qualify the act of ouster, and operate as a disseizin of the whole parcel expressed in the deed. The levy of an execution being in this respect alike matter of record, may have a like effect. Still the question recurs whether the acts stated amount to a disseizin ; and this depends not upon the levy in the one case, or the deed in the other, but on the nature of the acts themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Instead of undertaking to give a definition of disseizin, I prefer referring to the cases- where the subject is discussed and an approximation towards an exact definition effected. <em>Proprietors of Kennebeck Purchase </em>v. Springer, 4 Mass. 416. <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Long Wharf </em>5 Pick. 131. <em>Poignard </em>v. Smith, 6 Pick. 172. S. <em>C. </em>8 Pick. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">One point seems to be well settled, which is, that very strong acts of exclusive possession, such as building, enclosing, or cultivating, and that for a long time, and openly and notoriously, are necessary in order to constitute an actual ouster of the true owner who has no notice of such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The premises, in the present case, consisted of unenclosed meadow land, part of a large tract, used only for mowing. The plaintiff had disposed of the grass the two or three previous years, and had the actual possession, prior to Davis\u2019s levy of execution. That levy was made in January previous ; so that he had taken no crop, at the time of the supposed trespass. He entered upon the premises two or three times, to show the grass, but took no actual possession. The grass was advertised, hut it n as advertised as the growth of a tract of meadow belonging to Davis, and would give the plaintiff no notice of any intention to sell the grass of her meadow. The actual sale at auction was made at the road, a quarter of a mile distant from the land. The court are therefore of opinion, that this evidence falls far short of proving an actual ouster of the plaintiff, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that she had the right of possession as well as the better title, and might well maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The fact last stated in the agreement, that the plaintiff for many years lived in the family of Davis\u2019s debtor, Meriam, appears to be immaterial. If it was intended to rely on the point that she held it fraudulently, upon a secret trust for Meriam, and to insist on the validity of Davis\u2019s levy upon the premises as the estate of Meriam, supposing a levy could be made under those circumstances, that ground should have been distinctly taken and the facts fully set forth, and tried by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
