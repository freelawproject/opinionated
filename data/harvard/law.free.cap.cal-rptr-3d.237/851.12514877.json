After a bench trial, the court found SOLO liable for performing unauthorized repair work on Vasquez's car in violation of Business and Professions Code section 9884.9, and awarded Vasquez $12,000 in damages. On appeal, SOLO contends there is no private cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 9884.9. We agree and reverse the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the operative first amended complaint, Vasquez alleged that SOLO and its owner, defendant Jose Hernandez, (together, Defendants), performed unauthorized\n   repair work on his car, demanded payment for the repairs, and sold the car at a lien sale when Vasquez refused to pay. Vasquez asserted claims for violation of the Automotive Repair Act ( Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 9880 et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770 et seq. ), breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, intentional and negligent misrepresentations, and violation of Penal Code section 496.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court held a bench trial over the course of two days, during which the parties presented contradictory versions of the relevant events. Vasquez testified that he was involved in a car accident, which caused his car's side airbags to deploy and damaged the bumper. Vasquez received an estimate for repair work from a shop affiliated with his insurance company, but he decided to take his car to SOLO to get a second opinion. Vasquez agreed to leave the car at SOLO overnight so that Hernandez could perform a thorough inspection before preparing an estimate for the repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vasquez was not pleased with the estimated cost of repairs at SOLO and decided to pick up his vehicle. When Vasquez went to retrieve the car, however, he saw that much of the interior had been ripped out. Hernandez refused to allow Vasquez to take the car without paying for the teardown. Over the next few weeks, Vasquez had as many as 10 conversations with Hernandez about returning his car, but Hernandez continued to demand payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point, Vasquez filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repair (Bureau). A Bureau representative contacted Vasquez and informed him he could pick up his car free of charge, but he would need to sign a waiver. Vasquez did not know the terms of the waiver, but he did not want to sign one because he did not trust the Bureau representative. As a result, Vasquez did not attempt to reclaim his car, and it was eventually sold at a lien sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vasquez believed his car was worth approximately $12,000 at the time he dropped it off at SOLO, but he still owed about $24,000 on his car loan. For two months, Vasquez rented a car to get to and from work, which cost approximately $2,000. He also relied on other people to drive him to work, and he was often late as a result. Vasquez eventually lost his job due to tardiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hernandez testified to a much different version of events. According to Hernandez, he agreed to honor the estimate from the repair shop affiliated with Vasquez's insurance company. After doing so, Hernandez received explicit authorization from Vasquez and his insurance company to begin work on the vehicle. At Vasquez's request, Hernandez began the work immediately, and he ordered parts costing around $3,000. A few days later, Vasquez demanded Hernandez return his car. Hernandez, however, refused to return the car without payment for the work that had already been done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About a month after the dispute arose, Hernandez met with the Bureau representative, who convinced him to release the car without charge. Thereafter, a SOLO employee called Vasquez several times informing him he could pick up the car without charge. Hernandez did not insist that Vasquez sign a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vasquez did not respond to the calls, and Hernandez mailed Vasquez a letter notifying him that if he did not retrieve his car, it would be considered abandoned. The car remained at SOLO for approximately six or seven months. Hernandez eventually hired a company to conduct a lien sale, which was executed lawfully. The car was sold for $4,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Trial Court Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court granted nonsuit and a directed verdict in Defendants' favor as to all claims except those against SOLO for violation of the Automotive Repair Act, conversion, and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After considering the parties' closing arguments, the court concluded that SOLO performed the repair work without authorization, which constituted a violation of section 9884.9 of the Automotive Repair Act. The court further concluded that SOLO had not converted Vasquez's property or violated the CLRA. The court remarked that if there is no private cause of action under the Automotive Repair Act, judgment would have been entirely in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court determined Vasquez's total damages from SOLO's violation of section 9884.9 were $24,000, which represented the remaining balance of his car loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, reduced SOLO's liability to $12,000 because Vasquez failed to mitigate his damages by picking up his car free of charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court entered judgment against SOLO and in favor of Vasquez for $12,000. SOLO timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SOLO contends the judgment must be reversed because there is no private cause of action for violation of section 9884.9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9884.8, 9884.9, 9884.10.) Section 9884.9, in particular, provides that an automotive repair dealer \"shall give to the customer a written estimated price for labor and parts necessary for a specific job. No work shall be done and no charges shall accrue before authorization to proceed is obtained from the customer.\" ( \u00a7 9884.9, subd. (a).) The statute further specifies the information that must be contained in the written estimate, who may give authorization to perform the work, and the steps the dealer must take if the estimated price is insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subds. (a)-(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Automotive Repair Act created within the Department of Consumer Affairs the Bureau of Automotive Repair. (\u00a7 9882, subd. (a).) Automotive repair dealers are required to register with the Bureau. (\u00a7\u00a7 9884.2, 9884.6, subd. (a).) Failure to register is a misdemeanor (\u00a7 9889.20), and unregistered dealers are precluded from suing on a contract for vehicle repairs (\u00a7 9884.16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition to overseeing dealer registration, the Bureau is responsible for enforcement of the Automotive Repair Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00a7 9882, subd. (a).) To fulfill this duty, the Bureau is authorized to investigate, on its own initiative or in response to complaints, violations of the act. (\u00a7 9882.5.) To that end, the Bureau is required to establish procedures for accepting complaints from the public against any dealer. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) When a dealer is alleged to have committed a violation, the Bureau may suggest measures to compensate for any damages suffered. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) If the dealer \"accepts the suggestions and performs accordingly, such fact shall be given due consideration in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Bureau is also authorized to pursue criminal, civil, and administrative penalties and remedies in response to violations of the act. It is a misdemeanor to violate many provisions of the act, including section 9884.9, and the Bureau is authorized to file charges with a district or city attorney. (\u00a7\u00a7 9884.15, 9889.20.) The Bureau may also seek in the superior court an injunction or other appropriate order restraining the dealer from committing violations. (\u00a7 9884.14.) In addition, the Bureau may issue a citation, and suspend or revoke the dealer's registration. (\u00a7\u00a7 9882, subd. (a), 9884.7, subd. (a)(6), 9884.22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. There is No Private Cause of Action For Violation of Section 9884.9\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court entered judgment in favor of Vasquez based entirely on its\n   finding that SOLO violated section 9884.9 by performing unauthorized repair work on Vasquez's car. Section 9884.9 does not, however, contain any language \"strongly and directly indicat[ing] that the Legislature intended to create a private cause of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Lu, supra\n   </em>\n   , 50 Cal.4th at p. 597,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20498\">\n    113 Cal.Rptr.3d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=236%20P.3d%20346\">\n    236 P.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In fact, the statute is entirely silent on the issue of enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor is there language in other sections of the Automotive Repair Act to even suggest an intent to create a private cause of action, despite the fact that the Legislature certainly knew how to do so. Indeed, thirty years before enacting the Automotive Repair Act, the Legislature enacted the Unfair Practices Act, which enumerates various prohibited trade practices and provides that \"[a]ny person or trade association may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any violation of this chapter and, in addition thereto, for the recovery of damages.\" ( \u00a7 17070.) No comparable language appears anywhere in the Automotive Repair Act. Given the complete lack of statutory language manifesting a Legislative intent to create a private cause of action, we conclude there is no private cause of action for violation of section 9884.9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Our conclusion finds further support in the fact that, in stark contrast to the complete lack of statutory language manifesting an intent to create a private cause of action, the Legislature expressly provided numerous mechanisms for the Bureau of Automotive Repair to enforce section 9884.9. Indeed, the Legislature gave the Bureau broad authority to investigate violations and pursue criminal, civil, and administrative penalties and remedies in response. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9884.7, subd. (a)(6), 9884.14, 9884.15, 9889.20.) The fact that the Legislature created such a comprehensive enforcement scheme without expressly providing for a private cause of action is a strong indication that it did not intend to create one.

Contrary to Vasquez's suggestions, this language simply expresses that the Automotive Repair Act was not intended to replace other forms of civil liability.
