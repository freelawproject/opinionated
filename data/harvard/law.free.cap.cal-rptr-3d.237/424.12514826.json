During the same time period, the law firm represented one of these public entities in matters unrelated to the qui tam suit. Both clients had executed engagement agreements that purported to waive all such conflicts of interest, current or future, but the agreements did not specifically refer to any conflict and the law firm did not tell either client about its representation of the other. This arrangement fell apart when the public entity discovered the conflict and successfully moved to have the firm disqualified in\n   the qui tam action. A fight over the manufacturer's outstanding law firm bills followed, and the dispute was sent to arbitration in accordance with an arbitration clause in the parties' engagement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The arbitrators ruled in the law firm's favor and the superior court confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeal reversed. That court concluded that the matter should never have been arbitrated because, notwithstanding the broad conflict waiver in the engagement agreement, the law firm's undisclosed conflict of interest violated rule 3-310(C)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. This ethical violation, the court ruled, rendered the parties' agreement, including the arbitration clause, unenforceable in its entirety. The Court of Appeal further held that the conflict of interest disentitled the law firm from receiving any compensation for the work it performed for the manufacturer while also representing the utility district in other matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeal that, under the framework established in\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans v. Blick\n   </em>\n   (1949)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4396121\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/33/603/\">\n    33 Cal.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.2d%2023\">\n    204 P.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the law firm's conflict of interest rendered the agreement with the manufacturer, including its arbitration clause, unenforceable as against public policy. Although the manufacturer signed a conflicts waiver, the waiver was not effective because the law firm failed to disclose a known conflict with a current client. But we conclude, contrary to the Court of Appeal, that the ethical violation does not categorically disentitle the law firm from recovering the value of the services it rendered to the manufacturer; whether principles of equity entitle the law firm to some measure of compensation is a matter for the trial court to address in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2006, a qui tam action was filed against J-M Manufacturing Company, Inc. (J-M), a pipe manufacturing company, in federal court in California. John Hendrix, the relator in the action, alleged that J-M had misrepresented the strength of polyvinyl chloride pipe it had sold to approximately 200 public entities around the country for use in their water and sewer systems. In early 2010, the complaint was unsealed, and many of these public entities intervened in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As these events were unfolding, J-M began to consider replacing the law firm that had been representing it in the action. In February 2010, shortly after the complaint was unsealed, J-M's general counsel, Camilla Eng, invited attorneys from the law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton, LLP (Sheppard Mullin), to discuss taking over the representation from the other law firm. The attorneys, Bryan Daly and Charles Kreindler, ran a conflicts check to determine whether Sheppard Mullin had represented\n   any of the public entities identified as the real parties in interest in the qui tam action. The conflicts check revealed that another Sheppard Mullin attorney, Jeffrey Dinkin, had done employment-related work for a public entity intervener, South Tahoe Public Utility District (South Tahoe), on and off since at least 2002, and most recently in November 2009. South Tahoe had, however, signed an advance waiver of conflicts in cases unrelated to the employment matters on which Dinkin had provided assistance. After internal consultation, Sheppard Mullin's general counsel opined that because of this advance conflict waiver, the firm could take on representation of J-M in the qui tam action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 4, 2010, Sheppard Mullin and J-M signed an engagement agreement. Under the heading \"Scope of Representation,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   the agreement recited that Sheppard Mullin was engaged to represent J-M in the qui tam action. The agreement provided that the representation would terminate on completion of the lawsuit and \"any related claims and proceedings,\" unless the law firm agreed separately to provide J-M other legal services. The agreement recited the terms of the representation, including payment of fees, and provided that these terms would also apply to other engagements for J-M that Sheppard Mullin might undertake, except as the parties otherwise agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The engagement agreement also contained a conflict waiver much like the one South Tahoe had signed. The waiver provision provided:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Conflicts with Other Clients\n   </em>\n   . Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP has many attorneys and multiple offices. We may currently or in the future represent one or more other clients (including current, former, and future clients) in matters involving [J-M]. We undertake this engagement on the condition that we may represent another client in a matter in which we do not represent [J-M], even if the interests of the other client are adverse to [J-M] (including appearance on behalf of another client adverse to [J-M] in litigation or arbitration) and can also, if necessary, examine or cross-examine [J-M] personnel on behalf of that other client in such proceedings or in other proceedings to which [J-M] is not a party\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   the other matter is not substantially related to our representation of [J-M] and in the course of representing [J-M] we have not obtained confidential information of [J-M] material to representation of the other client. By consenting to this arrangement, [J-M] is waiving our obligation of loyalty to it so long as we maintain confidentiality and adhere to the foregoing limitations. We seek this consent to allow our Firm to meet the needs of existing and future clients, to remain available to those other clients and to render legal services with vigor and competence. Also, if an attorney does not continue an engagement or must withdraw therefrom, the client may incur delay, prejudice or additional cost such as acquainting new counsel with the matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Eng revised certain portions of the engagement agreement before signing, she made no changes to the conflict waiver provision. Sheppard Mullin did not tell J-M about its representation of South Tahoe before or at the time the engagement agreement was signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The engagement agreement also contained an arbitration clause, providing that any dispute over fees or charges that was not resolved through voluntary arbitration under the auspices of the California State Bar, and any other type of dispute between the parties, would be settled by \"mandatory binding arbitration\" conducted in accordance with the California Arbitration Act (CAA; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1282 et seq. ). The arbitration clause also stated the agreement would be governed by California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dinkin, the Sheppard Mullin employment partner, again began actively working for South Tahoe later in March 2010, a few weeks after Sheppard Mullin began representing J-M. Over the course of the following year, Sheppard Mullin billed South Tahoe for about 12 hours of work. During this period, South Tahoe's attorneys in the qui tam action became aware that Sheppard Mullin was now representing J-M in that action. In March 2011, South Tahoe's attorneys in the qui tam action wrote to Sheppard Mullin asking for an explanation for the firm's failure to inform South Tahoe of the adverse representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sheppard Mullin responded by reminding South Tahoe of its earlier conflicts waiver. Dissatisfied with this response,\n   South Tahoe filed a motion to disqualify Sheppard Mullin in the qui tam proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In July 2011, the district court granted the disqualification motion, ruling that Sheppard Mullin's simultaneous representation of South Tahoe and J-M had been undertaken without adequately informed waivers in violation of rule 3-310(C)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During its representation of J-M, Sheppard Mullin performed approximately 10,000 hours of work in the qui tam action and a related state court action. According to Sheppard Mullin attorney Kreindler, the firm's billings totaled more than $3 million, of which more than $1 million remained unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sheppard Mullin sued J-M for the unpaid fees. J-M cross-complained for breach of contract, an accounting, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent inducement; it also sought disgorgement of fees previously paid to Sheppard Mullin, as well as exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Sheppard Mullin petitioned for an order compelling arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2. J-M opposed the order, asserting that Sheppard Mullin's conflict of interest had rendered the parties' entire agreement illegal and unenforceable. Overruling J-M, the superior court granted the petition to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The arbitrators ruled in Sheppard Mullin's favor. They observed that \"the better practice\" would have been for the firm to disclose its representation of South Tahoe and seek J-M's specific waiver of the conflict. But the arbitrators concluded that, even assuming Sheppard Mullin's failure to disclose the conflict constituted an ethical violation, the violation was not sufficiently serious or egregious to warrant forfeiture or disgorgement. The arbitrators observed that Sheppard Mullin's representation of South Tahoe involved matters unrelated to the qui tam action and that the conflict of interest had not caused J-M damage, prejudiced its defense of the qui tam action, resulted in communication of its confidential information to South Tahoe, or rendered Sheppard Mullin's representation less effective or less valuable. The arbitrators awarded Sheppard Mullin more than $1.3 million in fees and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Sheppard Mullin petitioned the superior court to confirm the award, but J-M petitioned to vacate it, renewing its contention that the parties' engagement agreement was illegal and unenforceable due to Sheppard Mullin's simultaneous representation of adverse interests in violation of rule 3-310(C)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Again overruling J-M's objection, the superior court confirmed the award. Citing\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase\n   </em>\n   (1992)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2008254\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/3/1/\">\n    3 Cal.4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20183\">\n    10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20P.2d%20899\">\n    832 P.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh\n   </em>\n   ), the court held that a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct does not render a retainer agreement unenforceable. The court concluded that the arbitrators therefore did not exceed their powers in awarding the contractual fees. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (a)(4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court of Appeal reversed. The court explained that California law, unlike federal law, treats a challenge to the legal enforceability of a contract as a matter for the court to decide, regardless of whether the contract contains an arbitration clause. The appellate court concluded that here, Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of J-M and South Tahoe violated\n   rule 3-310(C)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, notwithstanding the scope of the conflict waivers in the parties' respective engagement agreements. This violation, the court concluded, both rendered the engagement agreement with J-M unenforceable and disentitled Sheppard Mullin from any fees for representing J-M while it was simultaneously representing South Tahoe in other matters. For fee calculation purposes, the court remanded to the superior court to determine when precisely Sheppard Mullin's representation of South Tahoe began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We granted Sheppard Mullin's petition for review. The petition presents three questions: (1) whether a court may invalidate an arbitration award on the ground that the\n   agreement containing the arbitration agreement violates the public policy of the state as expressed in the Rules of Professional Conduct, as opposed to statutory law; (2) whether Sheppard Mullin violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in view of the broad conflicts waiver signed by J-M; and (3) whether any such violation automatically disentitles Sheppard Mullin from any compensation for the work it performed on behalf of J-M. We consider each of these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The threshold question in the case concerns the proper scope of judicial review of the arbitrators' award under the CAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CAA is \"a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 3 Cal.4th at p. 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20183\">\n    10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20P.2d%20899\">\n    832 P.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) \"Through this detailed statutory scheme, the Legislature has expressed a 'strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.' \" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20P.2d%20899\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) To effectuate that policy, the CAA provides that \"[a] written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.\" ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.) Where, as here, an arbitrator has issued an award, the decision is ordinarily final and thus \"is not ordinarily reviewable for error by either the trial or appellate courts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh\n   </em>\n   , at p. 13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20183\">\n    10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20P.2d%20899\">\n    832 P.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The exceptions to this rule of finality are specified by statute. As relevant here, the CAA provides that a court may vacate an arbitration award when \"[t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.\" ( Code Civ.

Sheppard Mullin does not ask us to revisit that holding. It does, however, argue that the\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans\n   </em>\n   illegality exception should apply only to contracts that are\n   found to violate public policy as it has been declared by the Legislature. Because the Rules of Professional Conduct are not promulgated by the Legislature, Sheppard Mullin argues, a violation of the rules can afford no ground for vacating an arbitration award under section 1286.2(a)(4) of the CAA. We reject the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under general principles of California contract law, a contract is unlawful, and therefore unenforceable, if it is \"[c]ontrary to an express provision of law\" or \"[c]ontrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited.\" ( Civ.

But ever since\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans\n   </em>\n   -whose continued validity Sheppard Mullin has not questioned-California cases have made clear that the legislative policy favoring contractual arbitration, and the finality of arbitral awards, applies only when there is, in fact, a valid contract to arbitrate.

And as we said in\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh\n   </em>\n   , while a claim that a single provision of a contract is illegal ordinarily has no bearing on the validity of the parties' agreement to arbitrate, the same is not true of a claim that the entire contract is void for illegality. In such cases, we have said, the agreement to arbitrate cannot be severed from the remainder, and a court is not bound to confirm the results of an arbitration conducted under such a contract.

(E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 33 Cal.2d at p. 604,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.2d%2023\">\n    204 P.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [the arbitration award could not \"be reconciled with the settled public policy of this state as expressed in our statutory law\"];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.2d%2023\">\n    204 P.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [confirming the arbitration award \"would be tantamount to giving judicial approval to acts which are declared unlawful by statute\"].) Subsequent cases applying the\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans\n   </em>\n   illegality exception have involved similar scenarios. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    All Points Traders, Inc. v.

And as noted, California law holds that a contract may be held invalid and unenforceable on public policy grounds even though the public policy is not enshrined in a legislative enactment.\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Sheppard Mullin warns that failure to adopt a legislative policy limitation will invite a flood of litigation by parties disappointed by arbitration results. Courts will be mired in difficult line-drawing exercises to determine what sort of contracts violate public policy and which do not. The problem will be particularly acute in the context of attorney-service contracts, Sheppard Mullin says, because the Rules of Professional Conduct govern so many aspects of the attorney-client relationship. And to resolve these claims, courts will be regularly called on to resolve highly factual disputes, thereby eliminating the advantages of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But by declining to adopt Sheppard Mullin's legislative policy limitation on the illegality exception, we are hardly breaking new ground. We merely affirm that, under\n   <em>\n    Loving &amp; Evans\n   </em>\n   , the legality of a contract that contains an arbitration agreement is to be judged by the same standards as a contract without such an agreement. And we repeat that those standards do not encompass claims of mere partial illegality; the case law does not establish, nor do we today hold, that an attorney-services contract may be declared illegal in its entirety simply because it contains a provision that conflicts with an attorney's obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct. As\n   <em>\n    Moncharsh\n   </em>\n   illustrates, the violation of an ethical rule in one portion of a contract (there a fee-splitting provision) does not necessarily preclude enforcement of the contract as a whole.

We conclude that Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of J-M and South Tahoe violated rule 3-310(C)(3) and rendered the engagement agreement between Sheppard Mullin and J-M unenforceable. Our conclusion rests on three subsidiary points: First, at the time Sheppard Mullin agreed to represent J-M in the qui tam action, the law firm also represented a client with conflicting interests, South Tahoe; second, because Sheppard Mullin knew of that conflicting interest and failed to inform J-M of it, J-M's consent was not \"informed\" within the meaning of the Rules of Professional Conduct; and third, Sheppard Mullin's unconsented-to conflict of interest affected the whole of its engagement agreement with J-M, rendering it unenforceable in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In their engagement agreement, Sheppard Mullin asked J-M to agree to the law firm's representation of any other client, \"currently or in the future,\" in matters not substantially related to its representation of J-M, \"even if the interests of the other client are adverse\" to J-M's. The conflict waiver clause alerted J-M that Sheppard Mullin is a large firm with many offices and attorneys and may represent clients whose interests conflict with J-M's, but it did not disclose any particular conflict, or even any area of potential conflict, and did not mention Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of South Tahoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties and amici curiae debate at length whether a general advisement of this type is adequate to obtain a client's informed consent to the possibility of future conflicts with a law firm's future clients. But J-M argues that this debate is beside the point, because when it hired Sheppard Mullin to represent it in the qui tam action, the firm's representation of South Tahoe was not merely a future possibility; it was a present reality. Sheppard Mullin disputes the premise, asserting that when the firm took on J-M's representation on March 4, 2010, South Tahoe was a\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   client (or, to borrow a term used at oral argument, a \"dormant\" client) and did not become a current client again until March 29, when Dinkin began new employment work for the agency. But based on the terms of Sheppard Mullin's engagement agreement with South Tahoe, as well as the undisputed facts concerning their course of dealing, we agree with J-M: Sheppard Mullin and South Tahoe had an attorney-client relationship at the time Sheppard Mullin took on J-M, South Tahoe's adversary, as a client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   South Tahoe's operative engagement agreement, executed in 2006, provided that Sheppard Mullin would represent the utility district \"in connection with general employment matters (the 'Matter').\" The agreement further provided that South Tahoe could terminate the representation at any time, as could Sheppard Mullin (subject to its ethical obligations), but that otherwise the representation would terminate \"upon completion of the Matter\" unless the firm agreed to render other legal services to the agency. The parties' agreement thus established an attorney-client relationship that, absent earlier termination by one of the parties, would endure so long as Sheppard Mullin continued to work on \"the Matter,\" which was defined in the agreement as \"general employment matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dinkin had performed employment work for South Tahoe in November 2009 and did so again beginning on March 29, 2010. Overall, Dinkin had provided South Tahoe legal services as a Sheppard Mullin partner since 2002, and the firm billed the utility district for 119 hours of work in the five years before May 2011. As of March 4, 2010, then, Sheppard Mullin's work on \"general employment matters\" was ongoing. There is no evidence either party terminated the engagement until South Tahoe did so in 2011, after it discovered the firm's conflict of interest. It follows that Sheppard Mullin was still South Tahoe's attorney in March 2010, when it also began representing J-M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This conclusion finds support in a substantial body of case law from both within and without California. Under comparable circumstances, where a law firm and client have had a long-term course of business calling for occasional work on discrete assignments, courts have generally held the fact that the firm is not performing any assignment on a particular date and may not have done so for some months-or even years-does\n   not necessarily mean the attorney-client relationship has been terminated.

The terms of the agreement do not, however, bear out the characterization. The agreement provided that Sheppard Mullin's representation of South Tahoe would continue for the length of \"the Matter,\" which the agreement defined as general employment\n   <em>\n    matters\n   </em>\n   , in the plural. The definition belies the suggestion that the parties intended to terminate the attorney-client relationship after each individual general employment matter was completed. And unlike the framework agreement at issue in\n   <em>\n    Banning Ranch\n   </em>\n   , the agreement contained no language reserving to the law firm the right to decline work requested by the client. Nor did the agreement include any other explicit statement that Sheppard Mullin and South Tahoe would maintain an attorney-client relationship only during times when the law firm was actually performing work for the utility district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   While the South Tahoe engagement agreement was not what the\n   <em>\n    Banning Ranch\n   </em>\n   court called a \"[c]lassic retainer agreement[ ]\" (\n   <em>\n    Banning Ranch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 917,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20348\">\n    123 Cal.Rptr.3d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-there was no retainer fee involved-it was not a simple framework agreement, either. It was, rather, an agreement governing a continuing engagement involving occasional work on employment matters as needed. And under that agreement, over the course of a decade Sheppard Mullin regularly advised and assisted South Tahoe with employment matters. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    Banning Ranch\n   </em>\n   , at p. 915,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20348\">\n    123 Cal.Rptr.3d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [law firm performed minimal work for client under agreement].) Absent any express agreement severing the relationship during\n   periods of inactivity, South Tahoe could reasonably have believed that it continued to enjoy an attorney-client relationship with its longtime law firm even when no project was ongoing.

To be informed, the client's consent to dual representation must be based on disclosure of all material facts the attorney knows and can reveal. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Image Technical Services, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co.\n   </em>\n   (N.D.Cal. 1993)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7408174\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/820/1212/#p1214\">\n    820 F.Supp. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1214-1215, 1217 [law firm failed to obtain informed consent to a conflict of interest because it did not disclose known material details of the conflict].) An attorney or law firm that knowingly withholds material information about a conflict has not earned the confidence and trust the rule is designed to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Assessed by this standard, the conflicts waiver here was inadequate. By asking J-M to waive current conflicts as well as future ones, Sheppard Mullin did put J-M on notice that a current conflict\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   exist. But by failing to disclose to J-M the fact that a current conflict\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   existed, the law firm failed to disclose to its client all the \"relevant circumstances\" within its knowledge relating to its representation of J-M. ( Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-310(A)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Sheppard Mullin contends the blanket disclosure and waiver was sufficient in light of J-M's size and sophistication and the participation of J-M's own general counsel in the engagement negotiations. It cites a federal disqualification case from Texas,\n   <em>\n    Galderma Laboratories v. Actavis Mid Atlantic LLC\n   </em>\n   (N.D.Tex. 2013)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035655\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/927/390/\">\n    927 F.Supp.2d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   ), for support. In that case, Galderma, a large corporation with global operations, engaged a law firm to help it with employee benefits matters, signing (by its general counsel) a blanket waiver of conflicts for the law firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 393.) One of the firm's other clients, Actavis, was later named a defendant in an intellectual property suit brought by Galderma, and the firm represented Actavis in that litigation. When Galderma learned of the law firm's adverse concurrent representation, it sought to disqualify the firm in the intellectual property action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 394.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The district court denied disqualification. The court applied the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (hereinafter the Model Rules), which require informed consent to concurrent\n   representation of adverse interests (a more lenient Texas rule did not). (\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 927 F.Supp.2d at pp. 395-396.) Relying on a comment to rule 1.7 of the Model Rules to the\n   effect that a general waiver may be effective where the client is an experienced user of legal services represented by independent counsel, the district court found the law firm's blanket waiver form effective to obtain informed consent from Galderma, a large corporation represented by its own general counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 396-397, 399-406.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. As an initial matter, whether or not the district court in that case correctly interpreted and applied the Model Rules, California has not adopted those rules or, more importantly, the comments to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even more to the point, Sheppard Mullin's blanket waiver would not be effective in this case even under\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   's approach, because here the law firm failed to disclose a known, existing conflict before soliciting J-M's consent. On this point, the\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   court was clear: \"If a conflict of interest is known to an attorney at the time he seeks a waiver, the attorney is not allowed to hide that conflict, regardless of whether the client is sophisticated or not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 927 F.Supp.2d at pp. 402-403.) We agree. Whether the client is an individual or a multinational corporation with a large law department, the duty of loyalty demands an attorney or law firm provide the client all material information in the attorney or firm's possession. No matter how large and sophisticated, a prospective client does not have access to a law firm's list of other clients, and cannot check for itself whether the firm represents adverse parties. Nor can it evaluate for itself the risk that it may be deprived, via motion for disqualification, of its counsel of choice, as happened here. In any event, clients should not have to investigate their attorneys. Simply put, withholding available information about a known, existing conflict is not consistent with informed consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because this case concerns the failure to disclose a current conflict, we have no occasion here to decide whether, or under what circumstances, a blanket advance waiver like the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Galderma\n   </em>\n   would be permissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, rather, that without full disclosure of existing conflicts known to the attorney, the client's consent is not informed for purposes of our ethics rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Sheppard Mullin failed to make such full disclosure here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Sheppard Mullin argues that even if it failed to secure adequate consent to the dual representation of J-M in the qui tam action, the ethical violation does not invalidate the entire engagement agreement because the agreement encompassed other matters as well. But as noted, the object of the agreement was representation in the qui tam action. The agreement states that Sheppard Mullin is engaged to represent J-M \"in connection with the lawsuit filed by Qui Tam plaintiff John Hendrix.\" The agreement further states that the representation will terminate upon completion of that action and any related proceedings. The only reference to work outside that scope is a general statement that, except as the parties otherwise agree, the agreement's terms will also apply to \"other engagements for [J-M] that [Sheppard Mullin]\n   <em>\n    may undertake\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) And while the agreement states that certain provisions on responding to possible third party document requests survive termination of the representation, those provisions were not independent of the qui tam representation but dependent on it. They do not change the fact that the agreement was one for representation in the qui tam action, a representation that violated rule 3-310(C)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As explained in part II,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , violation of a Rule of Professional Conduct in the formation of a contract can render the contract unenforceable as against public policy. That is what happened here when Sheppard Mullin agreed to represent J-M in the qui tam action, while also representing South Tahoe on other matters, without obtaining J-M's informed consent. It is true that Sheppard Mullin rendered J-M substantial legal services pursuant to the agreement, and J-M has not endeavored to show that it suffered damages as a result of the law firm's conflict of interest. But the fact remains that the agreement itself is contrary to the public policy of the state. The transaction was entered under terms that undermined an ethical rule designed for the protection of the client as well as for the preservation of public confidence in\n   the legal profession. The contract is for that reason unenforceable.

And here, it argues, the circumstances do not warrant the denial of fees. The firm asserts that, as the arbitrators found, its attorneys acted in good faith reliance on the blanket conflict waivers both clients signed. There is no claim that Sheppard Mullin ever worked against J-M's interest in any matter, and no evidence suggests a breach of confidentiality. And finally, Sheppard Mullin emphasizes that J-M stipulated in the arbitration proceedings that it was not challenging the \"value or [ ] quality\" of Sheppard Mullin's work on the qui tam action or seeking \"transition costs\" incurred in replacing the disqualified firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the circumstances,\n   Sheppard Mullin argues, denying all compensation for the extensive legal services the firm rendered in the qui tam action would impose a greatly disproportionate penalty and give J-M a massive windfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The ultimate question whether Sheppard Mullin is entitled to any compensation at all is not ripe for our resolution. Because the superior court ordered the matter to arbitration before determining whether the parties had an enforceable contract and refused to review the merits of the arbitral award after it was made, it has yet to consider any of the noncontract issues framed by the parties' pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our holding today will reposition the parties where they were before the case took its unwarranted detour to arbitration, giving them an opportunity to litigate their noncontract claims. In order to clarify the scope of issues remaining for resolution, however, we address the portion of the Court of Appeal's decision categorically barring recovery. We conclude, contrary to the Court of Appeal, that California law does not establish a bright-line rule barring all compensation for services performed subject to an improperly waived conflict of interest, no matter the circumstances surrounding the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Like the Court of Appeal, we begin by considering the rule described in section 37 of the Restatement Third of Law Governing Lawyers: \"A lawyer engaging in clear and serious violation of duty to a client may be required to forfeit some or all of the lawyer's compensation for the matter.\" (See also\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 39, com. e, p. 288 [where fee contract is unenforceable, attorney may recover in quantum meruit \"unless the lawyer's conduct warrants fee forfeiture under \u00a7 37\"].) An actual conflict of interest, the Court of Appeal reasoned, is always a serious violation, and so always bars any compensation. But while every violation of attorney conflict of interest rules is indeed serious to some degree, the rule described in the Restatement-which\n   in turn derives from general principles of agency law-is not so categorical. The Restatement instructs, and we agree, that the egregiousness of the attorney's conduct, its potential and actual effect on the client and the attorney-client relationship, and the existence of alternative remedies are all also relevant to whether and to what extent forfeiture of compensation is warranted. (See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The law takes these case-specific factors into account because forfeiture of compensation is, in the end, an equitable remedy. As California courts have often noted, the rule governing attorney forfeiture derives primarily from the general principle of equity that a fiduciary's breach of trust undermines the value of his or her services.

Forfeiture also serves as a deterrent to misconduct, and it avoids putting clients to the task of proving the harm stemming from the lawyer's conflict of interest when the extent of the harm may be difficult to measure.

The commentary to the Restatement thus recognizes that while an attorney's \"flagrant\" breach of his or her duty to a client may justify a complete forfeiture even without proof of harm to the client (Rest.3d Law Governing Lawyers,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 37, com. d, p. 273), in other, less egregious cases complete forfeiture \"would sometimes be an excessive sanction, giving a windfall to a client\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , com. b, p. 272).

Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 843 P.2d at p. 477 [factors to be considered include the value of services to the client and \" 'whether the breach was intentional, negligent or without fault' \"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   When a law firm seeks fees in quantum meruit that it is unable to recover under the contract because it has breached an ethical duty to its client, the burden of proof on these or other factors lies with the firm. To be entitled to a measure of recovery, the firm must show that the violation was neither willful nor egregious, and it must show that its conduct was not so potentially damaging to the client as to warrant a complete denial of compensation. And before the trial court may award compensation, it must be satisfied that the award does not undermine incentives for compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. For this reason, at least absent exceptional circumstances, the\n   contractual fee will not serve as an appropriate measure of quantum meruit recovery.

Although the law firm may be entitled to some compensation for its work, its ethical breach will ordinarily require it to relinquish some or all of the profits for which it negotiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On remand, Sheppard Mullin may be unable to meet its burden and the trial court may find its misconduct so egregious or so potentially harmful to J-M as to preclude any award. But without a more robust factual record or any trial court findings we are unable to say it would be an abuse of discretion to order Sheppard Mullin compensated in some degree for the many thousands of hours of legal work it performed on J-M's behalf before South Tahoe successfully moved to have Sheppard Mullin disqualified. Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of J-M and South Tahoe in separate matters involved a conflict of interest affecting the representation itself, not merely the attorney's compensation as in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at page 463,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the firm did seek and obtain J-M's written consent to the conflict, albeit through a blanket waiver clause we hold here to be ineffective under the circumstances, and it could properly have represented both clients had the consent been properly informed. ( Rule 3-310(C)(3).) The law firm may have been legitimately confused about whether South Tahoe was J-M's current client when it took on J-M's defense, or it may in good faith have believed the engagement agreement's blanket waiver provided J-M with sufficient information about potential conflicts of interest, there being at the time no explicit rule or binding precedent regarding the scope of required disclosure. The conflict was, moreover, not one in which Sheppard Mullin represented another client\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   J-M (compare\n   <em>\n    Jeffry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 67 Cal.App.3d at p. 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20373\">\n    136 Cal.Rptr. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). And although J-M is under no obligation to present evidence that it was injured-the harm resulting from a violation of the duty of loyalty often being intangible and difficult to quantify-at this point, questions as to whether Sheppard Mullin's conflict may have affected the value of its work or led to a loss or default in the qui tam litigation have not yet been litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   On the other hand, considering Sheppard Mullin's actions and reasoning in light of the rule set forth in rule 3-310(C)(3), the trial court may conclude that the firm has not shown it was legitimately confused or that it acted in good faith. The law firm may also be unable to show its conduct caused or threatened no harm or only minimal harm to its client. Considering these and other factors, the trial court may determine that the policy of rule 3-310(C)(3) is best vindicated by a complete forfeiture of compensation. On the limited factual record before us, however, we cannot conclude that the existence of an improperly waived conflict of interest, by itself, presents an absolute bar to the award of reasonable compensation for services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   By leaving open the possibility of quantum meruit compensation for the 10,000 hours that Sheppard Mullin worked on J-M's behalf, we in no way condone the practice of failing to inform a client of a known, existing conflict of interest before asking the client to sign a blanket conflicts waiver. Trust and confidence are central to the attorney-client relationship, and maintaining them requires an ethical attorney to display all possible candor in his or her disclosure of circumstances that may affect the client's interests. Sheppard Mullin's failure to exhibit the necessary candor in this case has rendered its contract with J-M unenforceable and has thus disentitled it to the benefit of the unpaid contract fees awarded by the arbitrators in this case. Whether Sheppard Mullin is nevertheless entitled to a measure of compensation for its work is, along with the other unresolved noncontract issues raised by the pleadings, a matter for the trial court to consider in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it reversed the superior court's judgment entered on the arbitration award.

(J-M), hired Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton, LLP (Sheppard Mullin), to provide legal representation in a federal qui tam action in which various public entities were suing J-M for over $1 billion in damages. On the day J-M and Sheppard Mullin signed the engagement agreement, Sheppard Mullin knew, but failed to disclose, that one of the public entities suing J-M in the qui tam action-South Tahoe Public Utility District (South Tahoe)-was an existing client of the law\n   firm. Nor did Sheppard Mullin disclose this fact during the next year of the qui tam litigation, although it actively represented South Tahoe in unrelated matters during that time. It finally disclosed the conflict to J-M in April 2011, only after learning that South Tahoe, which discovered the conflict on its own, was planning to move for Sheppard Mullin's disqualification in the qui tam action. I agree with the majority that the conflict rendered the engagement agreement, including its arbitration clause, unenforceable as against public policy. However, I disagree with the majority that, notwithstanding the conflict and the agreement's invalidity, Sheppard Mullin may be entitled to recover from J-M in quantum meruit for the value of the legal services it provided in the qui tam action. I would instead hold that Sheppard Mullin's failure to disclose its known conflict of interest precludes it from any recovery. I dissent insofar as the majority holds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In 2006, J-M, a pipe manufacturer, was sued in a federal court qui tam action regarding pipe it sold to 200 public entities, including South Tahoe. The complaint demanded over $1 billion in damages. On February 5, 2010, South Tahoe intervened in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   On February 22, 2010, representatives of J-M-including its general counsel, Camilla Eng-met with Sheppard Mullin attorneys Bryan Daly and Charles Kreindler about taking over as J-M's defense counsel in the qui tam action. On March 4, 2010, Sheppard Mullin and J-M signed an engagement agreement, which included the following general conflict waiver provision: \"Sheppard ... has many attorneys and multiple offices. We may currently or in the future represent one or more other clients (including current, former, and future clients) in matters involving [J-M]. We undertake this engagement on the condition that we may represent another client in a matter in which we do not represent [J-M], even if the interests of the other client are adverse to [J-M] (including appearance on behalf of another client adverse to [J-M] in litigation or arbitration) and can also, if necessary, examine or cross-examine [J-M] personnel on behalf of that other client in such proceedings or in other proceedings to which [J-M] is not a party\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   the other matter is not substantially related to our representation of [J-M] and in the course of representing [J-M] we have not obtained confidential information of [J-M] material to representation of the other client. By consenting to this arrangement, [J-M] is waiving our obligation of loyalty to it so long as we maintain confidentiality and adhere to the foregoing limitations. We seek this consent to allow our Firm to meet the needs of existing and future clients, to remain available to those other clients and to render legal services with vigor and competence. Also, if an attorney does not continue an engagement or must withdraw therefrom, the client may incur delay, prejudice or additional cost such as acquainting new counsel with the matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   According to its general counsel, D. Ronald Ryland, before execution of the agreement, Sheppard Mullin ran \"a conflicts check\" and \"identified South Tahoe ... as a client in matters wholly unrelated to J-M.\" Specifically, Sheppard Mullin attorney Jeffrey Dinkin had periodically represented South Tahoe on employment matters since at least 2002, and most recently in November 2009. Ryland concluded that \"the matters Sheppard Mullin handled for South Tahoe were not 'substantially related' to the Qui Tam Action,\" and that an \"advance conflict waiver\" South Tahoe had\n   signed in 2006-similar to the one J-M signed-therefore \"authorized the undertaking of the representation.\" In Ryland's opinion, because South Tahoe had signed the advance waiver and J-M \"was comfortable with, agreed to, and was prepared to sign\" a similar waiver, \"there was nothing to disclose to J-M\" and he informed Daly and Kreindler that they could \"agree to represent J-M in the Qui Tam Action.\" Daly agreed that, because of South Tahoe's advance conflict waiver, \"there was no conflict\" and that South Tahoe \"presented [no] issue regarding representing J-M in the Qui Tam action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Consistent with this view, before J-M executed the engagement agreement, Sheppard Mullin did not disclose its representation of South Tahoe. Indeed, according to the sworn declaration of Eng, who retained Sheppard Mullin on J-M's behalf, \"[d]uring the interview process leading to [Sheppard Mullin's] retention, [Sheppard Mullin] attorneys assured [her] there were no conflicts with the firm's proposed representation in the [qui tam] Action.\" Sheppard Mullin has not denied this assertion. Daly stated in a sworn declaration that he did not \"intentionally conceal[ ] an alleged conflict\" from J-M. But, as noted above, he also declared that \"there was no conflict\" and that South Tahoe \"presented [no] issue regarding representing J-M in the Qui Tam action.\" Kreindler stated in a sworn declaration only that he \"did not learn about any potential issue involving South Tahoe\" at the time of the retention, adding that Daly \"handled the tasks associated with J-M's retention of Sheppard Mullin,\" including \"running and evaluating the conflicts check.\" Ryland stated in a sworn declaration that he \"did not 'conceal' anything from J-M nor anyone else in connection with [Sheppard Mullin's] retention by J-M.\" But, as noted above, he also declared that \"there was nothing to disclose to J-M.\" Sheppard Mullin's view that there was no conflict and nothing to disclose is completely consistent with Eng's statement that Sheppard Mullin attorneys \"assured\" her \"[d]uring the interview process\" that \"there were no conflicts with the firm's proposed representation in the [qui tam] Action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   A few weeks after the engagement agreement's execution, Dinkin again began actively working for South Tahoe. During the next year, he billed it for about 12 hours of work. Sheppard Mullin did not disclose this fact either to J-M or to South Tahoe's counsel in the qui tam action. In January 2011, South Tahoe's qui tam counsel became aware that Sheppard Mullin was simultaneously representing J-M in the qui tam action and South Tahoe in other matters. In a letter dated March 4, 2011, asking Sheppard Mullin to explain the situation, South Tahoe's counsel stated that it had learned that Sheppard Mullin \"concurrently has represented\" South Tahoe \"for the entire time Sheppard Mullin has been adverse to South Tahoe in the [qui tam] action,\" and that Sheppard Mullin's \"ongoing representation of South Tahoe predate[d] Sheppard Mullin's representation of\" J-M \"by several years.\" In response, Kreindler did not deny these assertions, and instead acknowledged that Sheppard Mullin \"has been representing South Tahoe for many years in connection with general employment matters.\" He also cited the \"conflict waiver\" in the \"current engagement letter\" with South Tahoe, and stated that, \"in response to\" South\n   Tahoe's March 4 letter, \"an ethical wall,\" though \"not required,\" had been \"erected between\" Sheppard Mullin employees \"who may be involved with the representation of J-M, and those who may be involved with general employment matters with South Tahoe.\" Unsatisfied with the response,\n   on April 11, 2011, South Tahoe's counsel informed Sheppard Mullin that South Tahoe was \"contemplating\" filing a motion to disqualify Sheppard Mullin from the qui tam case, and asked for a \"meet and confer discussion\" regarding the motion. During a subsequent telephone conference on April 19, South Tahoe's counsel reiterated its intention to move for Sheppard Mullin's disqualification as J-M's counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Between March 4, when South Tahoe's counsel first wrote to Sheppard Mullin about the conflict, and the April 19 telephone conference, Sheppard Mullin did not inform J-M that South Tahoe was questioning Sheppard Mullin's representation of J-M based on a conflict of interest, or that Sheppard Mullin was communicating with South Tahoe's counsel on this issue. It finally did so on April 20, informing Eng by email that South Tahoe's counsel \"has threatened to file a motion to disqualify Sheppard Mullin because a lawyer in our Santa Barbara office gives employment advice to South Tahoe.\" Even then, Sheppard Mullin did not disclose its March 2010 pre-engagement conflicts check. Eng did not discover that information for another two months, when Ryland filed with the court a declaration discussing the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   On May 9, 2011, South Tahoe's counsel moved to disqualify Sheppard Mullin as J-M's counsel. Sheppard Mullin opposed the motion based on South Tahoe's execution of the advance conflict waiver. In letters offering to settle the dispute-which proposed a $250,000 cash payment and 40 hours of free employment related legal work in exchange for South Tahoe's conflict waiver-Sheppard Mullin referenced its \"long-standing relationship\" with South Tahoe, noting that it had \"been pleased to provide labor advice to [South Tahoe] for the last 9 years.\" The court ultimately granted the motion, finding that the advance waiver was insufficient and that Sheppard Mullin's representation therefore violated rule 3-310(C)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides that an attorney \"shall not, without the informed written consent of each client ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... [r]epresent a client in a matter and at the same time in a separate matter accept as a client a person or entity whose interest in the first matter is adverse to the client in the first matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Sheppard Mullin sued J-M for unpaid fees, asserting it was still owed $1 million of the $3 million it had billed (for about 10,000 hours of work). J-M filed a cross-complaint asserting various claims and requesting disgorgement of fees paid and exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Sheppard moved to compel arbitration under the engagement agreement's arbitration provision. The court granted the motion, rejecting J-M's claim that Sheppard Mullin's ethical violation rendered the\n   entire agreement, including the arbitration clause, illegal and unenforceable. The arbitrators subsequently found for Sheppard Mullin, reasoning that any ethical violation was not so serious or egregious as to warrant forfeiture and disgorgement of fees. They awarded Sheppard Mullin over $1.3 million in fees and interest. On Sheppard Mullin's motion, the superior court confirmed the award, rejecting J-M's renewed claim that the agreement was illegal and unenforceable due to the rules violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court of Appeal reversed, holding: (1) the parties agreed that California law would govern any disputes; (2) under California law, a claim that a contract is wholly illegal and unenforceable is for a court to decide, notwithstanding an arbitration clause; (3) Sheppard Mullin violated rule 3-310(C)(3) ; and (4) the violation rendered the engagement agreement unenforceable and precluded Sheppard Mullin from recovering any fees, even in quantum meruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Initially, I agree with the majority in the following respects: (1) where California law governs, a court may invalidate an arbitration award on the ground that the contract containing the parties' arbitration agreement violates the public policy of the state as expressed in the Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) when Sheppard Mullin and J-M signed the engagement agreement regarding the qui tam action, Sheppard Mullin had an existing attorney-client relationship with South Tahoe on unrelated matters; (3) Sheppard Mullin knew of this existing conflict but failed to disclose it to J-M; (4) because of the nondisclosure, the waiver J-M signed was insufficient to permit Sheppard Mullin to represent J-M notwithstanding the existing conflict; (5) the undisclosed conflict violated rule 3-310(C)(3) and renders the engagement agreement unenforceable in its entirety; and (6) because the engagement agreement is unenforceable in its entirety, Sheppard Mullin is not entitled to the benefit of the arbitrators' decision awarding it unpaid contractual fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   However, I disagree with the majority's holding that Sheppard Mullin may pursue recovery in quantum meruit for the value of the services it rendered to J-M.

We concluded it would not, explaining: \"Attorneys who negotiate contingent fee-sharing agreements, which take into account the risk that the client pays no fee if the client does not prevail in his or her case, understandably prefer to receive their negotiated fees rather than the typically lesser amounts representing the reasonable value of the work performed.

The answer to the \"first\" question we considered in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   -whether a quantum meruit award would be contrary to what the violated rule \"seeks to accomplish\" (\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 458,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-is clearly yes. As here relevant, the purpose of rule 3-310 is to preclude attorneys from simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests absent the clients' informed written consent. Because Sheppard Mullin did not get that consent, a quantum meruit award would compensate it for legal services that the rule expressly precluded it from providing. Indeed, the majority agrees that the conflict resulting from Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of J-M and South Tahoe \"\n   <em>\n    affect[ed] the representation itself\n   </em>\n   , not merely the attorney's compensation as in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   .\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 24, first italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As to whether permitting quantum meruit recovery here would be \"consistent with case law\" (\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 461,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), based on the very case law we discussed in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   -as well as other case law-I conclude that the answer is no.

The case now before us fits\n   <em>\n    precisely within that description\n   </em>\n   : It involves violation of a rule \"that proscribed the very conduct for which compensation was sought, i.e., the rule prohibiting attorneys from engaging in conflicting representation or accepting professional employment adverse to the interests of a client or former client without the written consent of both parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Again, as the majority explains, the conflict resulting from Sheppard Mullin's concurrent representation of J-M and South Tahoe \"\n   <em>\n    affect[ed] the representation itself\n   </em>\n   , not merely the attorney's compensation as in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   .\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 24, first italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The majority declares\n   <em>\n    Jeffry\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Goldstein\n   </em>\n   to be unpersuasive.

First, the majority's description of the facts in\n   <em>\n    Jeffry\n   </em>\n   is somewhat misleading. The \"law firm\" there did not decide to represent the wife of its existing client in their marital dissolution action. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , --- Cal.Rptr.3d at p. ----, --- P.3d at p. ----.) One attorney in the firm undertook to represent the client's wife in the dissolution action \"without\n   the knowledge of\" a different attorney who was representing the existing client in a personal injury action \"and without knowledge of the status of the personal injury litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Jeffry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 67 Cal.App.3d at p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20373\">\n    136 Cal.Rptr. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Indeed, the court remarked that it was \"not charg[ing] [the attorneys] with dishonest purpose or deliberately unethical conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20373\">\n    136 Cal.Rptr. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Here, of course, when Sheppard Mullin undertook to represent J-M, it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   know-because it ran a conflicts check-of the existing conflict, but made a decision not to disclose it. Second, I disagree that neither\n   <em>\n    Jeffry\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Goldstein\n   </em>\n   offers reasoning to support denying recovery in this case.

It is of course true, as the majority asserts, that \"we did not decide\" in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   that an unwaived conflict of interest, standing alone, always requires the denial of compensation. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 450, 425 P.3d at p. 22.) Had we done so, the present\n   case would surely not be before us.

As explained above, in holding in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   that quantum meruit recovery is available when law firms violate ethical disclosure and consent requirements regarding fee-sharing agreements, we relied in part on the fact that two statutes regulating fee agreements \"specif[y]\" that, where a client voids an agreement for noncompliance, \"the attorney remains 'entitled to collect a reasonable fee.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   , at p. 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) I am aware of no statute-and neither Sheppard Mullin nor the majority cites one-reflecting a legislative policy determination that attorneys are entitled to a reasonable fee-or any other compensation-when they violate their duty of loyalty by undertaking to represent a client without disclosing a known and existing conflict with another client and obtaining both clients' informed consent to the simultaneous representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Finally, the last factor we discussed in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   -\"whether allowing recovery in quantum meruit would undermine compliance with\" the violated ethics rule (\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 459,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-supports denying quantum meruit in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   , we emphasized that the ethics rule violated there did not bar the law firm that was seeking recovery from working on the case or rendering services \"on [the client's] behalf; it simply prohibit[ed] the dividing of [the client's] fees because she was not provided written disclosure of the fee-sharing agreement and her written consent was not obtained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 463,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) By contrast, in this case, the violated rule\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   preclude Sheppard Mullin from rendering services to J-M absent its informed consent. Thus, the risk Sheppard Mullin faced if it disclosed to J-M that it was representing one of the entities suing J-M in the qui tam action was that J-M would decline to hire Sheppard Mullin and Sheppard Mullin would lose the representation in its entirety. Indeed, one must wonder why, other than that risk, Sheppard Mullin made a conscious decision after its conflicts check \"identified\" South Tahoe \"as a client,\" not to disclose the representation to J-M and to instead deal with this situation through a generalized conflicts waiver that only referenced the possibility Sheppard Mullin \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   currently ... represent one or more other clients ... in matters involving\" J-M.

The majority first emphasizes that the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   , in denying all compensation, \"held a trial and tailored a remedy appropriate to the facts and equities.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 450, fn. 16, 425 P.3d at p. 23, fn. 16.) However, as the majority later recognizes, there was \" 'a long, clearly established line of cases' denying all recovery for\" the kind of violation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   . (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 450, fn. 16, 425 P.3d at p. 23.) As I have shown, there is also a line of cases denying all recovery for the kind of violation that Sheppard Mullin committed. Moreover, the majority overlooks the fact that in\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   , notwithstanding the trial court's conclusion, we\n   <em>\n    independently\n   </em>\n   \"considered the possibility of\" imposing \"less severe\" penalties (\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal.3d at p. 651,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n    214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n    699 P.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and we found those alternative penalties wanting because they lacked adequate deterrent impact and would poorly serve the prophylactic function of the conflict of interest statute there at issue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 651-652,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n    214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n    699 P.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The\n   majority offers no explanation or justification for its \"different judgment about the range of remedies that will effectively avoid undermining incentives to comply with\" the rule at issue here. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 450, fn. 16, 425 P.3d at p. 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In fact, the majority offers no real discussion of deterrence at all. Instead, without analysis, it simply directs trial courts to make case-by-case determinations of whether a quantum meruit award would, under the circumstances, \"undermine incentives for compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 23.) The majority cites no authority for this novel approach. Certainly, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   or in\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   , where we addressed the issue ourselves, suggests that trial courts should make such a case-by-case inquiry. Nor does the majority explain how trial courts are to make such case-by-case determinations. What factors\n   should they consider? Is this part of the \"the burden of proof\" that the majority places on attorneys seeking quantum meruit recovery? (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 23.) If so, what constitutes evidence regarding the adequacy of the motivation to comply? Must the evidence address the effect of quantum meruit recovery on the motivation to comply, not just of the attorney seeking compensation in the case, but, as we discussed in\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   , of \"all other similarly situated law firms and attorneys\"? (\n   <em>\n    Huskinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20379\">\n    84 P.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Again, how is a court supposed to determine this larger issue? Because the majority offers no standards to guide the inquiry, is a trial court's determination reviewable, or is it effectively standardless and unreviewable? If it is reviewable, then what standard of review applies? The majority offers no guidance on any of these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Another consideration supporting my conclusion is one that J-M vigorously puts forth but that the majority barely acknowledges: the difficulty in determining whether the undisclosed conflict caused injury. J-M asserts that \"it is extraordinarily difficult\"-indeed \"practically impossible\"-\"to prove that an attorney pulled punches due to divided loyalty,\" and that \"a conflict can cause an attorney to compromise the client's case in myriad subtle ways that are, by their nature, almost impossible to assess.\" The United States Supreme Court made this similar observation in a case involving simultaneous representation of criminal defendants: \"[A] rule requiring a defendant to show that a conflict of interests ... prejudiced him in some specific fashion would not be susceptible of intelligent, even-handed application. ... [I]n a case of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil ... is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to\n   <em>\n    refrain\n   </em>\n   from doing.... [T]o assess the impact of a conflict of interests on the attorney's options, tactics, and decisions in plea negotiations would be virtually impossible. Thus, an inquiry into a claim of harmless error here would require ... unguided speculation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Holloway v.

There, we expressed concern that the conflict created by an attorney's dual representation of clients \"might have unconsciously caused [the attorney] to accept an offer of compromise or settlement of [the client's] claim\"-rather than \"sue ... for a large sum of money, as he had previously intimated ... he\n   would do\"-so as not to harm the interest of another client.

Here, during discussions leading up to the engagement agreement, Sheppard Mullin told J-M that one of its \"goal[s]\" as defense counsel would be \"to stop the 'free ride' by small municipalities, and to force them to spend time and resources to substantiate their claim.\" Did Sheppard Mullin's follow through on this strategy as to South Tahoe, notwithstanding its ongoing attorney-client relationship with that entity? Did it take action \"to force\" South Tahoe-its client in other matters-\"to spend time and resources to substantiate [its] claim\" against J-M in the qui tam action? An inquiry into this question, and more broadly into whether Sheppard Mullin's simultaneous representation of J-M and South Tahoe harmed J-M, would require \"unguided speculation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 435 U.S. at p. 491,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2258\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/475/#p490\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The majority says virtually nothing about this issue or J-M's arguments, only briefly acknowledging as an aside that \"the harm resulting from a violation of the duty of loyalty [is] often ... intangible and difficult to quantify.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 452, 425 P.3d at p. 23.) Even worse, the majority ignores its own recognition of this common difficulty and holds that the parties now must \"litigat[e]\" the question whether the undisclosed conflict \"affected the value of [Sheppard Mullin's] work.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 452, 425 P.3d at p. 24.) And the majority imposes this requirement without considering how extensive the additional litigation surely will be, including discovery battles with J-M seeking interrogatory responses and deposition testimony from Sheppard\n   Mullin attorneys regarding litigation tactics and decisionmaking. Nor does the majority discuss whether Sheppard Mullin will be responsible for J-M's costs in litigating these issues, which resulted\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   from Sheppard Mullin's decision not to disclose its relationship to South Tahoe. Rather than spawn more subsidiary litigation and raise a host of unanswered questions by allowing for quantum meruit recovery, we should hold that such recovery is unavailable under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally, the other considerations the majority cites do not justify its conclusion that quantum meruit recovery may be available. The majority emphasizes that Sheppard Mullin performed \"many thousands of hours of legal work\" before its disqualification. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 24.) Of course, Sheppard Mullin is solely responsible for that circumstance, because it consciously decided not to disclose the conflict and was disqualified by South Tahoe when the facts later came to light. The majority asserts that Sheppard Mullin \"did seek and obtain J-M's written consent to the conflict.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) However, as the majority correctly holds, because Sheppard Mullin did not disclose the existing conflict, it neither sought nor obtained a\n   <em>\n    valid and effective\n   </em>\n   waiver. The majority also asserts that Sheppard Mullin \"may have been legitimately confused about whether South Tahoe was [a] current client when it took on J-M's defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) However, there is no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   in the record that Sheppard Mullin thought South Tahoe was only a former client. There is, however, undisputed evidence-the sworn declaration of its general counsel, D. Ronald Ryland-that before execution of the retention agreement, Sheppard Mullin ran \"a conflicts check\" and \"identified South Tahoe ... as a client in matters wholly unrelated to J-M.\" According to other undisputed evidence, Sheppard Mullin simply concluded that, because of the waiver South Tahoe had signed, \"there was nothing to disclose to J-M\" and \"there was no conflict\" that \"presented any issue regarding representing\n   J-M in the Qui Tam action.\" The majority also asserts that Sheppard Mullin \"may in good faith have believed the engagement agreement's blanket waiver provided J-M with sufficient information about potential conflicts of interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) However, such a finding would seem to be inconsistent with (1) the majority's no-nonsense and unqualified declaration that, \"[s]imply put, withholding available information about a known, existing conflict is not consistent with informed consent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 443, 425 P.3d at p. 17, fn.omitted), (2) the majority's conclusion that \"at the time [it] agreed to represent J-M,\" Sheppard Mullin \"knew\" it \"represented a client with conflicting interests, South Tahoe\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 439, 425 P.3d at p. 14), and (3) the majority's statement that even the case law on which Sheppard Mullin now relies \"was clear\" that disclosure of conflicts \" 'known to an attorney at the time he seeks a waiver' \" is\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   \" 'regardless of whether the client is sophisticated' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 439, 425 P.3d at p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   I disagree with the majority that, notwithstanding these considerations, we need a trial court to determine whether Sheppard Mullin's good faith is established by the absence \"at the time\" J-M retained Sheppard Mullin of an \"explicit rule or binding precedent\" (maj. opn., ante, 237 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 452, 425 P.3d at p. 24) that affirmatively and definitively precluded Sheppard Mullin from \"withholding available information about [the] known, existing conflict\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 443, 425 P.3d at p. 17). Procedurally, it requires no factual development or credibility determination to decide whether the mere absence of such legal authority establishes good faith, so we are in as good a position as the trial court to decide that issue and need not commit this determination to the trial court's discretion. Substantively, I conclude that the mere absence of such legal authority cannot justify a finding that, because Sheppard Mullin had a \"good faith\" belief (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 23) it could \"withhold[ ] available information about [the] known, existing conflict\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 451, 425 P.3d at p. 23), it should receive compensation. The majority's contrary conclusion will\n   <em>\n    tempt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    encourage\n   </em>\n   attorneys to take advantage of their asserted \"confus[ion]\" or the absence of authority \"explicit[ly]\" precluding their conduct (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at. pp. 451-452, 425 P.3d at pp. 23-24) by testing the boundaries of their ethical obligations and engaging in questionable behavior that they\n   may later attempt to justify as having been done in good faith. At least where the fundamental and inviolate duty of loyalty is at stake, we should instead adopt a rule that encourages attorneys to err on the side of caution, and to scrupulously honor their ethical obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For the preceding reasons, I dissent insofar as the majority holds that Sheppard Mullin may be entitled to recover in quantum meruit the value of the services it rendered to J-M, notwithstanding Sheppard Mullin's failure to disclose its representation of South Tahoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   I CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

(See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Cal Pak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 15-16,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20207\">\n     60 Cal.Rptr.2d 207\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Rest.3d Law Governing Lawyers,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 37.) The difference between these approaches reflects a difference in the nature of the conflicts at issue-a Government Code section 1090 violation inheres in the very fact of the official's interest in the transaction, and cannot be avoided by full disclosure (\n    <em>\n     Thomson\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 649-650,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n     214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n     699 P.2d 316\n    </extracted-citation>\n    )-as well as a different judgment about the range of remedies that will effectively avoid undermining incentives to comply with the relevant rules (see\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 651,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n     214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n     699 P.2d 316\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Under these circumstances, we conclude consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, such as whether the law firm knowingly violated rule 3-310(C)(3) and whether the conflict affected the value of its legal work, is more appropriate than the \"undeniably harsh\" categorical rule applied in\n    <em>\n     Thomson\n    </em>\n    .
