The letter said, \"We have been recently startled by the unexplainable demand on the part of our customers for Sodium Borate C. P. Powder. From our representatives, we have learned that a Dr. Brinkley, of Milford, Kansas, has broadcast recommendations for the use of Merck's Sodium Borate C. P. in obesity, and we have been literally swamped with orders, not only from the trade, but also from the laity. [\u00b6] We have taken action by notifying our ... customers, as well as our sales staff and such retail druggists as have inquired of us regarding the product, strongly discouraging the use and sale of this material for the above mentioned purpose, as we are cognizant of the dangers involved in the internal administration of Sodium Borate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It's been almost a hundred years since Merck sent that letter-responding to demand created by a charlatan with no formal medical training whose license to practice had been revoked in several states, but who had his own radio station and was making a fortune peddling unfounded remedies to unsuspecting citizens with little or no access to doctors. Since then, Americans have learned to resist such hucksterism and rely not only upon their personal physicians and organizations like the AMA, but upon pharmaceutical companies whose closely regulated research, production, and merchandising have taken the place of expertise the average citizen is unable to develop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   So when consumers find a reputable company offering them vitamins-a company with 75 years of brand recognition, now owned by an international pharmaceutical company respected all over the world-they can be expected to adhere to that company's advice. And when that company suggests, as it has with its products since 1949, that one vitamin pill a day is sufficient, it cannot then rely upon individual consumers reading the small-indeed miniscule-print on the back of its label to learn that instead of ONE A DAY, they should be taking two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Much has changed since 1925 but we find nothing to suggest the public does not still expect that kind of responsible entrepreneurism from Merck-now a division of respondent Bayer-as well as the rest of the industry we entrust daily not just with goods and services but with our lives. So in this case we conclude Bayer has failed to appreciate the degree to which their trade name One a Day has inspired reliance in\n   consumers, and we hold an action alleging they violated California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA, Civ. Code \u00a7 1770 ), Unfair Competition Law (UCL, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 ) and express warranty law ( Com. Code, \u00a7 2313 ) should have survived demurrer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As we will explain, we are well aware that two federal district courts have reached a different decision.

LEXIS 117117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Goldman\n   </em>\n   ) a bench officer saw this case differently than we do. But both cases are based on what we think is an untenable proposition: that the market for vitamins is undifferentiated; that the hypothetical \"reasonable consumer\" would,\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   , examine the makeup of a daily vitamin supplement; that such a consumer would not rely upon the expertise of pharmacologists and doctors but would instead analyze the various concentrations of vitamins and minerals in each brand and draw a personal conclusion about which ingredients he/she needed in a daily vitamin supplement. We find nothing in law or experience to support that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bayer AG (Bayer; the \"AG\" stands for Aktiengesellsschalft\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), maker and marketer of One A Day brand vitamins, was sued in Orange County Superior Court for alleged violations of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Unfair Competition Law and express warranty law. Plaintiff Brady's theory is that Bayer's packaging of its \"Vitacraves Adult Multivitamin\" line of gummies is misleading. As Brady inveighs, despite the One A Day brand name, these particular vitamins require a daily dosage of\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   gummies to get the recommended daily values. Thus buyers end up receiving only half the daily vitamin coverage they think they are getting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The initial complaint was filed as a class action in March 2016, followed by an amended complaint in April, followed by a demurrer in May. The trial court, relying on the unpublished\n   <em>\n    Howard v. Bayer Corp.\n   </em>\n   decision mentioned above, involving these very facts-the supposedly misleading packaging of Bayer's One A Day gummies-sustained Bayer's demurrer without leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The problem is best represented by showing the product. So we reproduce here photos of the front and back of the bottles at issue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Now the back:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While we cannot provide photos large enough to enable the reader to make it out, the line above the words \"Supplement Facts\" (the listing of vitamins and minerals provided by each gummie) says-in the smallest lettering on the bottle, an ocular challenge even when the bottle is full-sized and held in good light-\"\n   <strong>\n    Directions\n   </strong>\n   : Adults and children 4 years of age and above.\n   <strong>\n    Chew\n   </strong>\n   two gummies daily.\" The issue before us is whether that language is enough to overcome the prominent and arguably advisory brand name of the product. We think not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our problem with Bayer's position is twofold. It seems to us to suffer from infirmities both factual and legal. The factual infirmity is that it requires us to accept the proposition that consumers do not rely on the expertise of One A Day when they buy vitamins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One A Day has spent 75 years convincing the public they could be trusted to divine its vitamin needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most of the California consumers to whom One A Day sells have spent\n   <em>\n    literally\n   </em>\n   their entire lives listening to One A Day tell them, essentially, \"Trust us. We know what you need. You will never know as much about vitamins as we do, but you can rely on us. Take one of our tablets every day and you won't need any other supplements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   And for all we know, that's absolutely true-except for the one tablet part. Presumably the One A Day formula represents\n   the collective experimentation and wisdom of a host of medical professionals-doctors, pharmacologists, biochemists-who have concluded that certain levels of the substances in these formulas are the optimum levels for most of us. We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of One A Day's research or the formulations based on it. And it appears the consumers of California have concluded that One A Day is a company they can trust: You don't hang around for 75 years if people don't buy your product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But now Bayer wants us to conclude that trust is not part of One A Day's success. They argue that modern consumers carefully read and analyze the formulations of the vitamins on the market and make their choices based upon their own expertise. They tell us-and the federal judges who accepted their arguments in\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   -that consumers \"look for the nutritional values\" on the label and choose the supplements they buy based on comparison of those nutritional values. Instead of relying upon lifelong experience that One A Day is a trustworthy company that has been studying and analyzing our health needs for decades and has much more knowledge about those things than laypeople, Bayer says consumers look at the label and decide just how much selenium, biotin, pantothenic acid and zinc they need and then make their purchase after comparing those values with the labels on the vitamin bottles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That's a stretch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But as problematic as that factual depiction is, we must stretch much further to adopt Bayer's legal position. We must conclude that consumers do that\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This case has arrived here via sustained demurrer. To affirm the court below, we would have to conclude that even if plaintiff's allegations are true, there is no cause of action. (\n   <em>\n    Beacon Residential Community Assn. v. Skidmore, Owings, &amp; Merrill LLP\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263604\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/59/568/#p571\">\n    59 Cal.4th 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=173%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20752\">\n    173 Cal.Rptr.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=327%20P.3d%20850\">\n    327 P.3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We would have to conclude that the market for vitamins is undifferentiated, and that a hypothetical \"reasonable consumer\" would,\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   , necessarily look behind the front label of a jar of Bayer's One A Day gummies and in the course of that action, would discover that not one gummie but two is what the company recommends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have been unable to reach that point. Not all reasonable vitamin buyers can be said to be alike as a matter of law. Some consumers would scoff at what they might consider the paltry daily dosage recommendations of One A Day; they might believe they need much higher amounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Or lower. Those are the consumers Bayer has in mind-the ones who scrutinize the back ingredients label to assure themselves they are buying the amounts they, or their health care provider, think are needed. But other reasonable consumers will consider the daily dosages recommended by Bayer and the FDA to be just fine-they might even consider those numbers a safe way to avoid against any danger of ingesting too much-and will rely upon the name they have come to trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Whether a practice is deceptive, fraudulent, or unfair is generally a question of fact which requires 'consideration and weighing of evidence from both sides' and which usually cannot be made on demurrer.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    McKell v.

The baby food maker had marketed a product for toddlers. It was packaged as \"Fruit Juice Snacks Naturally Flavored Rich in Vitamin C\" on the front side, including a picture of a variety of fruits.

One had to turn to the back side to discover that the only \"fruit juice\" in those \"snacks\" was \"white grape juice from concentrate\" and the two most prominent ingredients were \"corn syrup and sugar\" (the opinion noted the sugar was refined white sugar, at that).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court held the fact the back side of the product disclosed that concentrated white grape juice was the only juice in the product could not cure the misleading nature of the front side.

It explained that the point of ingredient lists on the back should be to\n   <em>\n    confirm\n   </em>\n   the implied representations on the front, not contradict them. It said, \"We do not think that the FDA requires an ingredient list so that manufacturers can mislead consumers and then rely on the ingredient list to correct those misinterpretations and provide a shield for liability for the deception.

Though the \"entire label\" was not before the court in the defendant's 12(b)(6) motion (presumably the \"entire label\" would have revealed the relatively low organic content of the products) the court was clear that the use of the word \"organic\" combined with the \"pure, natural and organic\" tagline did not allow a conclusion that no reasonable consumer could be deceived\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .

It leads us to conclude that all four themes that emerge from the case law uniformly point to the same result in this case: allowing\n   Brady's claim to proceed beyond the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here's how we break it down: 1.\n   <em>\n    Common sense\n   </em>\n   : Bayer's One A Day gummies cannot be said, as a simple application of common sense, to indicate that two gummies a day are required. Indeed, common sense flows in the other direction: If the label prominently displays the words \"One A Day\" there is an implication that the daily intake should be one per day. 2.\n   <em>\n    Literal truth\n   </em>\n   : In the context of its gummie product, the One A Day brand name is literally false. A consumer seeking to get the \"one a day\" amount of vitamins associated with the brand's capsules will not take\n   <em>\n    one a day\n   </em>\n   . 4.\n   <em>\n    Nature of the brand name:\n   </em>\n   \"One A Day,\" when it comes to gummies, is explicitly misleading. Even judges can do enough math to know two does not equal one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But the most damaging of these themes to Bayer's position in our case is 3,\n   <em>\n    the front-back problem\n   </em>\n   . The front of the product makes no attempt to warn the consumer that a one-a-day jar of gummies is in fact full of two-a-day products. One must look at the back of the jar, in small print in the upper right hand corner, to receive the direction to \"\n   <strong>\n    Chew\n   </strong>\n   : two gummies daily,\" making a \"Serving Size\" is indeed two gummies. And unlike the billboard, sunburst-backed brand name print, that information is printed in nano-type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Bayer tries to turn the \"serving size\" fine print on the back into a virtue by asserting that\n   <em>\n    of course\n   </em>\n   the customer must look at the back because \"The only place to learn about the serving size, the vitamins, or the amount of vitamins is on the back.\" We are unpersuaded. That might be the case if this product were called Gazorninplat Gummies or Every Day Gummies. But it is most decidedly not the case here. The front label fairly shouts that one per day will be sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Bayer feels the reasonable consumer will be so motivated to ascertain the precise amounts of vitamins that\n   <em>\n    of course\n   </em>\n   he or she will scrutinize the back. We don't think such a conclusion can be made as a matter of law at the pleading stage. Nothing in law or logic suggests consumers will take such a belt and suspenders approach, and Bayer's argument runs counter to an important insight from the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   opinion: You cannot take away in the back fine print what you gave on the front in large conspicuous print. The ingredient list must\n   <em>\n    confirm\n   </em>\n   the expectations raised on the front, not contradict them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The cases we have reviewed that favor marketers are inapposite here. Unlike those, there is nothing to suggest Bayer's brand name is not be taken seriously. The idea that a \"One A Day\" gummie can be packed with as much vitamin wallop as the traditional One A Day capsule, lacks the common-sense risibility that sank plaintiffs' claims in the Captain Crunch, Froot Loops, or vegetable crackers cases. Nor is there the wishful thinking that characterized the plaintiff's claims in\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Shaker\n   </em>\n   . A reasonable consumer might very well think it possible, in the early 21st Century, to package a full day's supply of vitamins in one gummie. Certainly this court-made up of reasonable consumers-has no sense of whether that is or is not possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Nor can Bayer claim the compliance with literal truth that protected the manufacturers in\n   <em>\n    Red\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rooney\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   . It is simply specious to assert that One A Day carries any literal truth here, and no wishful recharacterization of the brand name as \"one portion a day\" or \"one serving a day\" can fix that. Indeed, the use of the procrustean concept of \"serving size\" to disguise the amount needed strikes us as similar to the use of the\n   word \"natural\" in\n   <em>\n    Janney\n   </em>\n   : stretched beyond what the rest of the product explicitly or impliedly offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the cases where an implied promise was qualified by additional language on the package,\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   (butter) and\n   <em>\n    Gitson\n   </em>\n   (soy milk) involve prominent language on the front, or front and top of the product, not fine print on the back. The insightful\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   case is more similar to our facts than either of those.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In fine, \"these laws prohibit 'not only advertising which is false, but also advertising which[,] although true, is either actually misleading or which has a capacity, likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse the public.'

The\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   court framed its rationale this way: \"A reasonable consumer of any medicine or medicine-like substance such as vitamins would not stop with the brand name.

Consumers buy multivitamins precisely to obtain an aggregate amount of vitamins, and it is implausible that a purchaser would not look at the label to see what vitamins are included and in what quantity. A reasonable consumer would not purchase multivitamins before determining what vitamins were in the formulation, and that information is clearly listed on the remainder of the One A Day\u00ae VitaCraves\u00ae label, along with the information that the serving size is '2 gummies' and the number of 'Servings per Container' is 35.\" (\n   <em>\n    Goldman, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203168525\">\n    2017 WL 3168525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at p. *7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20117117\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

We respectfully part company with\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Goldman\n   </em>\n   because both cases rest on the assumption that reasonable consumers of vitamins are back-label scrutinizers. We think that assumption untenable. It may well be that many people-including some judges and lawyers-would make such an inquiry. It may well be that engineers and scientists and the vitamin cognoscenti would make such an inquiry. But we are convinced other consumers-knowing they have very little scientific background-would rely upon the representation of a known brand with 70 years of goodwill and credibility behind it. We think it likely they would consider that known brand-presumed to be the employer of doctors, biologists, and pharmacologists-to be a better judge of what vitamins and minerals should be taken than they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is safe to say the market for vitamins is large and varied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And reasonable consumers within that market will represent many different approaches to vitamin purchases. One of the most instructive cases on the diverse nature of vitamin consumers is\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional I, supra,\n   </em>\n   a 1974 case where the Second Circuit Court of Appeal explicitly distinguished between sophisticated consumers and ordinary consumers for purposes of FDA regulations of vitamin and supplement labels. We concur with that court's observation that, \"Petitioners argue also that it is unreasonable to prevent a purchaser from obtaining any combination he may desire by restricting him to the FDA's list of all vitamins and minerals, all vitamins, all minerals, or all vitamins and iron. So far as concerns the sophisticated purchaser this may well be so. But the FDA was entitled to give thought to the ordinary consumer, who may be harmed, for example, by purchasing a less inclusive combination while believing that he is getting everything he needs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The distinction was later underscored by the same federal court in\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional Foods Assoc. v. Mathews\n   </em>\n   (2d Cir. 1977)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"951639\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/557/325/\">\n    557 F.2d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional II\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional II\n   </em>\n   directly considered regulations promulgated by the FDA in the early 1970's which would have made a prescription necessary to obtain a preparation of vitamin A over 10,000 international units, or vitamin D over 400 international units. Vitamin producers took the FDA to court. In striking down the regulations, the appellate court noted that the many people might be content with the then-FDA recommended daily allowances, but some sought more vitamins \"to maintain optimal health\" than the FDA maximums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 336.) The vitamin producers won the battle in a decision holding the proposed regulations were indeed arbitrary and capricious. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 337.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional\n   </em>\n   cases each recognize what should be common sense in\n   any event, namely that the market among reasonable consumers of vitamins is not monolithic. Not every vitamin-buyer is a health-conscious consumer preoccupied with exact dosages. Some are people with only a vague sense that they \"need vitamins.\" Others fully understand what they perceive to be a need, but choose to trust a time-tested provider. Reasonable consumers will vary. Bayer itself targets a variety of submarkets among vitamin consumers. (See\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v. Bayer AG\n   </em>\n   (N.D.

The idea of the RDA for specific nutrients was developed about 1941, from a study conducted by a private organization, the National Academy of Sciences, with a view toward nutritional issues that could affect national defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The RDAs have been periodically updated since.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regulations were promulgated in 1941 mandating RDA labeling of vitamin content.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The very idea of One A Day, as both\n   <em>\n    National Nutritional I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   intimated, is that most ordinary consumers can obtain their RDA with one simple unit. We think it clear that the One A Day brand of capsules was developed in the aftermath of World War II to take advantage of that idea of simplicity and completeness, and grew into the \"70-year-old brand name\" (\n   <em>\n    Goldman's\n   </em>\n   phrase) we deal with today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, it also seems safe to say that Bayer does not target its vitamin-enhanced gummies toward the sort of consumer who treats vitamins as-to use\n   <em>\n    Howard's\n   </em>\n   phrase-\"medicine\" or \"medicine-like,\" substances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, judging from the ingredient\n   list, Bayer's gummies are targeted at more casual consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally we must go back to the packaging before us. There is nothing on the front of the bottle of gummies to suggest\n   <em>\n    anything other\n   </em>\n   than that one gummie supplies a sufficient amount of vitamins to cover a person's RDA. The front does not say anything like, for example: \"One A Day\n   <em>\n    Brand\n   </em>\n   Gummies: Get your classic one a day by chewing just two gummies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   To find out about the need to chew two, one must literally turn to the fine print on the back side of the bottle, which not only doesn't\n   <em>\n    confirm\n   </em>\n   the expectations from the front, but in fact\n   <em>\n    contradicts\n   </em>\n   them. The court in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   said that sort of front-back contradiction was sufficiently misleading to preclude disposition at the pleading stage of the litigation, and we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Warranty Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Brady's warranty claim is predicated on section 2313 of the Commercial Code, quoted in full in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The key language of the statute pertains to \"[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.\" Based on what we have already said about the front of the One A Day bottle in this case, Brady has stated at least a prima facie case for a valid claim of breach of warranty: The front of the bottle makes an implied affirmation that one gummie will be sufficient for one day's vitamins. When combined with the assurance the bottle contains 100 gummies, there is a promise of quantity: A 100-day supply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Bayer's argument is that any seeming warranty representations on the front can be (we quote from the respondent's brief) \"contradicted by specific language on the same label.\" For this proposition, Bayer cites section 10215 of the Commercial Code, again quoted in full in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presumably Bayer is relying on the language that \"Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As far as we can tell, no published California opinion has construed section 10215 of the Commercial Code, and we think Bayer's interpretation to be a Kierkegaardian leap of advocacy. On its face Commercial Code section 10215 contemplates a situation where there are\n   <em>\n    two or more\n   </em>\n   warranties proffered, as distinct from a situation where there is one warranty on the front negated by a disclaimer on the back. The point of the statute is to set up a methodology of reconciliation; the statute incorporates the venerable principle of contract interpretation that specific language controls general language.
