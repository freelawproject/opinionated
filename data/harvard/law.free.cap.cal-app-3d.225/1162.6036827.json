In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected defendants\u2019 claim of usury and therefore affirm the judgment. Plaintiffs appeal from the post-judgment order for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which made virtually no allowance for any of the disbursements of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in connection with the case. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that such disbursements are allowable as attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party on a contract providing for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>represent expenses ordinarily billed to a client and are not included in the overhead component of counsel\u2019s hourly rate. Accordingly, we reverse the postjudgment order in part and remand for a new determination of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">I.

Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Plaintiffs appeal from the postjudgment order fixing their attorney\u2019s fees and costs, contending that the trial court erred when it declined to award all but $200 of the $11,103.41 disbursed by their counsel in connection with the case. The largest disallowed expense items were expert witness\u2019s fees of $8,283, and photocopying charges of $1,751.20. Other disallowed expenses included: messenger and express mail charges; telephone bills; travel expenses for mileage, tolls and parking; fees for research on the usury law by a legislative intent service; the filing fee and \u201csupplies\u201d for a petition for writ of mandate; and a lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Plaintiffs claimed these expenses as \u201cattorney fees\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 (hereinafter section 1033.5), subdivision (a)(10), based on defendants\u2019 agreement under the note \u201cto pay all costs and expenses of collection including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Civil Code section 1717 states that attorney\u2019s fees payable under the terms of a contract \u201cshall be an element of the costs of suit.\u201d Such fees are therefore \u201cauthorized by statute\u201d within the meaning of section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10) and may be claimed as costs by the party who prevails on the contract. (See \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(5); <em>Wong </em>v. <em>Davidian </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 264, 271 [253 Cal.Rptr. 675]; <em>Beneficial Standard Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scharps </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 227, 231-232 227 [136 Cal.Rptr. 549]; and see generally Pearl, Cal. Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar Supp. 1990) \u00a7 1-3, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">In its memorandum of decision on attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the trial court \u201cdisallow[ed] the \u2018disbursements\u2019 as set forth in Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>memorandum except that the Court will allow $200 as an arbitrary amount for reasonable photocopying and for presentation to the Court at trial.\u201d The reference to \u201cDefendant\u2019s memorandum\u201d suggests that the court was persuaded by defendants\u2019 memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to fix attorney\u2019s fees. In this memorandum, defendants itemized the disbursements and objected to their allowance based on the language of section 1033.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Section 1033.5 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032 [defining \u201cprevailing parties\u201d and indicating that they are entitled to recover costs]: . . . [\u00b6] (10) Attorney fees authorized by statute . . . . [\u00b6] (b) The following items are not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law: [\u00b6] (1) Fees of experts not ordered by the court . . . . [\u00b6] (3) Postage, telephone, and photocopying charges, except for exhibits .... \u00b6] (c) Any award of costs shall be subject to the following: ... [\u00b6] (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation . . . . [\u00b6] (4) Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court\u2019s discretion . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Defendants asserted that counsel\u2019s disbursements were \u201csimply not recoverable pursuant to [section 1033.5].\u201d They objected to travel expenses, lunches and supplies on the ground that these items are not listed as allowable costs in section 1033.5, subdivision (a). They argued that expert witness\u2019s fees, postage, telephone and photocopying charges could not be awarded under subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(3). They also submitted that the messenger and express mail charges were not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">\u201cAn award of attorney fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent a manifest abuse of discretion the determination of the trial court will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>(Erich </em>v. <em>Granoff </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 920, 931 [167 Cal.Rptr. 538].) In this case, however, the court evidently determined that counsel\u2019s disbursements could not be awarded as a matter of law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we may independently assess that legal conclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>Braude </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of Southern Cal. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1013-1014 [223 Cal.Rptr. 914] reversing where trial court denied attorney\u2019s fees on incorrect legal theory]; and cf. <em>Eddy </em>v. <em>Temkin </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1115, 1121 [213 Cal.Rptr. 597] [remanding where trial court \u201cvested with discretion . . . decline[d] to exercise that discretion\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We conclude that where a contract provides for payment of costs and attorney\u2019s fees, the court may allow disbursements of counsel as attorney fees under s\u00e9ction 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10), if they represent expenses ordinarily billed to a client and are not included in the overhead component of counsel\u2019s hourly rate. An agreement for attorney\u2019s fees and costs would be less than effectual if it could not cover the actual costs of litigation, including disbursements of counsel, and a contrary conclusion would mean that the party prevailing on the contract could never be made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Considerations supporting allowance of counsel\u2019s out-of-pocket costs are underscored in opinions of the federal courts, where there is ample precedent for including such costs in attorney\u2019s fees awards (see Pearl, Cal. Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.16, p. 111). \u201c[Attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses are inseparably intertwined as equally vital components of the costs of litigation .... [E]xpenses such as supplemental secretarial costs, copying, telephone costs and necessary travel, are integrally related to the work of an attorney and the services for which outlays are made may play a significant role in the ultimate success of litigation . . . .\u201d <em>(Dowdell </em>v. <em>City of Apoka, Florida </em>(11th Cir. 1983) 698 F.2d 1181, 1190, fn. omitted.) A passage from <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Webermeier </em>(7th Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 188, 192, about the intentions of Congress in providing for attorney\u2019s fees in civil rights cases applies equally to private parties who contract for payment of those fees: \u201c. . . the line between fees and expenses is arbitrary . . . . It is impossible to believe that Congress would have wanted prevailing parties to get back their lawyers\u2019 local telephone expenses (invariably included in the hourly fee) but not their long-distance expenses (invariably billed separately); or to get back their secretarial expenses\u2014which are included in overhead and therefore billed as part of the lawyer\u2019s hourly rate rather than separately\u2014but not the expenses of word processing, often billed separately to the client.\u201d The following observations are also pertinent to the major expense item in our case: \u201cThe fees and costs of expert witnesses hired in a case are not normally absorbed as overhead in private firm litigation. Even if a firm advances such costs in a contingent fee case, reimbursement from the client\u2019s recovery in addition to the attorney\u2019s contingent fee is usually expected.\u201d <em>(Ramos </em>v. <em>Lamm </em>(10th Cir. 1983) 713 F.2d 546, 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>The provisions of section 1033.5 do not dictate a contrary result. Insofar as counsel\u2019s disbursements are for expenses not included in the list of allowable costs in section 1033.5, subdivision (a), the court has discretion to award them under section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4). (See <em>Winston Square Homeowner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Centex West, Inc. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 282, 293 [261 Cal.Rptr. 605] [\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c) grants \u201cdiscretion to award an item of cost not specifically disallowed\u201d].) Insofar as the disbursements are for costs that are not allowable under section 1033.5, subdivision (b), unless \u201cexpressly authorized by law,\u201d the requisite authority is found in the statutes that authorize contracting parties to stipulate for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021 [leaving \u201cthe measure and mode of compensation of attorneys\u201d to \u201cthe agreement, express or implied, of the parties\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717 [prevailing party on contract providing for attorney\u2019s fees and costs entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin addition to other costs\u201d]; and cf. <em>Ecco-Phoenix Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Howard J. White, Inc. </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 266, 274 [81 Cal.Rptr. 849, 461 P.2d 33] [cost award to be governed by prevailing party statute where contract provision was \u201cinapplicable\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The trial court, of course, may disallow any disbursements of counsel that are not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to the conduct of the litigation (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)), but there can be little dispute about the propriety of the outlay for expert witness\u2019s fees in this case. Although the trial judge did not expressly order the parties to present expert testimony, he openly \u201cinvited\u201d such testimony and suggested on at least five separate occasions prior to trial that such testimony would be helpful in connection with calculations under the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The judgment for plaintiffs on the note is affirmed. The postjudgment order for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is reversed insofar as it disallows the disbursements of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and the case is remanded for a redetermination of those costs in light of this opinion. Plaintiffs are entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal in an amount to be fixed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Anderson, P. J., and Reardon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\"> This inference is based on disallowance of virtually all of the disbursements. Although the judge may perhaps have passed on the \u201creasonable necessity\u201d of the minor expenditures for messenger services and express mail, he apparently concluded that the major expense items could not be allowed under section 1033.5, subdivision (b). This is apparent from the memorandum of decision\u2019s reference to photocopy expenses only for \u201cpresentation to the Court at trial,\u201d and from the transcript of the fee hearing, where the court asked plaintiifs\u2019 counsel, with respect to the expert witness\u2019s fees, how he could \u201cavoid 1033.5 by simply saying that\u2019s a fee, not a cost?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b917-8\">When Civil Code section 1717 was amended in 1987, language at the end of the first paragraph of subdivision (a), indicating that a party prevailing on a contract with an attorney\u2019s fees clause is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin addition to costs <em>and necessary disbursements,\u201d </em>was amended to read simply \u201cin addition to <em>other </em>costs.\u201d (Stats. 1987, ch. 1080, \u00a7 1 [italics supplied to words deleted and added].) We have found nothing in the legislative history of the amendment suggesting that this change was intended to preclude allowance of disbursements in an attorney\u2019s fee award. If the Legislature had determined that agreements to shift certain types of litigation expenses were contrary to public policy, then presumably it would have said so less obliquely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
