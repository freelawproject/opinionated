After his arrest, he was interviewed by a detective with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter. The interpreter did not adequately convey to defendant in Mandarin the detective\u2019s admonitions about defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to the police on Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grounds. Defendant was released on bail shortly after his arrest, and he used his employer-issued laptop computer to prepare numerous documents for his attorneys regarding the charged offenses. He placed these documents in a folder on the computer called \u201cAttorney\u201d and password-protected each of them. The prosecutor subsequently used a subpoena duces tecum to obtain the documents on this laptop computer from defendant\u2019s employer. The trial court found that these documents were not subject to the attorney-client privilege because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents on an employer-issued laptop computer. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the documents and recuse the prosecutor and ruled that the documents could be utilized by the prosecutor at trial. Defendant was convicted by jury trial and committed to state prison for a term of 19 years and 4 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends, among other things, that the trial court prejudicially erred in denying his suppression motion and in finding that the information in the documents on the laptop computer was not protected by the attorney-client privilege. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in denying the motion to suppress defendant\u2019s statement to the police merits reversal and address the attorney-client privilege issue and some of defendant\u2019s other contentions to provide guidance to the trial court in the event of retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Because the issues we resolve in this appeal were all decided in limine, A.\u2019s testimony at the July/August 2002 preliminary hearing provides the appropriate background for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">A. first met defendant in 1998 in China. She met him again in California in November 2001 when a mutual friend introduced them. She knew that defendant was married and had a young child, and defendant knew that A. had a boyfriend. Defendant gave A. his email address. In early December 2001, A. included defendant in an email she sent to a group of friends. She and defendant emailed back and forth over the next few weeks, and defendant offered to take her to lunch as a thank you for her email advice on purchasing a new car.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">On December 22, they met at a caf\u00e9 for lunch. They had a lengthy lunch and \u201ctalked a lot.\u201d A. offered to lend defendant some books to divert him from his loneliness while his wife and child were in China. She brought defendant back to her apartment to pick up the books. Upon arriving at her apartment, she found urgent faxes had arrived that she needed to translate for her boss. A. invited defendant to rest, read or watch a movie while she worked. He chose to rest on her couch. While she was doing her work, defendant approached and started touching her. She gave him a beer and some food and then some sake, and she sat on the couch talking to him. Later she put on a movie. Defendant started touching her again and tried to kiss her. She told him to stop. He poured more sake into his glass and made her drink it. Defendant kissed her, touched her breasts and removed her clothing. She again told him to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Defendant dragged her to her bed and tried to rape her. He held her down, and she unsuccessfully tried to push him away. He put his hand on the outside of her vagina, and he touched his penis to her vagina. Defendant got tired, and A. went to the bathroom and took a bath. After her bath, she offered to drive defendant back to his car, and she did so. She also lent him the books she had recommended earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>The next afternoon, defendant came to her door with a bunch of flowers. She opened the door and asked him what he was doing. He said he wanted to apologize for the previous day, and she admitted him to her apartment. A. admonished him for his behavior on December 22, and he apologized. They talked for 30 or 40 minutes. Eventually she asked him to leave because she was busy. He asked to use her telephone, and then he asked for some water. When she went to get him a bottle of water, he grabbed her from behind and dragged her toward the bed. After stopping briefly on the couch, he pushed her to the bed, held her down and removed her clothes. Defendant also removed his own clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">He tried to kiss her and touched her breasts. Defendant put his fingers in her vagina at least a couple of times. He also put his penis in her vagina. A. was unable to struggle because he was pushing her, but she cried very hard. Defendant ejaculated outside her vagina. Defendant told her that she \u201ccould not sue me for rape because you do not have any evidence.\u201d After some time, A. was able to free herself and go to the bathroom. She took a shower for half an hour and cried. Defendant told her not to cry so loud. She repeatedly asked him to leave, and eventually he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The next day, A. called the mutual friend who had introduced her to defendant and told him that defendant had \u201cdone something very, very bad to me.\u201d She asked him to tell defendant to leave her alone. Defendant continued to email her, telephone her, knock on her door and leave flowers and once a note on her doorstep, but she had no further personal contact with him. Her attempts to block his emails were unsuccessful. She changed her telephone number and moved to a different residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">On January 9, 2001, A. went to the police department and reported \u201csexual harassment\u201d by defendant. A. had told no one about the sexual assaults before she went to the police department, but she had asked friends for advice about \u201csexual harassment.\u201d She did not initially report the sexual assaults to the police, but she subsequently reported the December 23 assaults and later the December 22 assaults. A. was reluctant to report the sexual assaults because, after more than two weeks, she believed that the police would be unable to find any evidence. She finally reported the sexual assaults because she was so afraid of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Defendant was charged by information with forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)), two counts of forcible sexual penetration (Pen. Code, \u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1)), two counts of sexual battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243.4, subd. (a)), assault with intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220) and making annoying telephone calls and electronic communications (Pen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Code, \u00a7 653m, subd. (b)). It was specially alleged that the rape and sexual penetration offenses had occurred in the course of a burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.61, subds. (a), (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The jury deliberated for a day and a half before returning its verdicts. Defendant was convicted of all of the charged counts, but the special allegations were found not true. The court committed defendant to state prison for a term of 19 years and four months. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Anr\">A. Statement to Police</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing to suppress his statement to the police. He asserts that his waiver of his constitutional rights was not knowing and voluntary because the advisements were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Defendant is a native of China who came to the United States in April 2001. Schools in China require students to take six years of English courses in high school and two years in college. While attending one of the best colleges in China between 1990 and 1995, defendant took a single course in \u201cTechnological English\u201d and took a course in Metallurgy that was taught in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Between 1998 and 2000, defendant worked as a project manager in China. His job required him to visit several other Asian countries to negotiate and execute contracts for the export of electronic equipment. During one three-day negotiation in China in 1998, defendant sometimes spoke English to involved individuals who did not speak Mandarin.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Defendant came to the United States to work for Cadence Design Systems. His Cadence employment application was completed in English, and defendant supplied an English version of his resume. Defendant often used English to send brief work-oriented emails and other brief emails to friends.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Cadence-issued laptop computer that defendant used was \u201cdefaulted in English\u201d and had English set as the first language preference for email. Defendant used the laptop to prepare documents in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Defendant usually communicated orally in Mandarin at work because he did not speak English well. This was not a problem because defendant\u2019s coworkers were all from China and usually spoke in Mandarin. His brother, who also worked at Cadence, served as a translator for defendant when one was required. Defendant could write in English \u201cpretty good,\u201d much better than he could speak it.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The charged offenses occurred in December 2001, eight months after defendant\u2019s arrival in the United States. Defendant\u2019s email communications with A. were primarily in English, but their oral communications were always in Mandarin. Detective Joel Witmer arrested defendant on January 15, 2002. At the time of the arrest, Witmer had a \u201cvery brief\u2019 conversation with defendant in English. During the booking process, another officer asked defendant questions in English in order to fill out a \u201cMedical Information Questionnaire.\u201d Defendant responded in English to these questions. With the single exception of \u201csexual preference,\u201d these were simple yes or no questions. The officer testified that defendant did not understand \u201cevery word but he was able to answer the medical questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">After defendant had been booked, Witmer took him into an interview room. While he was bringing defendant to the room, Witmer had a brief conversation with defendant in English. Defendant had \u201csome communication difficulties.\u201d Although Witmer believed that defendant \u201cunderstood basic English,\u201d Witmer \u201crealized that there was a language barrier to some degree that would require an interpreter\u201d because \u201cI was going to need to get a precise conversation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe concept was getting in the specific rights or the Miranda admonition. It was what I considered a complex conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Witmer contacted the \u201cAT&amp;T Interpreter Service\u201d by telephone. A tape recording was made of the conversation between Witmer, the interpreter and defendant beginning at this point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Witmer initially asked the Mandarin interpreter to \u201clet me know if there\u2019s any problem as far as the translation between you two.\u201d Witmer believed that the interpreter was accurately translating what he was saying and that defendant was understanding him. Defendant was in the interview room with Witmer and could hear Witmer. The interpreter, who said her name was Tran, was on the telephone with both Witmer and defendant. Witmer told the interpreter that \u201cbefore we speak to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>him, or before I speak to him, I need to read him his Miranda rights.\u201d The three-way dialogue follows with the portions in Mandarin italicized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201cINTERPRETER: Urn, his, uh, what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201cWITMER: I need to read him his rights.

The following dialogue then occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-22\">\u201cWITMER: Okay, I have some questions I want to ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>\u201cINTERPRETER: <em>He\u2019s going to ask you some questions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">\u201cJIANG: Mm. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">\u201cWITMER: Okay? What is your relationship with [A.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u201cINTERPRETER: <em>What is your relationship with [A.]?\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Defendant responded to this and other questions. Some of his responses were in English, some were in Mandarin, and some were a mixture. Although defendant was able to give brief responses in English at times, his halting attempts to speak English displayed no fluency. At one point, after Witmer had asked a question in English but the inteipreter had not yet translated it, defendant asked the interpreter in Mandarin \u201c[w]hat did he say?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">During the interview, defendant initially denied that he had had \u201can affair\u201d with anyone. He admitted that he had been to A.\u2019s apartment two or three times. Defendant then admitted that he had \u201ckissed\u201d A. but \u201cI did not formally have sex with her.\u201d He said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d about the incident because he was married and had been drunk at the time. Defendant also admitted returning to A.\u2019s apartment the day after their first sexual encounter. On this second occasion, he \u201cheld her . . . got in bed, and then kissed her.\u201d Defendant said \u201cshe did not refuse me.\u201d Defendant admitted that he had touched A.\u2019s breasts, but he adamantly denied that they had actually completed an act of sexual intercourse. He claimed that they did not complete the act because A. was afraid of getting pregnant, and he prematurely ejaculated. Defendant said that after the attempted intercourse he placed his finger in A.\u2019s vagina to give her \u201can orgasm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Defendant said he engaged in these acts with A. because he \u201cfelt very sorry for her\u201d and had \u201csexual relations with her\u201d to \u201cmake her happy.\u201d Defendant said it was \u201chard to say\u201d whether A. \u201cask[ed] for it,\u201d but \u201cshe did not refuse.\u201d When Witmer accused defendant of \u201cforcing]\u201d A. to have sex, defendant said (in Mandarin): \u201cI didn\u2019t force her. But, I mean, she also, I mean, I couldn\u2019t say that it was playacting, but, it\u2019s, saying that she pushed me away, she also-also-also was grabbing me.\u201d He claimed that A. grabbed his shoulder and \u201cplayed with\u201d a piece of jade \u201con my chest.\u201d The tape recording of the interview appears to end prior to the completion of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">On a subsequent day, Witmer had a brief conversation in English with defendant, and defendant appeared to understand him. The remainder of that conversation was translated for defendant by defendant\u2019s boss.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to Witmer on <em>Miranda </em>grounds was granted by the magistrate at the July 2002 preliminary hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>In April 2003, defendant moved to suppress the statement on the same grounds at trial. The trial court held an Evidence Code section 402 in limine hearing at which evidence was presented by the prosecutor and the defense regarding the admissibility of the statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">A Mandarin interpreter testified at the hearing that Chinese people tend to use the word \u201cyes\u201d to mean \u201ccontinue\u201d rather than meaning \u201cI agree.\u201d Yun Xiang Yan, an anthropology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, testified at the hearing as an expert on Chinese culture. Yan had studied the relationship between individuals and the government in China. Because most Chinese citizens \u201care afraid of [the] police force,\u201d it is \u201cout of the question\u201d for them to refuse to respond to police questions. Such a refusal subjects a person to punishment in China. Chinese citizens who come to the United States are even more fearful of the police here.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The prosecutor conceded that defendant had a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201climited\u201d understanding of English. She also conceded that the interpreter utilized by Witmer \u201cdidn\u2019t get it perfect,\u201d but she argued that the translations of three of the four advisements were \u201csufficient\u201d and the translation of the fourth advisement was only inadequate because defendant interrupted the interpreter to tell Witmer, in English, that he understood. She argued that defendant had \u201cenough understanding of basic English to have understood\u201d the portion of that advisement that was not translated by the interpreter. The prosecutor asserted that, although the interpreter \u201cuses some unfortunate word choices,\u201d the right to an attorney had been adequately conveyed to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The trial court found that the interpreter\u2019s failure to use \u201cmagic words\u201d did not invalidate the advisements. The court noted that there were points in the interview when \u201cdefendant either interrupts or answers the questions directly without the aid of interpretation.\u201d The court also noted that \u201cwhen he is first advised by the interpreter of Detective Witmer\u2019s need to read him his rights, the defendant launches into an explanation.\u201d \u201cSo when you take all of these things into consideration, the fact that he has work experience at the Department of Export. He\u2019s engaged in the export of electronic equipment and projects for military use and has visited Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, India. Is a project manager, to execute contracts and those contracts were conducted in English, which is the testimony I\u2019ve been provided. [][] English was spoken with at least the Pakistanian contract that you heard testimony about. Taking into consideration his highly educated background, when you put all of those things together and viewing them in the totality of the circumstances, ... the court is going to find that the People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>have met their burden and the court finds that the defendant made a knowing intelligent, free and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">\u201cAn appellate court applies the independent or de nova standard of review, which by its nature is nondeferential, to a trial court\u2019s granting or denial of a motion to suppress a statement under <em>Miranda </em>insofar as the trial court\u2019s underlying decision entails a measurement of the facts against the law. [Citations.] As for each of the subordinate determinations, it employs the test appropriate thereto. That is to say, it examines independently the resolution of a pure question of law; it scrutinizes for substantial evidence the resolution of a pure question of fact; it examines independently the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly legal; and it scrutinizes for substantial evidence the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly factual.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 730 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) \u201c[W]e accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluation of credibility, if supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.] Although we independently determine whether, from the undisputed facts and those properly found by the trial court, the challenged statements were illegally obtained, [citation] we \u2018 \u201cgive great weight to the considered conclusions of a lower court that has previously reviewed the same evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Wash </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 215, 235-236 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 421, 861 P.2d 1107].)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">\u201cA translation of a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights need not be perfect if the defendant understands that he or she need not speak to the police, that any statement made may be used against him or her, that he or she has a right to an attorney, and that an attorney will be appointed if he or she cannot afford one.\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 93 F.3d 1493, 1502.) \u201cWhether there has been a valid waiver depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the background, experience, and conduct of defendant. [Citations.] The age of the defendant is one factor in applying the totality test. [Citation.] Similarly, any language difficulties encountered by the defendant are considered to determine if there has been a valid waiver. [Citations.] There is a presumption against waiver, and the burden of showing a valid waiver is on the prosecutor.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Bernard S. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 749, 751-752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">\u201c[A]fter the required warnings are given the accused, \u2018[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u2019 . . . [T]he question whether the accused waived his rights \u2018is not one of form, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u2019 Thus, the determination whether statements obtained during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to forgo his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(Fare v. Michael C. </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 707, 724-725 [61 L.Ed.2d 197, 99 S.Ct. 2560], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Initially, we must decide whether the interpreter\u2019s translation adequately informed defendant of his rights. The tape clearly demonstrates that defendant was informed in Mandarin of his right to remain silent and that he acknowledged his understanding of that right. At that point, the interpreter\u2019s translation diverged from Witmer\u2019s enunciation of defendant\u2019s rights. Although Witmer gave the remaining advisements accurately in English, the interpreter did not accurately or completely translate those advisements into Mandarin for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">First, the interpreter did not translate most of Witmer\u2019s advisement that anything defendant said could be used against him in court. Instead, she merely translated the first three words of this advisement into Mandarin and then stopped when defendant said \u201cYes.\u201d She then asked him in Mandarin if he understood, and he said he did, but it is impossible to discern what it was that he was acknowledging that he understood. While \u201c[a] suspect may not \u2018out Mirandize\u2019 the police by reciting his <em>Miranda </em>rights before the officer has admonished him and later claim the admonition was defective\u201d <em>(People v. Nitschmann </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 677, 683 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 325]), a suspect who merely interjects a \u201cYes\u201d in the midst of a translation does not demonstrate any understanding of the as-yet-untranslated portion of the advisement. This is particularly true where a suspect with a poor understanding of English may have understood the English word \u201cYes\u201d to mean \u201ccontinue\u201d rather than to signify an understanding of the English advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Second, the interpreter badly mangled Witmer\u2019s advisement regarding defendant\u2019s right to counsel. She did not tell defendant that he had a right to have an attorney present during questioning. The interpreter\u2019s translation of Witmer\u2019s advisement inaccurately told defendant in Mandarin that he had a right to \u201cuse an attorney, uh, before and after, proceedings . . . .\u201d This advisement wholly omitted any reference to a right to the presence of an attorney during questioning. An uninformed suspect, particularly one from a foreign country, might well perceive \u201cproceedings\u201d to refer only to formal hearings in court rather than to a police interview. And the reference to \u201cbefore and after\u201d rather than \u201cduring\u201d increased rather than diminished the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>potential for misunderstanding. As given in Mandarin, this advisement appeared to tell defendant that he had a right to \u201cuse\u201d an attorney before and after court hearings rather than the right to have an attorney present during a police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">This is not like the admonition in <em>Wash. </em>In that case, the California Supreme Court held that an admonition that the suspect has a right to counsel \u201cbefore\u201d questioning is not \u201cso ambiguous or confusing as to lead defendant to believe that counsel would be provided before questioning, and then summarily removed once questioning began.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wash, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 236.) Here, however, the reference to \u201cbefore and after\u201d was coupled with \u201cproceedings\u201d rather than \u201cquestioning,\u201d and the overall effect was a perceived restriction of the right to counsel to formal court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Third, the interpreter\u2019s translation of the final advisement was also inaccurate. She told defendant that, if he was unable to afford an attorney, Witmer could \u201cappoint one for you, and then before you are questioned, you ... he can pay . . . can provide you with an attorney.\u201d This mutilated advisement told defendant that the police officer could select an attorney for him. The inaccurate Mandarin advisement also was ambiguous about who would pay the attorney: \u201cyou ... he can pay.\u201d While this advisement actually mentioned \u201cbefore you are questioned,\u201d this phrase was severed from any meaning because it was unclear whether this referred to the time of payment or the time of provision of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">As the Mandarin translations of three of the four advisements were hopelessly inadequate, we are forced to conclude that defendant was not validly informed of his rights <em>in Mandarin. </em>The next question is whether the prosecution proved that defendant was adequately informed of his rights through the accurate <em>English </em>advisements notwithstanding the inaccuracies in the Mandarin translations of those advisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">There was considerable evidence that defendant was an educated man who had taken English courses in China and was capable of writing brief emails and documents in English. However, the only evidence of his ability to <em>speak </em>English and <em>understand spoken English </em>indicated that his skills were rudimentary. Indeed, the prosecutor <em>conceded </em>that defendant had only a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201climited\u201d understanding of English. Her contention was that defendant\u2019s limited knowledge of English was sufficient for him to credit Witmer\u2019s English advisements over the inaccurate and incomplete Mandarin translations of those advisements given by the interpreter. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">It defies logic to expect a suspect who has a poor understanding of English to credit his own limited understanding of advisements given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>English over the version translated into his native language by a person purporting to be a fluent interpreter. Certainly the prosecutor failed to meet her burden of proving this doubtful proposition. We must therefore conclude that defendant was not adequately and accurately advised of his constitutional rights. Consequently, any waiver was not knowing, and the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s statement into evidence at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The Attorney General asserts in a single brief paragraph, which is devoid of citation to the record or any authority, that the admission of defendant\u2019s statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. He claims that the statement was actually helpful to defendant\u2019s case at trial because it contained the only evidence supporting his consent defense. The statement was actually quite incriminating. Defendant admitted engaging in all of the charged sexual activities, and his statements regarding consent were very weak. Nor is it correct that the statement was the only evidence supportive of defendant\u2019s consent defense. The email exchanges between defendant and A. after the charged offenses could be construed as supporting his defense, and supportive inferences also could have been drawn from A.\u2019s failure to initially report any illegal sexual activity even when she belatedly contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">A trial court error in failing to exclude a statement on <em>Miranda </em>grounds is subject to harmless error review under <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824], <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 33 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673].) \u201cThe beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of <em>Chapman </em>\u2018requires] the beneficiary of a [federal] constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Neal </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 63, 86 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 650, 72 P.3d 280].) The one-paragraph argument by the Attorney General is not sufficient to satisfy his burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It follows that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">B. Attorney-client Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">We reverse the judgment because the trial court erred in failing to suppress defendant\u2019s statement to the Witmer. We also need to address defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his recusal/suppression motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>based on the prosecutor\u2019s acquisition of defendant\u2019s attorney-client information because the issue of the recusal of the prosecutor and/or the suppression of this information may arise again if this matter is retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In connection with his prospective employment by Cadence, defendant signed an \u201cEmployee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement\u201d in August 2000. One provision of this four-page document, which was in English, was the following: \u201c8. NON-PRIVATE NATURE OF COMPANY PROPERTY. I understand that I have no expectation of privacy in the voicemail and electronic mail provided to me by the Company or in any property situated on the Company\u2019s premises and/or owned by the Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas. I further understand that such property, including voicemail and electronic mail, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Defendant was arrested on January 15, 2002. He was initially represented by Richard Pointer. Defendant was released on bail on January 25, 2002. In February 2002, defendant\u2019s first Cadence-issued laptop computer was seized from him pursuant to a search warrant. In March 2002, Terrence Daily replaced Pointer as defendant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">On May 16, 2002, the prosecutor issued a subpoena duces tecum to Cadence. This subpoena sought \u201cAll correspondence in English that [defendant] authored and wrote including, but not limited to e.mails [\u00bf7c], memos, and other work related documents.\u201d The declared purpose of the subpoena was to obtain evidence of defendant\u2019s understanding of and ability to communicate in the English language. Cadence was directed to deliver these documents to the court under seal. After the issuance of this subpoena, Daily contacted the prosecutor to express his concern that the subpoena sought documents on defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer that were privileged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecutor assured Daily that she would notify Cadence not to include any documents \u201caddressed to\u201d an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Cadence provided a CD and printed documents to the court in June 2002. The CD contained documents and emails from defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer. The prosecutor represented to Daily and the court that the printed documents represented all of the contents of the CD. The court and Daily reviewed the printed documents. Defendant was not present when they did so. Daily found no privileged documents. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>released the documents and the CD to the prosecutor, who was to provide a copy to Daily. She gave Daily copies of the documents and CD on June 27, 2002. Her transmittal letter stated that she was providing \u201cSubpoenaed records from Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\u201d and a \u201cCD Rom of those same records.\u201d Daily never looked at the CD and had no idea that it contained any documents other than the electronic versions of the printed documents he had reviewed in court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was the only CD that the prosecutor ever provided to Daily.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The preliminary hearing began on July 31, 2002. On August 1, 2002, defendant was bound over for trial. In September or October 2002, the prosecutor reviewed the CD and noticed that there were \u201cfourteen block[ed] access documents\u201d on it that had not been included in the printed documents. These documents were not segregated or otherwise specially designated on the CD. They were simply listed along with the other Microsoft Word documents. The prosecutor believed that Cadence had blocked access to these files. She did not inform Daily of her discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In January 2003, Jaime Harmon replaced Daily as defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Harmon received a CD from Dailey when he transmitted his file to her. She believed that this CD contained emails found on defendant\u2019s first laptop computer. In February 2003, Harmon received a CD from the prosecutor that contained the emails from defendant\u2019s first laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In March 2003, the prosecutor contacted Cadence\u2019s attorney and asked him to obtain the \u201caccess code\u201d for the documents she had discovered on the CD but not among the printed documents. When the prosecutor\u2019s investigator examined the CD, the investigator reported that \u201c[s]everal documents were password protected due to possible \u2018attomey/client\u2019 privilege and were not viewed.\u201d The prosecutor received the password from Cadence on April 10, 2003 but did not look at it immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">On April 14, the prosecutor first disclosed the existence of \u201cblocked access\u201d documents. She told the court and Harmon that her office had received the \u201caccess code\u201d for 14 files to which defendant had blocked access, but she had not looked at the access code or opened the files. This disclosure occurred during a discussion of the proposed testimony of a defense expert. Harmon had asked the prosecutor how she had acquired the expert\u2019s report. In the course of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the prosecutor made the following statement. \u201cAlso in light of several of the e-mails that were provided pursuant to the S.D.T. [subpoena duces tecum] or the documents that I pointed out in my 402 hearing, that the defendant put a block on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>if you read those titles, it\u2019s pretty clear, at least it\u2019s strongly suggestive, that those are the documents that were provided to Dr. Yan to form his opinion. So everybody has got them but me, your honor.\u201d Harmon explained that Yan, the expert, had been given \u201ca statement prepared by my client to Mr. Daily apparently and then turned over as a means of orienting Dr. Yan to the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">On April 16, during the hearing on the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement to the police, the prosecutor had the CD marked as an exhibit and admitted into evidence. She then asked her investigator if she had found any files on the CD \u201cthat were blocked.\u201d The investigator said yes. The prosecutor asked the investigator if she was \u201cable to open them up.\u201d The investigator said \u201c[n]ot with conventional methods, no. So I did not.\u201d On cross-examination, the investigator testified that it was her understanding that the documents on the CD came from Cadence\u2019s server rather than from defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop. The prosecutor did not ask the court to look at the documents on the CD.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The prosecutor decided on her own that there was \u201cno attorney-client privilege\u201d to any documents on the CD because \u201cit was a work computer and they were not e-mails.\u201d On April 23, the prosecutor informed Harmon off-the-record that she \u201cdid not believe that there was a privilege\u201d and \u201cwould use the access code\u201d to open the files and provide copies to Harmon. Harmon believed that the prosecutor was referring to emails she had already seen, and she said she might object to admissibility. The following colloquy occurred on the record. \u201cMS. RAABE [the prosecutor]: . . . [][] The first matter, Your Honor, that in the previous 402 hearing I made mention that there were several files that were provided on the Cadence CD that were blocked by an access code. I informed counsel and the Court in chambers that the access code was actually placed on the documents by the defendant. I have not accessed those documents until I let the Court know that I was going to be using the password provided by Cadence to access those documents. I will print them out and provide a copy to counsel if they are relevant. I will be seeking to use them in this jury trial. I actually don\u2019t know what they contain. I want to make it clear that I am proceeding. I do not believe that they are privileged in any way. They are basically documents that were left by the defendant in a public place. [][] THE COURT: Certainly we can take that under submission until such time you have had an opportunity to research any objections counsel may have as to those documents.\u201d Harmon made no comment in response to this statement. She mistakenly believed that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a CD referred to the CD of emails from defendant\u2019s first Cadence-issued laptop. The prosecutor believed that Harmon\u2019s lack of objection meant that she was not claiming that there was any privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>Later that day, the prosecutor used the password provided by Cadence to open the files and read portions of them. On April 28, copies of the documents were made available to Harmon, and Harmon received them on April 29. When Harmon received these documents, she immediately informed the prosecutor that these documents \u201cwere privileged communications\u201d between defendant and his former attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">On April 30, during in limine motions, the following colloquy occurred. \u201cMS. RAABE: And then my last in limine, your honor, is the one that I provided today. And that involves the documents that I just recently provided to counsel which are the \u2014 [f] MS. HARMON: Your honor, before there\u2019s any evidence about these documents on the record, I think we need to have a hearing about the fact that the district attorney has the documents in the first place, because it is our position that these documents] are attorney-client privileged.\u201d The prosecutor claimed that the documents were not privileged and stated that she intended to \u201cuse those documents [for impeachment] at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">At Harmon\u2019s request, the court held a hearing on the claim of privilege.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court considered testimony at the hearing, exhibits introduced at the hearing and the declarations submitted by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Defendant\u2019s wife testified that she, defendant\u2019s sister-in-law and defendant\u2019s boss and sometimes an interpreter acted as conduits between defendant and his attorneys Pointer and Daily because his attorneys could not understand defendant and needed these other people to translate for defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pointer asked defendant to prepare documents regarding the case, and defendant did so. Defendant wrote down in Mandarin or told his wife what he wanted to convey to his attorney, and his wife produced documents on defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer containing the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>tian defendant wished to convey to his attorney. Defendant\u2019s brother also assisted in the preparation of some of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The documents were printed out and given to defendant\u2019s attorneys.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These documents were created between February and June 2002 and amounted to 70 printed pages. Each document was password-protected with a password known only to defendant and his wife, and the documents were kept on the laptop in a folder called \u201cAttorney.\u201d The reason for the password protection was to prevent \u201canyone else except our attorney\u201d from seeing the documents. Pointer\u2019s investigator had told defendant and his wife to keep defendant\u2019s communications with Pointer \u201cin a confidential manner and a clearly marked manner\u201d so that they would remain \u201csecret.\u201d The investigator suggested that defendant make a folder on his computer and \u201cmark it attorney-client privilege.\u201d When Daily replaced Pointer as defendant\u2019s attorney, Pointer gave Daily the documents that defendant had prepared for Pointer, and Daily treated these documents as attorney-client privileged documents. Daily assured defendant that no privileged documents would be turned over to the prosecution by Cadence because \u201cwe had a double level, a filtering level, first Judge Garibaldi and then me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Cadence\u2019s attorney testified that the prosecutor had contacted him about \u201ca block on some of the documents that were on the CD.\u201d She mentioned that \u201cshe believed there was an issue or discussion with defense counsel that there may be privileged documents on the CD.\u201d He informed her that the password protection had been placed on the documents by defendant rather than by Cadence. When Cadence supplied the prosecutor with the password, Cadence\u2019s attorney believed that the documents would only be released by court order if they were found not to be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The prosecutor argued that the documents had never been privileged. She urged that the court \u201cneeds to look at what is society going to protect in terms of confidentiality, a reasonable person standard of whether or not there\u2019s a reasonable expectation of privacy in that laptop computer . . Copies left in, basically, a public area . . . cannot be privileged.\u201d She also argued that defendant\u2019s failure to object on April 23 when she told the court and counsel that she was going to open the documents constituted a waiver of the privilege. Harmon argued that the prosecutor had violated Penal Code section 1326 and that defendant had a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy in things that were on his hard drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">The court found that the documents were not privileged. \u201cI\u2019m making a ruling as to whether or not the defendant had a reasonable expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>privacy at the time he put them in the second laptop and whether or not he waived any privilege.\u201d \u201c[T]he court concludes that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in said documents, any privileges that existed were waived by the defendant\u2019s own conduct.\" \u201c[T]he manner in which he acted, he knew at the time that the laptop was subject to search warrant, that was on the first one. [][] He nevertheless undertook, by his own conduct, he placed the documents in a second laptop that was issued by Cadence. He could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the documents.\u201d The court deemed irrelevant \u201cdefendant\u2019s inability to understand the language or .. . criminal rules of procedure or anything of that nature\u201d The court ruled that \u201csaid materials may be used as permitted by the Evidence Code for all purposes.\u201d The court refused to rule on whether the prosecutor had violated Penal Code section 1326.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Attorney General maintains that the information in the documents on defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer was not privileged because the Cadence \u201cEmployee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement\u201d signed by defendant eliminated any reasonable expectation of privacy in any documents on that laptop. He also argues that defendant \u201cwaived any privilege\u201d by failing to object on April 23 when the prosecutor stated that she was going to open some documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">A trial court ruling rejecting a claim of attorney-client privilege is ordinarily reviewed for substantial evidence where there are conflicting facts or inferences. <em>(People v. Gionis </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1208 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 456, 892 P.2d 1199].) \u201c[The] appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the [ruling] the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reilly </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 421, 425 [90 Cal.Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649].) However, even when exercising substantial evidence review, the appellate court \u201cmust exercise its independent judgment in applying the particular legal standard to the facts as found.\u201d <em>(People v. Butler </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1119, 1127 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 730, 79 P.3d 1036].)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Here, almost all of the essential facts are undisputed, so we exercise our independent judgment in deciding whether the trial court correctly applied the applicable legal standard to the undisputed facts.

Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 591, 600 [208 Cal.Rptr. 886, 691 P.2d 642], fn. omitted.) The attorney-client privilege has been statutorily defined by the Legislature. \u201c \u2018[Confidential communication between client and lawyer\u2019 means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted, and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 952.)  We are bound by the statutory limits of this privilege because \u201cthe privileges contained in the Evidence Code are <em>exclusive </em>and the courts are not free to create new privileges as a matter of judicial policy.\u201d <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977]; see <em>Roberts v. City of Palmdale </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 363, 373 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 330, 853 P.2d 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\u201cWhenever a privilege is claimed on the ground that the matter sought to be disclosed is a communication made in confidence in the course of the lawyer-client . . . relationship, the communication is presumed to have been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the burden of proof to establish that the communication was not confidential.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 917, subd. (a).) \u201cThe effect of a presumption affecting the burden of proof is to impose upon the party against whom it operates the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">a. Existence of Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The password-protected electronic documents on defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer indisputably contained information that defendant prepared at the direction of his attorney for his attorney and transmitted to his attorney.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By proffering evidence that these electronic documents were password-protected and placed in a folder called \u201cAttorney\u201d for the explicit purpose of protecting them from disclosure, defendant satisfied the initial evidentiary burden imposed on privilege claimants. (Cf. <em>People v. Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 655 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>[marital communication privilege].) The burden then shifted to the prosecutor to overcome the Evidence Code section 917, subdivision (a) presumption and prove that these documents were <em>not </em>confidential. The prosecutor attempted to do so by relying on the simple fact that defendant had signed the Cadence \u201cEmployee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement,\u201d which gave Cadence the right to inspect the laptop. She claimed that this agreement established that documents on the laptop were not confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The Attorney General relies on <em>TBG Ins. Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 155] <em>(TBG) </em>to support this proposition. <em>TBG </em>was an action by an employee against his employer for wrongful termination after the employee was terminated for repeatedly accessing pornography on the Internet using his employer-issued office computer. The employee had signed the employer\u2019s computer use policy agreeing not to use any employer-issued computers for nonbusiness purposes without express approval. He had also agreed in this document that his computer use could be monitored by the employer, that any communications transmitted using the employer-issued computers were \u201cnot private\u201d and that he could be fired for misusing the employer-issued computers. <em>(TBG, </em>at p. 446.) The policy also stated that the employer\u2019s monitoring would \u201c \u2018include the review, copying or deletion of messages, or the disclosure of such messages or files to other authorized persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>(TBG, </em>at p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In defending against the employee\u2019s lawsuit, the employer sought production of a second employer-issued computer that the employee had been using at his home. <em>(TBG, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at pp. 446-447.) The employee objected and claimed that the production of the computer would violate his constitutional right to privacy. <em>(TBG, </em>at p. 447.) The trial court refused to compel production of the home computer, and the employer sought writ relief. <em>(TBG, </em>at pp. 447-448.) The Second District concluded that the employee\u2019s agreement that the computer\u2019s contents were not private defeated his claim that he had a protected privacy interest in the contents of the computer. <em>(TBG, </em>at p. 452.) Nevertheless, the Second District permitted the employee on remand to seek a protective order shielding his personal information on the computer from disclosure to <em>TBG.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\"><em>TBG </em>had nothing to do with any <em>privileged </em>information, and there was no evidence that the employee had made any efforts to protect the personal information or segregate it from other files. The policy document signed by the employee in <em>TBG </em>was directly aimed at <em>precluding personal use </em>of an employer-issued computer and reserving the employer\u2019s right to <em>review, copy and disclose </em>any files found on the computer. Our case involves a statutorily-defined privilege. The agreement signed by defendant did not preclude personal use of the computer or mention anything about Cadence copying or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>disclosing the contents of the computer. Defendant made substantial efforts to protect the documents from disclosure by password-protecting them and segregating them in a clearly marked and designated folder. <em>TBG </em>did not find that the employee lacked all privacy interest in the personal information on the computer. The Second District\u2019s disposition permitted the employee to avoid disclosure of his personal information by seeking a protective order. <em>(TBG, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at pp. 454-455.) <em>TBG </em>is simply inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Von Villas </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 175 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 112] is also readily distinguishable. In <em>Von Villas, </em>the Second District held that the defendant\u2019s loud conversation with his wife in the jail visiting room with a guard obviously nearby was not protected by the marital communication privilege. <em>(Von Villas, </em>at pp. 220-221.) Defendant did not attempt to communicate privileged information in jail or by yelling in the presence of others. He placed attorney-client information on a laptop computer issued to him, password-protected that information and segregated it in a folder that clearly identified it as confidential. <em>Von Villas </em>tells us nothing of any relevance to our inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Even if we assume that the trial court properly used an objective standard to evaluate the confidentiality of defendant\u2019s attorney-client information, we are convinced that defendant\u2019s belief in the confidentiality of his attorney-client information was an objectively reasonable one.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nothing in the agreement defendant signed would have suggested to a reasonable person that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Cadence would make any effort to gain access to information in documents on an employee\u2019s Cadence-issued computer that were clearly segregated as personal and password-protected. The agreement was designed to protect Cadence\u2019s intellectual property, not to invade the privacy of its employees. And nothing in the Cadence agreement barred employees from using their employer-issued computers for personal matters. Under the circumstances of this case, it was objectively reasonable for defendant to expect that attorney-client information in the password-protected documents he placed in a segregated folder marked \u201cAttorney\u201d on his Cadence-issued laptop would remain confidential.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">b. Waiver of Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The Attorney General contends that, even if the documents were originally privileged, this privilege was waived by Harmon and defendant when they failed to object on April 23 after the prosecutor said that she was going to open the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number><em>Harmon </em>did not waive <em>defendant\u2019s </em>attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege \u201cis waived with respect to a communication protected by the privilege if any holder of the privilege, without coercion, has disclosed a significant part of the communication or has consented to disclosure made by anyone. Consent to disclosure is manifested by any statement or other conduct of the holder of the privilege indicating consent to the disclosure, including <em>failure to claim the privilege in any proceeding in which the holder has the legal standing and opportunity to claim the privilege.\u201d </em>(Evid. Code, \u00a7 912, subd. (a), italics added.) \u201cSubject to Section 912 and except as otherwise provided in this article, <em>the client, </em>whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between client and lawyer if the privilege is claimed by; [\u00b6] (a) The holder of the privilege.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 954, italics added.)  \u201cSection 912, subdivision (a), <em>supra, </em>contemplates a waiver only when the holder of the privilege . . . reveals a significant part of the communication, consents to disclosure, or fails to object when he has the opportunity. The disclosure of the communication by [the attorney], unless done with the consent of the [client], will not, therefore, constitute a waiver of the privilege under section 912.\u201d <em>(Roberts v. Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 341 [107 Cal.Rptr. 309, 508 P.2d 309], citation omitted [psychotherapist-patient privilege].) The prosecutor produced no evidence that defendant had consented to Harmon waiving the privilege or authorized Harmon to waive his privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The prosecutor also did not prove that defendant failed to claim the privilege when he had an opportunity to do so. Defendant, through Daily, made a timely assertion of privilege to the documents on his second Cadence-issued laptop computer shortly after the subpoena issued in May 2002. The prosecutor assured Daily that no attorney-client documents would be included, and Daily repeated this assurance to defendant. The prosecutor subsequently represented that the printed documents constituted the entire content of the CD. Daily carefully reviewed the printed documents in June 2002 and found no privileged documents. He and defendant were thereby lulled into believing that the attorney-client privileged documents on defendant\u2019s laptop had not been produced by Cadence and were not on the CD. Daily was computer-illiterate and never looked at the CD itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">These facts distinguish this case from <em>People v. Gillard </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 136 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 790]. In <em>Gillard, </em>the seized documents were \u201cheld under seal to allow Gillard to file a motion to suppress or to seek return of the materials . . . .\u201d <em>(Gillard, </em>at p. 164.) When \u201c[n]o motion or objection was filed[,] ... the file was released to the prosecution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, Daily preserved defendant\u2019s privilege by interposing a timely privilege objection while the documents were under seal and carefully reviewing the printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>documents, and he failed to protect the information only because the prosecutor provided him with misleading information.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">When the prosecutor discovered in September or October 2002 that the CD contained additional documents, she did not notify defendant or Daily (or Harmon) that her earlier representations had turned out to be wrong. Nor did she apprise defendant or Harmon when she contacted Cadence in March 2003 and asked that the password protection be broken even though her own investigator believed that the documents had been \u201cpassword protected due to possible \u2018attomey/client\u2019 privilege.\u201d At the April 16 hearing on the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement to Witmer, the prosecutor\u2019s investigator testified that it was her understanding that the documents on the CD came from Cadence\u2019s server rather than from defendant\u2019s Cadence-issued laptop. This testimony was consistent with defendant\u2019s previous understanding that Cadence had not produced the privileged documents on defendant\u2019s laptop in response to the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">On April 23, the prosecutor told Harmon that there were \u201cseveral files that were provided on the Cadence CD that were blocked by an access code\u201d that \u201cwas actually placed on the documents by the defendant.\u201d She explained that she had \u201cnot accessed those documents\u201d and did not \u201cbelieve that they are privileged in any way.\u201d She also said: \u201cThey are basically documents that were left by the defendant in a public place.\u201d While the prosecutor\u2019s statements might have been interpreted to refer to the privileged documents, her assertions that the documents were not \u201cprivileged in any way\u201d and had been \u201cleft by the defendant in a public place\u201d were consistent with defendant\u2019s preexisting understanding that the privileged documents had not been produced by Cadence (and therefore were not on the CD) and that the CD contained only those documents that had been on Cadence\u2019s server rather than on defendant\u2019s Cadence-issued laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">And the court\u2019s response to the prosecutor\u2019s statement seemed to assure defendant that any objections at that time would be premature. The court\u2019s statement was not clear enough that a layperson would have known whether the court was taking \u201cunder submission\u201d the issue of admissibility or the issue of access to the documents. The fact that the court delayed any ruling \u201cuntil such time you have had an opportunity to research any objections counsel may have as to those documents\u201d could have provided defendant with further reassurance that it was not necessary to object at this time. And defendant could not rely on Harmon to understand that an objection was necessary. Harmon mistakenly believed that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a CD referred to the CD of emails from defendant\u2019s first Cadence-issued laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Taken in context, the undisputed evidence establishes that the absence of an objection by Harmon or defendant on April 23 did not amount to a consent to disclosure of the privileged information. This is unlike the situation in <em>Calvert v. State Bar </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 765 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 684, 819 P.2d 424] where the holder of the privilege was deemed to have waived the privilege when, after the privilege issue was raised at a hearing, the holder consulted with her attorney regarding the issue and did not instruct the attorney to claim the privilege. <em>(Calvert </em>at p. 780.) The April 23 proceedings did not unambiguously raise the privilege issue because the prosecutor\u2019s statements did not clearly describe which documents were at issue, and a reasonable layperson could have understood the court\u2019s statement to reserve any claim of privilege for later resolution. Therefore, the prosecutor failed to prove that defendant waived his privilege as to the information in these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the information in the password-protected documents on the second laptop was not privileged and in concluding that the privilege was waived. Defendant seeks (and sought below) recusal of the prosecutor and the district attorney\u2019s office and suppression of the documents. Obviously suppression of these privileged documents is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">\u201cUndeniably there are circumstances in which the participation of a district attorney in a criminal trial as prosecutor would be improper.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Greer) </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 255, 261 [137 Cal.Rptr. 476, 561 R2d 1164] <em>(Greer).) </em>The district attorney\u2019s possession of a criminal defendant\u2019s confidential attorney-client information regarding the charged offenses is a proper basis for disqualifying the district attorney from participating in the prosecution to ensure a fair trial. (Cf. <em>Greer, </em>at pp. 261-262; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>WPS, Inc. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 644, 656-657 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 799]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128, subd. (a).) Because the trial court found that the documents were not privileged, it did not consider whether the prosecutor\u2019s perusal of these privileged documents merited disqualification of her or of the entire district attorney\u2019s office. Should the district attorney\u2019s office elect to retry this case, the trial court shall hold a hearing to consider whether recusal of the prosecutor or the district attorney\u2019s office is merited due to the prosecutor\u2019s exposure to the privileged attorney-client information.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">C.

If the prosecution elects to retry defendant, the trial court shall suppress defendant\u2019s statement to Witmer, and it shall also suppress the information in the password-protected privileged documents obtained from defendant\u2019s second Cadence-issued laptop computer. It shall also hold a hearing on whether to recuse the prosecutor or the district attorney\u2019s office due to the prosecutor\u2019s exposure to the privileged information.

We believe that the statutory scheme does not support the application of an objective standard to determining whether an attorney-client communication was in confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">First, Evidence Code section 952 defines the attorney-client privilege in terms that explicitly depend on the client\u2019s subjective awareness. An attorney-client communication is \u201cin confidence\u201d if the \u201cmeans\u201d by which the \u201cinformation\u201d was \u201ctransmitted\u201d do not <em>\u201cso far as the client is aware\u201d </em>disclose the information to unnecessary third parties. The marital privilege, which has been held subject to an objective \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickey, supra, </em>54 Cal.Sd 612, 654-655), is not statutorily defined in terms of the communicant\u2019s subjective awareness. The marital communication privilege protects a communication that was \u201cmade in confidence.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 980.) By defining the confidential nature of an attorney-client communication in terms of the client\u2019s subjective awareness, the Legislature explicitly rejected an objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Second, the Legislature\u2019s recent enactment of Evidence Code section 917, subdivision (b), while not directly applicable here, suggests that the Legislature did not intend to preclude the attorney-client privilege from extending to stored electronic versions of what otherwise would be confidential communications simply because certain third parties may technically have access to these stored versions. Evidence Code section 917, subdivision (b) provides that a privileged communication \u201cdoes not lose its privileged character for the sole reason that it is communicated by electronic means or because persons involved in the delivery, facilitation, or storage of electronic communication may have access to the content of the communication.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 917, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"AxI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>It is true that Evidence Code section 917, subdivision (b) applies only to communications \u201cby electronic means\u201d and therefore does not strictly apply to these communications between defendant and his attorney since these communications culminated in a non-electronic transmission. But it hardly makes sense to ascribe to the Legislature the intent to provide more protection for information in an electronic document that is transmitted electronically than for information in an electronic document that is printed out and physically transmitted. In the modem world, the use of computers to prepare documents for either physical or electronic transmittal is nearly universal. Today\u2019s technology practically precludes the complete destruction of an electronic copy of a document. Even when a electronic document has been \u201cdeleted,\u201d all or a remnant of the document frequently remains on a computer. The Legislature\u2019s decision to mandate protection for electronic communications that necessarily may be accessible by disinterested third parties suggests that this type of access is not viewed by the Legislature as destroying the confidential nature of a communication. A subjective standard based on the client\u2019s awareness comports with the Legislature\u2019s recognition in Evidence Code section 917, subdivision (b) that the existence of a technical means of access to an electronic document does not destroy its privileged nature.</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">We have found no case holding that the confidentiality of an attorney-client communication depends on the <em>objective </em>reasonableness of the client\u2019s belief that the communication would remain confidential. The cases generally discuss the issue in terms of the client\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d that the communication remain confidential. (See <em>City &amp; County of S. F. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d at p. 235 [privilege extends to attorney-client communication if \u201cthe client intended the communication to be confidential\u201d].) Because we believe that the statutory framework reflects that the Legislature intends this privilege to extend to communications that the client believes will remain confidential, we believe that the trial court applied the wrong standard. However, since we conclude that the trial court erred even under an objective standard, we need not reach the issue of the correct standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\"> The fact that defendant\u2019s first Cadence-issued laptop had been seized pursuant to a search warrant did not render his belief unreasonable.
