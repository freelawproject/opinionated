J . \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">Bartholomew D. appeals a dispositional order committing him to the California Youth Authority (CYA) after the juvenile court found he committed a robbery and personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon (BB gun) in the commission of that felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7211, 12022, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the published portion of the opinion, we address appellant\u2019s contention that evidence of his use of a BB gun is insufficient to support the finding of personal use of a dangerous weapon under section 12022, subdivision (b). In the unpublished portion, we agree with appellant\u2019s contention that his precommittment custody credits must be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">\n<em>The Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The victim delivered pizzas for a pizzeria. On the night of the robbery, a young male voice placed a telephone order for two pizzas to be delivered to 415 West Merle Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">When the victim arrived with the pizzas at 415 West Merle Court, appellant was standing at the front of the driveway. He informed the victim that the house he was looking for was in the back and accompanied the victim down the driveway. At the rear of the driveway, appellant pointed what appeared to be a shiny silver semiautomatic handgun at the victim\u2019s head, demanded his money, and ordered him to drop everything. The victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>dropped the pizzas on the driveway and gave appellant his money. Appellant told the victim to leave. Just as the victim got to his car, appellant demanded his cell phone. The victim threw the phone to appellant and drove back to the pizzeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Before the victim arrived back at the pizzeria, the same caller who had placed the order telephoned the pizzeria again to say his order had not yet been delivered. The receptionist told him she would try to contact the deliveryman. She never did so because two minutes after she took the call saying the pizzas had not yet been delivered, the victim entered the pizzeria and said he had just had a gun shoved in his face. He and the receptionist contacted the police. Upon their arrival at the pizzeria, the police instructed the receptionist to telephone the number from which the order had been placed and say she was sending a free pizza. The receptionist spoke to the same caller who had placed the order. He directed her to have the pizza delivered to 435 West Merle Court instead of 415 West Merle Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The police went to 435 West Merle Court and rang the bell. Appellant\u2019s mother answered the door and consented to a search of the house. In appellant\u2019s bedroom, the police recovered a receipt for the pizzas that had been ordered for 415 West Merle Court. They also seized a black BB gun from the television stand in appellant\u2019s bedroom. At trial, the victim was unable to identify the BB gun as the gun used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant presented an alibi defense. He denied being the robber and denied owning a gun. He said the BB gun found in his bedroom belonged to a friend who was paying him to fix it. He acknowledged he had never before fixed a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The juvenile court sustained the juvenile wardship petition (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 602) following a contested hearing. It committed appellant to CYA for a maximum confinement of 6 years 10 months, less 38 days of custody credit, with commitment stayed pending placement review.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">I. <em>Substantial Evidence a BB Gun Is a Dangerous Weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Appellant does not challenge the robbery finding, nor does he now claim that he did not use a BB gun during the commission of the robbery. He contends there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that the particular BB gun he used was a deadly or dangerous weapon, within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>When a defendant claims insufficient evidence to support a finding, the appellate court \u201cmust review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence \u2014 that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014 such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) We presume the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 277 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892].) The same standard of review applies to claims of insufficient evidence by a juvenile criminal defendant. (See <em>In re Jerry M. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 289, 298 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Section 12022, subdivision (b), states, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who personally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony . . . shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for one year . . . .\u201d The statute does not define \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d To find a section 12022, subdivision (b) allegation true, the fact finder must conclude that the defendant himself intentionally displayed an instrument capable of inflicting great bodily injury or death in a menacing manner during the crime. <em>(People v. Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 302 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Cases have historically recognized a pellet gun as a dangerous weapon in the context of penal statutes in which proof that the perpetrator was \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon\u201d is an element of the crime. Under former section 211a, for example, conviction of first degree robbery required the robbery to be perpetrated by a person armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>People v. Sherman </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 849 [60 Cal.Rptr. 198] affirmed a conviction of first degree robbery, rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that no evidence was presented that the pellet gun used in the robbery, which the victim had described as resembling a German Luger, constituted a deadly weapon. \u201c[T]he evidence shows, and defendant conceded, that the gun was a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 .... The words \u2018dangerous or deadly\u2019 are used disjunctively. \u2018Thus, it is not necessary to show that the weapon is deadly so long as it can be shown that it is dangerous. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] Any gun, even a short one, may be a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 within the meaning of the statute since it is capable of being used as a bludgeon .... A metal gun the size and shape of [the pellet gun used in the robbery], which has the appearance of a Luger, is sufficient to constitute a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 within the meaning\u201d of former section 211a. <em>(Sherman, supra, </em>at pp. 856-857, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bums </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 238 [75 Cal.Rptr. 688], the defendant was charged in the accusatory pleading with an arming enhancement under former section 3024. The jury found the defendant guilty of first degree robbery but found he was not armed with a <em>deadly </em>weapon in the commission of the offense, as required to prove the section 3024 enhancement. (B<em>urns, supra, </em>at pp. 253-254.) <em>Burns </em>concluded there was no inconsistency in the verdict. \u201cAt the time defendant was arrested a pellet gun was found in the car. [The victim] identified this gun as the robbery weapon. Accordingly, under the state of the evidence the jury could conclude that this gun was used in the robbery and that it was a dangerous weapon. Proof that the robber was armed with a gun that could be a dangerous weapon would support a conviction of robbery of the first degree. This is true even though it would not establish that he was armed with a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>People v. Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153], the defendant kicked the robbery victim, and the issue was whether a shoe was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of former section 211a. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Raleigh (People </em>v. <em>Raleigh </em>(1932) 128 Cal.App. 105 [16 P.2d 752]), <em>Graham </em>distinguished between two classes of \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons\u201d for purposes of the statute. \u201c \u2018. . . There are, first, those instrumentalities which are weapons in the strict sense of the word, and, second, those instrumentalities which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word, but which may be used as such. The instrumentalities falling in the first class, such as guns, dirks and blackjacks, which are weapons in the strict sense of the word and are \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed, may be said as a matter of law to be \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons.\u201d This is true as the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such. The instrumentalities falling into the second class, such as ordinary razors, pocket-knives, hatpins, canes, hammers, hatchets and other sharp or heavy objects, which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word and are not \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed, may not be said as a matter of law to be \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons.\u201d When it appears, however, that an instrumentality other than one falling within the first class is capable of being used in a \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d manner, and it may be fairly inferred from the evidence that its possessor intended on a particular occasion to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require, we believe that its character as a \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d may be thus established, at least for the purposes of that occasion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Graham, supra, </em>at pp. 327-328.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Subsequent cases have relied on <em>Sherman, Bums, </em>and <em>Graham </em>in analyzing challenges to a section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement. In <em>People v. Montalvo </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 790 [173 Cal.Rptr. 51], the jury found true the section 12022, subdivision (b) allegation that the defendant used a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>dangerous weapon \u2014 a pellet gun \u2014 in a robbery. <em>(Montalvo, supra, </em>at pp. 792, 796.) Although it reversed on unrelated grounds, <em>Montalvo </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was improperly enhanced. Based on the <em>Bums </em>and <em>Sherman </em>holdings that a pellet gun \u201cis in fact a dangerous weapon,\u201d <em>Montalvo </em>concluded, without further analysis, that a section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement based on use of a pellet gun was proper. <em>(Montalvo, supra, </em>at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In <em>People v. Schaefer </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 950 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 536], the defendant admitted a section 12022.5, subdivision (a) enhancement \u2014 use of a firearm \u2014 during a robbery, based on his use of a pellet gun. <em>Schaefer </em>agreed the enhancement could not stand because the Legislature subsequently removed \u201cpellet gun\u201d from the statutory definition of \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>(Schaefer, supra, </em>at p. 951.) Nevertheless, relying on <em>Montalvo's </em>holding that a pellet gun was a dangerous or deadly weapon under section 12022, subdivision (b), <em>Schaefer </em>concluded the defendant\u2019s admission of the section 12022.5, subdivision (a) enhancement necessarily included an admission of a section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement, and modified his conviction accordingly. <em>(Schaefer, supra, </em>at pp. 951, 952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>People v. Reid </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 354 [184 Cal.Rptr. 186], the defendant used a toy gun, made of metal with a plastic grip, in a robbery. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 364.) He contended his section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement should be stricken because there was no evidence he intended to use the toy gun as a club. <em>(Reid, supra, </em>at p. 364.) In resolving the issue, <em>Reid </em>applied the \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d distinction to section 12022, subdivision (b), that <em>Graham, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 303 had applied to former section 211a. It analyzed instrumentalities that are weapons in the strict sense of the word differently from instrumentalities that are not strictly weapons but are capable of use as such, when coupled with evidence the user intended that the instrumentality could be so used. It concluded a toy gun fell in the second category because it was \u201cclear[ly]\u201d not a weapon in the strict sense. <em>(Reid, supra, </em>at p. 367.) It struck the enhancement because, although the toy gun was capable of being used in a dangerous manner, i.e., as a club, there was insufficient evidence that the defendant intended to do so. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Similarly, <em>People v. Godwin </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1562, 1574 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 545], struck an enhancement in which the instrumentality used during a robbery was a starter pistol because there was insufficient evidence to support the finding. It observed that the capacity of a starter pistol to inflict injury is not a matter of common knowledge, and there was no evidence regarding the starter pistol\u2019s capacities as a dangerous weapon, so as to be a dangerous weapon as a matter of law, i.e., a weapon in <em>Graham's </em>\u201cstrict sense of the word\u201d category. <em>(Godwin, supra, </em>at p. 1574.) Nor was there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>evidence that the defendant intended to use it as a bludgeon, although it could have been so used. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In <em>In re Arturo H. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1694 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 5], the defendant was found to have possessed a pellet gun on school grounds, a violation of section 626.10, which specifically proscribes possession of \u201cany instrument that expels a metallic projectile such as a BB or a pellet, through the force of air pressure, CO[2] pressure, or spring action . . .\u201d Defendant argued the finding must be reversed because there was no evidence his gun was <em>operable. </em>He reasoned that by defining the prohibited instrumentality in functional terms, the statute referred only to operable pellet guns. <em>Arturo H. </em>disagreed. It first noted the many cases that have interpreted the laws prohibiting firearms as applying to inoperable as well operable firearms, given the underlying purpose of the Dangerous Weapons Control Law (\u00a7 12000 et seq., including \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) to deter the danger that derives not only from the weapon, but also from the defensive reaction of people to the weapon. <em>(Arturo H., </em>supra, at pp. 1697, 1698.) It then concluded that the same rationale applies to pellet guns, \u201cwhich are reasonably perceived as dangerous weapons capable of inflicting serious injury.\u201d <em>(Arturo H., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1698, citing <em>Schaefer, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 950, <em>Montalvo, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d 790, and <em>Sherman, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 849.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Unlike <em>Arturo H., </em>we interpret here an enhancement statute that contains no definition of the \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapons[s]\u201d which will trigger its application. The Dangerous Weapons Control Law (\u00a7 12000 et seq.) defines BB guns for purposes of sections 12551 and 12552 (prohibiting the sale or furnishing of any BB device to minors), as \u201cany instrument that expels a projectile, such as a BB or a pellet, . . . through the force of air pressure, gas pressure, or spring action, or any spot marker gun.\u201d (\u00a7 12001, subd. (g).) The definition comports with the general definition of a BB gun: \u201ca smooth bore air gun actuated by a spring loaded plunger that upon release from the cocked position compresses the air behind the pellet and propels it from the tube.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet. (2002) p. 189.) Although the Dangerous Weapons Control Law does not specifically apply its section 12001, subdivision (g), definition of \u201cBB device\u201d to \u201cdangerous weapon[s]\u201d referred to in section 12022, subdivision (b), the policy considerations supporting criminalizing the possession of BB guns and pellet guns on school grounds, or the sale of BB or pellet guns to minors, would in our view likewise support characterizing pellet guns as \u201cdangerous weapon[s]\u201d as that term in used in section 12022, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The legislative history related to the 1993 amendment of section 626.10 (the statute at issue in <em>Arturo H.), </em>which added to its subdivision (a) the prohibition of \u201cany instrument that expels a metallic projectile such as a BB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>or a pellet ... or any spot marker gun\u201d on school grounds (Stats. 1993, ch. 599, \u00a72, p. 3151), reflects these policy considerations. The amendment was introduced as Senate Bill No. 647. Its accompanying analysis states that \u201c[t]he purpose of this measure is to prevent the introduction of weapon-like instruments on the campuses of public elementary and high schools because of their capacity for creating disruption, apprehension, [and] physical injury . ... HD ... HQ ... BB guns . . . have an inherent capacity for physical injury. . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 647 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 28, 1994.) These statutues proscribing pellet guns on school campuses, as well as the sale of pellet guns to minors, reflect a legislative recognition that the inherently dangerous nature of these instruments justifies the imposition of criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Considering the two classes of \u201cdangerous weapons or deadly weapons\u201d articulated by our Supreme Court in <em>Graham (People v. Graham, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 327), we conclude a pellet gun falls into the first. It is a \u201cweapon\u201d in the strict sense of the word. We are convinced that a pellet gun is a dangerous weapon under section 12022, subdivision (b), as a matter of law because it is dangerous to others in the ordinary use for which it was designed. Unlike a toy gun, which is designed for play and is incapable of shooting a projectile, or a starter pistol, which is not designed to release a projectile but to make a loud noise to signal the beginning of a race, a BB gun is not an imitation gun. It is an instrument designed to shoot by expelling a metal projectile at a target, is commonly recognized as such, and thus, as <em>Arturo H. </em>observes, is reasonably perceived as capable of inflicting serious injury. <em>(In re Arturo H., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1698.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the victim here perceived the instrumentality as \u201ca semiautomatic handgun.\u201d He testified he was certain it was a handgun; that it was semiautomatic and not a revolver. It was without question a real gun. And, in fact its appearance provoked the desired reaction: submission to appellant\u2019s criminal enterprise and demands. In short, the BB gun wielded by appellant was by design a weapon, and its use to expel a projectile supports the section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement, even in the absence of evidence of its capacity to be used in a dangerous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence that the BB gun used in this case was capable of inflicting great bodily injury. The gun was introduced into evidence. Markings on the gun included its caliber, \u201cBB Cal (4.5mm) .177/Cal.,\u201d and model name, \u201cMarksman Repeater.\u201d No evidence was presented regarding the velocity with which the BB\u2019s could be expelled from the gun, the material or shape of the BB\u2019s used in the gun, or the velocity necessary for a BB, in general, to produce injury. Relying primarily on <em>People </em>v. <em>Lochtefeld </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 533 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 778] <em>(Lochtefeld), </em>appellant argues that without such evidence the capacity of this particular gun to injure could not be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Lochtefeld, </em>the defendant was convicted of section 245, subdivision (c): assault on a peace officer \u201c <em>\u2018with a deadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm.\u2019 \u201d (Lochtefeld, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 535, original italics.) After noting the expert trial testimony that the pellet gun at issue could expel pellets at sufficient speed to penetrate muscle tissue or an eyeball from a significant distance, <em>Lochtefeld </em>concluded the jury was entitled to find, on that evidence, that the gun was a weapon capable of inflicting great bodily injury. Therefore, <em>Lochtefeld </em>held, it was a deadly weapon for purposes of section 245 as a matter of law. <em>(Lochtefeld, supra, </em>at p. 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Lochtefeld </em>does not assist appellant. First, it emphasizes at the outset that a pellet gun has been found to be a deadly or dangerous weapon in the context of other penal statutes, specifically section 12022, subdivision (b), and in no way implies criticism of such a finding. <em>(Lochtefeld, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 535.) Second, it does not establish an evidentiary threshold for proof of a weapon\u2019s capability to injure. In any case, evidence of the <em>Lochtefeld </em>weapon\u2019s capabilities was of greater significance in that case because, under section 245, there must be a finding the weapon was \u201cdeadly,\u201d not, as under section 12022, subdivision (b), \u201cdeadly <em>or </em>dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Additionally, <em>Lochtefeld </em>had to determine, for purposes of conviction of section 245, whether the pellet gun had a <em>present </em>ability to injure, which, under section 245, means it was operable. <em>(Lochtefeld, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 541-542.) A \u201ctrue\u201d finding under section 12022 does not require that the weapon necessarily operated. (See <em>People v. Nelums </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 355, 357 [182 Cal.Rptr. 515, 644 P.2d 201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">II. <em>Custody Credits</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The orders sustaining the petition and committing appellant to CYA are affirmed. The case is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to (1) calculate the amount of precommitment custody credit to which appellant is entitled; (2) prepare an amended commitment order reflecting such credit; and (3) forward a certified copy of the amended commitment order to CYA or, if applicable, appellant\u2019s alternate placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Simons, J., and Gemello, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 2, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-13\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\"> Section 211a was repealed in 1986 (Stats. 1986, ch. 1428, \u00a7 1, p. 5123), and \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d no longer determines the degree of robbery, now specified in section 212.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\"> Appellant was alleged, in the alternative, to have used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd.

What was seized was a BB gun, which certainly doesn\u2019t fall within the statute for a deadly weapon.\u201d The prosecutor agreed there was insufficient evidence of firearm use for purposes of section 12022.53, subdivision (b), but argued that a true finding under section 12022, subdivision (b), \u201cdoesn\u2019t require a firearm. It could be any weapon. It could be a rock, it could be a bat, it could be a BB gun. A BB gun would qualify as a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel made no attempt to rebut this prosecution argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 317.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
