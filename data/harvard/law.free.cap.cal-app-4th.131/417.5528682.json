J.</author>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">This proceeding arises out of a grand jury investigation into allegations that two Roman Catholic priests, petitioners Doe 1 and Doe 2 (sometimes hereafter referred to as the Priests), sexually assaulted children while they worked for petitioner Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles, a Corporation Sole (hereafter referred to as the Archdiocese). In seeking to quash grand jury subpoenas duces tecum, petitioners raise issues that require a balance of the rights of religious belief and practice with the rules of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">As the California Supreme Court noted in connection with this state\u2019s evidentiary privilege for clergy-penitent communications (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1030-1034), \u201cthe statutory privilege must be recognized as basically an explicit accommodation by the secular state to strongly held religious tenets of a large segment of its citizenry.\u201d <em>(In re Lifschutz </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 415, 428 [85 Cal.Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557].) While it is true the right to religious freedom holds a special place in our history and culture, there also must be an accommodation by religious believers and institutions to the rules of civil society, particularly when the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting children is in question. Although the religion clauses of the First Amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the United States Constitution \u201cembrace[] two concepts, \u2014 freedom to believe and freedom to act,\u201d the first concept \u201cis absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.\u201d <em>(Cantwell v. Connecticut </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 296, 303-304, fn. omitted [84 L.Ed. 1213, 60 S.Ct. 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The Los Angeles County Grand Jury subpoenaed various documents from the Archdiocese which purportedly would allow the grand jury to determine whether to indict the Priests. Petitioners objected to disclosure of the subpoenaed documents, primarily relying on the freedom of religion clauses in the federal and California Constitutions and on California\u2019s evidentiary privileges. Some of petitioners\u2019 objections were sustained, but the great majority of them were overruled. Petitioners seek to reverse the adverse rulings. With the exception of a single document, we affirm the rulings ordering the subpoenaed materials to be turned over to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In June and July 2002, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury served subpoenas duces tecum on the Archdiocese\u2019s custodian of records, seeking documents relating to child sexual abuse allegedly committed by certain Roman Catholic priests. Except for routine attorney-client communications, the Archdiocese turned over the requested documents. However, several priests and the Archdiocese immediately filed motions to quash the subpoenas. As a result, none of the documents has been turned over to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The parties to this proceeding, the petitioners, the Priests and the Archdiocese, and the real party in interest, the District Attorney of Los Angeles County (District Attorney), stipulated to the appointment of Retired Judge Thomas Nuss as referee (hereinafter, referee) to resolve substantive issues raised by the motions to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">On July 15, 2002, the referee concluded the subpoenas were not defective for failing to meet the affidavit requirements set forth in Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985, subdivision (b) (affidavit shall be served with subpoena duces tecum showing good cause and materiality) and 1987.5 (service of subpoena duces tecum is invalid without affidavit).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">On July 29, 2002, petitioners sought a writ of mandate from this court vacating the referee\u2019s order denying their motions to quash. We issued an order to show cause. After briefing and oral argument, we held a California grand jury has the power to issue a subpoena duces tecum and that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>subpoena does not require a good cause affidavit. <em>(M. B. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1384 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 454].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">On June 25, 2004, the referee quashed all the grand jury subpoenas in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stogner v. California </em>(2003) 539 U.S. 607 [156 L.Ed.2d 544, 123 S.Ct. 2446], which held California\u2019s newly enacted statute of limitations for child molestation was unconstitutional when used to <em>revive </em>time-barred prosecutions. However, the referee granted the People leave to serve new subpoenas requesting the identical documents on the assurance and subsequent showing the People were investigating credible, prosecutable claims against named targets.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On June 30, 2004, the People served the two grand jury subpoenas, one for Doe 1 and one for Doe 2, at issue in this writ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On July 9, 2004, Does 1 and 2 moved to quash the new subpoenas. The Archdiocese followed with its own motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">On September 7, 2004, the referee issued a decision which substantially rejected petitioners\u2019 motions to quash. Out of the approximately 285 subpoenaed documents challenged by petitioners below, the referee sustained 53 objections and ordered the remaining documents turned over to the grand jury. Of the 53 sustained objections, one was based on the attorney-client privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 954), two were based on the clergy-penitent privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1033-1034), and 50 were based on the physician-patient privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1014). The referee stayed disclosure of the documents to enable the parties to seek review.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Thereafter, the Archdiocese filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court seeking to prevent disclosure of 15 documents the referee had ruled could go to the grand jury. The Priests filed their own petition for writ of mandate asking this court to prevent the disclosure of <em>any </em>documents to the grand jury. The petitions were consolidated, an order to show cause was issued, production of documents was stayed, and briefing was obtained from the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">An amicus curiae brief from Monsignor Thomas Green, a professor of canon law, was filed in support of petitioners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">1. <em>Petitioners\u2019 claim the subpoenaed documents cannot be disclosed to grand jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Petitioners contend the referee erred in ruling the subpoenaed documents should be disclosed to the grand jury because compliance with the subpoenas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>would violate constitutional and statutory rules. Petitioners assert a Catholic bishop has a religious obligation to care for the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of the priests within his diocese. Petitioners argue all the communications arising out of this obligation, including communications with the accused priests and the psychotherapists who treat them, are protected from disclosure by the constitutional right to freedom of religion and by California\u2019s psychotherapist-patient and clergy-penitent evidentiary privileges. In support of these claims, petitioners submitted evidentiary declarations, which were opposed by declarations filed by the District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">2. <em>Petitioners\u2019 evidentiary declarations; their reliance on the church\u2019s \u201cformation of clergy\u201d doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In declarations supporting its motion to quash, the Archdiocese asserted that according to Roman Catholic doctrine, bishops are the direct successors of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the church\u2019s \u201cformation of clergy\u201d doctrine, a bishop is charged with the responsibility of sanctifying his priests, and is obligated to \u201ccare for and treat any emotional, physical, or spiritual problem a priest may be experiencing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In carrying out this obligation, a bishop \u201cmay establish detailed boundaries for his priests concerning chastity\u201d and \u201cpass judgment in particular cases concerning the observance of this obligation. The bishop is obliged to intervene and judge inappropriate conduct of any priest and to impose restrictions and penalties as appropriate in his moral judgment.\u201d The Archdiocese argued these tasks require \u201copen communications between the bishop and his priests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">A bishop \u201cis permitted to appoint Episcopal vicars. An Episcopal vicar has the same power as a Bishop in the specific type of activity for which he is appointed.\u201d The archbishop in Los Angeles, Cardinal Mahony, has appointed such a vicar, called the Vicar for Clergy, who is obligated to care for the \u201cemotional, physical, psychological and spiritual lives\u201d of the archdiocesan priests. Monsignor Craig Cox, who is both a canon lawyer and the Vicar for Clergy, declared Cardinal Mahony had established policies for the Archdiocese under which accusations of clerical sexual misconduct immediately are investigated. \u201cThe involved priest is confronted and is encouraged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>discuss whatever problems he is experiencing regarding chastity.\u201d \u201cMsgr. Cox states \u2018Based on the fundamental religious relationship between the bishop and his priest, the priest is encouraged to communicate his deepest psychological and sexual issue[s], to undergo psychiatric evaluation and treatment, and to share the results of this therapy with the Vicar and the Bishop. <em>All of this for the purpose of the ongoing formation and sanctification of the </em>priest.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">If \u201ca canonical investigation of a boundary violation or accusation of sexual misconduct [is required], the process is conducted in accord with the requirements of Canons 1717-1719\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and pursuant to Archdiocesan practice. These Canons require the bishop to inquire carefully either personally or through some acceptable person, about the facts and circumstances and about the imputability of the offense, [\u00b6] . . . [T]o date, the bishops and priests have always understood that these records would be confidential, and files covering these materials would be kept separately from the priest\u2019s normal personnel file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">3. <em>The District Attorney\u2019s evidentiary declarations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In an attempt to rebut petitioners\u2019 evidentiary claims, the District Attorney submitted declarations from Thomas Doyle, a Roman Catholic priest who is also an expert in canon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Father Doyle stated it is expected the preliminary investigation, required by Canons 1717-1719, will generate a written record. \u201cThe information contained in the record may be sensitive and is to be treated accordingly with due regard for the reputations of those involved. It may however, be licitly and properly disclosed to civil law enforcement agencies if it involves [a] matter as serious as sexual abuse.\u201d Father Doyle asserted \u201cinvestigations of child abuse documented by the Archdiocese, through the Vicar for Clergy, which are kept in the \u2018secret archives\u2019 (confidential files) can be and have been supplied to law enforcement in other jurisdictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">4. <em>Referee\u2019s final decision on petitioners\u2019 claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">In his final decision, the referee rejected petitioners\u2019 claims all the subpoenaed documents had arisen out of the archbishop\u2019s religious obligation to care for the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of his priests, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>therefore, that disclosing them to the grand jury would violate a constitutional right to freedom of religion, California\u2019s evidentiary privileges for clergy-penitent and psychotherapist-patient communications, and various other rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The referee held the subpoenas violated neither the free exercise clause nor the establishment clause of the federal Constitution. Further, compliance with the subpoenas would not impermissibly burden petitioners\u2019 religious beliefs or practice under <em>Employment Div., Ore, Dept. of Human Res. v. Smith </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L.Ed.2d 876, 110 S.Ct. 1595] <em>(Smith), </em>nor would it create an impermissible governmental entanglement with internal church affairs under <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 602 [29 L.Ed.2d 745, 91 S.Ct. 2105], As for California\u2019s free exercise clause, even under the <em>pre-Smith (Smith, supra, </em>494 U.S. 872), compelling state interest test, disclosure was required because the government has a compelling interest in prosecuting child molesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">While the referee found evidence in the record to support the assertion Cardinal Mahony had a religious obligation to care for his priests, he also found the Archdiocese simultaneously had been engaged in the kind of routine investigation any employer would undertake upon learning a trusted employee had been accused of child molestation. In addition, the referee held the clergy-penitent privilege was inapplicable where the communication had been disclosed to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Regarding the principal remaining issues, the referee concluded the psychotherapist-patient privilege protected some of the subpoenaed documents, that the prosecution of Doe 1 and Doe 2 was not precluded by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statute of limitations ruling in <em>Stogner </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>539 U.S. 607, that the prosecutor had not improperly manipulated the grand jury process, and that the subpoenas were not impermissibly vague or overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Petitioners\u2019 chief contentions are that disclosure of the subpoenaed documents is barred by the First Amendment of the federal Constitution and by the free exercise clause of the California Constitution, as well as by Evidence Code provisions relating to the clergy-penitent and psychotherapist-patient privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Additionally, petitioners contend disclosure of the subpoenaed documents is barred by California\u2019s attorney-client and work product privileges; under <em>Stogner v. California, supra, </em>539 U.S. 607, disclosure of the subpoenaed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>documents is barred by the ex post facto clause; the District Attorney improperly usurped the grand jury\u2019s authority; the subpoenas duces tecum were impermissibly vague and were issued without proper authority and without the requisite good faith affidavit; and disclosure of the subpoenaed documents is barred by assorted statutory and constitutional rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">1. <em>Constitutional right to freedom of religion does not bar disclosure of the subpoenaed documents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Petitioners contend the disputed documents<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cannot be turned over to the grand jury without violating their right to freedom of religion. In particular, they claim disclosure of the subpoenaed documents will violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment to the federal Constitution, as well as the free exercise clause of the California Constitution. For the reasons explained, <em>post, </em>petitioners\u2019 contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">a. <em>General principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201cThe Religion Clauses of the First Amendment provide: \u2018Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u2019 The first of the two Clauses, commonly called the Establishment Clause, commands a separation of church and state. The second, the Free Exercise Clause, requires government respect for, and noninterference with, the religious beliefs and practices of our Nation\u2019s people.\u201d <em>(Cutter v. Wilkinson </em>(2005) 125 S.Ct. 2113, 2120 [161 L.Ed.2d 1020].) The First Amendment \u201csafeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion. Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts, \u2014 freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.\u201d <em>(Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303-304, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Judicial decisions regarding the religion clauses of the First Amendment are subject to de nova review. (See <em>Rubin v. City of Burbank </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1199 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 867] [establishment clause challenge to religious invocation at municipal function reviewed de nova].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>b. <em>No violation of the free exercise clause of the federal Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that disclosure of the subpoenaed documents would violate the free exercise clause of the federal Constitution is defeated by <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">(1) Smith\u2019s <em>new rule for evaluating free exercise claims rests on \u201cneutral laws of general applicability. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In <em>Smith, supra, </em>494 U.S. 872, a case involving peyote use by members of the Native American Church in a state (Oregon) which had not granted an exemption for sacramental use of the drug, the United States Supreme Court adopted a new rule for evaluating free exercise claims. <em>Smith </em>rejected the former balancing test (see <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner </em>(1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790]), under which \u201cgovernmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a compelling governmental interest,\u201d reasoning \u201cWe have never held that an individual\u2019s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate. On the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise jurisprudence contradicts that proposition.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>494 U.S. at pp. 878-879, 883.) Under the new rule, \u201cthe right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a <em>\u2018valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 879, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In <em>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hialeah </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 520 [124 L.Ed.2d 472, 113 S.Ct. 2217], the United States Supreme Court summed up its newly-announced rule \u201cIn addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposition that <em>a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. ... A </em>law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 531-532, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Although <em>Smith </em>involved criminal conduct, the case is not limited to such situations. As <em>Smith </em>commented, \u201cThe government\u2019s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, <em>like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, </em>\u2018cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector\u2019s spiritual development.\u2019 [Citation.] To make an individual\u2019s obligation to obey such a law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>contingent upon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s interest is \u2018compelling\u2019 \u2014 permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, \u2018to become a law unto himself,\u2019 [citation] \u2014 contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>494 U.S. at p. 885, fn. omitted, italics added; see <em>Gary S. v. Manchester School Dist. </em>(1st Cir. 2004) 374 F.3d 15, 18 [rejecting argument <em>Smith </em>was \u201climited to instances of socially harmful or criminal conduct,\u201d court applied <em>Smith </em>to claim the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was unconstitutional as applied to disabled child attending Catholic elementary school].)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Smith </em>is applicable here and defeats petitioners\u2019 contention the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause bars disclosure of the subpoenaed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">(2) <em>The \u201cecclesiastical abstention\u201d doctrine does not apply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Petitioners, however, argue an exception to the <em>Smith </em>rule applies, namely, the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine. This doctrine grew out of the so-called church property cases. However, the church property cases, as exemplified by the ones cited by the Archdiocese, are inapposite because they involve internal church disputes whose resolution crucially depend on interpretations of religious doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">However, the case at bar is not, at its core, an <em>internal </em>church dispute. It is a criminal investigation into suspected child molestation allegedly committed by Catholic priests. <em>Smith </em>itself characterized the church property decisions as cases in which the government was impermissibly \u201clending] its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma.\u201d <em>{Smith, supra, </em>494 U.S. at p. 877.) The case at bar does not involve an internal church dispute over religious authority or dogma.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">(3) <em>The \u201cministerial exception\u201d doctrine does not apply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Petitioners also argue the <em>Smith </em>rule does not defeat their free exercise claim because the so-called ministerial exception doctrine applies. Petitioners\u2019 reliance on this exception is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The ministerial exception doctrine is based on the notion a church\u2019s appointment of its clergy, along with such closely related issues as clerical salaries, assignments, working conditions and termination of employment, is an inherently religious function because clergy are such an integral part of a church\u2019s functioning as a religious institution. (See, e.g., <em>Werft v. Desert Southwest Annual Conference </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 377 F.3d 1099, 1101.) This is not an employment case and the ministerial exception doctrine has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">(4) Smith <em>applies to these grand jury subpoenas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The Archdiocese contends <em>Smith </em>is inapplicable because there is no legislative act at issue, and because subpoenas are not neutral laws of general application. This argument misconstrues the notion of generally applicable neutral laws. \u201cA law is not neutral towards religion if its \u2018object ... is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] A law is not generally applicable if it \u2018in a selective manner impose[s] burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 527, 550 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 283, 85 P.3d 67].) The neutral law of general applicability at issue here is the statutory and common law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> basis of California\u2019s grand jury process. That this particular grand jury investigation and the subpoenas it generated are directed at a Catholic archdiocese is merely an incidental effect of the grand jury process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena (Chinske) </em>(D.Mont. 1991) 785 F.Supp. 130, the petitioner claimed that having to comply with a grand jury subpoena would violate his religious beliefs. At oral argument, the petitioner\u2019s attorney \u201cattempted to distinguish <em>Smith </em>... by claiming that the compulsion to testify before the grand jury is not a law of general application prohibiting certain conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 133.) Commenting that \u201c[c]ounsel clearly does not appreciate the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings concerning free exercise claims,\u201d the federal court held <em>\u201cSmith </em>clearly does not apply only to cases where the law in question prohibits certain conduct, since the court considered tax collection cases in reaching its decision.

However, the core issue in that case was whether there had been unfair labor practices, and it was this issue which was necessarily entangled with questions of religious doctrine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">However, the core issue in the case at bar is whether children were molested by priests who worked for the Archdiocese, an issue having no comparable religious doctrine aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Also pertinent here is <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>(2004) 441 Mass. 662 [808 N.E.2d 272], in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rejected a claim that disclosure of a priest\u2019s personnel file, in connection with a criminal prosecution for sexual assault, would violate the establishment clause. The court explained \u201cWith regard to the test of \u2018effect\u2019 on religion, we must look at the law\u2019s \u2018principal or primary effect,\u2019 <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra, </em>not at its incidental effects. Here, the alleged inhibition on religion is not a \u2018principal or primary\u2019 effect of the subpoena, although it may, in a subtle way, provide some disincentive that would arguably discourage accused priests from being totally forthcoming with their superiors. ...[][] <em>Nor does the enforcement of this subpoena result in any excessive government entanglement with religion. </em>The court can decide issues of relevance, burdensomeness, and the applicability of the asserted privileges without having to decide matters of religion or embroil itself in the internal workings of the Jesuits. Indeed, the only form of \u2018entanglement\u2019 with religion at issue in the motions to quash is a form that [the priest] and the Jesuits have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>themselves invited, namely, the court\u2019s consideration whether [the priest\u2019s] communications qualify for protection under the priest-penitent privilege .... Assessment of the applicability of that privilege does not lead to excessive government entanglement in religion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 283, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">This case is analgous to <em>Society of Jesus of New England v. Com., supra, </em>808 N.E.2d 272, rather than to <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago, supra, </em>440 U.S. 490. We conclude disclosure of the subpoenaed documents to the grand jury will not result in excessive entanglement or any other violation of the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">d. <em>\u201cHybrid rights\u201d exception to </em>Smith <em>not applicable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Petitioners contend disclosure of the subpoenaed documents would violate the First Amendment because the so-called hybrid rights exception to the <em>Smith </em>rule applies in this case. The Archdiocese argues \u201cthe neutrality rule of <em>Smith </em>does not apply\u201d here because \u201cthe challenged state conduct interferes with the free exercise of religion <em>and </em>causes excessive entanglement.\u201d This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">As a doctrinal matter, the nature and scope of the so-called hybrid rights exception to <em>Smith </em>is rather nebulous. \u201cThe <em>Smith </em>court developed the hybrid claim exception in an effort to explain several past decisions which invalidated on free exercise grounds laws that appeared to be neutral and generally applicable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gary S. v. Manchester School Dist. </em>(D.N.H. 2003) [241 F.Supp.2d 111, 121], fn. omitted, affd. (1st Cir. 2004) 374 F.3d 15, 19.) \u201cThe most relevant of the so-called hybrid cases is <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 232-33 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526] (1972), in which the Court invalidated a compulsory school attendance law as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 525, 539.) Under the hybrid rights theory, \u201c \u2018the First Amendment [still] bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action\u2019 if the law implicates not only \u2018the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press[.]\u2019 [Citation.] In such \u2018hybrid\u2019 cases, the law or action must survive strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>(San Jose Christian College v. Morgan Hill </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 360 F.3d 1024, 1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">However, even assuming a hybrid rights exception to <em>Smith, </em>it would not apply to this case because the Archdiocese merely has combined a free exercise claim with a meritless establishment clause claim. (See <em>Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 559, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fn. 15 [\u201cCatholic Charities perfunctorily asserts that its claims under the establishment clause [citation] also justify treating this case as involving hybrid rights. We have, however, already determined that those claims lack merit.\u201d].) Hence, <em>Smith\u2019s </em>\u201cvalid and neutral rule of law of general applicability\u201d standard does apply to petitioners\u2019 federal free exercise claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">e. <em>California free exercise claim is meritless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Petitioners contend the <em>Smith </em>rule does not apply to a free exercise claim under the California Constitution and that we should apply, instead, the <em>pre-Smith </em>compelling state interest test. However, we conclude that even pursuant to the former strict scrutiny test, under which governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a compelling governmental interest, disclosure of the subpoenaed documents would not violate petitioners\u2019 rights. Therefore, we need not decide whether <em>Smith </em>applies to California\u2019s free exercise clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">California\u2019s free exercise clause (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4.) provides \u201cFree exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed. This liberty of conscience does not excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace or safety of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The <em>Smith </em>case was decided in 1990. In 2004, the California Supreme Court was faced in <em>Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 527 with a claim that the <em>pre-Smith </em>test applies to California\u2019s free exercise clause because its language differs from the federal free exercise clause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cCatholic Charities\u2019 final argument for applying strict scrutiny invokes the free exercise clause of the California Constitution. [Citation.] That clause, Catholic Charities contends, forbids the state to burden the practice of religion, even incidentally, through a neutral, generally applicable law, unless the law in question serves a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Catholic Charities asserts, in other words, that we must interpret the California Constitution the same way the United States Supreme Court interpreted the federal Constitution\u2019s free exercise clause in <em>Sherbert, supra, </em>374 U.S. 398.\u201d <em>(Catholic Charities, </em>at p. 559, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Saying that in the proper case it would not have hesitated \u201cto declare the scope and proper interpretation of the California Constitution\u2019s free exercise clause,\u201d <em>Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at page 562 concluded it did not need to do so because the pr <em>e-Smith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>strict scrutiny test<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had been met. <em>Catholic Chanties </em>involved the claim by a religiously-connected nonprofit public benefit corporation that it had been impermissibly burdened by the Women\u2019s Contraception Equity Act (WCEA), a law requiring certain health and disability contracts to cover prescription contraceptives. The Supreme Court held \u201cAssuming for the sake of argument the WCEA substantially burdens a religious belief or practice, the law nevertheless serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, [\u00b6] The WCEA serves the compelling state interest of eliminating gender discrimination.\u201d <em>(Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 563-564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We reach a similar conclusion here. As the following case law demonstrates, the grand jury\u2019s investigation into suspected child molestation serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In <em>Branzburg v. Hayes </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 665 [33 L.Ed.2d 626, 92 S.Ct. 2646], in the course of holding that reporters may be required to testify before grand juries about the criminal conduct of their confidential sources, the United States Supreme Court said \u201cAlthough the powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the longstanding principle [is] that <em>'the public . . . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence,\u2019 </em>except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 688, italics added.) \u201cThe requirements of those cases, [citation], which hold that a State\u2019s interest must be \u2018compelling\u2019 or \u2018paramount\u2019 to justify even an indirect burden on First Amendment rights, are also met here. As we have indicated, <em>the investigation of crime by the grand jury implements a fundamental governmental role of securing the safety of the person and property of the citizen, </em>and it appears to us that calling reporters to give testimony in the manner and for the reasons that other citizens are called \u2018bears a reasonable relationship to the achievement of the governmental purpose asserted as its justification.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 700, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">With a nod to <em>Branzburg, </em>many federal cases since have held that compelled testimony before a grand jury in violation of a witness\u2019s religion does not constitute a free exercise violation. We rely on federal cases in this context because (1) before <em>Smith </em>was decided, both the federal and the California free exercise clauses were analyzed under the compelling state interest test (see <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 112, 138-141 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>[253 Cal.Rptr. 1, 763 P.2d 852]), and (2) we have found no California cases involving free exercise clause claims in a grand jury context.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">These federal cases have assumed, for the purpose of decision, that the witness\u2019s objection to testifying was both sincerely held and religiously grounded. Each case concluded the ensuing burden on the witness\u2019s religious belief was outweighed by the compelling state interest in obtaining grand jury testimony. (See <em>In re Grand Jury Empaneling of Special Grand Jury </em>(3d Cir. 1999) 171 F.3d 826, 832 [even if Orthodox Jewish law proscribed giving grand jury testimony against family member, \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in securing the evidence\u201d in white collar crime case was \u201ccompelling\u201d because \u201cthe duty to prosecute persons who commit serious crimes is part and parcel of the government\u2019s \u2018paramount responsibility for the general safety and welfare of all its citizens\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Grand Jury Proceedings of John Doe v. U.S. </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 842 F.2d 244, 247-248 [Mormon belief proscribing intrafamily testimony before grand jury was outweighed by compelling state interest in investigating violation of federal criminal law]; <em>In re Three Children </em>(D.N.J. 1998) 24 F.Supp.2d 389, 392 [\u201cthe government\u2019s interest in investigating and successfully prosecuting crimes, which invariably includes taking the grand jury testimony of witnesses, far outweighs the incidental burden on the professed free exercise of religion in this matter.\u201d]; see also <em>Congregation B\u2019Nai Jonah v. Kuriansky </em>(1991) 576 N.Y.S.2d 934, 936 [172 A.D.2d 35, 39] [state\u2019s interest in enforcing subpoenas for Medicaid fraud investigation outweighed infringement on free exercise \u201cUnquestionably, the State has a profound interest in fighting corruption in the Medicaid industry and in enforcing its tax laws [citations].\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Priests also argue that because the \u201cdocuments pertain to confidential communications of a most private nature between a Roman Catholic bishop and the priests he ordained,\u201d their disclosure \u201cwill chill the free exercise of their religion, and inevitably and impermissibly alter the relationship [between] Catholic bishops and priests and the way they practice their religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">However, several jurisdictions have rejected similar arguments and we agree with their reasoning. (See <em>People v. Campobello </em>(2004) 348 Ill.App.3d 619 [810 N.E.2d 307, 311-312, 284 Ill.Dec. 654] [Catholic diocese must comply with government subpoena in sexual assault prosecution against priest, even if Canon 489 requires bishop to maintain secret archive for files relating to internal church discipline]; <em>Com. v.

We conclude disclosure of the subpoenaed documents is not barred by the First Amendment to the federal Constitution, or by the free exercise clause of California\u2019s Constitution. Having so determined, we next examine the two principal statutory grounds petitioners rely on to prevent disclosure of the subpoenaed documents to the grand jury, the clergy-penitent privilege and the psychotherapist-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">2. <em>Documents in question do not satisfy criteria for application of clergy-penitent privilege, irrespective of the formation of clergy theory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Evidence Code section 1032, within the article relating to the clergy-penitent privilege, defines a \u201cpenitential communication\u201d as \u201ca communication made in confidence, <em>in the presence of no third person </em>so far as the penitent is aware, to a member of the clergy who, in the course of the discipline or practice of the clergy member\u2019s church, denomination, or organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear those communications and, under the discipline or tenets of his or her church, denomination, or organization, <em>has a duty to keep those communications </em>secret.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Petitioners argue the subpoenaed documents constitute privileged penitential communications within the meaning of Evidence Code section 1032 because they were generated in the course of the formation of clergy process during the Archdiocese\u2019s interventions to help troubled priests.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 contention fails.

Before these sections were enacted in 1965, the privilege was defined by Code of Civil Procedure section 1881, subdivision (3), which provided \u201cA clergyman, priest or religious practitioner of an established church cannot, without the consent of the person making the <em>confession, </em>be examined as to any <em>confession </em>made to him in his professional character in the course of discipline enjoined by the church to which he belongs.\u201d (Italics added.) The current statute makes no reference to confessions, and instead provides an evidentiary privilege for \u201c \u2018penitential communication.\u2019 \u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1032.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">e. <em>For clergy-penitent privilege to attach, requirements of Evidence Code section 1032 must be satisfied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The central provision of California\u2019s clergy-penitent privilege is Evidence Code section 1032, which defines a penitential communication as a confidential communication made to a clergy person who is authorized to hear and obligated to keep secret such communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">However, even with the privilege centered on a \u201ccommunication,\u201d rather than on a \u201cconfession,\u201d not every statement made to a member of the clergy is privileged. \u201cIn order for a statement to be privileged, it must satisfy all of the conceptual requirements of a penitential communication: 1) <em>it must be intended to be in confidence', </em>2) it must be made to a member of the clergy who in the course of his or her religious discipline or practice is authorized or accustomed to hear such communications; and 3) such member of the clergy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>has a duty under the discipline or tenets of the church, religious denomination or organization to keep such communications secret. </em>(\u00a7 1032; 2 Jefferson, Cal.

They presented evidence, <em>post, </em>showing that pursuant to this religious doctrine, a bishop is charged with the obligation to care for the physical, spiritual, emotional and psychological well-being of the priests within his diocese. Further, the obligation imposed by this doctrine includes intervention with priests who are experiencing problems related to celibacy and sexuality, including an \u201cintervention interview\u201d with the accused priest. The evidence also showed the Archdiocese encouraged priests to discuss such problems with Cardinal Mahony and the Vicar for Clergy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Archdiocese argues the challenged subpoenaed documents fall within California\u2019s clergy-penitent privilege because they were confidential communications made in the course of troubled-priest interventions, and under the tenets of the church, Cardinal Mahony and the Vicar for Clergy were authorized to hear the communications and obligated to keep them secret. The Archdiocese also presented evidence the interventions with troubled priests depend on the troubled priests\u2019 understanding the communications will be held in confidence <em>within the church.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">g. <em>Subject communications do not meet criteria of Evidence Code section 1032.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Petitioners\u2019 theory conflicts with Evidence Code section 1032, which defines a \u201cpenitential communication\u201d as \u201ca communication made in confidence, <em>in the presence of no third person </em>so far as the penitent is aware,\u201d to a clergy person who must keep the communication secret. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The record demonstrates the participants in the Archdiocese\u2019s troubled-priest interventions knew any communications likely were to be shared with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>more than one person. According to the Archdiocese\u2019s declared policy, priests experiencing psychological and sexual problems were encouraged to discuss those problems with the archbishop and the Vicar for Clergy. Furthermore, the subpoenaed documents themselves amply demonstrate that communications to and from the individual priests were routinely shared by Cardinal Mahony, whoever happened to be the current Vicar for Clergy, and sometimes other Archdiocese employees as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">This sharing of information violates Evidence Code section 1032\u2019s requirement that the penitent\u2019s communication be \u201cmade in confidence, in the presence of no third person so far as the penitent is aware,\u201d to a cleric who is obligated \u201cto keep those communications secret.\u201d The fact both parties to the original communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person vitiated <em>ab initia </em>any privilege under Evidence Code section 1032, or, alternatively, constituted a waiver of the privilege under Evidence Code section 912, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Here, the record demonstrates the District Attorney met the burden of rebutting Evidence Code section 917\u2019s presumption of confidentiality by proving the Priests were aware the communications were likely to be transmitted to third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Archdiocese argues these communications were not transmitted \u201cto any third party, that is, someone outside of the bishop (or his alter ego, the Vicar for Clergy).\u201d The contention is unavailing. We reject the argument that just because Cardinal Mahony considers the Vicar for Clergy his surrogate for dealing with troubled priests, there was no violation of Evidence Code section 1032\u2019s requirement that the communication be \u201cmade in confidence, in the presence of no third person so far as the penitent is aware, to a member of the clergy who . . . has a duty to keep those communications secret.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>With respect to the various documents here in issue, discussed, <em>ante, </em>the referee held <em>none </em>was shielded by the clergy-penitent privilege.

The referee reasonably could conclude the three numbered subparagraphs of this letter did not constitute penitential communications because they merely notified the priest of certain administrative decisions made by the Archdiocese. In any event, the entire letter is not covered by the clergy-penitent privilege because it was not sufficiently confidential. Not only did the priest know such communications were likely to be shared with the Vicar for Clergy, but the letter itself announced a copy was being sent to the Vicar.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Doe 1 No. 50-52: This document consists of a letter from a priest to the Vicar for Clergy, and a cover memorandum from the Vicar transmitting the priest\u2019s letter to Cardinal Mahony. The referee reasonably could conclude the letter was not within the clergy-penitent privilege because it merely discussed administrative actions taken by the Archdiocese, asked for legal information and suggested future job assignments. Furthermore, the letter was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication because the priest knew it was likely to be shared with a third person. Further, the cover memorandum does not constitute a penitential communication because it does not contain any information transmitted to or from the priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Doe 1 No. 80: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, reporting on a conversation with a priest. The referee reasonably could conclude this document did not constitute a penitential communication because it merely reported on the priest\u2019s cooperation with his therapists, strategized about possible legal problems and discussed church assignments. Moreover, the letter was not within the clergy-penitent privilege because it was not sufficiently confidential in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Doe 1 No. 397-400: This document consists of dated file notes containing summaries and verbatim excerpts from other subpoenaed documents:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The December 24, 1986, entry is a summary of Doe 1 No. 16-17, which we have concluded does not fall within the clergy-penitent privilege.

The referee reasonably could conclude this document did not constitute a penitential communication because it merely related an event in the priest\u2019s personal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Doe 2 No. 23: This is a memorandum to the file, written by the Vicar for Clergy, reporting on a third person\u2019s observation and evaluation of a priest\u2019s conduct in a particular situation. The referee reasonably could conclude this document did not constitute a penitential communication because it merely related an event in the priest\u2019s personal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Doe 2 No. 31-32: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony. The Archdiocese is only objecting to two paragraphs of this document. The third paragraph merely repeats communications, contained in Doe 2 No. 13 and Doe 2 No. 23, which we have concluded do not fall within the clergy-penitent privilege. The same result applies to this summary of those documents. The referee reasonably could conclude the information contained in the seventh paragraph of the memorandum did not constitute a penitential communication because it merely related an incident in the priest\u2019s personal history. In any event, the entire memorandum was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Doe 2 No. 34: This is a memorandum from a member of the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff to the Vicar for Clergy. A copy of the memorandum was transmitted to another member of the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff. The referee reasonably could conclude the document was not a penitential communication because it merely related incidents in the priest\u2019s personal history and offered an evaluation of the priest\u2019s situation. The document does not constitute a penitential communication because it does not contain any information transmitted to or from the priest. In any event, the memorandum was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Doe 2 No. 79: This is a letter from Cardinal Mahony to a priest, responding to a letter from the priest. A copy of Cardinal Mahony\u2019s letter was transmitted to the Vicar for Clergy. The letter was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Doe 2 No. 140: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, advising him of a conversation a member of the Vicar\u2019s staff had with a priest and the priest\u2019s psychotherapist. The referee reasonably could conclude this document did not constitute a penitential communication because it was merely a status report concerning the priest\u2019s progress in psychotherapy. In any event, the document was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Doe 2 No. 172: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, discussing the establishment of an aftercare program for when a priest completes psychotherapy. The document was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person. The document does not constitute a penitential communication because it does not contain any information transmitted to or from the priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Doe 2 No. 183: This is a letter from the Vicar for Clergy to a priest. The referee reasonably could conclude the document did not constitute a penitential communication because it was largely taken up with administrative matters and any penitential aspect was insignificant. Moreover, the document was not sufficiently confidential to constitute a penitential communication in that the parties to the communication knew it likely would be transmitted to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Doe 2 No. 278: This document consists of excerpts from three of the documents discussed, <em>ante </em>(Doe 2 Nos. 140, 172 &amp; 183), which we have concluded do not fall within the clergy-penitent privilege. The same result applies to these excerpts of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In sum, we conclude that none of the particular subpoenaed documents challenged by the Archdiocese falls within California\u2019s clergy-penitent privilege, and we affirm <em>all </em>of the referee\u2019s rulings in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">3. <em>Application of psychotherapist-patient privilege to Archdiocese\u2019s claims regarding particular documents; the communication must be \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to accomplish the purpose for which the psychotherapist was consulted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">a. <em>Controlling statute: Evidence Code section 1012.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">California\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege provides that a \u201c \u2018confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist\u2019 means information, including information obtained by an examination of the patient, transmitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>between a patient and his psychotherapist in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the patient is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the patient in the consultation, <em>or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted, </em>and includes a diagnosis made and the advice given by the psychotherapist in the course of that relationship.\u201d (Evid.

They argue that disclosures to third parties were duly made as reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the psychotherapy, namely, diagnosis and treatment of issues relating to celibacy and sexuality, and therefore remain confidential within the meaning of Evidence Code section 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">c. <em>Case law interpretation of Evidence Code section 1012; to remain privileged, disclosure to third persons must be in furtherance of the purpose for which the psychotherapist was consulted, namely, diagnosis and treatment of the patient.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">To reiterate, Evidence Code section 1012 defines a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist as information transmitted between a patient and his or her psychotherapist in the course of that relationship, which information is disclosed \u201cto no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the patient in the consultation, <em>or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary </em>for the transmission of the information or <em>the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted, </em>and includes a diagnosis made and the advice given by the psychotherapist in the course of that relationship.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The <em>purpose </em>for which a psychotherapist is consulted is set forth in Evidence Code section 1011, which defines \u201cpatient\u201d as \u201ca person who consults a psychotherapist or submits to an examination by a psychotherapist <em>for the purpose of securing a diagnosis or preventive, palliative, or curative treatment of his mental or emotional condition </em>or who submits to an examination of his mental or emotional condition for the purpose of scientific research on mental or emotional problems.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">There is ample case law illustrating disclosures to third persons which are \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the accomplishment of the <em>purpose </em>for which the psychotherapist was consulted.

Superior Court </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 502 [140 Cal.Rptr. 278], the issue presented was whether the plaintiff in a personal injury action was entitled to discovery of a minor defendant\u2019s psychiatric hospital records, on the theory the records might contain statements made by the minor\u2019s parents to the hospital staff indicating the parents had knowledge of the minor\u2019s propensities for violence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Grosslight </em>held such communications between parent and hospital were shielded by the psychotherapist-patient privilege because they were made \u201cfor the purpose of furthering the child\u2019s interest in communicating with the psychotherapist and . . . <em>to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of the child.\u201d (Grosslight </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>72 Cal.App. 3d at p. 506, italics added.) <em>Grosslight </em>reasoned \u201cAlthough the [patient] at 16 or 17 is clearly old enough verbally to communicate with her doctors, the nature of her problem is psychiatric, and it is entirely possible that her psychiatric illness precludes objective, accurate and complete communication by her with hospital personnel without the cooperation of her parents.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 507.) Thus, any parental communication <em>to the hospital staff </em>in <em>Grosslight </em>would be privileged because it was made to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In <em>People v. Gomez </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 874 [185 Cal.Rptr. 155], the defendant contended that statements he made to students serving as interns with the family court services office were privileged. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880.) <em>Gomez </em>rejected that argument, noting the psychotherapist-patient privilege extended to virtually every licensed classification of \u201ctherapist\u201d but did not apply to student interns. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 880-881; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1010.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Gomez </em>went on to state, however, that under some circumstances, communications to student interns could be privileged if the students were working <em>\u201cunder the supervision of a licensee to whom the privilege does attach </em>[citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881, fn. 3, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>In <em>Luhdorff v.

Gramajo was not a therapist to whom the privilege attached but \u201che worked under such a person generally, and [defendant\u2019s] case was ultimately <em>controlled and supervised by persons to whom the privilege </em>attached.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490, italics added.) <em>Luhdorff </em>was guided by \u201c[t]he language of [Evidence Code] section 1012 [which] plainly indicates that communications made by patients to persons <em>reasonably necessary to assist psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of the patient\u2019s mental disorder </em>come within the privilege.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 489, italics added.) <em>Luhdorff </em>concluded \u201cGramajo clearly falls within the category of persons reasonably necessary for the transmission of information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In <em>Farrell L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 521 [250 Cal.Rptr. 25], the question presented was \u201cwhether communications made by a patient to other persons participating in a group therapy session [conducted by a counselor at a state hospital] come within the psychotherapist-patient privilege.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Farrell L. </em>reasoned \u201cthe other participants in a group therapy session are \u2018those who are present <em>to further the interest of the patient in the consultation ... or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted </em>. . . .\u2019 (Evid.

The language of Evidence Code section 1012 plainly indicates that communications made by patients to persons who are present to further the interests of the patient come[] within the privilege. \u2018Group therapy\u2019 is designed to provide comfort and revelation to the patient who shares similar experiences and/or difficulties with other like persons within the group. The presence of each person is for the benefit of the others, including the witness/patient, and is designed to facilitate the patient\u2019s treatment. Communications such as these, when made in confidence, should not operate to destroy the privilege.\u201d <em>(Farrell L., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 527, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>In re Pedro M. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 550 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 839], the juvenile court ordered a minor to \u201c[cjooperate in a plan for psychiatric, psychological testing or treatment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553.) The minor subsequently contended the juvenile court erroneously admitted the testimony of his therapist after he invoked the psychotherapist-patient privilege. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 554.) <em>Pedro M. </em>concluded said privilege did not preclude the therapist from testifying at the adjudication of the supplemental petition concerning the minor\u2019s participation and progress in the court-ordered treatment plan. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>Pedro M. </em>explained \u201cEvidence Code section 1012 itself permits the disclosure of a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist to <em>\u2018those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for ... the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted </em>. . . .\u2019 In our view, this would include the juvenile court, where the patient is a delinquent minor who has been properly directed to participate and cooperate in a sex offender treatment program in conjunction with a disposition order placing the minor on probation.\u201d <em>(In re Pedro M., supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 554, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><em>In re Mark L. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 573 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 499] held \u201c[t]he rationale of <em>In re Pedro M., supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 550, is applicable in the juvenile dependency context, in which therapy has a dual purpose \u2014 treatment of the child to ameliorate the effects of abuse or neglect and the disclosure of information from which reasoned recommendations and decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare can be made. As the Supreme Court has observed, \u2018[without the testimony of psychologists, in many juvenile dependency and child custody cases superior courts and juvenile courts would have little or no evidence, and would be reduced to arbitrary decisions based upon the emotional response of the court.\u2019 <em>(In re Jasmon O. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 398, 430 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 878 P.2d 1297].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Most recently, in <em>In re Christopher M. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 684 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 61], the juvenile court placed the defendant on probation subject to numerous conditions, including conditions requiring that all records related to his medical and psychological treatment be made available upon request to the court and to the probation department. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 687, 690.) Defendant contended said conditions of probation violated the psychotherapist-patient privilege. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\"><em>Christopher M. </em>rejected the argument, explaining the express language of Evidence Code section 1012 \u201cpermits disclosure of otherwise privileged communications between patient and psychotherapist to third persons to whom disclosure is <em>reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose </em>for which the psychotherapist is consulted.\u201d <em>(In re Christopher M., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 696, italics added.) <em>Christopher M. </em>observed \u201cHere, by reasonably limiting disclosure of otherwise privileged psychotherapist-patient communications to the probation officer and the court, the court acted under the authority of Evidence Code section 1012 and avoided unnecessary disclosure of those communications.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Additionally, we briefly look to case law relating to the physician-patient privilege, which is analogous to the psychotherapist-patient privilege.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In <em>Rudnick v.

Pursuant to the principles set forth, <em>ante, </em>we uphold the referee\u2019s rulings, with one exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Doe 1 No. 50-52: This document consists of a letter from a priest to the Vicar for Clergy, and a cover memorandum from the Vicar transmitting the letter to Cardinal Mahony. The Archdiocese only claims that the cover memorandum, which recites a psychotherapist\u2019s recommendation about the priest taking a trip abroad, is protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege. However, the referee reasonably could conclude the transmission of this information to the Archdiocese did not come within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012, because any connection to furthering the priest\u2019s treatment was too attenuated. Moreover, neither party to this communication was a psychotherapist or someone being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Doe 1 No. 74: This is a memorandum to the file, by the Vicar for Clergy, reporting on treatment recommendations transmitted by a priest\u2019s psychotherapists. This communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because the Vicar was not involved in rendering psychotherapy to the priest, nor was he being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Doe 1 No. 80: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, reporting on a conversation the Vicar had with a priest regarding psychotherapy recommendations and future work assignments for the priest. This communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because neither party to this communication was a psychotherapist or someone being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Doe 1 No. 397^-00: This document consists of dated file notes containing summaries and verbatim excerpts from other subpoenaed documents:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The January 9, 1987, entry is essentially a copy of a psychotherapeutic report prepared by a priest\u2019s therapists. The report contains a detailed psychosexual history and diagnosis. This communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because no person at the Archdiocese was involved in rendering psychotherapy to the priest, or was being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The June 22, 1987, entry is a summary of Doe 1 No. 80, which we have concluded must be produced to the grand jury. The same result applies to this summary of that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The September 6, 1996, entry is essentially a copy of a psychotherapeutic evaluation sent by a priest\u2019s therapists to a member of the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff. This evaluation contains both a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. This communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the puipose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff was not involved in rendering psychotherapy to the priest, nor was that staff being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The March 5, 1999, entry is essentially a copy of a file note prepared by a member of the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff, reporting on a discussion he had with a priest. The document describes the priest\u2019s self-report concerning his level of functioning, his progress in therapy and his desires concerning future work assignments. This communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because it does not convey any significant psychological information. Moreover, the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff was not involved in rendering psychotherapy to the priest, nor was it being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Doe 2 No. 46: This is the sole item as to which we overturn the referee\u2019s ruling because the \u201cclaimed privilege appears as a matter of law from the undisputed facts.\u201d <em>(HLC Properties, Limited v. Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 60.) This document is a memorandum from a member of the Vicar for Clergy\u2019s staff to a priest\u2019s psychotherapists. Said memorandum supplied the therapeutic team with information about a troubled priest\u2019s personal history as an aid to diagnosis and treatment. The record reflects such background information was routinely provided to assist the psychotherapists in diagnosing and treating the Priests. Under the reasoning of <em>Grosslight v. Superior Court, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at pages 506-507, we conclude this document is appropriately shielded by the psychotherapist-patient privilege because it was a disclosure reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the psychotherapist was consulted, namely, diagnosis and treatment of the patient. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1012.) The inclusion of such material within the purview of the privilege \u201cencourages full disclosure of pertinent matters that otherwise might be withheld by [third persons] to the detriment of the patient.\u201d <em>(Grosslight, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 507.) Therefore, we overrule the referee\u2019s order that this particular document be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Doe 2 No. 140: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, advising him of a conversation a member of the Vicar\u2019s staff had with a priest and the priest\u2019s psychotherapist. Although the document is ostensibly a status report on the priest\u2019s progress in therapy, the referee reasonably could conclude it was not covered by the psychotherapist-patient privilege because it did not contain any significant psychological information. Moreover, this communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because neither party to this communication was a psychotherapist or someone being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Doe 2 No. 172: This is a memorandum from the Vicar for Clergy to Cardinal Mahony, discussing possible aftercare programs for a priest when he completes psychotherapy. The referee reasonably could conclude it was not covered by the psychotherapist-patient privilege because it did not contain any significant psychological information. Moreover, this communication does not fall within the \u201cfurtherance of the purpose\u201d rule of Evidence Code section 1012 because neither party to this communication was a psychotherapist or someone being supervised by a treating psychotherapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Doe 2 No. 278: This document consists of dated file notes containing excerpts from two of the documents discussed above. We have concluded that neither Doe 2 No. 140 nor Doe 2 No. 172 falls within the psychotherapist-patient privilege. The same result applies to these excerpts of those two documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In sum, we conclude that, <em>except for Doe 2 No. 46, </em>none of the particular subpoenaed documents challenged by the Archdiocese falls within California\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege, and we affirm all of the referee\u2019s rulings in this regard. We order that Doe 2 No. 46 not be turned over the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">4. <em>Attorney-client and attorney work product privileges are inapplicable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The Archdiocese contends some of the disputed documents should not be disclosed to the grand jury because they are protected either by the attorney-client privilege or by the attorney work product privilege. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Noting the referee concluded \u201cthe communications at issue [had] been made for multiple purposes,\u201d the Archdiocese argues that if any of the disputed documents were generated by \u201cinvestigations of crime or communications to ascertain the validity of charges, as Respondent court asserts, then they should be protected by the Work Product Doctrine and/or the Lawyer-Client Privilege in addition to the First Amendment and Clergy Privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">However, the Archdiocese is confusing two different issues: (1) the referee\u2019s conclusion, in connection with his general ruling on the First Amendment and clergy-penitent privilege claims, that the Archdiocese had mixed motives for intervening with priests accused of sexual misconduct, and (2) the referee\u2019s rulings on the individual documents at issue in this writ proceeding. None of the remaining disputed documents falls within either the attorney-client or the attorney work product privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Under Evidence Code section 952, the attorney-client privilege protects \u201cinformation transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship . . . and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.\u201d \u201c \u2018In California the [attorney-client] privilege has been held to encompass not only oral or written statements, but additionally actions, signs, or other means of communicating information. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Solin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 451, 457 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 456].) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2018, subdivision (c), \u201c[a]ny writing that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories shall not be discoverable under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The Archdiocese\u2019s attorney is referred to only twice in the 15 documents that remain in dispute. Doe 2 No. 31 refers to particular advice given by the attorney to the Vicar for Clergy, but this reference appears in one of the paragraphs of Doe 2 No. 31 that is <em>not </em>being disputed by the Archdiocese. In Doe 1 No. 50, the Vicar for Clergy refers to the attorney, but only to mention counsel\u2019s presence at a meeting during which Cardinal Mahony made a particular statement. There is no indication Cardinal Mahony\u2019s statement reflects any of the attorney\u2019s thought processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">There is no indication any of the 15 disputed documents constitutes information transmitted between the Archdiocese and its lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Hence, none of the disputed documents falls within either the attorney-client or the attorney work product privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>5. <em>The </em>Stogner <em>decision does not invalidate the subpoenas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In 1993 the Legislature enacted Penal Code section 803, subdivision (g), in order to expand the statute of limitations in child molestation cases. <em>Stogner v. California, supra, </em>539 U.S. 607, held this statute violated the ex post facto clause when used to revive prosecutions already time-barred before the statute was enacted. The Priests contend the grand jury subpoenas duces tecum violate the principles of <em>Stogner </em>because the subpoenas encompass documents that are irrelevant to crimes allegedly occurring after January 1988, and because, properly understood, <em>Stogner </em>prohibits prosecution of any child molestation crime committed before January 1, 1994.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The first claim fails because admissible \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence is not restricted by the statute of limitations. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1101, subd. (b), &amp; 1108.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As the Priests themselves acknowledge, \u201cneither Evidence Code section 1101(b) nor 1108 is a chargeable offense. They are merely rules of admissibility for evidence at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The second claim is unavailing because it misconstrues <em>Stogner, </em>which stated \u201c[W]e agree that the State\u2019s interest in prosecuting child abuse cases is an important one. But there is also a predominating constitutional interest in forbidding the State to revive a long-forbidden prosecution. And <em>to hold that such a law is ex post facto does not prevent the State from extending time limits </em>for the prosecution of future offenses, or <em>for prosecutions not yet time </em>barred.\u201d <em>(Stogner v. California, supra, </em>539 U.S. 607 at p. 632, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Hence, the Priests\u2019 argument already has been firmly rejected by a number of courts which have recognized the difference between extension statutes and revival statutes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 750, 775 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 71] [\u201cAs <em>Stogner </em>indicates, extensions of existing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>unexpired limitations periods are not ex post facto because such extensions do not resurrect otherwise time barred prosecutions.\u201d]; accord <em>People v.

This claim also is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The Priests assert the District Attorney openly declared he was using the grand jury to conduct \u201cprivate\u201d discovery for his own purposes that had nothing to do with any pending grand jury investigation, and that the referee improperly acquiesced in this manipulation of the grand jury process. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This claim is based on a misreading of the District Attorney\u2019s oral argument to the referee and a misperception about the proper scope of a grand jury investigation, which \u201c 1 \u201cis not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime. As has been said before, the identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury\u2019s labors, not at the beginning.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(M. B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1394 \u2014 1395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Contrary to the Priests\u2019 assertion the District Attorney was allowed to subvert the grand jury process, the record shows the referee rejected the District Attorney\u2019s argument he should be allowed to present, at the preindictment stage of a grand jury proceeding, evidence that would be inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Priests complain that, although the District Attorney \u201cmay be present to advise the grand jury and conduct examination of witnesses for the grand jury, ... he may not take the evidence he is exposed to in that capacity to use for other purposes outside the grand jury.\u201d But the Priests point to no evidence indicating such a thing happened here. They merely argue it can be <em>inferred </em>from the District Attorney\u2019s oral argument to the referee that the District Attorney <em>believed </em>he could do this. We do not agree with the Priests\u2019 interpretation of the District Attorney\u2019s comments. In any event, something more than bad thoughts would have to be demonstrated to sustain this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>7. <em>Subpoenas were not impermissibly vague.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The Priests contend the subpoenas were defective because they were overbroad as to time, place and conduct, and imprecise in their description of the items to be produced. Again, these claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Although \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment requires search warrants to state with reasonable particularity what items are being targeted for search,\u201d in order to prevent police from rummaging through someone\u2019s belongings, a search warrant \u201c \u2018need only be reasonably specific, rather than elaborately detailed, and the specificity required varies depending on the circumstances of the case and the type of items involved.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Bridges </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 344 F.3d 1010, 1017.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The subpoenas here requested \u201c[a]ll documents and other materials that are in the possession, custody, or control of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles that relate in any way to allegations of child molestation or sexual abuse committed by Father ....[]\u25a1 The subpoenaed documents and other materials <em>include, but are not limited to, </em>documents in the Archdiocese general archives, general files, secret archives, secret files, . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The Priests contend the subpoenas amounted to unconstitutional general warrants because their descriptions of the items to be produced were impermissibly vague. They argue that the \u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d language is precisely the kind of overbroad language found to have invalidated a search warrant in <em>U.S. v. Bridges, supra, </em>344 F.3d 1010. But a crucial defect in <em>Bridges </em>was that the search warrant nowhere stated what criminal activity was being investigated. \u201cIn light of the expansive and open-ended language used in the search warrant to describe its purpose and scope, <em>we hold that this warrant\u2019s failure to specify what criminal activity was being investigated, </em>or suspected of having been perpetrated, <em>renders its legitimacy constitutionally defective.\u201d (U.S. v. Bridges, supra, </em>344 F.3d at p. 1016.) There is no such problem in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The Priests contend the subpoenas were impermissibly overbroad as to time because they effectively asked for every personnel document since the Priests had been incardinated in the Archdiocese. As we pointed out, <em>ante, </em>however, the admissibility of other crimes evidence under Evidence Code sections 1101 and 1108 means relevant evidence could be discovered by such requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>As to place, the Priests complain the subpoenas are not limited to crimes committed in Los Angeles County in compliance with Penal Code section 917, which provides \u201c[t]he grand jury may inquire into all public offenses committed or triable within the county . . . .\u201d However, as the District Attorney points out, Penal Code section 784.7, subdivision (a), allows a sex crime committed outside Los Angeles County to be joined with a Los Angeles County sex crime, and then for the entire case to be prosecuted in Los Angeles County.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Betts </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1039, 1059 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 138, 103 P.3d 883] [section 784.7 \u201cexpands venue for specified offenses to permit crimes . . . that occurred in different counties to be tried in the same county\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">As to conduct, the Priests contend \u201cThe term \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 is so vague and broad that a reasonable Custodian of Records might feel obliged to produce information pertaining to sexual conduct that is not criminal at all, such as verbal sexual harassment, [or] consensual sexual activity with an adult \u2014 one person\u2019s bawdy joke may be another person\u2019s \u2018sexual abuse.\u2019 Indeed, in the context of the Catholic clergy . . . even masturbation and sexual thoughts may be deemed to be sinful and abusive.\u201d However, there is no indication whatsoever the subpoenas were read in such a broad manner. Had they been, objections could have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Moreover, this claim is based on a reading of the phrase \u201cevidence of child molestation and sexual abuse\u201d in which the word \u201cchild\u201d does not modify \u201csexual abuse.\u201d This is not the only, or even the most natural, interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">8. <em>Several grand jury issues already have been decided in prior appellate proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Priests raise several grand jury issues that were decided in our earlier opinion in this matter. They claim the grand jury did not have the power to issue subpoenas duces tecum and, if it did, these subpoenas were defective because they were unaccompanied by a good faith affidavit. These issues were decided in <em>M. B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 1384, and it is unnecessary to revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>9. <em>Priests\u2019 claims regarding particular documents are insufficiently presented and will not be addressed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The Priests contend some of the subpoenaed documents cannot be disclosed without violating the hearsay rule, the confidentiality of third persons named in the subpoenaed documents, the right of privacy, and the attorney-client, attorney work product, psychotherapist-patient, and clergy-penitent privileges. As to all of these claims, however, the Priests have failed entirely to specify which documents they are challenging. Their pleadings merely refer to \u201csome of these records\u201d and similarly vague characterizations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This does not constitute adequate briefing. (Cf. <em>Jones v.
