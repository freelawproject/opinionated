J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff, Virginia Silano, appeals from the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant George Cooney\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on her claims of slander and libel per se. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court erred (1) in finding that the defendant's statements to the Trumbull Police Department were not\n   defamatory and (2) in\n   concluding that the defendant did not abuse his qualified privilege in making such statements to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In 2009, the plaintiff and the defendant were members of the Pinewood Lake Association (association) and residents of Trumbull. At that time, the defendant, a retired New York City police officer, owned and operated a business, Hemlock Manor, LLC (Hemlock), which conducted \"audits\" and investigations on behalf of Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of New York (Pepsi Bottling). The audits were conducted pursuant to a contract that Hemlock had with a business known as Winthrop Douglas, Inc. (Winthrop), which, in turn, had a contract with Pepsi Bottling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When conducting a typical audit for Pepsi Bottling, the defendant would purchase Pepsi products at various locations throughout New York in order to recover certain \"codes\" from these items, which he would later provide to Winthrop. The defendant also would purchase Pepsi products at his own expense in an attempt to procure contracts with other Pepsi distributors. Significantly, as a result of these endeavors, the defendant accumulated large quantities of soda. He often donated the soda to various charitable organizations throughout New York, but he also stored a substantial portion in his home garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2009, the defendant, while serving as president of the board of governors of the association, proposed\n   that if the association acquired a vending machine, he would stock it with soda at no cost. The board of governors approved the proposal, and the association eventually acquired a vending machine. The association had the vending machine installed near the community beach on Pinewood Lake and sold the soda for fifty cents each, which was \"pure profit\" for the association. According to the association's financial statements, the income from the soda was $ 1093.54 in 2009 and was $ 1955.83 in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At some point in 2010, however, the plaintiff became concerned about the amount of litter the vending machine was causing around her home and the quality of the soda being sold. She complained to the defendant about the discarded soda cans and the fact that they could not be returned for a bottle deposit refund in Connecticut because they had been purchased in New York. Despite her complaint, the association continued to operate the vending machine and the defendant continued to stock it. In 2011, the plaintiff began making phone calls to Pepsi Bottling, complaining that the defendant was redistributing expired Pepsi products that were not redeemable in Connecticut. When making her complaints to Pepsi Bottling, the plaintiff provided her name and telephone number as return contact information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 2011, the president of Winthrop, Marc Aliberti, notified the defendant that the plaintiff was making\n   complaints to Pepsi Bottling about him. Specifically, Aliberti told the defendant that the plaintiff was providing Pepsi Bottling with negative character references and making false allegations, including telling the company that the defendant was selling \"expired\" and\n   \"dirty\" soda in Connecticut and acting in a negative manner while doing so. After he was provided with this information, the defendant prepared a statement to the Trumbull Police Department in order to make a record of the situation. Detective Kevin Hammel told the defendant that, while the matter appeared to be civil in nature, if the plaintiff's behavior continued, the defendant could file an additional complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 28, 2011, Aliberti again called the defendant to tell him that the plaintiff had made additional false statements about the defendant to Pepsi Bottling. The defendant was informed that the plaintiff had accused him of selling Pepsi products to \"every store in Trumbull\" and that he was selling the products in an \"otherwise negative manner.\" In a sworn statement, dated August 5, 2011, the defendant relayed this information to the Trumbull Police Department. The defendant indicated that the plaintiff's false allegations to Pepsi Bottling have \"caused a threat of cancellation of [his] employment services with the Pepsi organization\" and \"serve no other legitimate purpose other than to repeatedly annoy and alarm [him] and [his] business associates to the point of unnecessary disruption and threat of cancellation of services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result of the defendant's statements, the Trumbull Police Department commenced a criminal investigation into the matter. In connection with this investigation, Hammel on several occasions spoke with Aliberti, who corroborated the defendant's complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hammel concluded\n   on the basis of this information that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff on a charge of harassment. He applied for an arrest warrant, and the application was granted on November 22, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following her arrest, the plaintiff was charged with harassment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After several court appearances, the charge was dismissed. On June 10, 2014, the plaintiff\n   commenced a civil action against the defendant and Hemlock, alleging claims sounding in malicious prosecution, slander per se and libel per se. Following a bench trial, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant and Hemlock on all counts. The plaintiff now appeals from the judgment in favor of the defendant on the third and fourth counts of her complaint, which, respectively, allege slander per se and libel per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in finding that the defendant's statements to the Trumbull Police Department did not constitute slander per se or libel per se. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court misconstrued established precedent in concluding that harassment was not a crime involving \"moral turpitude,\" despite the fact that it was punishable by a term of imprisonment. Although we agree with the plaintiff that the court misconstrued the applicable law, we nonetheless conclude that the court properly found that the defendant's statements were not defamatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the relevant legal principles and the proper standard of review. \"A defamatory statement is defined as a communication that tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him .... Defamation is comprised of the torts of libel and slander: slander is oral defamation and libel is written defamation.... To establish a prima facie case of defamation at common law, the plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant published a defamatory statement; (2) the defamatory statement identified the plaintiff to a third person; (3) the defamatory statement was published to a third person; and (4) the plaintiff's reputation suffered injury as a result of the statement....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Statements deemed defamatory per se are ones in which the defamatory meaning of the speech is apparent on the face of the statement.... Our state has generally recognized two classes of defamation per se: (1) statements that accuse a party of a crime involving moral turpitude or to which an infamous penalty is attached, and (2) statements that accuse a party of improper conduct or lack of skill or integrity in his or her profession or\n   business and the statement is calculated to cause injury to that party in such profession or business.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490421\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/1157/#p544\">\n    175 Conn.

This is because the law presumes general damages where the defamatory statements are actionable per se....

Our review is plenary, however, in ascertaining whether the trial court applied the correct legal standard in deciding the merits of the plaintiff's claim. See\n   <em>\n    Hartford Courant Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828623\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/86/#p96\">\n    261 Conn. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=801%20A.2d%20759\">\n    801 A.2d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n   In finding in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff's claims of defamation per se, the court noted that although, \"[t]o an attorney or person trained in the law,\" the defendant's statements to the Trumbull Police Department accused the plaintiff of harassment in the second degree, which is a class C misdemeanor punishable by up to three months incarceration, such a crime does not involve moral turpitude and, thus, cannot support a claim of defamation per se. The plaintiff contends that the court erred in reaching this conclusion because, under the modern view of defamation, a crime of moral turpitude is a chargeable offense punishable by a term of imprisonment, such as harassment in the second degree. To the extent that there is any confusion in our law with respect to this issue, we take this opportunity to clarify our definition of defamation per se vis-\u00e0-vis imputations of criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hoag\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"758321\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/23/585/#p590\">\n    23 Conn. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590 (1855), our Supreme Court acknowledged that a statement that accuses a party of a crime involving moral turpitude, or a crime subject to an infamous penalty, is actionable without having to prove special damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Hoag\n   </em>\n   , our courts consistently have used the disjunctive \"or\" when listing the two types of criminal accusations that comprise this class of defamation per se under our law.

[The plaintiff] left her home telephone number as a return contact and there were several communications between [the plaintiff] and [Pepsi Bottling] before the allegation was deemed unsubstantiated.

This time, the representative at [Pepsi Bottling] asked [the plaintiff] to provide further proof of her allegations, which she was unable to provide.

Harper et al., Torts (3d Ed. 2006) \u00a7 5.10, p. 118. Specifically, in the Middle Ages, in order to establish the jurisdiction of the English common law courts, the plaintiff was required to show \"temporal\" harm-i.e., that the false accusation could subject that party to endangerment of life or liberty.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20A.3d%20215\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    p. 109 n.4. In the absence of temporal harm, the claim would likely be treated as a 'spiritual' matter under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts.\" Id.; see also W. Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 112, p. 788 (\"[t]he exact origin of these exceptions is in some doubt, but probably it was nothing more unusual than a recognition that by their nature such words were especially likely to cause pecuniary, or 'temporal,' rather than 'spiritual' loss\"). Some of these same scholars argue that courts should reevaluate their jurisprudence in this area, given that the ecclesiastical courts were abolished several centuries ago and the distinctions drawn between crimes for the purposes of defamation per se are in some manner arbitrary.
