On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred when it concluded that the commission properly denied the plaintiff's special exception application on the basis of (1) concerns about increased off-site traffic, and (2) the plaintiff's inability to identify specific tenants that would occupy the proposed office spaces. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts. The plaintiff, a Connecticut 501 (c) (3) nonprofit corporation, owns an approximately 11.7 acre parcel of land at 309 Barberry Road in the Southport section of Fairfield. The property is located in a AA residential zone and is solely accessible by a private driveway off the Barberry Road cul-de-sac. The property contains two buildings: a former parochial elementary school, which the plaintiff now occupies; and the former Christ the King preparatory high school, which currently stands vacant but previously had hosted 132 students and ten faculty and staff adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the former elementary school building, the plaintiff operates its Giant Steps School (Giant Steps), a private school that provides educational and therapeutic services for students with complex neurobiological based learning and developmental\n   disorders. Giant Steps is approved by the Connecticut Department of Education to serve up to forty students between two and sixteen years of age.\n   The plaintiff wishes to use the former high school building for its proposed project, Next Steps. Next Steps would provide continued educational, vocational, and other services to Giant Steps graduates with severe learning disabilities, as well as to similarly situated adults, who otherwise would be ineligible for many programs after reaching twenty-one years of age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 16, 2015, pursuant to \u00a7 27.0 of the regulations, the plaintiff applied to the commission for a special exception, requesting permission to use part of the former high school building for Next Steps. The application proposed designating six rooms in the building to host nonprofit agencies that would agree to provide vocational training opportunities to these young adults with severe learning disabilities. Section 27.0 of the regulations governs the granting of special exceptions. Section 5.1.4 of the regulations specifically enumerates the various special exception uses in all residential districts. As provided in the regulations, such permitted uses, subject to the securing of a special exception pursuant to \u00a7 27.0 of the regulations, include, inter alia, \"schools\" and \"charitable institutions,\" provided they are \"not conducted as a business, or for profit ....\" Fairfield Zoning Regs., \u00a7 5.1.4 (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 14, 2015, the commission held a public hearing on the plaintiff's application. Attorney William Fitzpatrick appeared on behalf of the plaintiff and offered presentations from, inter alia, engineers and the founder and executive director of Giant Steps, Kathy Roberts, detailing how the plaintiff's proposal complied with the technical requirements of the applicable regulations. The commission reconvened on July 28, 2015, for public comment, during which time it heard both support for and opposition to the plaintiff's application. A common thread among the neighbors who appeared in opposition to the application was concern about possible\n   adverse effects caused by the anticipated increased traffic volume in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 25, 2015, the commission voted five to two to deny the plaintiff's application. On August 28, 2015, notice of this decision was published in the Fairfield Citizen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, thereafter, timely appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the commission's decision lacked support in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following an April 21, 2016 hearing, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal, concluding that the commission properly denied the plaintiff's application. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a petition for certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (o) and Practice Book \u00a7 81-1, which this court granted. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we consider whether the commission has provided a collective statement setting forth its reasons for denial. \"Where a zoning agency has stated its reasons for its actions, the court should determine only whether the\n   assigned grounds are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was required to apply under the zoning regulations.... The principle that a court should confine its review to the reasons given by a zoning agency does not apply to any utterances, however incomplete, by the members of the agency subsequent to their vote.

DENIED.\" The reasons for the denial are not set forth in the published notice. On that same date, a clerk for the commission, however, wrote the plaintiff's counsel a letter providing the following three purported reasons for the commission's denial: \"(1) In accordance with [\u00a7] 27.4.1 of the [regulations] it has not been demonstrated that the location, type, character and size of use will be in harmony with and conform to appropriate and orderly development of the neighborhood, and will not hinder or discourage appropriate development and use of adjacent property or impact its value. (2) In accordance with [\u00a7] 27.4.3 of the [regulations] it has not been demonstrated that the streets serving the proposed use shall be adequate to carry prospective traffic and that provisions for entering or leaving the site have been made to avoid hazard or congestion. (3) It has not been demonstrated that the\n   proposed use is a permitted use in that there is no evidence that the proposed offices for charitable institutions will be [nonprofit] entities nor has [it] been demonstrated that the proposed use is a compliant education facility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although our case law directs that we not rely on a letter that was not adopted by the commission to evince the commission's collective decision; see\n   <em>\n    Smith-Groh, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496790\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/216/#p227\">\n    78 Conn.

The basic rationale for the special [exception] [is] ... that while certain [specially permitted] land uses may be generally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in particular zoning districts, their nature is such that their precise location and mode of operation must be regulated because of the topography, traffic problems, neighboring uses, etc., of the site. Common specially permitted uses, for example, are hospitals, churches and schools in residential zones. These uses are not as intrusive as commercial uses would be, yet they do generate parking and traffic problems that, if not properly planned for, might undermine the residential character of the neighborhood. If authorized only upon the granting of a special [exception] which may be issued after the [zoning commission] is satisfied that parking and traffic problems have been satisfactorily worked out, land usage in the community can be more flexibly arranged than if schools, churches and similar uses had to be allowed anywhere within a particular zoning district, or not at all.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    St. Joseph's High School, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491024\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/73/#p585\">\n    176 Conn.

The plaintiff contends that \u00a7 27.4.3 of the regulations sets forth specific requirements, which the plaintiff maintains it has satisfied. In comparison, the plaintiff contends that the neighbors' concerns were too generalized\n   to support the commission's purported reasons for denial under \u00a7 27.4.3.

This is because [t]he designation of a particular use of property as a permitted use establishes a conclusive presumption that such use does not adversely affect the district and precludes further inquiry into its effect on traffic, municipal services, property values, or the general harmony of the district....

Fuller, 9B Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (4th Ed. 2015) \u00a7 49:15, p. 148. Referencing these standards, Galante indicated that traffic delay would be \"at most [0.5] seconds per vehicle during [peak] time period[s],\" such that the level of service for these roads would remain at level A, which Galante described as \"the best condition from a traffic perspective ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One commissioner observed: \"[The plaintiff's proposal] was an example, at least statistically, of one of the least in terms of total impact when you look at the statistical traffic report....

The mere possibility of an adverse outcome, without more, typically does not constitute substantial evidence.

Specifically, the commission concluded: \"It has not been demonstrated that the proposed use is a permitted use in that there is no evidence that the proposed offices for charitable institutions will be [nonprofit] entities ....\" The plaintiff contends that this stated reason for denial is unavailing because it, in effect, requires the plaintiff to identify prospective users, whereas, to satisfy \u00a7 5.1.4 (d) of the regulations, the plaintiff need only identify the prospective use. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff aptly notes that \u00a7 5.1.4 of the regulations sets forth no requirements as to the identity of the user. In its special exception application, the plaintiff proposed using the vacant Christ the King preparatory school building as a \"[c]ompanion [s]chool (Next Steps) [f]or [y]oung [a]dults\" and as \"[o]ffices for [nonprofit] [c]orporations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   At hearings before the commission, the plaintiff represented that the proposed office use\n   would be permitted as a \"charitable [institution]\" pursuant to \u00a7 5.1.4 of the regulations. It further suggested that the commission \"should make it a condition of approval ... that [the occupants] be demonstrated to be [501 (c) (3) nonprofit corporations].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During public comment, neighbors expressed concern that the nonprofits might operate in a business-like capacity and that a prospective occupant might itself be a for-profit entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Echoing such concerns, a commissioner suggested that the plaintiff's inability to identify office occupants meant it did not commit to host only nonprofits: \"The proposal is to provide leased space to ... [nonprofits]. We don't know what those are going to be, we don't know what business they are going to be involved in, but they're not going to be charities. There was no commitment that they were going to be charities. Charities can be [for-profit] enterprises.\" Such concern was reflected in the third reason for denial provided in the initial letter to Fitzpatrick,\n   which read: \"It has not been demonstrated that the proposed use is a permitted use in that there is no evidence that the proposed offices for charitable institutions will be [nonprofit] entities ....\" That conclusion is baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In making its application, the plaintiff has agreed to be bound by a condition that it would lease the office spaces only to 501 (c) (3) nonprofit corporations. This use is consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 5.1.4 (d) of the regulations. Despite the plaintiff's express agreement, and the absence of evidence that the proposed\n   use would not be a permitted use, the commission denied the application on the basis of a concern that a for-profit entity might operate in the building. Unless and until such event occurs, the commission's denial improperly was based on mere speculation. See\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262853\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/69/#p75\">\n    130 Conn.
