We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We begin our consideration of the appeal with a brief summary of the history of HCAPPA. The Health Information Electronic Interchange Technology Act (the HINT Act) was enacted in 1999.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1999,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   154 (codified as amended in various sections of titles 17, 17B, 26, and 45 of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated). The HINT Act provided for, among other things, the electronic receipt, transmission, and prompt payment of claims for health and dental benefits.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   HCAPPA amended certain provisions of the HINT Act, and added substantially-identical statutes that permit health service corporations, group health insurers, hospital service corporations,\n   medical service corporations, individual health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and prepaid prescription service organizations to obtain reimbursement of overpayments of claims, subject to certain conditions and criteria. The reimbursement provisions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (10) With the exception of claims that were submitted fraudulently or submitted by health care providers that have a pattern of inappropriate billing or claims that were subject to coordination of benefits, no payer shall seek reimbursement for overpayment of a claim previously paid pursuant to this section later than [eighteen] months after the date the first payment on the claim was made. No payer shall seek more than one reimbursement for overpayment of a particular claim. At the time the reimbursement request is submitted to the health care provider, the payer shall provide written documentation that identifies the error made by the payer in the processing or payment of the claim that justifies the reimbursement request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (11)(a) In seeking reimbursement for the overpayment from the health care provider, except as provided for in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, no payer shall collect or attempt to collect: (i) the funds for the reimbursement on or before the [forty-fifth] calendar day following the submission of the reimbursement request to the health care provider; (ii) the funds for the reimbursement if the health care provider disputes the request and initiates an appeal on or before the [forty-fifth] calendar day following the submission of the reimbursement request to the health care provider and until the health care provider's rights to appeal set forth under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection e. of this\n   section are exhausted; or (iii) a monetary penalty against the reimbursement request, including but not limited to, an interest charge or a late fee. The payer may collect the funds for the reimbursement request by assessing them against payment of any future claims submitted by the health care provider after the [forty-fifth] calendar day following the submission of the reimbursement request to the health care provider or after the health care provider's rights to appeal set forth under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection e. of this section have been exhausted if the payer submits an explanation in writing to the provider in sufficient detail so that the provider can reconcile each covered person's bill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 17:48E-10.1(d) (health service corporations); N.J.S.A. 17B:27-44.2(d) (group health insurance companies); N.J.S.A. 17:48-8.4(d) (hospital service corporations); N.J.S.A. 17:48A-7.12(d) (medical service corporations); N.J.S.A. 17B:26-9.1(d) (individual health insurers); N.J.S.A. 26:2J-8.1(d) (health maintenance organizations); N.J.S.A. 17:48F-13.1(d) (prepaid prescription service organizations).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2017, the Department issued a notice stating that it intended to adopt amendments to the rule governing the prompt payment of health and dental claims, and adopt new rules addressing,\n   among other things, the reimbursement by payers of claim overpayments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   49 N.J.R. 2729(a) (proposed Aug. 21, 2017). One of the proposed rules stated in relevant part that a \"health carrier or its agent may offset\" any overpayment \"against a provider's future insured claims,\" subject to certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (later codified at N.J.A.C. 11:22-1.8(b)(5) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Dr. Vitale and the NJDA submitted comments to the rule proposal. They asserted that the reimbursement provisions of HCAPPA only apply to health benefits plans and do not permit payers to obtain reimbursements of overpayments of claims paid under \"stand-alone\" or \"dental-only\" plans. Dr. Vitale and the NJDA also asserted that the Department should confirm that the word \"offset\" used in the proposed regulation has the same meaning as \"setoff\" under New Jersey law. They argued that the payer could not apply a \"setoff\" to a provider's future claims for patients other than the patient for whom the overpayment was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Department responded to these comments when it issued its notice of rule adoption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   50 N.J.R. 829(a) (Feb. 5, 2018). The Department stated that the suggested change in the proposed rule governing reimbursement of overpayments is not required. The Department noted that the reimbursement provisions apply to health carriers, which as defined under HCAPPA do not include dental service corporations or dental plan organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Department concluded, however, that health carriers could nevertheless obtain reimbursements of any overpayments they may have made on claims, including claims submitted under \"stand-alone\" or \"dental-only\" plans. The Department stated that HCAPPA's reimbursement provisions \"are based on the type of carrier, not the type of insurance plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Department cited as authority for its comment our unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    N.J.

The Department stated, \"[u]pon review, the Department has determined that no clarification is necessary as [the words] 'offset' and 'setoff' are synonymous.\" The Department also stated that it did not \"believe there is any need to define these terms since their meaning is plain and well-understood.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Department argues that the NJDA is barred under principles of collateral estoppel from raising its challenge to the rules adopted to implement the reimbursement provisions of HCAPPA.

Indeed, it would be absurd and unreasonable to read HCAPPA as permitting the payers identified in HCAPPA to recoup overpayments for all claims except those paid under dental plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We therefore conclude that HCAPPA permits the payers identified in the reimbursement provisions to obtain recovery for any overpayment of claims paid by these entities, including claims submitted under \"stand-alone\" or \"dental-only\" plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dr. Vitale also argues that the Department erred by failing to \"clarify\" the regulation that allows carriers to obtain reimbursement of an overpayment by offsetting the amount of the overpayment \"against a provider's future insured claims.\" N.J.A.C. 11:22-1.8(b)(5). He argues the Department should have clarified the regulations by defining the term \"offset\" and \"setoff\" to limit the claims from which a payer can obtain reimbursement. Dr. Vitale asserts that such a clarification is required so that the regulations are consistent with the common law of restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In support of his argument, Dr. Vitale relies upon the innocent third-party exception to the common law right of restitution, which is set forth in\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 67 (Am. Law Inst. 2011), which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) [a] payee without notice takes payment free of a restitution claim to which it would otherwise be subject, but only to the extent that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (a) the payee accepts the funds in satisfaction or reduction of the payee's valid claim as creditor of the payor or of another person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (b) the payee's receipt of the funds reduces the amount of the payee's claim pursuant to an obligation or instrument that the payee has previously acquired for value and without notice of any infirmity; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (c) the payee's receipt of the funds reduces the amount of the payee's inchoate claim in restitution against the payor or another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) [a] payee is entitled to the defense described in this section only if payment becomes final, and the payee learns of the payment and its ostensible application,\n   before the payee has notice of the facts underlying the restitution claim the defense would cut off. For purposes of this subsection, a payment becomes final when the\n   payor is no longer entitled to countermand or recover it without the aid of legal process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Vitale argues that our decision in\n   <em>\n    H.

In doing so, we relied upon\n   <em>\n    Restatement of Restitution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14 (Am.

In these circumstances, the payers of claims and the providers are engaged in an ongoing relationship of claims submission and payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This relationship generates new claims, which a provider submits for payment, and if all claims have not been paid, payment is not final. A comment to the\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   notes that \"[a] payment that is not yet final is one that may be recovered by legitimate self-help, without reference to either claims or defenses in restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 67, cmt. h.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any event, Dr. Vitale's reliance upon the\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   and the common law of restitution as a basis for his challenge to the regulations is misplaced. In obtaining reimbursement as permitted by HCAPPA, the payers are not asserting claims for restitution under the common law. They are recouping overpayments pursuant to the specific statutory authorization in HCAPPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The provisions of HCAPPA thus abrogate any principle under the common law that would otherwise preclude payers of claims from obtaining reimbursements for their overpayments. A statute like HCAPPA that abrogates the common law must be construed narrowly, but if the language of the statute is clear, the court must enforce the statute \"according to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.
