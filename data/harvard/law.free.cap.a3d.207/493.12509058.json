The defendant in error, the town of Redding (town), appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which granted the writ of error filed by the plaintiff in error, David R. Salinas. In granting the writ, the Appellate Court vacated the trial court's order denying his motion for a protective order that sought to prohibit the town from taking his deposition and ordered the trial court to determine whether Salinas' testimony was privileged under the new, qualified unretained expert privilege that the Appellate Court announced. To reach this issue, however, this court must overcome two jurisdictional hurdles: (1) whether this court has jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal from the Appellate Court's determination of a writ of error, and (2) whether the trial court's ruling constituted an appealable final judgment. Although we determine that we have jurisdiction to grant certification, we nevertheless determine that there was no appealable final judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and direct that court on remand to dismiss the writ of error for lack of a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our review of these claims. In October, 2012, the town assessed real property owned by Redding Life Care, LLC (Redding Life). As a result of that assessment, Redding Life initiated an action against the town to challenge the assessed value of the property\n   (tax appeal). Prior to the initiation of that action, in 2010 and 2011, Salinas had completed two appraisals of that property on behalf of CapitalSource Bank (bank), a nonparty to the tax appeal, as part of the underwriting process for extending a loan to Redding Life in 2011. In July, 2014, after learning about and obtaining copies of these appraisals through the pretrial discovery process, the town filed a motion for a commission to depose Salinas, who resided in Florida. Redding Life and the bank objected. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Arnold W. Aronson\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted the town's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, the town served Salinas with a subpoena compelling him to appear at a deposition scheduled for January, 2015, in Florida. Salinas filed a motion for a protective order in the Connecticut Superior Court seeking to prohibit the town from taking his deposition. He argued that he had not been retained in the tax appeal, did not have any relevant knowledge, and\n   could not be compelled to testify as an expert because Connecticut law \"prohibit[s] the compulsion of such unretained expert testimony.\" The town objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court denied Salinas' motion and ordered the following: \"The deposition shall proceed. The town shall pay the witness his fees and expenses as provided in Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (c) (2). The town shall enter into any reasonable protective order proposed by the witness or the other parties designed to limit the use of the information obtained in the deposition to this case only.\" Salinas then filed a writ of error with this court seeking appellate review of the trial court's denial of his motion for a protective order. Salinas subsequently filed a motion seeking the following articulation: \"Did the trial court conclude that ... Salinas can be compelled under Connecticut law to provide expert witness testimony against his will? If so, what is the basis for that conclusion?\" The court responded: \"The answer to the first question is no. It was unnecessary to reach\n   that conclusion because [Salinas] had already authored appraisals that contained his opinions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The town thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the writ of error for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the trial court's discovery order did not constitute an appealable final judgment. This court transferred the matter to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), and that court denied the town's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Redding Life Care, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490256\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/180/#p196\">\n    174 Conn.

In defining the parameters of this privilege, the Appellate Court explained that, on remand, the trial court \"should, in determining whether to grant Salinas' motion for a protective order because his testimony is appropriately barred by the qualified unretained expert privilege, consider (1) whether, under the circumstances, he reasonably should have expected that, in the normal course of events, he would be called upon to provide opinion testimony in subsequent litigation; and (2) whether there exists a compelling need for his opinion testimony in this case.

Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Initially, we must resolve Salinas' challenge to this court's subject matter\n   jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal from the Appellate Court's judgment on his writ of error, which was originally filed with this court but transferred to the Appellate Court pursuant to \u00a7 51-199 (c). We conclude that we have such jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Salinas argues that by transferring the case to the Appellate Court, this court lost jurisdiction over his writ of error. Specifically, he argues that, in the absence of a transfer of the writ of error back to this court, \u00a7 51-199 (c) provides no procedure by which this court may later review the Appellate Court's judgment on a transferred writ of error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further contends that even if this court retains jurisdiction over his transferred writ of error, it lacks jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f because that statute applies only to appeals, not writs of error. The town counters that, pursuant to \u00a7 51-199 (a), this court has \"final and conclusive\" jurisdiction over all\n   writs of error, even those transferred to the Appellate Court, and that we should interpret the term \"appeal\" in \u00a7 51-197f broadly to encompass the judgment of the Appellate Court on a transferred writ of error.

Our General Statutes do not define the term \"appeal.\" Turning to the dictionary definition of the term, we observe that \"appeal\" is defined broadly. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) p. 117 (defining \"appeal\" as \"[a] proceeding undertaken to have a decision reconsidered by a higher authority; esp., the submission of a lower court's or agency's decision to a higher court for review and possible reversal\"); see also Ballentine's Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969) p. 82 (defining appeal as \"[a]ny form of appellate review other than by one of the extraordinary writs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This broad definition is not precise\n   as to whether it includes\n   writs of error. It is plausible, however, for this broad definition of the term \"appeal,\" comprising any form of appellate review, to include writs of error, which clearly constitute a form of appellate review and are defined similarly as an appeal. See Ballentine's Law Dictionary, supra, p. 1380 (defining \"writ of error\" as \"[a] commission by which the judges of one court are authorized to examine a record on which a judgment was given in another court, and affirm or reverse that judgment according to law\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Chipman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509818\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/59/496/#p497\">\n    59 Conn. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20A.%20289\">\n    22 A. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, although our rules of practice may use the term \"appeal\" to refer to appeals by parties from final judgments; see Practice Book \u00a7 61-1 ; when previously interpreting the scope of the term \"appeal\" in relation to \u00a7 51-197f, we have construed the term broadly and have held that this court may grant certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 51-197f to challenge orders for which appellate review would be \"tantamount\" to an appeal. See\n   <em>\n    In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146949\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/247/#p258\">\n    293 Conn. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20166\">\n    977 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Thus, in light of the commonly approved usage of the term \"appeal\" and prior cases interpreting \u00a7 51-197f, the term \"appeal\" for purposes of \u00a7 51-197f clearly and unambiguously is broadly defined to encompass any review of a lower court's decision by a higher court that is \"tantamount\" to an appeal brought by a party from a final judgment. To determine whether a proceeding is tantamount to an appeal, this court has focused on whether the legislature intended this court or another court to be the court of last resort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146949\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/247/#p258\">\n    293 Conn. at 258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20166\">\n    977 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court held that a petition\n   for review of a three judge panel determination regarding statutory authorization to disclose the state's application for a grand jury investigation under General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g was \"tantamount to an 'appeal' within the meaning of \u00a7 51-197f.\" In reaching this holding, we recognized that the language of \u00a7 54-47g (a) contemplated an appeal from such a panel's ruling: \" '[a]ny person aggrieved by an order of the panel shall have the right to appeal such order by filing a petition for review with the Appellate Court ....' \" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20166\">\n    Id., at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20166\">\n    977 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a). Although a petition for review perhaps does not fall under a narrow definition of the term \"appeal,\" we concluded that the language in \u00a7 54-47g was \"a strong indication that the legislature did not intend for the Appellate Court to be the court of last resort with respect to the review of grand jury panel orders.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20166\">\n    977 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Analogously, although \u00a7 51-199 does not use the term \"appeal\" in relation to the mechanism by which this court may review the Appellate Court's judgment on a writ of error, a writ of error also is \"tantamount\n   to an appeal\" for two reasons. First, like \u00a7 54-47g in\n   <em>\n    In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02\n   </em>\n   , the language used in \u00a7 51-199 provides a strong indication that the legislature did not intend for the Appellate Court to be the court of last resort with respect to the review of trial court orders that give rise to writs of error. As discussed previously, although the Supreme Court may transfer writs of error to the Appellate Court, \u00a7 51-199 (a) specifically confers on the Supreme Court final and conclusive jurisdiction over writs of error. Nothing in subsection (c) of \u00a7 51-199 suggests that the legislature intended for the Supreme Court to lose this authority upon transferring a writ of error. Rather, we read the statutes as more logically manifesting a legislative intent for the Supreme Court to be the court of last resort in these\n   matters. Thus, as this court is the court of last resort in this state, it would be an illogical and bizarre result if the transfer of a writ of error to the Appellate Court divested this court of final jurisdiction in the absence of an express intent by the legislature to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Raftopol\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345235\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/681/#p703\">\n    299 Conn. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20783\">\n    12 A.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"it is axiomatic that those who promulgate statutes ... do not intend to promulgate statutes ... that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, writs of error and appeals share many features in common. The writ of error was the predecessor to the appeal and, in many ways, was the first form of appeal: \"Prior to the enactment of the appeals statute in 1882, chapter 50 of the 1882 Public Acts, there were no appeals as of right in this state.... The writ of error is the common-law method, and formerly the only method in this [s]tate, of carrying up a cause from an inferior to a higher court for the revision of questions of law.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Haylett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537550\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/207/547/#p550\">\n    207 Conn. 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20494\">\n    541 A.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). \"The appeal ... simply performs the office of the old ... writ of error ....\"\n   <em>\n    Schlesinger\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519667\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/52/271/#p274\">\n    52 Conn. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (1885). A writ of error is, thus, \"the functional equivalent of an ordinary appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/#p184\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is true that appeals and writs of error are procedurally distinct in how they are filed. Compare Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 63-1 and 63-3 with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 72-1 through 72-4. Like appeals, however, writs of error must be taken from final judgments; Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 (a) ; and must conform to the rules of practice for appeals. See Practice Book \u00a7 72-4. After they have been filed, writs of error are therefore prosecuted, briefed, and argued in the same manner as appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A primary distinction between appeals and writs of error is that writs of error fill a gap left by appeals by allowing nonparties aggrieved by a final judgment to obtain review. See\n   <em>\n    Bergeron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mackler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757722\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/391/\">\n    225 Conn. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391-92 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20A.2d%20489\">\n    623 A.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (noting aggrieved nonparty cannot appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 52-263\n   but must instead file writ of error to obtain review of final judgment); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 (only party aggrieved by final judgment of Superior Court may appeal). Rather than setting writs of error apart from appeals, however, this distinction confirms their resemblance. A writ of error is the means by which a nonparty may seek review of a final judgment. An appeal is the means by which a party may seek review of a final judgment. There is no distinction between a writ of error and an appeal that justifies treating them differently for purposes of \u00a7 51-197f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We therefore conclude that the Appellate Court's judgment on a transferred writ of error is tantamount to an appeal for purposes of \u00a7 51-197f. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal from the Appellate Court's judgment on Salinas' transferred writ of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Having determined that this court has jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal from the Appellate Court's judgment on a transferred writ of error, we turn to\n   whether, nevertheless, the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to a lack of an appealable final judgment. We conclude that there was no final judgment, and, thus, the writ of error must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The town argues that the Appellate Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Salinas' writ of error because the trial court's interlocutory discovery order was not an appealable final judgment and did not satisfy either prong of the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682753\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/27/#p30\">\n    191 Conn. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20566\">\n    463 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   for obtaining appellate review. See Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 (a) (\"[w]rits of error for errors in matters of law only may be brought from a final judgment of the Superior Court to the Supreme Court\"). Specifically, it argues that the trial court's denial of Salinas' motion for a protective order did not terminate a separate and distinct proceeding because the information sought will directly impact and is pertinent to the trial court's ability to resolve the underlying case. Additionally, relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Niro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Niro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%2062\">\n    314 Conn. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20801\">\n    100 A.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the town contends that there would be no irreparable harm to Salinas because he will be able to appeal from the trial court's order if he chooses to stand in contempt for violating it. Finally, the town argues that no public policy concerns in this case justify permitting Salinas to appeal from an interlocutory discovery order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response, Salinas argues that there was an appealable final judgment because the denial of his motion for a protective order terminated a separate and distinct proceeding. Specifically, he argues that (1) there was a clear and definite discovery order that constituted a\n   final and comprehensive ruling from which there can be no further proceedings before the trial court that affect him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) he is a\n   nonparty who is not involved in the underlying lawsuit in any way. He further argues that the discovery order is not related to or intertwined with the underlying case because the trial court does not require the information sought to resolve the underlying case. In particular, he argues that his appraisal reports pertain to the value of the property in 2010 and 2011, whereas the underlying case centers on the value of the property in 2012. We disagree with Salinas that the trial court's ruling was immediately appealable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. During the course of pretrial discovery, the town obtained two appraisal reports commissioned by the bank and authored by Salinas containing his opinions regarding the value of the property as of October 6, 2010, and July 12, 2011. Because the expert appraisal report independently obtained by Redding Life contained property values drastically lower than the property values listed in Salinas' reports, the town sought to depose Salinas to understand the difference in values. The town filed a motion for a commission to take an out-of-state deposition of Salinas. In that motion, the town listed Salinas' qualifications as an appraiser, stated that he had appraised the property in 2010 and 2011 at values substantially in excess of the value stated by the town's assessor, and sought \"to depose ... Salinas with respect to his determination of [the] value[s] in these appraisals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the trial court granted the motion over Salinas' objection, no deposition ever has taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There is therefore no record of what questions the town and Redding Life would have asked Salinas. Although it can be surmised from the town's motion for a commission that the town would have asked Salinas about the opinions contained in his reports, we do not know what specific questions would be posed; nor do we know what questions Redding Life, which also would be present at and participating in the deposition, would ask Salinas-questions regarding his preexisting opinions, questions regarding new opinions, or merely questions of fact as a fact based witness who had viewed the property in 2010 and 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With this factual context in mind, we turn to the legal principles that guide our analysis. \" Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 (a) provides: 'Writs of error for errors in matters of law only may be brought from\n   <em>\n    a final judgment of the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    S\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    uperior\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    C\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ourt\n   </em>\n   to the [S]upreme [C]ourt in the following cases: (1) a decision binding on an aggrieved nonparty ... and (4) as otherwise\n   necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction and agreeable to the\n   usages and principles of law.' ...

In the present case, the order at issue does not satisfy the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   because there was no clear and unequivocal trial court order. Specifically, the trial court's discovery order was not sufficiently definite, specific, or comprehensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Abreu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woodbury Knoll, LLC\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Niro\n   </em>\n   , in which the trial court ruled on the specific questions and documents at issue, in the present case, the specific questions that the parties would pose to Salinas are unknown. Although the town has stated that its primary purpose for deposing Salinas is to authenticate his reports, it also has conceded on numerous occasions that its questions would pertain to a broader subject matter-his reports in general and his opinions as to the value of the property more specifically. Redding Life has not stated on the record the nature or specifics of its potential questions. And Salinas has refused to testify at all, asserting that he has an absolute privilege from testifying. Although the court's articulation of its order specifically stated that Salinas could be deposed as to preexisting opinions, nothing in its order limits the questioning to this topic. Without knowing the precise questions that will be asked at the deposition, this court cannot determine whether any privilege, if one even exists, applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even if we assume that Salinas has an absolute privilege not to testify regarding his unretained expert opinions, without speculating, we cannot determine on this record whether this privilege applies to all questions that may be asked at the deposition. No privilege exists\n   that would prohibit the town from deposing Salinas altogether, and Salinas does not argue for such an expansive privilege. For example, even an absolute privilege would not prevent the town and Redding Life from deposing Salinas as a fact witness or as a keeper of records to establish the admissibility of his reports as business records. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-4. Although the town represented that it sought to depose Salinas about the value of the property as\n   stated in his reports, some of its (or Redding Life's) questions may be purely fact based, concerning, for example, what the property looked like when Salinas viewed it. Such information may be used to justify a change in property value if the property has been altered since the time of Salinas' reports, without requiring Salinas to give an expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because the record does not contain the questions that would be posed to Salinas, it is unclear which, if any, questions would be privileged. There is no reason the parties-including Redding Life, which has not participated in this appeal-could not have done as the parties in\n   <em>\n    Abreu\n   </em>\n   did: attend a deposition and make a record of the specific questions that seek allegedly privileged information, and then request a further ruling from the trial court on particular questions. Instead, without such a record, Salinas essentially seeks an advisory opinion, requesting a decision regarding the existence of an unretained expert privilege in the event that privileged questions are posed to him at the deposition. We are not prepared to issue such an advisory opinion recognizing a new privilege for expert witnesses on this record.

Rather, he requested such an order from the Connecticut Superior Court. We presume that, having invoked the jurisdiction of the Connecticut court system, Salinas will comply with Connecticut's resolution of his challenge to the subpoena. If Salinas never had filed a motion for a protective order in the Connecticut Superior Court, the Connecticut courts most likely would not be able to hold Salinas in contempt for failing to comply with the subpoena. Because Salinas sought relief from the Connecticut court system, however, the trial court may enforce the resulting order, and Salinas may be held in contempt for violating it. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Noll\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp\n   </em>\n   ., Docket No. CV-02-4034702-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204635591\">\n    2008 WL 4635591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *7 (Conn. Super. September 26, 2008) (\"This court has jurisdiction over the parties to enforce its orders and to compel parties to obey its rules....

He\n   seeks review from this court to obtain a protective order but also argues that the Connecticut courts have no power over him for purposes of contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, although it is true that a Connecticut court could not enforce the subpoena at issue as a contempt sanction because it was issued by an out-of-state-authority to an out-of-state witness; see\n   <em>\n    Struckman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504650\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/542/#p552\">\n    205 Conn. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=534%20A.2d%20888\">\n    534 A.2d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (\"the defendant does not have the power by subpoena to force an out-of-state witness to travel to Connecticut for trial\"); that does not mean the court cannot hold Salinas in contempt for violating a discovery order that was the byproduct of his having sought aid from the Connecticut court system. See Practice Book \u00a7 1-13A (a) (\"[a]ny person ... misbehaving or disobeying any order of a judicial authority in the course of any judicial proceeding may be adjudicated in contempt and appropriately punished\").

Even if sanctions will be of no use or are unenforceable in Connecticut, a party is not prevented from moving for a finding of contempt.

Rather,\n   <em>\n    Lougee\n   </em>\n   involved a discovery order that was the only portion of the underlying case pending in a Connecticut court. This court made no suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Lougee\n   </em>\n   that the reason why further proceedings would not affect Lougee was because the trial court\n   was incapable of holding him in contempt. Rather, the focus of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lougee\n   </em>\n   was that, because the discovery order was the sole\n   judicial proceeding instituted in Connecticut, the trial court's ruling terminated a separate and distinct proceeding under\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   's first prong.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=582%20A.2d%20456\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Lougee\n   </em>\n   , the discovery order in the present case is not the sole judicial proceeding instituted in Connecticut. Rather, the discovery order at issue is part of an underlying civil action instituted in Connecticut. Additionally, as explained in part II A of this opinion, the discovery order in the present case did not terminate a separate and distinct proceeding because it was not a clear and definite order, which distinguishes it from the discovery order in\n   <em>\n    Lougee\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, requiring Salinas to appeal from an order of contempt does not raise an important counterbalancing public policy in favor of permitting an interlocutory appeal. Such a result does not violate justice or public policy in the same way as requiring the foster parent in\n   <em>\n    Abreu\n   </em>\n   or the nonparty law firm in\n   <em>\n    Woodbury Knoll, LLC\n   </em>\n   , to choose between contempt and violating a law or ethical code. In the absence of an overriding, important public policy consideration, requiring Salinas to appeal from a finding of contempt ensures that there is an actual live controversy in which Salinas' legally protected interest has been adversely affected. See\n   <em>\n    Slimp\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Liquor Control\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300332\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/599/#p609\">\n    239 Conn. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20123\">\n    687 A.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (\"courts and parties [should not be] vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and ... judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others [should be] forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Once Salinas attends the deposition, objects on the record to specific questions, and a trial court decides which, if any, questions he must answer, the courts will be better positioned to determine not only whether an unretained expert privilege exists, but if such a privilege even applies in this\n   case. As the record now stands, Salinas is requesting this court to decide this issue in a vacuum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the discovery order does not satisfy either prong of\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   and thus does not constitute an appealable final judgment.

E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Peters\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dept. of Social Services\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709427\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/434/#p441\">\n     273 Conn. 434\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 441,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=870%20A.2d%20448\">\n     870 A.2d 448\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005) (\"subject matter jurisdiction ... may be raised by a party, or by the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Although the plaintiff in error in\n    <em>\n     Abreu\n    </em>\n    also was a nonparty, this court's analysis in that case did not center on that fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Salinas' argument appears to implicate the court's personal jurisdiction over him. He has not, however, disputed personal jurisdiction. Thus, we do not address that issue. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Waz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613418\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/365/\">\n     240 Conn. 365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 371 n.11,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=692%20A.2d%201217\">\n     692 A.2d 1217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1997) (declining to address implication by state, which was not briefed, that defendant may not have had standing to challenge police search of parcel that contained illegal drugs).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Our conclusion that the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the writ of error because the underlying order from which the writ arose did not constitute a final judgment necessarily means that there was a lack of a final judgment when the writ originally was filed with this court. Thus, we could have dismissed the writ ourselves when it originally was filed with this court. Rather, this court transferred the writ of error and motion to dismiss that writ to the Appellate Court, pursuant to \u00a7 51-199 (c), which expressly permitted this court to transfer this \"cause\" to the Appellate Court and extended jurisdiction to the Appellate Court to decide the motion to dismiss. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McCahill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828600\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/492/#p503\">\n     261 Conn. 492\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 503,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20A.2d%20667\">\n     811 A.2d 667\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002) (\"our transfer authority by way of \u00a7 51-199 [c] is not limited to a formal appeal, but encompasses causes\"). In light of this transfer, we conclude that the appropriate course of action is to remand the case to the Appellate Court with direction to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Saucier\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730505\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/207/#p221\">\n     283 Conn. 207\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 221,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20A.2d%20633\">\n     926 A.2d 633\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) (\"in a certified appeal, the focus of our review is not the actions of the trial court, but ... on the judgment of the Appellate Court\" [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). Finally, because we determine that the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the writ, we do not reach the issues raised in the first two certified questions, as the Appellate Court was without authority to determine that Connecticut recognizes an unretained expert privilege.
