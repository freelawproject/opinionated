Bar's Practice Management Advisory Service as non-identical reciprocal discipline; and it appearing that respondent did not file a response to the court order or respond to Disciplinary Counsel's statement but did file the required D.C. Bar R. XI \u00a7 14(g) affidavit on April 18, 2019, it is\n   ORDERED that Yolanda Thompson is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of six months\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to April 18, 2019. Reinstatement is conditioned on the completion of the two-day Basic Training and Beyond Course conducted by the D.C. Practice Management Advisory Service. Disciplinary Counsel has established by clear and convincing evidence that the facts affirmed by the court in her Maryland disciplinary proceeding would result in a substantially different discipline in this jurisdiction. Respondent was found to have negligently misappropriated entrusted funds, commingled personal and entrusted funds, failed to keep adequate records, inadequately represented a client, and committed unauthorized practice of law. In this jurisdiction, negligent misappropriation of entrusted funds would require a six-month suspension and the completion of continuing legal education. Therefore, we find that Disciplinary Counsel has met the requirement of D.C. Bar R. \u00a7 11 (c)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146715\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/860/363/\">\n    860 A.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2004) (imposing substantially different discipline of a six-month suspension for negligent misappropriation found by the state of Maryland).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
