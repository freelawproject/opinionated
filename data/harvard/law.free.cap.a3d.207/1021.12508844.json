Father appeals the superior court's decision granting mother's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities and permitting father to have contact with the parties' minor child only if the child agrees. We affirm the modification of parental rights and responsibilities, but reverse and remand the parent-child contact order.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      \u00b6 2. The parties' daughter was born in July 2002. In November 2012, the family division of the superior court entered a final order awarding primary legal rights and responsibilities for daughter to mother, subject to an obligation to consult with father prior to making any major decisions. The court ordered the parties to share physical rights and responsibilities. The schedule set forth in the order called for daughter to spend approximately half of her time with each parent. The parties were required to attempt to resolve any disputes about parenting issues through mediation before returning to court.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      \u00b6 3. In August 2017, father filed a motion to enforce parent-child contact. He claimed that mother had consistently interfered with his contact with daughter and recently had prevented him from seeing daughter at all. Mother denied father's allegations that she had interfered with his contact with daughter. She asserted that daughter, who was now fifteen years old, felt uncomfortable and anxious around father and no longer wanted to have contact with him. Mother asked the court to appoint counsel for daughter so that daughter could testify on her own behalf. Mother also moved to modify the November 2012 order to give her sole legal and physical responsibilities for daughter. She sought to modify the parent-child contact order so that overnight visits were no longer required and daughter could end contact with father if daughter felt uncomfortable. The court initially denied both parties' motions because they had not attempted to mediate their dispute before coming to court.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      \u00b6 4. After an unsuccessful attempt at mediation, the parties renewed their motions. The court appointed a guardian ad litem for daughter and scheduled an evidentiary hearing on parental rights and responsibilities for March 15, 2018. In the meantime, it ordered that father be allowed contact with daughter for at least one hour per week in a public location.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      \u00b6 5. The day before the March 2018 hearing, mother asked the court to schedule a separate hearing to permit testimony from daughter.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      She argued that \"certain events had occurred\" between father and daughter, causing daughter to express a desire not to have contact with father, and that daughter's testimony was necessary because only she could testify about those events. Father opposed mother's request for daughter to testify, arguing that it was not appropriate for daughter to testify about why no visitation agreement had been reached, or \"to address activity that is simply a recurrence of the same behavior/refusals which the Court was informed about at the previous hearing.\" He further argued that daughter could not testify unless the court appointed a lawyer to represent her.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      \u00b6 6. At the beginning of the March 2018 hearing, mother's attorney suggested that the court hear from the parties' other witnesses before deciding whether daughter should be called to testify. Father's attorney did not object. After hearing testimony from mother, daughter's therapist, daughter's school principal, and father, the court granted mother's motion to set another hearing to allow daughter to testify. Father's attorney asked if he could submit questions for the court to ask daughter. The court ordered the parties to file a stipulated list of proposed questions prior to the hearing.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      \u00b6 7. The second hearing took place in May 2018. At father's request, the court appointed counsel for daughter. Opportunity was provided for daughter to consult with counsel, and she did so. The court then questioned daughter briefly in chambers, in the presence of her attorney and guardian ad litem. Daughter's testimony was recorded and broadcast into the courtroom to be heard by the parties and their counsel.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      \u00b6 8. The court subsequently issued a written decision granting mother's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact and denying father's motion to enforce the original order. The court found that the parties' motions were triggered by an incident in July 2017. Daughter was with mother and stepfather at their summer home in Island Pond on father's birthday. Father was scheduled to have contact with daughter that day. Daughter wanted to remain in Island Pond and tried to convince father to delay parent-child contact. An argument ensued. Father then posted disparaging comments about stepfather on Facebook.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      Daughter saw father's posts and became deeply upset. She began crying and screaming that she hated father. She blocked him on her Facebook account and blocked his calls and text messages on her cell phone.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      \u00b6 9. Daughter later tried to talk to father about her feelings but was unsuccessful. She wrote a letter to father explaining that his negativity caused her to feel stressed, anxious, confused, and unhappy, and that she did not feel comfortable being around him as a result. In the letter, she asked father not to contact her and to consider engaging in counseling. At the time she wrote the letter, daughter was fifteen years old. The letter was admitted as an exhibit at the March 2018 hearing. The court found that daughter wrote the letter of her own accord and was not influenced by mother or any other person in doing so.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      \u00b6 10. The court found that father loved daughter but was unable to see how his interactions with daughter and his reactions to situations created stress and anxiety for her. It found that daughter had expressed reservations and concerns about spending time with father at various times over the years. At times, she had tried to\n     avoid going to his home, and she had left his home during a scheduled visit. This behavior had increased over time, but father's actions in July 2017 had led daughter to express a desire to cease contact completely. The court concluded that the breakdown in their relationship constituted a real, substantial, and unanticipated change in circumstances warranting modification of the prior order.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      \u00b6 11. The court then analyzed whether a modification of the prior order was appropriate under the best-interests factors set forth in 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b). The court found the first, third, fourth, and sixth statutory factors favored mother. Specifically, it found that although father loved daughter, there had been a breakdown in their relationship that father was unable to see, and he had not demonstrated an understanding of how his own behavior contributed to daughter's emotional needs and struggles. It found that daughter's developmental needs were now primarily emotional and that mother was able to meet those needs by supporting her participation in therapy. Father, on the other hand, did not support daughter's participation in therapy, believing that her involvement in treatment was influenced by mother. The court found that requiring daughter to continue to participate in the weekly overnight visits with father called for by the original order would have a significant negative impact on daughter. Removing that requirement would be a positive change because it would alleviate the stress and anxiety she experienced in anticipation of visits with father. Finally, the court found that although the parents had shared primary caregiving responsibilities in the past, daughter's relationship with father was now extremely strained, in contrast to her close relationship with mother. The court found the other statutory factors to be neutral or inapplicable. Notably, it found that both parents were able to foster a positive relationship with the other parent, implicitly rejecting father's claims that mother was attempting to alienate daughter from father.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      \u00b6 12. The court concluded that mother was better suited to meet daughter's emotional and developmental needs, and that it was in daughter's best interests for mother to have sole physical rights and responsibilities. It ordered that \"[f]ather may have such parent child contact with [daughter] as [daughter] requests.\" It permitted father to communicate with daughter through mail or her therapist and required mother to provide a quarterly report to father about daughter's school activities, progress, and medical status. The court declined to modify the prior order's assignment of legal rights and responsibilities. Father appealed.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      \u00b6 13. On appeal, father argues that the family court erred by calling daughter as a witness. He also challenges the court's decision to modify the previous order governing parental rights and responsibilities to effectively end his contact with daughter.\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n      We conclude that father failed to preserve his arguments regarding daughter's testimony and that the court's determination to modify physical rights and responsibilities is amply sustainable, based upon its detailed findings of fact, proper calculus, and\n     conclusions. However, we reverse and remand for the court to reconsider its parent-child contact order.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-23\">\n      \u00b6 14. We first consider father's arguments regarding the court's decision to hear testimony from daughter. The family court may call a minor child as a witness in a proceeding concerning parental rights and responsibilities if it finds after hearing that the child's testimony is necessary to determining the custody issue, the probative value of the testimony outweighs the potential detriment to the child, and the evidence sought is not otherwise available. 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 594(b) ; V.R.F.P. 7 ;\n      <em>\n       Cameron v. Cameron\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4710467\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/137/12/#p14\">\n       137 Vt. 12\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 14,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4710467\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/137/12/#p14\">\n       398 A.2d 294\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 296 (1979) (explaining that family court has discretion to permit child testimony on issue of custody if such testimony is in child's best interests). \"The examination of the child may be conducted by the court in chambers in the presence of such other persons as the court may specify and shall be recorded by a court reporter.\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 594(c). The statute requires the court to appoint counsel for a child that is called as a witness.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4710467\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/137/12/#p14\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 594(b).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      \u00b6 15. Father does not challenge the court's compliance with the above statutory requirements. Rather, he argues that he did not want daughter to testify because mother allegedly manipulated her testimony. \"[T]o preserve an issue for appeal, a party must present the issue with specificity and clarity in a manner which gives the trial court a fair opportunity to rule on it.\"\n      <em>\n       Sundstrom v. Sundstrom\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605893\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/577/\">\n       2004 VT 106\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , \u00b6 21,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605893\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/577/\">\n       177 Vt. 577\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605893\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/577/\">\n       865 A.2d 358\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (mem.) (quotation omitted). As noted above, father did oppose mother's initial motion to have daughter testify on the grounds that the sought-after testimony was otherwise available and the court had not yet appointed an attorney for daughter.\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n      However, at no point did he argue that daughter's testimony should be excluded due to mother's alleged improper influence. By failing to raise this specific issue below, father failed to preserve it for our review.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605893\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/577/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      \u00b6 16. Father also argues that it was error for the court to consider the guardian ad litem's opinion regarding whether daughter should testify. Neither father nor his attorney raised this argument below. To the contrary, when the family court asked the parties if they objected to hearing from the guardian ad litem, father's attorney responded, \"No.\" Father therefore waived any objection to this procedure, which is expressly permitted by the Vermont Rules for Family Proceedings.\n      <footnotemark>\n       6\n      </footnotemark>\n      See V.R.F.P. 7(f)(2) (providing, in part, that guardian ad litem may speak on record at evidentiary hearing if attorney for child has been appointed and parties agree, or court requests, that guardian ad litem speak).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      II. Modification of Parental Rights and Responsibilities and Parent-Child Contact\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-27\">\n      \u00b6 17. Although we reject father's claims of procedural error, we nevertheless agree\n     with him that the family court's decision on parent-child contact must be reversed. By modifying the existing order to place daughter-who has repeatedly expressed that she does not wish to see father at all-in control of contact with him, the family court effectively terminated father's parent-child contact. The court's order was erroneous because it was unsupported by clear and convincing evidence that terminating contact with father was necessary to protect daughter's welfare and because it provided no pathway for father to eventually resume contact. We therefore reverse and remand for the court to reconsider the parent-child contact order.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      \u00b6 18. Modification of an order governing parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact involves a two-step process. First, the family court must find that there has been a \"real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances.\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 668(a). \"There are no fixed standards to determine what constitutes a substantial change in material circumstances; instead, the court should be guided by a rule of very general application that the welfare and best interests of the children are the primary concern in determining whether the order should be changed.\"\n      <em>\n       Maurer v. Maurer\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n       2005 VT 26\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , \u00b6 7,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n       178 Vt. 489\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n       872 A.2d 326\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (mem.) (quotations omitted). We review this threshold determination for abuse of discretion and will not reverse unless the court \"exercised its discretion on grounds or for reasons clearly untenable, or it exercised its discretion to a clearly unreasonable extent.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      Here, we conclude that the court acted within its discretion in determining that the complete breakdown in the relationship between father and daughter constituted a substantial change in circumstances to trigger modification of the underlying custody order.

Rather, it appears from the record that father has been an involved, loving parent throughout daughter's life and maintained regular and frequent contact with her until the July 2017 incident. Although the court found that daughter had \"observed a great deal of negativity in her day to day interactions with\" father that caused her to be stressed, expressed reluctance to spend time with father \"at various times throughout the years,\" and requested that father not contact her after his inappropriate Facebook posts, this is insufficient to amount to clear and convincing evidence that\n      <em>\n       any\n      </em>\n      future contact with father, even in a supervised or therapeutic setting, would be detrimental to daughter's best interests.

Our holding, as in any case of this nature, is not to be construed as mandating wholly unconditional contact between parent and child where such would clearly not be in the child's best interests.
