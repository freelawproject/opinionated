At the hearing, Queensgate's counsel represented that Queensgate was Golden Developers, LLC's assignee and agreed to redemption if Appellants had the funds readily available within 30 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 113a. Frempong represented that Appellants could have the funds within 30 days, but the Court offered them 60 days (until July 11, 2018) to obtain the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By three separate orders entered/docketed on May 17, 2018, the trial court denied Appellants' motion to strike or set aside the deed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellants' Br.

Specifically, Appellants aver that they were required \"to pay amounts beyond and in excess of the demands ..., to a party which does not own the redeemable [P]roperty and cannot convey said [P]roperty to them[.]\" Appellants' Br. at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Queensgate contends that \"the trial court expected all parties to reappear before it on July 11, 2018 to check on the status of [Appellants'] payment\" and, thus, the May 17, 2018 Order \"w[ould] not become final until after the scheduled hearing to determine if [Appellants] had completed the redemption process.\" Queensgate Br. at 17. \"If [Appellants] chose not to pay the redemption amount within the time required or before July 11, 2018, the trial court could deny their [M]otion and an appeal could be taken.\" Queensgate Br. at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During the May 16, 2018 hearing, Appellants agreed to pay Queensgate the ordered redemption amount.

In the May 17, 2018 Order, the trial court made its rule absolute, expressly granted the Motion, and specified the amount of money Appellants had to pay, to whom and by when. Although the trial court expected confirmation by July 11, 2018 that Appellants complied with the May 17, 2018 Order, there was nothing more for the trial court to decide after May 17, 2018. Contrary to the positions taken by the trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Queensgate, whether the trial court's order was final and appealable is not determined by whether Appellants actually paid the redemption costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v.

Despite that the\n   <em>\n    F.A.

Although this same trial court used differing procedural mechanisms, the effect was the same, the redemption was granted and payment was ordered. No further trial court action was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the May 17, 2018 Order \"dispose[d] of all claims and all parties,\" it was a final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 341(b).

Rather than request an accounting, and consistent with their claim in the Motion that they were \"ready and able to ... pay [ ] the bid or purchase price plus 10% of said price and all incidental expenses as required under [Section 32 of the Act],\" R.R. at 29a, Appellants declared that they could and would pay that sum within 30 to 60 days. The trial court ordered Appellants to show proof by July 11, 2018 that it paid Golden Developers, LLC $24,155.86 plus $6.44 per day plus other applicable charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 17, 2018 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is clear based on the law and this record that Appellants had the option of paying US Bank $13,239.52 plus interest, costs, charges, expenses and fees\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the sheriff's sale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 7281, or paying Golden Developers, LLC or its assignees $24,155.86 plus $6.44 per day\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the sheriff's sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 7293(a). Because Appellants did not act until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the sheriff's sale, they were obligated to pay the purchaser the amounts specified in Section 32(a) of the Act to redeem the Property. The trial court's order lists only those redemption costs expressly authorized by Section 32(a) of the Act and which Appellants agreed to pay. Under these circumstances, \"[US Bank] will be made whole, the purchaser will be reimbursed any costs incurred during the pendency of the sale, Appellants will retain their property, and the purpose of sheriff's sales under the Act, to obtain delinquent taxes, will be fulfilled.\"\n   <em>\n    F.A. Realty Inv'rs Corp. (2014)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930728\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/377/#p384\">\n    95 A.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellants further assert that the trial court should have stayed the proceedings to prevent the sheriff from acknowledging and transferring the deed after the Motion was filed. However, Appellants do not offer, and this Court did not find, support either in Section 32 of the Act or the myriad of precedential case law (particularly those in which Appellants have been parties) requiring the trial court or the sheriff to stay proceedings to finalize a sheriff's sale once redemption is sought. Accordingly, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in that regard when adjudicating the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellants also contend that Golden Developers, LLC's and/or Queensgate's actions before the Property's transfer violated Appellants' property,\n   contractual and constitutional rights and Appellants should be compensated with an offset to the redemption sum. First, nothing in Section 32(a) of the Act authorizes offsets for trespass or other alleged tortious conduct by a third-party purchaser. Second, Appellants presented no evidence at the May 16, 2018 hearing to support their allegations that any such conduct occurred. The only reference to violative activity by Golden Developers, LLC and/or Queensgate appears in the Motion and in Appellants' brief on appeal to this Court, neither of which are record evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court was bound to award only those costs set forth in Section 32(a) of the Act, which it did. Without record or legal support for Appellants' claims that they are entitled to an offset for Golden Developers, LLC's and/or Queensgate's purported pre- and post-sale tortious activity, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by not considering an offset when adjudicating the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellants further contend that the trial court's order was unclear or created an impossible and unreasonable mandate and disregarded the trial court's declarations at the hearing. We agree that the trial court acknowledged Golden Developers, LLC's assignment to Queensgate and granted Appellants 60 days to pay the redemption sums, yet its order specified that Appellants shall pay Golden Developers, LLC within 30 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notably, the trial court did not explain or correct those errors in its opinion. Notwithstanding, the errors do not affect Appellants' obligation to pay the ordered redemption sum, and an appeal was not necessary to correct them. Rule 1701(b) provides that, even after an appeal is taken from a trial court order, \"the trial court ... may ... [t]ake such action as may be necessary to ... correct formal errors in papers relating to the matter ....\" Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, although the May 17, 2018 Order afforded Appellants 30 days to pay after the trial court verbally granted them 60 days, the trial court's payment confirmation was not due until July 11, 2018, which was 60 days after the order was issued. Thus, Appellants, in essence, had 60 days to ensure that payment was made. In addition, the May 17, 2018 Order specifically stated: \"If [Appellants are] unable to remit said funds directly to the successful bidder for any reason, then [Appellants] shall deposit said funds into an escrow account with the [trial court], Office of Judicial Records, Room 296, City Hall.\" May 17, 2018 Order. Therefore, if unsure that the trial court intended for them to pay Golden Developers, LLC rather than Queensgate, Appellants could have paid the funds into an escrow account and, thereafter, sought clarification from the trial court. However, rather than pay into an escrow account and seek clarification, Appellants appealed from the trial court's order, thereby further delaying their obligation to pay the redemption amount they agreed upon. In any event, the trial court committed harmless error and did not abuse its discretion when adjudicating the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the trial court's May 17, 2018 Order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Judge Ceisler did not participate in the decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   AND NOW, this 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2019, the Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court's May 17, 2018 order granting Agnes Manu's and Steve A.

Moreover, the trial court declared based upon the evidence before it that \"[Golden Developers, LLC] ... assigned [its interest] to [Queensgate].\" R.R. at 113a. Finally, nothwithstanding Appellants' contention, although not evidence, in their brief to this Court, Appellants represented that Golden Developers, LLC \"change[d] its name to [Queensgate] with the same principal and same legal representation[.]\" Appellants' Br. at 5. If that is the case, Queensgate is Golden Developers, LLC's successor in interest. Regardless, without record evidence that Golden Developers, LLC's assignment or name change to Queensgate was fraudulent, this Court has no basis on which to declare that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Queensgate's Intervention Petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    THE COURT: Are you telling me under oath that you have the ability to make that payment within 30 days?\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    [FREMPONG]: Your Honor, we're asking for 30 days ....
