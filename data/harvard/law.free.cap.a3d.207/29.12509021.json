In this motion, the defendant alleged that his sentence was illegal because (1) Judge Gormley had presided over both the defendant's probable cause hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the criminal trial, (2) Judge Gormley was biased, (3) Judge Gormley did not order a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 54-56d\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) there were inconsistent statements by witnesses during the criminal investigation and trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 14, 2018, the court conducted a hearing on the defendant's motion. In addition to the claims set forth in his motion, the defendant also claimed that his sentence was illegal because the Bridgeport Police Department lost and destroyed evidence before the criminal trial and that he was the victim of implicit bias. One week later, the court,\n   <em>\n    Devlin, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision dismissing the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence. After setting forth the relevant law, the court concluded: \"None of the six claims raised by the defendant concerns his sentence or the manner in which it was imposed. To the contrary, his claims regarding judicial bias, lack of competency examination, implicit bias, inconsistent statements, lost evidence and that the same judge presided over the [probable cause hearing] and trial, all concern the underlying conviction and not the defendant's sentence. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider these claims.\" This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in his motion to correct an illegal sentence. The state counters, inter alia, that all of the\n   defendant's issues focus on the events that occurred prior to his sentencing, and therefore the court properly dismissed the motion to correct. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the outset, we identify our standard of review. \"Our determination of whether a motion to correct falls within the scope of Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 is a question of law and, thus, our review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12507594\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/203/683/#p584\">\n    187 Conn.

In the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of its jurisdiction are delineated by the common law.... It is well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This is so because the court loses jurisdiction over the case when the defendant is committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction and begins serving the sentence.... Because it is well established that the jurisdiction of the trial court terminates once a defendant has been sentenced, a trial court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant's sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act.... [Practice Book] \u00a7 43-22 embodies a common-law exception that permits the trial court to correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition.... Thus, if the defendant cannot demonstrate that his motion to correct falls within the purview of \u00a7 43-22, the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it....\n   <em>\n    [I]n order for the court to have jurisdiction over a motion to correct an illegal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sentence after the sentence has been executed, the sentencing proceeding [itself] ... must be the subject of the attack\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[A]n illegal sentence is essentially one [that] either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant's right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory. By contrast ... [s]entences imposed in an illegal manner have been defined as being within the relevant statutory limits but ... imposed in a way [that] violates [a] defendant's right ... to be addressed personally at sentencing and to speak in mitigation of punishment ... or his right to be sentenced by a judge relying on accurate information or considerations solely in the record, or his right that the government keep its plea agreement promises .... These definitions are not exhaustive, however, and the parameters of an invalid sentence will evolve ... as additional rights and procedures affecting sentencing are subsequently recognized under state and federal law.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12507594\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/203/683/#p584\">\n    187 Conn.

While stopped at a red light at the intersection of Fairfield and Iranistan Avenues, Sierra spotted two young women, Tracey Gabree and Terri Horeglad, with whom he was acquainted, standing at a nearby pay telephone.

A man, later identified by Sierra and Gabree as the defendant, emerged from the tan car and approached the passenger side of Sierra's car, where Horeglad remained seated. Sierra jumped out of his car and asked the defendant what was wrong. The defendant, who did not respond, pulled out what appeared to be a .32 or .38 caliber chrome plated revolver and fired four shots at Horeglad, each of which entered the right side of her body.
