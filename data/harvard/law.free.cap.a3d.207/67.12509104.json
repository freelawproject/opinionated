(BASI), appeal from the judgment of the trial court denying their application to vacate and granting a motion to confirm an arbitration award in favor of the defendants, James J. Benincasa and Jody L. Benincasa. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly denied the application to vacate the arbitration award because the award was (1) not timely issued, (2) predicated on a manifest disregard of the law, (3) not mutual, final and definite, and (4) in\n   violation of public policy. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"The dispute which brought the parties to arbitration involved the purchase of two $ 16 million individual whole life insurance policies on the lives of the [defendants], who were the president and vice president, respectively, and sole owners of [Mortgages Unlimited, Inc. (MUI) ], an S corporation. The policies were purchased by the Benistar 419 Plan and Trust (plan), a multiple employer welfare benefit plan. The funding for the purchase of the policies came from MUI's participation in, and contributions to, the plan. BESTCO was the plan sponsor, and BASI was the administrator of\n   the plan. The Plan was designed to comply with Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 419A (f) (6). In its conception, the plan was to provide tax deductions to participating employers, such as MUI, for contributions paid by them to the plan's trust fund. The contributions, in turn, funded the premiums for preretirement life insurance policies for key employees under the plan. The Plan issued a certificate of coverage to the employer, MUI, listing the participants as the [defendants], each of whom was to receive $ 16 million in death benefits. In this case, MUI contributed [$ 700,000] annually to fund the policies between 2001 and 2004, totaling $ 2.8 million. The contributions to the plans were, in fact, claimed as tax deductions by MUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"In 2004, MUI transferred the benefits and life insurance policies from the plan to the Grist Mill Trust Welfare Benefit Plan out of concern that the plan would no longer support tax free contributions to the life insurance policies. Benistar 419 Plan Services, Inc., was the Grist Mill [Trust Welfare Benefit] Plan's sponsor and administrator. The [defendants], as participants, and MUI, as employer, shortly thereafter, terminated their participation in the Grist Mill Trust [Welfare Benefit Plan], and the [defendants] took possession of the policies in their own names. The [defendants] were charged $ 33,546.90 for the surrender of the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (commissioner) challenged the validity of the tax deductions and ultimately issued the [defendants] a notice of deficiency on their personal income taxes on the basis that the contributions to the plan were payments on their personal behalf and were not ordinary and necessary business expenses of their employer, MUI, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20162\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The commissioner also asserted that the distribution of the two life insurance policies resulted in taxable income to the [defendants], which they failed to report. In addition, the commissioner\n   imposed underpayment penalties pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662A....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The [defendants] filed a claim for arbitration against the [plaintiffs]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on November 29, 2007, asserting, among other theories of liability, breach of contract for their failure to provide a tax exempt vehicle to purchase the life insurance policies. The arbitration was sought in accordance with identical provisions found in the plan Administration Agreement and the Grist Mill Trust Welfare Benefit Plan Administration Fee Agreement, which provided in relevant part: 'Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement or with respect to the Employer's participation in the Plan shall be settled by Arbitration, conducted by a single\n   arbitrator in New York City in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association [ (AAA) ] then in effect ....' The [defendants] submitted, inter alia, breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Evidence in the arbitration was taken on March 5 and 6, 2013, [before Arbitrator Jeffrey G. Stein]. The arbitrator's award dated May 15, 2013, was transmitted to AAA on May 17, 2013. The award recited a prearbitration request by the [plaintiffs] to add a cross claim in the context of the pending arbitration submittal, which Stein had denied on the basis that the AAA rules required them to file a separate arbitration and then consolidate the cases. Stein declared in the award that '[o]n or about April 18, 2013 ... the record was closed.' Substantively, Stein made the specific finding that the [plaintiffs] 'breached their promises and obligations to [the defendants] in numerous ways.' Pertinently, this included a breach of the [plaintiffs'] 'contractual fiduciary duties [by] failing to provide a\n   compliant 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 419A (f) (6) plan and, most specifically, by not determining the maximum amount of contributions that could be contributed .... [The plaintiffs] ... failed to provide a tax free transfer of the policy out of the plan to the [defendants].' Stein awarded the [defendants] the following damages: (1) taxes, including 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662A taxes, as of the date of the award attributable to 'the transfer of the [life insurance] polic[ies] as part of the exit strategy from the failed Plan'; (2) 'the $ 33,546.90 transfer fee' for the surrender of the policies; (3) the attorney's fees for 'the legal defense of the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ] assessment' ... and (4) any state taxes assessed for the transfer of the policies. Because the amount of the federal and state taxes and penalties had not yet been determined, and no findings as to such were made by Stein, he retained jurisdiction to interpret and resolve any disputes concerning the award. The parties moved for clarification of the award. In the clarification, Stein explained that the [defendants] had 'not [yet] settled with the IRS and, therefore, there [could be] no set amount of taxes and penalties that could be awarded.' Stein observed that his award detailed 'each component of the ultimate settlement [the defendants] [would] reach with the IRS and which party is responsible for that component. [Stein] believe[d] that [the award was] specific and clear enough.' \" (Footnotes added and omitted.) Additional facts will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before reaching the plaintiffs' claims on appeal, we underscore that the policy behind arbitration compels a deferential standard of review of arbitration awards. \"[T]he law in this state takes a strongly affirmative view of consensual arbitration .... Arbitration is a favored method to prevent litigation, promote tranquility and expedite the equitable settlement of disputes .... As a consequence of our approval of arbitral proceedings, our courts generally have deferred to the award that\n   the arbitrator found to be appropriate .... The scope of review for arbitration awards is exceedingly narrow .... Additionally, every reasonable inference is to be made in favor of the arbitral award and of the arbitrator's decisions ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Despite the wide berth given to arbitrators and their powers of dispute resolution, courts recognize three grounds for vacating arbitration awards .... As a routine matter, courts review de novo the question of whether any of those exceptions apply to a given award .... The first ground for vacating an award is when the arbitrator has ruled on the constitutionality of a statute .... The second acknowledged ground is when the award violates\n   clear public policy .... Those grounds for vacatur are denominated as common-law grounds and are deemed to be independent sources of the power of judicial review .... The third recognized ground for vacating an arbitration award is that the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of ... [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-418....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the [ground] that ... the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   will they review the arbitrators' decision of the legal questions involved .... In other words, [u]nder an\n   unrestricted submission, the arbitrators' decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact .... Furthermore, in applying this general rule of deference to an arbitrator's award, [e]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the [arbitral] award and of the arbitrators' acts and proceedings.\" (Citations omitted; footnote altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Local R1-126, National Assn. of Government Employees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754545\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/35/#p39\">\n    108 Conn.

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Moreover, [t]his court will not reverse the factual findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous .... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed ....

Joseph M. Pastore III, counsel for the [plaintiffs], wrote to Stein to advise him that the [plaintiffs] were going to file a counterclaim against the [defendants] and a third-party claim against MUI for indemnification. Stein replied by e-mail on November 7, 2012. While he deferred to Veneda Edenfield, AAA senior case manager, as to the application of the AAA rules, Stein expressed his belief that the [plaintiffs] would need to file an arbitration demand and commence an action which would, thereafter, be joined with the arbitration before him ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"On February 28, [2013], Pastore wrote again to Stein, indicating that the [plaintiffs] intended to initiate a separate arbitration against the [defendants] to assert a variety of claims which arose out of the same facts and circumstances at issue in the arbitration before Stein. Pastore asked for a formal affirmation from Stein that the [plaintiffs] would not be precluded from asserting such a counterclaim in a subsequent AAA proceeding or in a court of law. In the alternative,\n   <em>\n    Pastore asked that Stein keep the matter open after the hearings scheduled for the following week\n   </em>\n   and to refrain from\n   issuing any award in order to allow the [plaintiffs] to assert their intended counterclaims, including a claim for attorney's fees, against the [defendants] in a separate AAA arbitration, which could then be consolidated with the pending action to allow further hearings on\n   the [plaintiffs'] claims against the [defendants] and/or MUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Stein replied on March 1, 2013, by e-mail: 'I did not preclude anyone from doing anything. What I said in November, [2012], is that in arbitration you don't file a counterclaim or cross claim, you file a demand for arbitration. I am not going to opine on the consequences that stem from your failure to do so. I assume that if you file a demand for arbitration in 2013 for a breach in 2004 your adversary will assert a [statute of limitations] defense. Just guessing. As to claims for attorney's fees, let's wait and see.' On March 4, 2013, the [plaintiffs]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed such separate claims with [AAA against] the [defendants] and MUI ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The hearing on the [defendants'] claims in this arbitration took place on March 5, 2013, and March 6, 2013. On March 7, 2013, Stein wrote via e-mail that he thought the facts were clear and the law already fully briefed and resolved. 'Unless you all strenuously object, I am ready to issue an award and can do so in a matter of weeks. If anyone still wants to send me something, let me know, but otherwise [let's] close this and get it resolved quickly.' By a later e-mail that day, Stein provided the parties with an opportunity to file posthearing briefs through March 14, 2013. Although the record is not clear, apparently later that day, Mark Kallenbach, counsel for the [defendants], advised Stein that he had received the [plaintiffs'] arbitration claims and asked if Stein would hear a motion to dismiss the claims. Stein replied, on that same date, that he had not been assigned\n   the case and would have no authority to rule on such a motion. Pastore e-mailed Kallenbach and Stein, commenting that Stein did not procedurally have the authority to rule on the new matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"In response, Stein replied to all that he was aware of the intent of the [plaintiffs] to consolidate their claims, asked Edenfield as to the procedure for consolidation and indicated that he would delay his decision. 'I will hold my hearing determination in abeyance awaiting guidance from AAA.' Stein, thereafter, e-mailed the parties on March 15, 2013, to advise them that AAA informed him that the [plaintiffs'] claim was not 'a labor/ benefits case but rather a commercial case' and that the parties would receive a list of arbitrators from which they would choose. Stein indicated that he believed he would be on that list and that any motions made in that file would be made to the chosen arbitrator ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"On April 17, 2013, Stein again e-mailed Kallenbach and Pastore, indicating that he was informed by AAA that another arbitrator had been selected in the new case and he would, therefore, be issuing an opinion in the case before him. On May 13, 2013, Pastore e-mailed a letter to the AAA case manager, noting that the arbitration award had not been issued within thirty days, as required by AAA Rule 30 and Connecticut law, that [the plaintiffs] did not consent to the length of time it [was] taking for the award to be rendered, and that Pastore had not waived any future objection that the award [was] untimely. In response to Pastore's letter, Stein replied that he had 'told the parties that [he] was waiting on assignment regarding the new arbitration and that [he] would not begin to write the award until [he] heard from the parties about possible assignment and consolidation. No one objected to that.' The award was dated May 15, 2013, and e-mailed\n   to Edenfield and counsel for the parties on May 17, 2013. The award makes a specific finding that '[a]t that time, on or about April\n   18, 2013, just before my scheduled trip to Europe, the record was closed.' This comment likely refers to Stein's e-mail of April 17, 2013, where he indicated that he would be issuing an opinion.\" (Emphasis added; footnotes added and omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court applied the reasonableness standard when reviewing the closing of the hearing and found that \"Stein reasonably awaited the closing of the hearings in expectation of the submission of [the] additional element [of the separate AAA arbitration]\" and, therefore, concluded that the award was timely. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court improperly interpreted \u00a7 52-416 (a) and mistakenly concluded that the award was timely because the statute is clear and unambiguous that the award must be made within thirty days of the date that the hearing was completed or the date fixed for the receipt of material, and that \"[t]he arbitration ended March 6, [2013], and the [plaintiffs] submitted their posthearing brief by March 14, 2013, yet the arbitrator did not render his decision until May 17, 2013.\" Therefore, the plaintiffs argue, the trial court improperly confirmed the award, as it was untimely as a matter of law. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our case law is clear that the closing date of the hearing is reviewed under a standard of reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Trotta\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1958849\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/7/272/#p276\">\n    7 Conn.

In the present matter, April 18, 2013, was a reasonable date for Stein to close the hearing, as it only then became clear that the two arbitrations could not be consolidated. Closing the hearing after the determination that the cases could not be consolidated is not only consistent with the public policy that favors arbitration for efficiency and economic reasons; see\n   <em>\n    Remax Right Choice\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aryeh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035280\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/100/373/#p381\">\n    100 Conn.

The absence of a specific dollar figure does not render the rights and obligations in doubt as to who is entitled to receive or pay the damages. The award provides sufficient guidance from which the parties may identify the specific amounts of payments. The amounts are those sums assessed by the IRS and the appropriate state agency, as well as the legal defense costs of the IRS assessment charged by Attorney [Thomas] Brever. The [plaintiffs], therefore, have adequate information from Stein's decision to effectuate the award.
