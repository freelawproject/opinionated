The defendant therefore contends that the trial court improperly relied on its finding-that the witness was disabled for purposes of \u00a7 54-56b-to deny his motion to dismiss and to allow the nolle to enter over his objection. The state responds that the defendant's claim mischaracterizes the representations of the prosecutor at the time that the nolle entered. According to the state, rather than simply claiming that the witness was afraid to testify, the prosecutor represented to the court that the witness was disabled due to her compromised mental state-and that her statements of fear, among other things, demonstrated that compromised mental state. We agree with the state's characterization of the prosecutor's representations to the trial court. Our review of the record also reveals that, contrary to the defendant's claim on appeal, the trial court made no finding that the witness was-or was not-disabled. Instead, the court properly grounded its ruling on its\n   finding that, in entering the nolle, the prosecutor had not abused her discretion in a manner clearly contrary to manifest public interest. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On May 31, 2016, the defendant was arrested in connection with an alleged assault on J,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   his girlfriend. He was charged with, among other crimes, strangulation in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 53a-64bb, assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1), unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96 (a), threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1), and interfering with an emergency call in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183b (a). At the defendant's arraignment, the court issued a no contact protective order against the defendant as to J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 10, 2017, the day that evidence in the defendant's trial was scheduled to begin, the prosecutor sought to enter a nolle prosequi. In her memorandum in support of her motion seeking to enter the nolle, the prosecutor represented that J was a material witness. The prosecutor also alleged that, on July 21, 2016, J, who was originally from North Carolina and had returned to live there following the incident, called the victim's advocate and stated that she was experiencing \"bouts of depression\" and crying. She also reported to the victim's advocate that a\n   friend of the defendant had contacted her to urge her not to testify against the defendant. Although J consistently had stated that, despite her fears, she intended to return to Connecticut to testify, she also informed the victim's advocate that\n   she still thought about the incident and that it bothered her a great deal. J was scheduled to travel by bus to Connecticut on Friday, January 6, 2017, but the bus did not run that day due to a storm in North Carolina. On the evening of Sunday, January 8, 2017, J contacted the prosecutor to inform her that she would be unable to return to Connecticut to testify. During the course of that conversation, J requested help in finding counseling, indicated that she was afraid to testify and stated that she wanted to \"get on with her life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Relying on these factual allegations, the prosecutor contended in her memorandum that J had \"become disabled\" for purposes of \u00a7 54-56b. The prosecutor further argued that the issue before the court in determining whether to allow the nolle to enter was not whether J was disabled, but only whether, in entering the nolle, the prosecutor had abused her discretion in a manner contrary to public policy. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534560\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/185/199/#p204\">\n    185 Conn. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20867\">\n    440 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court heard argument on the prosecutor's motion. At the hearing on the motion, the prosecutor reiterated her reliance on, inter alia, J's statements indicating that J was going through bouts of depression and crying, that she needed counseling, was afraid, could not stop thinking about the incident and wanted to get on with her life. The prosecutor further represented that the state could not proceed without J's testimony and contended that J was disabled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor's statements in support of her representation that J was disabled demonstrate that she relied on multiple pieces of information to support her conclusion that J suffered from a disability due to the emotional trauma that she had experienced as a victim of domestic violence. Specifically, the prosecutor pointed not only to J's \"fear,\" but also to her \"depression\" and \"emotional issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several other statements made by the prosecutor at the hearing further demonstrate that her representation that J was \"disabled\" relied on more than a vague assertion regarding J's fear of testifying. Acknowledging that she had been unable to find legal precedent supporting her claim that J's mental condition constituted a disability pursuant to \u00a7 54-56b, the prosecutor lamented the lack of such legal authority, stating that the \"emotional tumult\" often experienced by victims, combined with their fear of the ramifications of cooperating with the police and prosecutors, \"literally makes them unable to come forward.\" With \"supportive counseling,\" the prosecutor continued, victims may be able to overcome their fear of testifying. These statements demonstrate that, rather than representing that J chose not to testify because she was afraid, the prosecutor represented to the court that J was\n   <em>\n    unable\n   </em>\n   to testify due to a disability. The prosecutor urged the court to find that her determination to enter the nolle on the basis of J's disability was not an abuse of her discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant objected to the nolle and moved to dismiss the charges, focusing solely on one of the facts that the prosecutor had referenced in representing to the court that J had become disabled pursuant\n   to \u00a7 54-56b-that J was unable to testify due to her fear. Fear alone, the defendant contended, is not sufficient to constitute a disability for purposes of \u00a7 54-56b. The defendant argued that J merely had elected not to return to Connecticut to testify and the prosecutor had chosen not to serve her with a material witness subpoena. The defendant did not respond to the prosecutor's representations that J was depressed and suffering from \"emotional issues,\" and that she had requested help in finding counseling services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court issued its decision from the bench, beginning with the observation that its role was not to receive evidence or to make a finding as to whether J was disabled,\n   but only to determine whether, in entering the nolle, the prosecutor had exercised her discretion in a manner that was \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534560\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/185/199/#p204\">\n    185 Conn. at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20867\">\n    440 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In finding that the prosecutor had not abused her discretion, the court relied on the facts alleged by the prosecutor during the hearing, viewed in light of the prosecutor's seventeen years of experience litigating domestic violence cases. The court accordingly accepted the nolle prosequi and denied the defendant's motion for dismissal. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Translated from Latin, the term \"nolle prosequi\" means \"to be unwilling to prosecute.\" Webster's New International Dictionary (2d Ed. 1941) p. 1465; see also Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) p. 1210 (\"not to wish to prosecute\").

Pursuant\n   to \u00a7 54-56b, that discretion is no longer without limit. As a general rule, a nolle may not enter over a defendant's objection and demand for a trial or dismissal. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56b. Although there is an exception to that general rule when the prosecutor represents to the court that \"a material witness has died, disappeared or become disabled or that material evidence has disappeared or has been destroyed and that a further investigation is therefore necessary\"; General Statutes \u00a7 54-56b ; the prosecutor's exercise of discretion in entering the nolle is subject to review by the court for abuse of discretion.

In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the federal District Court, which had denied the prosecutor's motion to dismiss pending criminal proceedings pursuant to rule 48 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and, when the government refused to proceed, appointed special prosecutors. Id., at 505. Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in relevant part: \"(a) The government may,\n   <em>\n    with leave of court\n   </em>\n   , dismiss an indictment, information or complaint. The government may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent....\" (Emphasis added.) The Fifth Circuit explained that the issue presented in the appeal was \"the extent to which the phrase '[with] leave of court' in [r]ule 48 (a) limits or conditions the [common-law] power of the [government] to dismiss an indictment without leave of court.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cowan\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 505-506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Similar to \u00a7 54-46b, rule 48 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure has modified the previous, absolute authority enjoyed by federal prosecutors to dismiss charges. The phrase \"with leave of court\" established a judicial check on that formerly absolute power. See id., at 513. The court explained that the rule was not intended, however, \"to confer on the [j]udiciary the power and authority to usurp or interfere with the good faith exercise of the [e]xecutive power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. [ Rule 48 (a) ] was not\n   promulgated to shift absolute power from the [e]xecutive to the [j]udicial [b]ranch. Rather, it was intended as a power to check power. The [e]xecutive remains the absolute judge of whether a prosecution should be initiated and the first and presumptively the best judge of whether a pending prosecution should be terminated. The exercise of its discretion with respect to the termination of pending prosecutions should not be judicially disturbed unless clearly contrary to manifest public interest. In this way, the essential function of each branch is synchronized to achieve a balance that serves both practical and constitutional values.\" Id. ; see also\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ammidown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174492,3681966\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/497/615/\">\n    497 F.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (observing that role conferred on judiciary by rule 48 [a] of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was \"role of guarding against abuse of prosecutorial discretion\"). Like rule 48 (a), \u00a7 54-46b allows for a deferential review by the courts of a prosecutor's entry of a nolle, solely to protect against prosecutorial abuses of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is highly significant that a prosecutor is an officer of the court, who owes a duty of candor to the tribunal. See Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3. Due to their function, in fact, prosecutors are held to an even higher standard than other attorneys. We have observed that \"[the prosecutor] is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who\n   seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20604\">\n    308 Conn. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20503\">\n    65 A.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ; see also A.B.A., Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function (4th Ed. 2015) standard 3-1.2 (b) (\"The primary duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice within the bounds of the law, not merely to convict.

Abuse of discretion review is precisely what it sounds like-upon a defendant's objection, \u00a7 54-56b requires a court to\n   <em>\n    review\n   </em>\n   the prosecutor's decision to enter a nolle for abuse of discretion, on the basis of the prosecutor's representations at the hearing. The mere fact that the court's review is a deferential one does not mean that, in every instance, a court must accept the nolle.

Accordingly, the trial court properly relied on those representations to find that the prosecutor was not abusing her discretion in a manner clearly contrary to manifest public interest. Contrary to the defendant's interpretation of the record, the prosecutor did not\n   rely solely on J's stated fear of testifying in asserting that J had \"become disabled\" for purposes of \u00a7 54-56b. Instead, as we explained in this opinion, the prosecutor made various representations consistent with the position that J suffered from a disability that prevented her from being able to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those representations included that J stated that she suffered from bouts of depression and crying, needed counseling, was afraid and could not stop thinking about the incident.

At the hearing, the prosecutor represented that she had concluded that, as of the time of trial, J was\n    <em>\n     unable\n    </em>\n    to testify due to her disability. Although a material witness subpoena is an appropriate measure for a prosecutor to take to overcome a witness'\n    <em>\n     unwillingness\n    </em>\n    to testify, a subpoena cannot overcome an\n    <em>\n     inability\n    </em>\n    to testify. The defendant's argument is implicitly premised on the primary argument that he advances on appeal-the defendant contends that J was not unable, but unwilling, to testify. As we explained in this opinion, however, it was not the task of the trial court-and it is certainly not the task of this court-to second guess the prosecutor's judgment that J was disabled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    For similar reasons, the defendant's argument that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the prosecutor's representations were insufficient to support a finding by the trial court that J was disabled have no bearing on the resolution of this appeal. First, as we explained in this opinion, the defendant's argument incorrectly interprets the record. The prosecutor did not rely solely on J's fear in representing that J suffered from a disability that prevented her from being able to testify. Second, the trial court properly made no finding as to whether J was actually disabled. It properly considered only whether the prosecutor had abused her discretion in entering the nolle.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
