Small contends that the court erroneously determined that the parties agreed to the terms of the modified divorce judgment. We agree and vacate the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] Josefine Bahn and Mark Small were divorced by an agreed-to judgment entered by the court (\n   <em>\n    O'Mara, J.\n   </em>\n   ) in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties later moved to modify the judgment as to parental rights and responsibilities. On July 23, 2018-the date set for a hearing on the motions to modify-the parties and the guardian ad litem (GAL) instead engaged in a judicial settlement conference (\n   <em>\n    Daigle, J.\n   </em>\n   ), after which the court stated on the record that an agreement was reached on all points. Without creating any record that would show the terms of any such agreement and the parties' confirmation of it, the court entered a judgment dated August 30, 2018, purporting to memorialize that agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] Small moved for relief from the judgment on the ground that it did not\n   accurately reflect the parties' agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 60(b). Based on its review of the \"notes of the agreement read into the record on July 23, 2018,\" the court found that \"[f]ull agreement was reached by the parties and the Guardian ad Litem\" during the settlement conference, the GAL agreed to incorporate the agreement terms into a proposed order, the parties then had an \"opportunity to express any disagreement with any of the terms of the proposed Order,\" Small \"filed with the [c]ourt several points of disagreement\" with the proposed order, and the court considered the points of disagreement before issuing the modified judgment. The court denied the motion for relief from judgment, concluding, \"[T]he terms of the proposed Order are accurate in all respects, and accurately set[ ] forth all of the several terms agreed by the parties and the Guardian at the judicial settlement conference.\" Small appeals, arguing that the court erred by modifying the divorce judgment with terms to which he did not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] When a judicial settlement conference results in an agreement, a \"[c]omplete record\" of the agreement must be created: \"The parties may memorialize their mutual assent by signing a written agreement or by placing their oral stipulation on the record in open court.\"\n   <em>\n    Dewhurst v.
