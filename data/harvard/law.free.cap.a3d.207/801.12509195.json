Richard Zappile of the Delaware River Port Authority received information that a 2011 grey Hyundai, registered to Erinn Thompson, repeatedly evaded tolls while crossing the Benjamin Franklin and Walt Whitman bridges, by driving through the EZ-Pass Only lanes without having a valid EZ-Pass transponder. Cpl. Zappile was provided with a log of each violation as well as images and the license plate number of the offending vehicle. A review of the logs showed that between May 2, 2016, and November 15, 2016, the vehicle made 220 crossings of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and four crossings of the Walt Whitman Bridge without paying the five-dollar toll. The total amount of unpaid tolls was $ 1120. Administrative fees totaled $ 5600. Notices of each violation were mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle, but she failed to respond to the notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cpl. Zappile contacted Thompson, who advised him that her boyfriend, defendant Daniel Marks, was the operator of the motor vehicle at the time of these violations. Defendant later contacted Cpl. Zappile and admitted that he was responsible for all of the violations. Defendant subsequently surrendered himself to police and provided a recorded statement in which he admitted that he was responsible for each and every toll evasion, that he knew he was required to pay a five-dollar toll, and that he intentionally drove through the EZ-Pass lane to avoid paying the toll. He also admitted that he received a violation notice for each violation and ignored the notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2017, this case was presented to a Camden County Grand Jury. The sole witness at the hearing was Cpl. Zappile, who testified to the above facts.

Defendant asserts that like the accused in\n   <em>\n    Kocen\n   </em>\n   , he did not make any representations or present any false tokens. Additionally, defendant argues that failure to pay an EZ-Pass toll is a civil issue, not a criminal act. Third, defendant contends that he was improperly charged with a third-degree offense. Defendant asserts that because this conduct should be penalized through civil penalties, theft of services is not subject to the gradation of theft offenses in N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, the State argues that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Kocen\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kocen\n   </em>\n   , the gas company delivered gas to the defendant without billing the defendant, due to a clerical error. The State submits that no one delivered the bridge or toll service to defendant Marks without seeking payment for the service. Rather, the\n   State argues defendant repeatedly took the volitional action of entering the lane marked EZ-Pass Only and driving through the toll without having an EZ-Pass transponder. Defendant\n   repeatedly drove through the EZ-Pass Only lanes for the purpose of avoiding payment for the service, use of the bridge, and concealed this from toll collectors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State also asserts that the grading statute, N.J.S.A. 2C: 20-2(b), applies in this case. As the title of the statute suggests, \"Consolidation of theft and computer criminal activity offenses,\" the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b) apply to theft offenses generally. As theft of services is located within the same section of the criminal code, the gradation portion applies to theft of services. Likewise, the evidence presented to the grand jury demonstrates that the value of the toll evaded totals $ 1120. N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b) provides that theft constitutes a crime of the third degree if the amount involved exceeds $ 500 but is less than $ 75,000. Finally, the State argues that the existence of civil liability does not preclude criminal action for the same conduct, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Darby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331324\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/246/432/\">\n    246 N.J.

The State presented some evidence as to each element of the crime of theft of services. First, the State presented evidence that defendant purposely obtained a service. Driving over a bridge subject to a toll is a service. By presenting evidence that defendant drove his vehicle over the bridge, the State presented evidence that defendant purposely obtained a service. Second, the State presented testimony that defendant knew that the services were available only for compensation. The State submitted evidence that defendant drove through the lanes marked EZ-Pass Only. This allows an inference that defendant knew that the service was only available in exchange for payment. Defendant additionally admitted he was aware he was intentionally avoiding the toll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third, the State presented sufficient evidence of defendant's physical act of deception. Specifically, the State presented testimony that defendant traveled through the EZ-Pass lane, knowing\n   that he did not have an EZ-Pass transponder. Use of the EZ-Pass Only lane is a representation that the vehicle operator possesses a valid EZ-Pass transponder. Driving through the EZ-Pass Only lane has no significant difference from placing a false slug or token into an unmanned toll collection receptacle. This evidence is sufficient to establish a physical act of deception by defendant. Defendant's purpose to avoid payment can be inferred from those actions. Additionally, since compensation is ordinarily paid when driving over the bridge, the presumption pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:20-8(a) that defendant's purpose was to avoid payment for the service applies. Finally, defendant admitted his intent was not to pay the tolls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Kocen\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Here, there is a physical act of deception by defendant. By repeatedly driving through the EZ-Pass Only lane without a valid transponder, defendant was committing an act of deception, unlike\n   <em>\n    Kocen\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant was never billed for the use of natural gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Counsel's argument that the theft of services statute does not fall within the grading provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b) is not supported by the statute or case law. The grading portion of the theft statute is a general provision which applies to all categories of theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b)(2) makes theft of more than $ 500 but less than $ 75,000 a third degree crime.

These 224 crossings of the bridge, without paying the toll, occurred at a rate of more than once\n   per day. This conduct persisted over an extended period of time, essentially on a daily basis. These facts suffice to establish a continuing course of conduct and trigger the provision in N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b) which allows the amount of the thefts to be aggregated for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although defendant here is charged with theft of services, not theft by deception, the court finds this distinction to be immaterial. N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(b) applies equally to both statutes. Defendant allegedly engaged in a course of conduct that involved an intent to deceive the same victim. The State presented evidence to the grand jury that defendant evaded $ 1120 in tolls, each time driving through the EZ-Pass Only lane with no transponder. Defendant used the same vehicle each time, which belonged to his girlfriend, and deliberately avoided paying the tolls. Similar to the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   , defendant engaged in repeated, similar acts of deception, with the overarching goal of avoiding paying tolls. Therefore, the third-degree charge here is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the court rejects defendant's argument that the penalty for toll evasion should be limited to civil liability only. The court rejects this argument since the imposition of a civil remedy and a criminal penalty are not mutually exclusive events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Appellate Division examined the dichotomy between criminal sanctions and civil penalties in the context of an analysis whether double jeopardy barred a later criminal proceeding in the case of\n   <em>\n    Darby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331324\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/246/432/\">\n    246 N.J.

The\n   <em>\n    Darby\n   </em>\n   court instructed that a court must evaluate whether the civil penalty is actually assessed for a punitive purpose to determine whether double jeopardy applies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331324\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/246/432/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331324\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/246/432/\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331324\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/246/432/\">\n    587 A.2d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ability of the State to seek both civil penalties and criminal liability as a result of the same or similar conduct is not limited to securities violations. The statutory scheme for the enforcement of tax laws likewise permits both civil and criminal penalties. N.J.S.A. 54A:9-6 provides for civil penalties as a result of a failure to file a tax return or the filing of a fraudulent tax return. At the same time, where there is an intent to defraud the state or to evade or avoid the payment of taxes, criminal penalties may also be imposed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:52-8 and N.J.S.A. 54:52-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   No case has been cited by defendant which precludes the imposition of both civil and criminal penalties as a result of the same conduct. The court finds that no prohibition exists which would prevent the State or other governmental agency from seeking both criminal and civil penalties as a result of the same or similar conduct. Rather, the only limitation to the right of the State to seek such penalties is the potential that where the civil penalties are deemed to be assessed primarily to serve the punishment goals of retribution and\n   deterrence, an analysis would be required to determine whether double jeopardy attaches.\n   Here, a demand for civil penalties has been made but no formal court proceedings commenced to collect those civil penalties. Further, the civil penalties assessed here also serve a remedial purpose and serve to compensate the toll collecting authority for the costs associated with collection of unpaid tolls. Additionally, the court notes that the civil penalties are imposed regardless of whether the toll violation is inadvertent or intentional. N.J.S.A. 27:23-34.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, the court concludes that the attempt to collect a civil penalty as a result of defendant's failure to pay the required toll on multiple occasions does not preclude indictment or conviction for this conduct. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the indictment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The five-dollar toll is paid crossing the bridge from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.
