The father argues that the court erred by finding that he is unfit as a parent and abused its discretion by determining that termination of his parental rights is in the best interests of the children. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The court found the following facts, which are supported by competent evidence in the record. In January 2018, the father shot and killed the mother in the kitchen of their family home. The children, ages sixteen and eleven, witnessed their mother's body and their father standing in the room with a gun on the floor. The children fled the house and the oldest child called 9-1-1. The next day, the Department of Health and Human Services filed a child protection petition and a request for a preliminary protection order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4032, 4034 (2018). The court (\n   <em>\n    Eggert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted the preliminary protection order, placing the children in the Department's custody. The father was later arrested and remains incarcerated while awaiting trial on a charge of murdering the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] A contested jeopardy hearing was held in May 2018, following which the court issued an order finding jeopardy as to the father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4035 (2018). The jeopardy order included findings that \"the father killed the mother\" and that \"[t]he evidence presented show[ed] the horrific psychological impact on the [children], ... constitut[ing] a heinous and abhorrent action by their father, an aggravating factor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4002(1-B)(A)(1) (2018). Because the court found the existence of an aggravating factor, the court relieved the Department of its responsibility to provide reunification and rehabilitation services to the father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4036(1)(G-2) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] The Department petitioned to terminate the father's parental rights in June 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4052 (2018). The court (\n   <em>\n    Woodman, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a single-day hearing in September 2018, during which it took judicial notice of all prior court orders in the case and, by stipulation of the parties, took \"judicial notice\" of two reports of the guardian ad litem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following\n   the hearing, the court issued a judgment terminating the father's parental rights to the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a), (b)(i), (1-A)(A) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] The court's ultimate decision to terminate the father's parental rights was based on the following findings of fact, which the court found by clear and convincing evidence and which are supported by the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [The father] is unable to protect the ... children from jeopardy and these circumstances are unlikely to change within a time that is reasonably calculated to meet the children's needs. Specifically, the father is in jail awaiting trial on charges of murder of the mother of the minor children. The facts as described by Judge Eggert in the [jeopardy] [o]rder issued on May 24, 2018 are grotesque. On January 7, 2018, the children heard a noise in the home and ran to the kitchen. They saw their mother on the floor, dead, covered in blood. They also saw a gun on the floor, with only the father standing there. [The older child] escaped the home with [the younger child] without any shoes or jackets even though this happened in the middle of winter. They ran to a neighbor's home and were able to call 9-1-1. Father had previously made threats to kill mother which the [children] heard.... [T]he court found by a preponderance of the evidence that father killed mother. The [c]ourt concluded that the act had a horrific psychological impact on the boys, and constitutes a heinous and abhorrent action by their father which is an aggravating factor. Based on this finding, the Department ... was relieved from the requirement to make reasonable efforts to reunify the children with the father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Father has not seen the children since the day of the murder. They had initially been placed with paternal grandfather. However, due to the grandfather's continual attempts to undermine mother's family and unduly influence the children with regard to what occurred on the night their mother died, the children were removed and have been placed with maternal uncle ... and family. The children are doing well there and wish to remain there....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Father is in jail facing murder charges. If he is convicted he will likely spend decades in prison. The children have not seen him in nearly nine months and have no desire to see him or to have a relationship with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Father's heinous and abhorrent actions towards mother and children make him an unfit parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The [c]ourt finds that the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   made a thorough investigation of the case and advised the [c]ourt of his opinion that termination of father's parental rights was in the best interests of these children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The father timely appealed the court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4006 (2018) ; M.R.

In reaching this determination, the court relied upon three main findings: (1) that the father killed the mother,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) that the father has been incarcerated for nine months and will be incarcerated for a long period if convicted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) that the father's actions had a\n   \"horrific psychological impact on the [children].\" Each of these findings is supported by competent evidence in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b610] The father also argues that his killing of the mother cannot be considered \"heinous and abhorrent\" according to 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1-A)(A) or otherwise form the basis of his parental unfitness because he has yet to be convicted of murder. But, as we have noted in regards to the similar language used to define an \"aggravating factor\" in 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4002(1-B)(A)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"it is not necessary for the court to have had before it an actual criminal conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Jamara R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014732\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/870/112/\">\n    2005 ME 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014732\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/870/112/\">\n    870 A.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    partially overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re B.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311720\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/58/1118/\">\n    2012 ME 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311720\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/58/1118/\">\n    58 A.3d 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The language of section 4055(1-A)(A) requires only a finding that \"[t]he parent has acted toward a child in a manner that is heinous or abhorrent to society\"; it does not require a criminal conviction.
