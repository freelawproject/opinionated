Mix Design for item 4489-2000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Final Determination at 2.) On November 14, 2017, DOT invoked a 30-day extension to respond pursuant to section 902 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.902.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On December 11, 2017, DOT provided Requester with redacted payroll records responsive to Item 4 of his request, withholding employee names, Social Security numbers, and dependent information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, DOT denied the request as to Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 on the basis that the responsive records contain trade secrets and confidential proprietary information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Requester appealed to the OOR, which invited both parties to supplement the record and directed DOT to notify any third parties of their ability to participate in the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 4, 2018, DOT submitted a position statement alleging that, with respect to the payroll records, employee names and personal identification information are exempt from access under the RTKL, and that the remainder of the requested information was exempt from access as trade secrets and confidential proprietary information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 34a-38a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DOT attached to this statement a sworn and notarized affidavit from Mike Bernetski, Civil Engineer Supervisor for DOT's Engineering District Office 4. (Final Determination at 2-3.) In this affidavit, Bernetski explained that the records responsive to Item 4 of the request were certified payroll records submitted by DOT's contractor, Glenn O. Hawbaker, Inc. (Hawbaker) and its subcontractor, Midland Asphalt Materials, Inc. (Midland), whose workers were nongovernmental employees. (R.R. at 40a.) Bernetski stated that he was informed by Midland that the responsive records to the remaining items of the request contained information classified as trade secrets and confidential proprietary information because they contained commercial\n   and financial information which was privileged or confidential and, if disclosed, would cause substantial harm to its competitive position by allowing competitors to ascertain its business plans and strategies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bernetski noted that Midland advised that such records included information not subject to public access, such as its \"proprietary mix formula for asphalt from which production quantities can be extracted and pricing information can be reverse engineered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Bernetski noted that the \"production quantities utilized in a competitive construction market [are] proprietary by its very nature\" and that disclosure of the requested records could be used by a competitor to reverse engineer bid information. (R.R. at 41a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On this same date, Midland submitted a request to participate in the appeal, which the OOR granted the next day, accompanied by a position statement and a sworn and notarized affidavit of its Senior Executive, William Coleman. (Final Determination at 3.) In its position statement, Midland alleged that DOT properly redacted personal identification information from the certified payroll records and properly denied access to the remainder of the request because the information contained therein was confidential and proprietary. (R.R. at 44a-50a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his affidavit, Coleman identified Midland as providing \"construction materials and services to DOT's heavy and highway industry.\" (R.R. at 51a.) He noted that Midland \"generally supplies asphalt products and specialized construction services to qualified heavy and highway contractors, including but not limited to [Hawbaker] for use and incorporation into [DOT] highway construction projects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As part of its business practice, Coleman stated that Midland routinely submits quotes for materials and/or services to qualified general contractors in competitive bidding processes throughout the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He described Project 94465 as involving the rehabilitation and improvement of certain sections of I-80 in Pennsylvania that included the preservation of existing concrete and the application of a thin asphalt overlay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He explained that Midland's construction services include \"the application of ultra-thin asphalt layering for preservation of pavement\" for which it \"utilizes a specialized paver to apply its proprietary formula of mix and polymer coating.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Coleman noted that Midland submitted its quote and related information to Hawbaker \"with the understanding that Hawbaker would maintain the confidentiality of Midland's information and not disclose the information to any third party, except as necessary for Hawbaker's bid to [DOT].\" (R.R. at 51a-52a.) He noted that highway procurement bids are extremely competitive by nature and dependent on the specific technical services offered by a contractor and subcontractor, all of whom must closely guard their confidential information to limit a competitor's ability to review and incorporate such information into future procurements. (R.R. at 52a.) He described the release of information such as that requested by Requester as having the potential of impairing competitive trade secrets and causing irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He explained that Midland \"takes great pains to ensure that its confidentiality is protected,\" including closely restricting access to the documents submitted to Hawbaker to essential employees, providing confidentiality training to its employees, limiting disclosure of documents to Hawbaker and DOT, and destroying all non-essential copies of such documents. (R.R. at 52a-53a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, Coleman noted that \"[t]here were only a handful of competitors offering\n   services in Pennsylvania with the technical expertise and financial resources to provide the materials, equipment and construction services for the ultra-thin layering necessary for the Project,\" and that releasing the requested information would allow competitors to review how Midland structured its quote to Hawbaker and DOT and reverse engineer the same. (R.R. at 53a.) He described Midland's operational plans for the supply and layering of asphalt material as having independent economic value to Midland because it is not known by competitors and not reasonably ascertainable by proper means.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following submission of briefs, the OOR requested clarification as to which specific records contained the information sought in Items 1, 2, 3, and 5. (Final Determination at 3.) Requester submitted a response indicating that the CS-4171 certifications identified in Item 1 were standard forms used by material suppliers and submitted to DOT and he attached a blank form to his response as an exhibit. (R.R. at 71a, 73a-75a.) As to Items 2 and 3, Requester noted that the information would be contained in construction documentation that was required to be submitted to DOT in accordance with DOT's \"Publication 2 Project Office Manual,\" relevant portions of which were also attached as an exhibit, as well as in the daily records of a DOT inspector. (R.R. at 71a, 84a-87a.) As to Item 5, Requester noted that the information would be contained in a TR-448A Job Mix Formula Report, another standard form used by DOT, with a blank form attached as an exhibit. (R.R. at 72a, 88a-90a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both DOT and Midland also responded to the OOR's request for clarification. (Final Determination at 3.) DOT submitted an exemption log to the OOR identifying the types of records in DOT's possession, explanations of the subject matter of these records, the applicable exemption, the corresponding item number in Requester's request, and the corresponding number of pages. (R.R. at 95a.) DOT also submitted an additional affidavit from Bernetski certifying that the documents reflected in the exemption log would be responsive to the request and maintaining that such documents were exempt from disclosure as trade secrets and confidential proprietary information. (R.R. at 97a-101a.) In its response, Midland simply reiterated its allegations that the information sought in Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 constituted a trade secret and confidential proprietary information. (R.R. at 91a-93a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    OOR's Final Determination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 21, 2018, the OOR issued its Final Determination granting in part and denying in part Requester's appeal. More specifically, the OOR granted Requester's appeal solely as to 10 certificates of compliance dated October 18 to November 2, 2017, subject to DOT's redaction of the quantity, lot number, and material produced, which the OOR deemed to be confidential. The OOR denied Requester's appeal to the extent that he challenged the redaction of personal identification information from the certified payroll records, concluding that DOT met its burden of establishing that the redactions were justified under section 708(b)(6)(i)(A) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(6)(i)(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Department of Conservation and Natural Resources v. Office of Open Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290370\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/929/\">\n    1 A.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) (holding that redaction of personal identification information from certified payroll records of third-party contractors was proper). The OOR also denied Requester's appeal to the extent that the remainder of the documents sought in Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 contained trade secrets or confidential proprietary information and, hence, were exempt from disclosure. The OOR concluded that DOT met its burden with respect to these exemptions based upon the affidavits of Bernetski and Coleman and the exemption log submitted by DOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The OOR noted that the 10 certificates of compliance showed the daily results of the asphalt plant, including its job mix formula, material class, and asphalt mix type. The OOR also noted that the exemption log revealed that the documents responsive to Requester's request included material quantities and mathematical equations relative to the computation of materials. The OOR concluded that such information was confidential and constituted trade secrets of Midland. Requester thereafter filed a petition for review with this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requester argues that DOT did not meet its burden of establishing that the withheld responsive records constitute or reveal trade secrets or confidential proprietary information. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the RTKL, information is only subject to disclosure if it is a \"public record.\" Section 301(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.301(a). Pursuant to section 305 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.305, a record in the possession of a Commonwealth agency shall be presumed to be a public record unless (1) it is exempt under Section 708 of the RTKL; (2) the record is protected by a privilege; or (3) the record is exempt from disclosure under any other federal or state law or regulation or judicial order.\n   <em>\n    McGowan v.

Cmwlth. 2014). The agency receiving a RTKL request bears the burden of proving that the record is exempt by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 708(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(a). The preponderance of the evidence standard, which is \"the lowest evidentiary standard, is tantamount to a more likely than not inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Delaware County v. Schaefer ex rel.

Cmwlth. 2012). Section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL specifically provides an exemption for \"[a] record that constitutes or reveals a trade secret or confidential proprietary information.\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Trade Secret\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 102 of the RTKL defines a \"trade secret\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Information, including a formula, drawing, pattern, compilation, including a customer list, program, device, method, technique or process that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The term includes data processing software obtained by an agency under a licensing agreement prohibiting disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102.

In order to meet its burden in the present case, DOT submitted the affidavit of Bernetski, Civil Engineer Supervisor for DOT's Engineering District Office 4. Additionally, Midland submitted an affidavit from Coleman, a Senior Executive for the company. In his affidavit, Bernetski explained that Midland's personnel understand that certain information \"should not\n   be subject to public access, including the proprietary mix formula for asphalt from which production quantities can be extracted and pricing information can be reverse engineered.\" (R.R. at 40a.) He also noted that the requested records \"contain[ed] information, that derive[d] independent economic value, which [was] not generally known or readily ascertainable,\" the disclosure of which would be of economic value to a competitor. (R.R. at 41a.) Further, while Requester contends that he is not seeking any information regarding Midland's methods and operations to provide ultra-thin layering, but only asks for certifications that Midland used materials that meet the Project specifications set by DOT, Bernetski noted that \"[t]he production quantities utilized in a competitive construction market is proprietary by its very nature\" and that, \"[i]n the hands of a competitor, the details submitted by [Midland] could be used to reverse engineer bid information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505909\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/819/417/#p430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hence, he described this production information as having \"independent economic value\" itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505909\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/819/417/#p430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Likewise, in his affidavit, Coleman stressed that Midland utilized a \"proprietary formula of mix and polymer coating\" for its ultra-thin asphalt as well as a \"specialized paver\" to apply the same.

He described bids submitted in response to a highway procurement as, \"by their nature, extremely competitive\" and something that must be protected from use against the bidder \"in future procurements.\" (R.R. at 52a.) Coleman also noted that DOT routinely maintains bids as confidential so as not to impair a contractor's competitive advantage or cause irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505909\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/819/417/#p430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He indicated that Midland takes steps to protect the information contained in its bids, including restricting \"access to the documents submitted to Hawbaker to only those employees essential to preparation of [its] quote\"; providing \"confidentiality training to its employees\"; only disclosing the documents to Hawbaker; and destroying \"all non-essential copies of the documents submitted to Hawbaker and [DOT].\" (R.R. at 52a-53a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   If a competitor was able to obtain the information requested by Requester herein, Coleman stated that a competitor would be able to \"reverse engineer Midland's quote, and then use that information to undercut Midland's ability to contract in the future.\" (R.R. at 53a.)

Suffice it to say, the efforts undertaken by Midland established that such information is confidential. As to the potential for disclosure of such information to cause substantial harm to Midland's competitive position, both Bernetski and Coleman described the highway construction market as highly competitive and detailed the likelihood of substantial injury to Midland should this information be released, thereby satisfying the necessary prongs of the competitive position analysis. More specifically, Bernetski described the construction market as \"competitive\" and noted that the \"production quantities utilized in [such a market] is proprietary by its very nature.\" (R.R. at 41a.) Additionally, he stated that \"[i]n the hands of a competitor, the details submitted by the contractor could be used to reverse engineer bid information,\" which would effectively harm that contractor's competitive position on future contract bidding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325993\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1049/#p1064\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Likewise, Coleman noted that Midland routinely submits quotes to heavy and highway contractors in competitive bidding processes throughout the United States and described such processes as \"extremely competitive.\" (R.R. at 52a.) He also described the highway construction market, and in particular the application of an ultra-thin layering of asphalt, as a \"highly-competitive market.\" (R.R. at 53a.) He also explained how the release of the requested information would damage Midland's competitive position, noting that the release of the same would allow a competitor to be able to \"review how Midland structured its quote to Hawbaker and [DOT], including the financial terms, the expertise of its employees, and the materials, equipment and technical processes\" used for the Project at issue, which could be used to undercut Midland's ability to contract in the future.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325993\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1049/#p1064\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also stated that a competitor could use this information \"to tailor and to structure [its] layering processes as well as the materials and equipment used to the competitive disadvantage of Midland.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325993\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1049/#p1064\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Through the affidavits of Bernetski and Coleman, DOT and Midland have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the information requested by Requester constitutes \"confidential proprietary information\" and, hence, this information is exempt from disclosure under section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, the OOR's Final Determination is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Judge Cohn Jubelirer did not participate in this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      ORDER\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   AND NOW, this 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of April, 2019, the Final Determination of the Office of Open Records, dated February 21, 2018, is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101 -67.3104.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    UTBWC appears to reference \"Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing Course,\" a specific type of asphalt application requested by DOT for this particular Project.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 77a.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Section 708(b)(6)(i)(A) provides that certain personal identification information is exempt from access under the RTKL, including \"a person's Social Security number, driver's license number, personal financial information, home, cellular or personal telephone numbers, personal e-mail addresses, employee number or other confidential personal identification number.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Requester did not raise any issue in his petition for review with respect to Item 4 and the redaction by DOT of the personal identification information from the certified payroll records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As to factual disputes, this Court may exercise functions of a fact-finder, and has the discretion to rely upon the record created below or to create its own.\n    <em>\n     Department of Labor and Industry v.

As to a question of law under the RTKL, our scope of review is plenary.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958795\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/90/823/#p828\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Eiseman\n    </em>\n    involved an RTKL request for any and all documents that set forth the rate of payment, including but not limited to capitation rates, that the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) paid to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide coverage to recipients in southeastern Pennsylvania. This request included the rates paid for dental services pursuant to established dental procedure codes and any payments made by an MCO for such services. DPW refused to provide the requested information on the basis that the rates constituted trade secrets and/or confidential proprietary information that was protected from disclosure by,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , the Trade Secrets Act and section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL. The OOR, however, granted an appeal by the Requesters and directed DPW to disclose the records, concluding that the records constituted financial records to which the exception in section 708(b)(11) did not apply (section 708(c) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(c), provides that \"[t]he exceptions set forth in subsection (b) shall not apply to financial records.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    On appeal, this Court affirmed the final determination of the OOR relating to disclosure of capitation rates but reversed the final determination relating to disclosure of the rates paid by MCOs. Regarding the former, we agreed with the OOR that the capitation rates constituted financial records to which the exception for trade secrets/confidential proprietary information set forth in section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL did not apply. However, we held that the Trade Secrets Act could act as \"stand-alone statutory basis for protection,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , a \"state law that takes precedence over other provisions in the RTKL,\" including section 708(c).\n    <em>\n     Eiseman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271141\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/1117/#p1126\">\n     85 A.3d at 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, we ultimately concluded that the MCOs failed to establish that such rates constituted trade secrets under the Trade Secrets Act. Subsequent to our decision, DPW disclosed the capitation rates to Requesters. Regarding the latter, we concluded that the MCO rates were not financial records because these rates were not disbursed by an agency, namely DPW, but instead were paid by the MCOs to providers. Additionally, we held that such rates constituted confidential proprietary information that was protected from disclosure by section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The dissenting opinion disagreed with the Majority's conclusion that the MCO rates were not financial records simply because they were disbursed by the MCOs rather than DPW and, consequently, that the trade secrets/confidential proprietary information exception could apply to the same. Further, the dissent disagreed with the Majority to the extent that it concluded that the Trade Secrets Act constituted an independent, \"stand-alone statutory basis for protection\" from disclosure.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271141\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/1117/#p1126\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271141\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/1117/#p1126\">\n     at 1138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
