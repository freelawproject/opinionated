CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] On October 27, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4052 (2018). The court held a three-day hearing on the petition in July and August 2018. On September 17, 2018, the court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mother is unable to protect the child from jeopardy or take responsibility for the child within a time which is reasonably calculated to meet the child's needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(b)(i)-(ii). The court further found that termination of the mother's parental rights is in best interest of the child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] The court based its decision on the following factual findings, which are supported by competent evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Child of Jonathan D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20ME%2014\">\n    2019 ME 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505721\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/200/799/\">\n    200 A.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] The mother has a substantial history with the Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The child who is the focus of this appeal was six years old at the time of the hearing. During his life, he has been involved in child protective proceedings on three separate occasions, and has been in the Department's custody most of his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] The mother has lived a \"difficult and traumatic life,\" with a significant history of substance abuse and mental health issues. Although she has been able to maintain her sobriety for an \"extended period of time,\" the mother failed to engage meaningfully in mental health counseling until after the court terminated her parental rights to another child in October 2017, and as a result has considerable past trauma that remains unaddressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found the mother's recent improvements to be \"encouraging, but ... not timely\" and noted that the mother's \"track record is not simply the last several\n   months, but must include a longer period of her history.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] With regard to the mother's ability to safely parent the child, the court recognized that she has become more amenable to suggestions related to her parenting deficits, but she is highly unlikely to be able to keep the child safe on a daily basis. The court's concerns were heightened by the mother's continued association with unsafe people, particularly her ex-boyfriend with whom she lived for a period of time despite her claims that he had been violent toward her on several occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] The court found that the child \"had been in several placements before being placed with the current foster parents,\" and that he \"needs consistency, dependability, and predictability from a parent.\" The court also heard testimony from the child's foster parents; he has been in their care since the fall of 2016, marking \"one of the longest periods of stability\" in his life. The foster parents each testified about their recent decision to separate from one another, while also highlighting their dedication to meeting the child's needs and making sure that his life is not disrupted by their separation. The court ultimately determined that the child's best interest will be \"served by freeing him up for adoption into a stable, loving, and consistent home,\" due to his need for permanency, and because the \"uncertain nature of the time necessary for [the mother to make sufficient progress] is too substantial a problem for him to have to wait.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] On September 28, 2018, the mother filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 59(e), and for additional findings of fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 52(b), along with a motion for a new trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 59(a), or to reopen the evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 43(j). The Department filed a response to the mother's post-judgment motions on October 18, 2018. The court denied in part and granted in part the mother's motion for additional findings, though it did not alter its decision to terminate the mother's parental rights, and it denied the mother's motion for a new trial or to reopen the evidence. The mother timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4006 (2018) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(2)(B)-(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Parental Unfitness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69] The mother first argues that there is insufficient evidence of parental unfitness. We review the trial court's factual findings that a parent is unfit for clear error.\n   <em>\n    In re Child of Tanya C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%20153\">\n    2018 ME 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12504564\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/198/777/\">\n    198 A.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to the mother's contentions, there is competent evidence in the record that supports the court's findings of parental unfitness. The court supportably found that-despite the mother's recent improvements-she had failed to participate in mental health services during a significant portion of the proceedings; she had failed to set safe boundaries for the child at supervised visits; she had a lengthy history with the Department; and she continued to associate with unsafe people. Accordingly, the court did not err in its determination that the mother is unable to protect the child from jeopardy or take responsibility for the child within a time reasonably calculated to meet his needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(b)(i)-(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Child of Eric K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2032\">\n    2018 ME 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493445\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/666/\">\n    180 A.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213901\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/854/195/\">\n    2004 ME 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213901\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/854/195/\">\n    854 A.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Child's Best Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] The mother's primary challenge on appeal appears to be based on the foster parents' separation and its effect on the best interest of the child. \"We review\n   the trial court's factual findings ... that termination of parental rights is in the child's best interest for clear error and the ultimate decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Children of Anthony M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%20146\">\n    2018 ME 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502493\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/1229/\">\n    195 A.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b611] The mother argues that the foster parents' recent separation presents concerns about their ability to provide the child with stability and consistency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, we have held that the question of\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   will adopt a child after parental rights have been terminated is not an issue that is determined in a termination proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Children of Nicole M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2075\">\n    2018 ME 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497497\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/187/1/\">\n    187 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Isabelle T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422499\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/639/\">\n    2017 ME 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422499\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/639/\">\n    175 A.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Kenneth S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316594\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/244/\">\n    2017 ME 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316594\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/244/\">\n    157 A.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the best interest determination to be made in a termination proceeding [is] distinct from the question of\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   should adopt the child, which is addressed in an adoption proceeding\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b612] The court based its best interest findings on the child's need for permanency and the length of time the child has already spent in the Department's custody. In reaching its determination, the court explicitly found that the best interest of the child \"will be served by freeing him up for adoption into a stable, loving, and consistent home.\" This finding is supported by evidence in the record. Accordingly, the court did not commit clear error or abuse its discretion in determining that termination was in the child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Child of Troy C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%20150\">\n    2018 ME 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503322\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/452/\">\n    196 A.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Children of Anthony M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%20146\">\n    2018 ME 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502493\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/1229/\">\n    195 A.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    2005 ME 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    889 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.

Therefore, the court knew that the Department had not changed its permanency plan or placement, and, accordingly, did not abuse its discretion in denying the mother's motion for a new trial based on her erroneous assertions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The court also knew that the Department had not changed its permanency plan or the child's placement when it made its decision to deny the motion.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    n.6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
