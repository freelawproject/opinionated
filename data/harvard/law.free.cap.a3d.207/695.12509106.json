In full recognition of existing local pesticide ordinances, the members of the House of Delegates by floor vote rejected each of the bills that sought to preempt more stringent local regulation. This \"strongly suggests\" under the Amendment Rejection Theory that there was no legislative intent to authorize or recognize preemption.\n   <em>\n    Allied Vending, Inc. v.

Among its other provisions, the bill amended the Montgomery County Code to restrict certain pesticide use on private and County-owned property. Appellees\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenged the ordinance in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking a declaratory judgment that the bill was preempted by State law and a permanent injunction before the County ordinance was scheduled to take effect in January 2018. The County and Appellees waived discovery, stipulated as to the facts, and filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In an August 2017 written opinion, the circuit court concluded that the County ordinance was preempted by State law, both by implication and by conflict: \"[t]he County's Ordinance flouts decades of State primacy in ensuring safe and proper pesticide use, undermines the State's system of comprehensive and uniform product approval and regulation, and prohibits\n   products and conduct that have been affirmatively approved and licensed by the State.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the circuit court granted Appellees' motion for summary judgment, issued a declaratory judgment that Bill No. 52-14 was unlawful and preempted by Maryland law, and ordered that the bill \"as it regards the use of pesticides on private property, shall not\n   take effect, and [Appellees] are entitled to permanent injunctive relief from the enforcement of these sections.\" The County's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To properly evaluate whether the General Assembly has intended to preempt local pesticide regulation, we must first consider how the County ordinance fits within the interweaving structures of federal and State law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Montgomery County's Pesticide Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The County ordinance amended existing language in the Montgomery County Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to require that retailers, among other requirements, make available to pesticide purchasers (1) notice signs, (2) federally-approved product labels, and (3) County-approved materials that explain both the potential dangers of pesticide use and the availability of alternative products. Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33B-3(a). The ordinance further amended existing language in the County Code to require that commercial pesticide applicators provide new\n   customers with certain notice before and after pesticide application. Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33B-7(b). Additionally, the ordinance specified that applicators must place certain notice markers in areas near the site of application. Montgomery County Code \u00a7\u00a7 33B-8-33B-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Most pertinent to Appellees' challenge here, the ordinance specifies that only \"listed pesticide[s]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   may be applied to (1) lawns, (2) playgrounds, (3) mulched recreation areas, (4) children's facilities, or (5) the grounds of a children's facility when those areas are located on \"County-owned property and private property\"-which by definition would exclude public schools. Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33B-10(a). However, the law then specifies numerous exceptions to those use restrictions: a person may apply any pesticide that is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to those same surfaces if applied to (1) control weeds, (2) control invasive species, (3) control disease vectors, (4) control biting or stinging insects or stinging plants, (5) control organisms that threaten the health of trees or shrubs, (6) maintain property as part of a public utility's efforts to comply with regulations, (7) control indoor pests, (8) control pests while engaged in agriculture, or (9) control a pest outbreak that poses an imminent threat to human health or prevent significant economic damage. Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33B-10(b). The law then stipulates that if a pesticide is applied pursuant to the exception concerning imminent threats to human health or preventing significant economic damage, the person applying the pesticide must inform the County of the application.

Even though 1947's FIFRA characterized pesticides as \"economic poisons,\" it was not until 1964-after\n   <em>\n    Silent Spring\n   </em>\n   heightened the public's awareness that pesticides could, for instance, accumulate in human body tissues and breast milk-that Congress authorized USDA to take\n   pesticides off the market by canceling their registrations.

The 1969 law originated as proposed legislation from a Governor's Commission on Pesticides; the Commission itself had been created by a joint resolution of the General Assembly in 1967.\n   <em>\n    Report to the Governor of Maryland and Maryland General Assembly from the Commission on Pesticides\n   </em>\n   , September 1, 1968 (\"Commission Report\").

The bulk of the opinion's analysis focused on why federal law would preempt such an ordinance (an analysis later superseded by\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   ), but on the State law issue, the\n   opinion said: \"existing State law [ ] does not preempt the County's authority to regulate pesticides[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107682\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/597/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 164 n. 5.

The Legislature also conferred upon the Department the authority to impose civil penalties and seek injunctive relief for those violating the notice and posting requirements.

Specifically, HB 762 was amended in committee to provide that \"Any ordinance or regulation adopted by a local jurisdiction regulating pesticides in effect on October 1, 1992 may remain in effect as written.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As amended, the bill cleared committee and went to the floor, where it was voted down 72-52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opposition to the bill came from Delegates from charter home rule subdivisions (Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George's counties, and Baltimore City).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1993 brought round two, where the push began on the Senate side. SB 429 would have vested the Secretary of Agriculture with \"general authority over the regulation of pesticides.\" A local jurisdiction could enact a tougher regulation if it ran the proposal through a three-member review board, consisting of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources. As introduced, the bill grandfathered existing local ordinances, but not subsequent amendments. In committee, the grandfather clause was amended to provide that \"[T]his Act does not affect the authority of a local\n   jurisdiction that has a local ordinance regulating pesticides as well as public notification regarding the use of pesticides in effect as of October 1, 1993 to adopt and implement an ordinance that is more stringent than State regulation.\" As amended, the bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming majority (42-5) and was sent to the House.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once again, the bill was approved by the House Environmental Matters Committee, but was then defeated on the House floor by a 70-65 vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once again, the opposition to the bill came from Delegates from charter home rule jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The final knockdown occurred in 1994. HB 948, as introduced, contained some elements of previous bills, including the grandfather clause from the 1993 legislation. The review board was expanded to five Cabinet secretaries. Most significantly, the bill was amended to specifically exempt Montgomery County from the review process entirely. The bill was approved by the House Committee and again reached the floor. Although the vote was closer than in previous years, the bill failed to win the necessary constitutional majority of 71 by three votes. A motion for reconsideration failed by a single vote. The same coalition of charter subdivision legislators was responsible for the defeat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Current Code: The Maryland Pesticide Registration and Labeling Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Maryland Pesticide Registration and Labeling Law is currently codified as\n   Subtitle 1 of Title 5 of the Agriculture Article; its essential provisions remain consistent from when it was first enacted in 1957. The law requires distributors to\n   register pesticides with the Agriculture Secretary before distributing them in the State. \u00a7 5-105(a). Before a pesticide may be registered, the pesticide must comply with federal pesticide laws and regulations. \u00a7 5-105(h). Subject to certain exceptions, any pesticide that is distributed, sold, offered for sale, delivered for transportation, or transported in the State must be properly packaged and labeled, \u00a7 5-106, and a person may not distribute, sell, or transport any unregistered or misbranded pesticide. \u00a7 5-109. The Agriculture Secretary may suspend or cancel the registration of any pesticide that is improperly labeled or otherwise does not comply with the law. \u00a7 5-107.

Additionally, because \"[u]niform pesticide requirements between the several states and the federal government are desirable to avoid confusion that endangers the public health and that results from diverse requirements,\" the Secretary may adopt EPA's rules and regulations if they \"are applicable to and conform with the primary standards established by this subtitle.\" \u00a7 5-104(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Current Code: The Pesticide Applicator's Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Pesticide Applicator's Law is currently codified as Subtitle 2 of Title 5 of the Agriculture Article. The law states that, among other duties, the Agriculture Secretary shall: \"[a]dopt rules and regulations governing the storage, sale, distribution, exchange, use, and disposal of any pesticide and its container;\" \u00a7 5-204(1); \"[p]rescribe, when necessary, the time and conditions under which a pesticide may be sold, distributed, exchanged, or used in different areas of the State;\" \u00a7 5-204(2); \"[p]rovide, if necessary, that extremely hazardous pesticides may be sold, distributed, exchanged, or applied only when special permission first is obtained from the Secretary;\" \u00a7 5-204(3); and \"[d]efine the formulations and establish the conditions and appropriate areas for application of any pesticide;\" \u00a7 5-204(4). The law sets forth that \"[a]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   person may not use, apply, or recommend use of a pesticide other than as specified by the label[,]\" and \"[a] person may not use, apply, or recommend use of a pesticide in a manner other than as specified by [the law] or rules and regulations adopted under it.\" \u00a7 5-210. The Agriculture Secretary must set certification requirements for applicators, \u00a7 5-206(a), and may only issue licenses to applicants who meet those requirements. \u00a7 5-206(b). At various times, licensees must provide a customer with \"[p]ertinent safety information, as determined by the Department,\" \u00a7 5-208(a)(5), and the statute requires notice posting when pesticides are commercially applied to a lawn. \u00a7 5-208(c). Additionally, the statute states that, \"[f]or purposes of uniformity and in order to enter into cooperative agreements, [the Secretary shall] adopt use classifications and other pertinent pesticide regulation provisions that are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency[.]\" \u00a7 5-204(13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There are three ways in which State law may preempt local law: (1) expressly, (2) by conflict, or (3) by implication.\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490265,12314693\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/514/\">\n    454 Md. at 540-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490265,12314693\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/514/\">\n    165 A.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Md.

As described above, the Maryland Pesticide Registration and Labeling Law, currently codified as Subtitle 1 of Title 5 of the Agriculture Article, originated as the Maryland Pesticide Law of 1958. Laws of 1957, Chapter 536. And as mentioned, an amendment to the Maryland Pesticide Law of 1958 added an uncodified provision to the law that provided that jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to the distribution, sale, and transportation of pesticides would be vested exclusively in the State Chemist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   And be it further enacted, that jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to the distribution, sale and transportation of pesticides is by this act vested exclusively in the State Chemist and all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby expressly repealed. Laws of 1957, Chapter 536, Sec. 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The County's brief acknowledges this uncodified provision, and even goes so far as to call it a \"preemption clause,\" but then claims that the clause was eliminated by the 1973 Code revision that created the new Agriculture Article. We disagree with the County on both counts: the provision does not, in fact, appear to have ever been expressly repealed; nevertheless, it is not preemptive of the County's authority to impose local pesticide requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The County cites a Revisor's Note to the 1973 Session Law that created the Agriculture Article for the proposition that the 1973 Code revision repealed the uncodified provision. The Revisor's Note in question stated: \"All other present references to the State Chemist\n   <em>\n    in this subtitle\n   </em>\n   are proposed for deletion ....\" Laws of 1973, Chapter 6, at 1571 (Emphasis added). However, the phrase \"in this subtitle\" would only refer to\n   <em>\n    codified\n   </em>\n   provisions of the Code; by their very nature, uncodified provisions would not be a part of the codified \"subtitle.\" Thus, the uncodified provision would not have been deleted by this language and, technically, remains law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nevertheless, we do not read the uncodified provision as a true preemptive clause that was meant to confine local regulation in the face of State authority. Rather, in context, the uncodified provision appears more likely to have been intended as a realignment of duties\n   <em>\n    among\n   </em>\n   State officials. The Maryland Pesticide Law of 1958 repealed and amended an earlier law from 1939 that had regulated the registration, sale, and handling of insecticides and fungicides. The 1939 law had placed enforcement and administrative authority over\n   pesticide registrations in the State Board of Agriculture, and authorized the State Board of Agriculture to promulgate such rules and regulations as may have been necessary for the law's administration. Laws of 1939, Chapter 141, \u00a7 105D. The Maryland Pesticide Law of 1958, however, specified that those responsibilities would now be vested in the State Chemist, an officer appointed by the University of Maryland's Board of Regents acting\n   <em>\n    ex officio\n   </em>\n   as the State Board of Agriculture. Laws of 1957, Chapter 536, \u00a7 134. Elsewhere, the 1957 law stated that \"[a]ll authority vested in the State Chemist ... may with like force and effect be executed by such employees of the Board of Agriculture as the State Chemist may from time to time designate for said purpose.\" Laws of 1957, Chapter 536, \u00a7 140C. Given these somewhat overlapping duties between the State Board of Agriculture and the State Chemist it appointed, the uncodified provision was likely intended to clarify the apportionment of duties between the State units. And as such, when the Code was revised in 1973, and the position of State Chemist was transferred to a subordinate position within the new Department of Agriculture, it would at that time have become clear that the express duties of the State Chemist were now duties within the Department's hierarchy of duties. Indeed, were the uncodified provision intended to be a true preemption clause with respect to the authority of local governments-and never repealed-it would make no sense to vest exclusive State jurisdiction in a subordinate office within the Agriculture Department.\n   <strong>\n    II.

Appellees point to the Pesticide Applicator's Law, codified as Subtitle 2 of Title 5 of the Agriculture Article, which states that, among other duties, the (now) Agriculture Secretary shall: \"[a]dopt rules and regulations governing the storage, sale, distribution, exchange, use, and disposal of any pesticide and its container;\" \u00a7 5-204(1); \"[p]rescribe, when necessary, the time and conditions under which a pesticide may be sold, distributed, exchanged, or used in different areas of the State;\" \u00a7 5-204(2); \"[p]rovide, if necessary, that extremely hazardous pesticides may be sold, distributed, exchanged, or applied only when special permission first is obtained from the Secretary;\" \u00a7 5-204(3); and \"[d]efine the formulations and establish the conditions and appropriate areas for application of any pesticide;\" \u00a7 5-204(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On their face, these provisions are less comprehensive than the non-preemptive features of FIFRA. Furthermore, we note\n   that at the time these provisions were enacted, in 1969, the Maryland Department of Agriculture did not yet exist. Instead, the regulatory authority conveyed by the language just described was given to the State Board of Agriculture-a body that since 1908 had officially consisted of the University of Maryland's Board of Regents acting in an additional capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not believe that the General Assembly of 1969 intended the University's Board of Regents to have such expertise in the field of pesticide regulation as to preclude any regulation by local governments. For perspective, in 1966 the USDA employed\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   toxicologist, despite being the federal agency in charge of administering FIFRA at that time. John Wargo,\n   <em>\n    Our Children's Toxic Legacy\n   </em>\n   76 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We are also especially mindful that the Department of Agriculture's regulatory authority was already present within the Pesticide Applicator's Law when the Attorney General's office concluded, closer to the time of enactment, in 1985, that \"State law ... [does not] so comprehensively regulate[ ] in this area that a court would be compelled to find preemption by implication.\" 70 Md. Att'y Gen. Op. 161, 164 n. 5 (1985). Such an understanding that\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   law did not preempt local regulations is gleaned from the General Assembly's consideration of pesticide legislation in 1987. That year, the General Assembly revised the Pesticide Applicator's Law to require commercial applicators to post notice signs on lawns for 48 hours following the application of pesticides. Laws of 1987, Chapters 301 and 302. The State legislation arose after\n   Montgomery County and Prince George's County each passed legislation requiring notice in connection with pesticide application. In a consolidated lawsuit, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland held in 1986 that\n   <em>\n    FIFRA\n   </em>\n   preempted both counties' laws.\n   <em>\n    Md.

The counties' legislation, along with pressure from environmental activists, spurred the General Assembly to pass the statewide notice requirements via an Agriculture Department Bill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   A review of this legislation's bill file conveys that, in the period in 1987 in which the legislation was considered-that is to say, after the District Court decision, but before the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   the general understanding was that\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   law preempted County regulation. Given this understanding pre-\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   that federal law already preempted local regulation, the General Assembly may very well have not concerned itself with the question of whether State law also preempted local regulation. 70% of the Delegates who were in the House in 1987 were still in the House in 1992 when, after\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   , the bill specifically designed to preempt local regulation was voted down on the House floor.\n   <em>\n    Compare Maryland Manual\n   </em>\n   (1987-1988)\n   <em>\n    with Maryland Manual\n   </em>\n   (1991-1992). It would be curious for these same Delegates to expressly reject preemption in 1992 (and again in 1993 and 1994) if they had earlier thought they were already comprehensively regulating the field. Indeed, any consideration of whether State law preempted local regulation (such as that passed by Montgomery County and Prince George's County) is largely absent from the materials contained within the\n   1987 legislation's bill file.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even Montgomery County supported the 1987 legislation, on the grounds that (1) it resembled the County's bill, and (2) as the County understood it at that point (post-District Court, but pre-\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   ), \"FIFRA does not preempt States from requiring pesticide application signage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A very recent example of the General Assembly acquiescing to the views of local pesticide regulators occurred in 2016, when Montgomery County opposed amended language in legislation, HB211/SB198, that became the Pollinator Protection Act. Laws of 2016, Chapters 661 and 662. At one point, the Senate amended the bill to require the Agriculture Department to make recommendations (following an EPA risk assessment) for any changes to the State pesticide laws that would be \"necessary to ensure State laws and regulations\n   <em>\n    are consistent with\n   </em>\n   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommendations.\" (Emphasis added). The amendment's \"consistency\" language raised the concern of Montgomery County\n   in connection with the County ordinance. The Pollinator Protection Act's bill file contains a letter to Montgomery County Delegates from (then) Councilman Marc Elrich stating that the Senate amendment \"could create problems for our (and other) counties to enact legislation that we think is in the best interest of our residents.\" Additionally, an email to Montgomery County Delegates and Senators from the office of Councilman George Leventhal noted that the Montgomery County Council voted unanimously to oppose the Senate amendment's language. Notably, the legislation that was ultimately enacted by both chambers was consistent with the preferences of the Montgomery County delegation. The General Assembly stripped the \"consistent with [EPA recommendations]\" language, and amended the legislation to instead read: \"the Department shall review the State's pesticide laws and regulations and make recommendations for any changes necessary to ensure State laws and regulations are protective of pollinators,\n   <em>\n    taking into account\n   </em>\n   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommendations.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Application of the Amendment Rejection Theory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The County has argued that the Amendment Rejection Theory supports the conclusion that the ordinance is not impliedly preempted. The Appellees disagree. The circuit court did not address the issue. In our opinion, the circuit court erred in not giving strong weight to the almost-unheard-of rejection by the House of Delegates in three successive sessions of legislation seeking to preempt stricter local regulation of pesticides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Amendment Rejection Theory is generally a type of post-enactment legislative history, where the Legislature's inaction on a bill impacts the interpretation of existing law.

Equally important, we think, is the entity doing the rejecting. A failure in a single committee of the\n   General Assembly is not as significant as a failure by floor vote in one chamber of the Legislature. Here, we have a failure on the floor of the House in three successive sessions. Such an event is almost as rare as this year's super blood wolf moon eclipse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Appellees discount the invocation of the Amendment Rejection Theory here, arguing that the legislative history for 1992-94 reflects a \"legislative stalemate\" where the General Assembly rejected express preemption as well as amendments that would\n   have specifically authorized more stringent local regulation by some subdivisions. In our view, this is not an accurate reflection of the legislative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Important here is the \"contemporary legal context,\"\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v.

Following hard on the heels of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mortier\n   </em>\n   , and in light of a published opinion of the Attorney General that State law did not impliedly preempt more stringent local regulation of pesticides, an industry-friendly bill sought to completely and expressly preempt local pesticide regulation. To gain support for what had become a controversial measure, proponents over a three-year period were forced to sacrifice uniformity with increasingly broader grandfather clauses and exemptions for local regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   These were not new authorizations,\n   as Appellees claim, but more akin to provisos or savings clauses protecting authority that already existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Nor is Appellees' argument against amendment rejection advanced by their assertion that all that was being rejected was express and not implied preemption. Once again, opponents of the three bills were striving to protect local authority over pesticide regulation in the face of any type of preemption. Legislators voting against the bill-many of whom voted in favor of the 1987 pesticide legislation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   p. 33-would have been shocked to discover that their votes were wasted and doomed from the start by implied preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   There was no ambiguity over what occurred in 1992, 1993, and 1994: the Legislature repeatedly rejected attempts to preempt local regulation of pesticides. This is a most compelling case of amendment rejection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Uniformity of Regulations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Another secondary factor in determining whether state law preempts a field by implication is whether a \"multi-tiered regulatory process ... would invite chaos and confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Altadis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718034\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/307/#p311\">\n    431 Md. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718034\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/307/#p311\">\n    65 A.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Allied Vending\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021769,2021762\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/279/\">\n    332 Md. at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021769,2021762\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/279/\">\n    631 A.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). To that end, Appellees stress that the General Assembly has intended to elevate the principle of uniformity as a\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of pesticide regulation in\n   Maryland. The County contends that it would be odd for the General Assembly's animating purpose to be \"uniformity\" for its own sake, rather than a substantive policy aim such as promoting agricultural yield or protecting the public health and environment. We agree with\n   the County that the text of the Agriculture Article, its interaction with the broader statutory structure, and the General Assembly's legislative course indicate that \"uniformity for uniformity's sake\" was not the General Assembly's paramount interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To be sure, \u00a7 5-104(c) of the Maryland Pesticide Registration and Labeling Law states in aspirational, preamble-like fashion that uniform requirements between the states and the federal government are \"desirable,\" albeit not mandatory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Uniform pesticide requirements between the several states and the federal government are desirable to avoid confusion that endangers the public health and that results from diverse requirements, particularly relating to the labeling and coloring of pesticides, and to avoid increased costs to the people of the State due to the necessity of complying with diverse requirements for manufacturing and selling pesticides. Consequently, the Secretary, after public hearing, may adopt the rules and regulations of the appropriate agency of the United States government relating to pesticides, if the rules and regulations are applicable to and conform with the primary standards established by this subtitle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   However, we do not read this language to be so emphatic as to preclude any room for local regulations. First, uniformity is described as \"desirable,\" not mandatory. Second, the focus of the statutory language is national and horizontal uniformity-at the federal and State level,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not vertical uniformity-from one state to its subdivisions. Next, the qualifier that uniformity is desirable \"particularly relating to the labeling\n   and coloring of pesticides\" is peculiar, given that, under FIFRA, states are generally prohibited from imposing any labeling requirements that are different from EPA's: by the terms of the federal statute, subject to certain exceptions, labeling\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be uniform. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b). Finally, the section concludes by stating that the Agriculture Secretary may ultimately choose to adopt federal regulations \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the rules and regulations are applicable to and conform with the primary standards established by this subtitle.\" (Emphasis added). By acknowledging that federal regulations may not necessarily \"conform\" to the State's own sense of appropriate standards, this provision contemplates potential variations between State and federal regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Nor is the \"uniformity\" language contained within the Pesticide Applicator's Law more availing to Appellees' argument. Section 5-204(13) of the Pesticide Applicator's Law states that \"[f]or purposes of uniformity and in order to enter into cooperative agreements,\" the Agriculture Secretary shall \"adopt use classifications and other pertinent pesticide regulation provisions that are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency[.]\" The qualifier \"pertinent\" indicates that the General Assembly does not envision blanket uniformity. And if the General Assembly desired nothing beyond simple uniformity with EPA, that would deprive the Agriculture Department of any ability to act according to its own volition. If that\n   were the case, that would render as surplusage the other language from the same section of the Pesticide Applicator's Law that authorizes the Secretary to \"[p]rescribe, when necessary, the time and conditions under which a pesticide may be sold, distributed, exchanged, or used in different areas of the State;\" \u00a7 5-204(2), and \"[d]efine the formulations and establish the conditions and appropriate areas for application of any pesticide;\" \u00a7 5-204(4).\n   More importantly, the General Assembly's course of legislative action illustrates that it does not intend to simply tether the State to federal requirements. The enactment of 2016's Pollinator Protection Act illustrates this dynamic. The Pollinator Protection Act added provisions to the Agriculture Article to restrict the use of neonicotinoids (a class of pesticides associated with colony collapse disorder in bees). Laws of 2016, Chapters 661 and 662. At the time of enactment in 2016, EPA had not undertaken similar restrictions regarding neonicotinoids. Indeed, Appellees note in their brief that Maryland was \"the first State to pass legislation restricting consumer use of pesticides containing neonicotinoids[.]\" As such, the very fact that Maryland was the first state to pass a law restricting neonicotinoid use demonstrates that the General Assembly is not inherently opposed to regulations that differ from, or go beyond, other state and federal regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We further observe that, practically speaking, the abstract talisman of \"uniformity\" is simply a chimera in light of the widespread variations that\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   exist across the country with regard to pesticide regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   To name just one example: whereas the EPA currently uses a cost-benefit analysis when deciding whether to register a pesticide under FIFRA, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation \"has rejected the consideration of benefits in its [own] registration process, except in extremely limited circumstances.\" Danica Li,\n   <em>\n    Toxic Spring: The Capriciousness of Cost-Benefit Analysis Under FIFRA's Pesticide Registration Process and Its Effect on Farmworkers\n   </em>\n   , 103 CAL. L. REV . 1405, 1439 (2015). As a result, California-the nation's largest agricultural producer-\"has often denied registration to pesticides that the EPA has approved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1442.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor are regulatory variations\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   states uncommon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Additionally, as mentioned earlier, in Maryland, compliance with the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program requires local jurisdictions to pursue best management practices with respect to pesticides and agriculture. COMAR 27.01.06.02(E) (When developing Critical Area programs, local jurisdictions shall \"[a]ssure that best management practices for the control of nutrients, animal wastes,\n   <em>\n    pesticides\n   </em>\n   , and sediment runoff be used to protect the productivity of the land base and enhance water quality. These practices shall minimize contamination of surface and ground water and, further, shall minimize adverse effects on plant, fish, and wildlife resources.\") (Emphasis added). It would be anomalous to conclude that the State values uniformity above any other consideration when the Critical Area Program actively tells counties to pursue their own pesticide control practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   And counties have, in fact, enacted pesticide regulations pursuant to the Critical Area Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 33-2-204(b)(7) (\"Within the boundary of a Chesapeake Bay Critical Area resources easement or reservation [that contains certain resources], a person may not ... [s]tore, use,\n   or apply pesticides, except for the spot spraying of noxious weeds consistent with the recommendations of the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service[.]\"); Dorchester County Code, \u00a7 68-22(B)(5) (incorporating COMAR 27.01.06.02(E) ); Harford County Code, \u00a7 267-63(F)(4)(a) (\"Each agricultural operation in the Critical Area shall have and be implementing a soil and water conservation plan, approved by the Harford Soil Conservation District Office ... [that] adequately address[es] the control of nutrients, animal wastes, pesticides and sediment runoff.\"); Prince George's County Code, \u00a7 5B-102(a)(5) (same language as COMAR 27.01.06.02(E) ); Wicomico County Code, \u00a7 125-11(B)(8) (for the purposes of implementing the Critical Area, defining \"buffer yard\" to mean an area at least 25 feet wide, and which \"shall be maintained primarily for the purposes of wildlife habitat and water quality and shall not be maintained in a manner that conflicts with these purposes such as by mowing or the application of herbicides.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, we note that by stressing that the State prioritizes uniformity, Appellees undercut their other main argument: that the Agriculture Department is so extensive and comprehensive a regulator as to preclude any room for local regulation. After all, if the General Assembly intended for pesticide regulations in Maryland to simply duplicate federal rules, without variation, that would leave little for the Agriculture Department to do beyond mimic EPA policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The notion that the Agriculture Department is so pervasive and comprehensive a regulator as to preclude any local regulation is further belied by certain public comments made by the Department itself. For instance, in 2016, MDA submitted a\n   written opposition to the legislation, HB211/SB198, that became the Pollinator Protection Act, Laws of 2016, Chapters 661 and 662.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its opposition was partly based on the fact that EPA \"has always taken the lead on pesticide registration and labeling issues[,]\" and that it is EPA that \"has the resources, expertise and reach to evaluate the vast volume of data and information available worldwide to assess pesticide risk.\" The comment further noted that MDA's Pesticide Regulation Section \"is entirely specially and federally funded\" (MDA receives federal funds to enforce FIFRA in the State) and that if the Pollinator Protection Act were enacted without additional funding, \"federal funding could be compromised.\" At present, MDA's Pesticide Regulation program has only 13 authorized positions (only four of which are inspectors); other positions within the State Chemist's office are responsible for pesticide registrations, and the Mosquito Control Program has additional responsibility for the application of mosquito-controlling insecticides. Md. Dep't of Budget &amp; Mgmt.,\n   <em>\n    Proposed FY 2020 Operating Budget, Vol. II\n   </em>\n   , at 42-43, 46, 58. It is also important to note that the Department supported the early 1990's bills that would have preempted county pesticide regulations. (The Department submitted legislative comments supporting the bills in 1993 and 1994, and sent a favorable memo about the 1992 bill to the Senate.) This position was emphatically rejected by the House of Delegates on three occasions. The pervasive administrative regulation preemption factor cuts in favor of the County ordinance.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

To that end, we have already mentioned the county regulations enacted pursuant to the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program's regulations. Additionally, we note that counties have enacted pesticide regulations with respect to stormwater management and other local concerns. In addition, as noted earlier, the 1992, 1993, and 1994 legislation expressly took note of those counties (and the Town of Manchester, in Carroll County) with pesticide regulations in a failed attempt to preempt local regulation. Therefore, it can hardly be said that the General Assembly was unaware of any concept of local authority to act in the field of pesticide regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490265,12314693\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/514/\">\n    454 Md. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490265,12314693\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/514/\">\n    165 A.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court of Appeals, in concluding that the Surface Mining Act did not preempt local zoning and planning authority, stated: \"it cannot be that the Council-and by extension, the citizens of Prince George's County-are powerless to restrict surface mining in those areas of the County where surface mining is no longer a safe and viable activity.\" (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We believe that a similar conclusion is appropriate here. Factors supporting our conclusion against preemption include: repeated failures to preempt, a lack of comprehensiveness along the lines of FIFRA, no pervasive scheme of administrative regulation, no conflict\n   through frustration of purpose, and General Assembly recognition of local regulation of pesticides. Together, these factors point in one direction: the State has not prohibited local governments from regulating pesticides in the manner addressed by the County.

For the reasons we describe in greater detail elsewhere in this opinion, we believe that an analysis of the Maryland statutes and caselaw dictates a different conclusion. As the April 2015 advice letter itself acknowledged: \"The [out-of-state] cases are not as helpful as they could be, [ ] because different states apply different tests as to preemption, and, of course, the types of regulation that have been attempted at the local level vary greatly.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    We also note that the Attorney General's office then wrote an advice letter in May 2015 to Delegate Kumar Barve about the County legislation. Though the April and May 2015 advice letters are largely the same, the May 2015 advice letter did not mention the 1987 statute. Instead, the May 2015 advice letter stated that the 1985 Attorney General's opinion no longer \"settle[s] the issue\" of preemption because \"[t]he [1985] Opinion did not [ ] address the ability of a County to ban or restrict the use of specific pesticides.\" Once again, the advice letter did not analyze the impact of repeated failed legislation that sought to negate the County's authority to enact an ordinance stricter than State law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    The circuit court decision did not mention the published 1985 Attorney General's opinion which concluded that there was no State preemption. Rather, it pointed to the unpublished 2015 advice letters for support. We note that unpublished advice letters do not ordinarily overrule published opinions of the Attorney General. These opinions \"are entitled to careful consideration\" by the courts,\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

The legislature over the past year, in considering other legislation dealing with state versus local control, has shown great deference to preserving the ability of local governments to meet local needs.
