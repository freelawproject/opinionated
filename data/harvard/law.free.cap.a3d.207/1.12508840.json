In particular, we are asked to consider whether\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519100\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/576/\">\n    208 Conn. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20A.2d%20243\">\n    546 A.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), and the legislative response to that decision, instead requires payment of such benefits to the claimant's dependents or nondependent children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Janet Brennan, executrix of the estate of Thomas Brennan (executrix), appeals from the decision of the Compensation Review Board concluding that the executrix improperly was substituted as party claimant because a claimant's estate cannot receive the claimant's vested but unpaid \u00a7 7-433c benefits. We hold that neither\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   nor any other legal authority barred the substitution to the extent that the executrix sought payment of matured benefits. We conclude, however, that, on the record before this court, we cannot determine that the permanent disability benefits matured prior to the death of Thomas Brennan (decedent). Accordingly, we reverse the board's decision only as to its determination that the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Fourth District (commissioner) to grant the motion to substitute the executrix as a party claimant was improper, but we affirm the decision in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In\n   1991, the decedent was employed by the defendant, the city of Waterbury (city), as its fire chief. During all relevant times, Janet Brennan\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was\n   married to the decedent. After the decedent suffered a heart attack during the course of his employment in July, 1993, he promptly filed a claim for \u00a7 7-433c benefits. The Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Fifth District thereafter accepted the parties' stipulation of facts, wherein they agreed that the decedent had been diagnosed with hypertension and heart disease after his heart attack and that no evidence of such disease had been present prior to the decedent's employment as fire chief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December, 1993, the fifth district commissioner issued a finding and award, which ordered the city to pay the decedent all of the benefits of \u00a7 7-433c to which he \"is or may become entitled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For several years after issuance of the 1993 finding and award, the decedent and the city attempted to reach an agreement on the payment of benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While negotiations were ongoing, the decedent elected to take disability retirement in December, 1995. In connection with the disability pension hearing and the pending \u00a7 7-433c claim, the city obtained opinions from three medical experts assessing the extent of the decedent's disability. Two of those experts rated the permanent impairment relating to his heart condition at 50 percent, and the other expert rated it at 75 percent. The decedent\n   obtained an opinion from his own physician, who assessed the permanent impairment at 80 percent. The city's retirement board authorized a disability pension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, the city also made certain payments to the decedent pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. In July, 1997, the city paid the decedent a lump sum, which the accompanying letter from the city's risk manager explained as \"representing 115.4 weeks [of permanent partial disability benefits] from the [maximum medical improvement] date of [October 13, 1993] to [the decedent's] retirement date of [December 21, 1995] at his maximum [permanent partial disability] rate .... We can use this amount as an advance if a final settlement can be reached. In the event that one is not obtainable at this time, the balance of [the\n   decedent's permanent partial disability] would be calculated pursuant to [the statutory cap under General Statutes \u00a7] 7-433b.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June, 1999, the city paid the decedent an additional lump sum, which represented a \"52 weeks advance [of permanent partial disability that was] calculated pursuant to [the statutory cap under \u00a7] 7-433b and utilized a counterpart's pay ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The city and the decedent, however, never entered into a full and final settlement of the heart and hypertension claim. The failure to do so may have been due to the city's ongoing financial difficulties, which, in 2001, resulted in the appointment of an oversight board to review and control the city's financial affairs. See Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2003, due to his deteriorating health, the decedent sought temporary total incapacity benefits. The city paid the decedent total incapacity benefits from February 19, 2003, until the decedent's death on April 20, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It was not until 2013 that the decedent's attorney sought to finalize the decedent's permanent partial disability claim under \u00a7 7-433c. In connection with those proceedings, the decedent's treating physician, who had assigned an 80 percent disability rating in 1995, issued a postmortem opinion that the decedent's permanent disability rating should be increased to 90 percent. Subsequently, the decedent's attorney moved to substitute Brennan in her capacity as executrix of the decedent's estate and Brennan in her individual capacity as party claimants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The city objected to the substitutions, advancing two independent grounds with respect to the estate. First, it contended that Brennan, the decedent's sole heir and the beneficiary of a spousal pension, was improperly seeking to circumvent the city charter's pension offset, which would negate any \u00a7 7-433c benefits otherwise due to her. Second, it contended that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519100\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/576/\">\n    208 Conn. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20A.2d%20243\">\n    546 A.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the estate was not a legally qualified recipient of funds paid under \u00a7 7-433c. In reply, the decedent's counsel contended that the substitution was proper because the benefits had vested and matured during the decedent's lifetime and, as such, would pass to his estate. The commissioner\n   granted the motion insofar as it permitted the estate to be substituted as a party, but he denied the motion as to Brennan individually. The commissioner cited General Statutes \u00a7 52-599 (b), which provides for the survival of actions and the continuation of actions by a decedent's executor, as authority for the substitution. The city filed an appeal from the decision granting the estate's substitution. While that appeal was pending, proceedings continued on the benefits claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December, 2015, the commissioner issued a finding and decision, ordering the city to pay benefits for 80 percent permanent partial disability of the decedent's heart pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-308 (b), less any advance payments made to date on permanent partial\n   disability. In support of this decision, the commissioner found that the decedent had reached maximum medical improvement on October 13, 1993, and credited the 1995 opinion of the decedent's physician assigning the 80 percent permanency rating to the decedent's disability. The commissioner declined to credit the lesser ratings of the city's three medical experts or the greater postmortem rating of the decedent's physician. The commissioner concluded that the decedent's entitlement to permanent partial disability benefits had vested prior to his death. The commissioner specifically concluded, however, that benefits were \"due and payable to Janet Brennan and not the estate of [the decedent] ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both parties filed motions to correct and for an articulation. The commissioner denied the city's motions but granted the executrix' motions in part. Specifically, the executrix sought (1) an articulation as to the dates on which the decedent's entitlement to disability benefits \"vested\n   <em>\n    and matured\n   </em>\n   \"; (emphasis added); and (2) a correction making the disability benefits payable to the estate or, alternatively, an articulation as to why the benefits are properly payable to Brennan individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, the commissioner issued the following correction: \"[Permanent partial disability] benefits vested as of the date of [maximum medical improvement] on October 13, 1993. [Permanent partial disability] benefits of 80 [percent] of the heart are payable to Janet Brennan, [e]xecutrix of the [e]state of [the decedent].\" The city filed an appeal from the corrected finding and decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the city's request, the board consolidated the appeal contesting the estate's substitution with the appeal contesting the corrected finding and decision. The board concluded that the case was controlled by\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519100\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/576/\">\n    208 Conn. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20A.2d%20243\">\n    546 A.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the board interpreted to hold that an estate is not a qualified recipient of vested but unpaid \u00a7 7-433c benefits. In reliance on\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the board vacated the commissioner's decision granting the motion to substitute the executrix, vacated the corrected decision making the estate the beneficiary, and remanded the case to the commissioner to decide the proper recipient of the benefits. As to the benefits owed to any such recipient, the board affirmed the central findings of the commissioner's decision. However, the board ordered the commissioner, when considering on remand the proper beneficiary, also to address several issues previously raised by the city relating to the availability and amount of benefits that the commissioner had declined to address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before turning to the executrix' challenges to the board's decision, we must\n   dispose of a jurisdictional issue raised by the city. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Soracco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams Scotsman, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145776\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/86/#p90\">\n    292 Conn. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20A.2d%201\">\n    971 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Specifically, the city contends that this appeal must be dismissed because it was filed by Brennan individually, who lacks standing to appeal as she neither was a party to the proceedings below nor is aggrieved by the board's decision. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The city's jurisdictional claim rests on the fact that the appeal form reflects that \"Janet Brennan\" is identified as the party filing the appeal. However, this entry does not indicate whether Brennan filed the appeal in her representative or individual capacity. This court has explained that \"the forms for appeals and amended appeals do not in any way implicate appellate subject matter jurisdiction. They are merely the formal, technical vehicles by which parties seek to invoke that jurisdiction. Compliance with them need not be perfect;\n   <em>\n    it is the substance that matters, not the form\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950716\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/262/#p275\">\n    281 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201025\">\n    914 A.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). When there is an ambiguity as to the identity of the appellant, this court will look to other filings to resolve that ambiguity. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Celentano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rocque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951999\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/645/\">\n    282 Conn. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20709\">\n    923 A.2d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The docketing statement, the name of the case cited on the appeal form, and the appellant's brief indicate that the appellant's intention was that the appeal was filed on behalf of \"Janet Brennan, Executrix of the Estate of Thomas Brennan.\" Although these documents also refer to Brennan individually, the aforementioned references are sufficient to dispel any ambiguity as to\n   whether a proper party has filed the appeal. See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20709\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring to briefs and docketing statement to discern proper identity of parties to appeal). Accordingly, we reject the city's request for dismissal of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We now turn to the merits of the appeal. The executrix contends that the estate is the proper recipient of any unpaid permanent partial disability benefits owed by the city because those benefits matured during the decedent's lifetime. Had they been paid when due, according to the executrix, the entirety of the decedent's benefits would have been paid during his lifetime. The executrix further contends that\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519100\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/576/\">\n    208 Conn. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20A.2d%20243\">\n    546 A.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on which the board relied, presents no legal impediment to awarding benefits to a claimant's estate because certain statutory language on which the case relied was repealed. Should this court conclude that\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   was not implicitly legislatively overruled, she contends that\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   should be either limited to its facts, which involved unmatured benefits, or overruled if applicable to vested, matured benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The city disagrees with the executrix' characterization of the benefits as matured. It also defends the vitality and applicability of\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , and contends that awarding unpaid benefits to an estate would undermine legislative intent to provide compensation only to dependents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We conclude that \u00a7 7-433c benefits properly may be paid to a claimant's estate, if such benefits matured before the claimant's death. However, we disagree that the record establishes that the disability benefits at issue in the present case matured prior to the decedent's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In considering whether an estate can be a proper recipient of \u00a7 7-433c benefits, we apply the well settled\n   standard of review applicable to administrative appeals. \"Cases that present pure questions\n   of law ... invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Estate of Rock\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    University of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486823\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/420/#p30\">\n    323 Conn. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486823\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/420/#p30\">\n    144 A.3d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"[W]e do not defer to the [agency's] construction of a statute-a question of law-when ... the [provisions] at issue previously have not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or when the [agency's] interpretation has not been time tested.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Christopher R.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Mental Retardation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749364\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/594/#p603\">\n    277 Conn. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20431\">\n    893 A.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The present case does not involve a time tested agency interpretation. Moreover, although \u00a7 7-433c was subject to prior judicial scrutiny in\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the present case requires us to determine the scope of our holding in that case, as well as the effect of subsequent legislative action. We therefore apply plenary review and established rules of construction. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963525\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/258/#p270\">\n    257 Conn. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20A.2d%20645\">\n    777 A.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 7-433c (a) provides in relevant part: \"[A] uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who ... suffers ... any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation ... in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 [the Workers' Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. ] ....\" Therefore, \u00a7 7-433c prescribes the conditions under which benefits are provided for this class of employees\n   and their dependents, but the Workers' Compensation Act dictates the substance of and the procedure for obtaining such benefits.

See\n   <em>\n    Finkelstone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Brass Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1561874\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/144/470/#p472\">\n    144 Conn. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.2d%2074\">\n    134 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stratford Lumber Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 105 Conn. at 300-301,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.%20574\">\n    135 A. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only beneficiary added to \u00a7 31-308 (d) that had not previously been recognized as a proper recipient of benefits is the employee's nondependent children. We therefore assume that this provision was not intended to take away employees' existing right to have their unpaid matured benefits pass to their estate but, rather, was\n   intended to provide a new right by expanding the potential beneficiaries of unmatured benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The legislative history of P.A. 89-346 confirms that the legislature did not intend to change the law except as necessary to rectify the holding in\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   with respect to nondependent children. Explanations regarding the bill that became P.A. 89-346 indicate the legislature's intent to expand the existing class to whom\n   <em>\n    unmatured\n   </em>\n   benefits could pass to include nondependent children. See 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1989 Sess., p. 1600, remarks of Representative Joseph A. Adamo (discussing bill as direct response to\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ); 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1989 Sess., pp. 5877-78, remarks of Representative Adamo (referring to \"leftover\" benefits); 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., p. 3952, remarks of Senator James Maloney (referring to benefits that had not been \"fully paid\" out before worker died). Had the legislature intended to overrule seven decades of workers' compensation precedent, under which matured benefits passed to an employee's estate, presumably a sponsor\n   of the legislation would have made this fact known to the legislators voting on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While the legislative response to\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   gives no indication of an intent to overrule precedent other than the specific holding of\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the legislative history does provide a clear indication of an intent to apply the same rules of distribution for \u00a7 7-433c benefits and workers' compensation benefits. One legislator asked whether the new provision expanding the class of beneficiaries also would apply to benefits provided through \u00a7 7-433c, or would apply only to those provided through the act. See 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1989 Sess., pp. 5882-83, remarks of Representative Robert M. Ward. The bill's sponsor made clear that both benefits would be treated the same. See 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1989 Sess., p. 5883, remarks of Representative Adamo. Thus, to whatever extent the board deemed it significant that\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   characterized these benefits differently, this legislative\n   history confirms that any such difference would not bear on distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, with regard to the city's argument that providing benefits to a claimant's estate would contravene the legislature's intent not to benefit nondependents, this court long ago rejected this very argument: \"The trial court based its decision [denying the claim of the claimant's estate]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   upon the theory that the intent of the [act] is to provide compensation to the workman and upon his decease to his dependents. And that, if the estate of the workman received the compensation for his incapacity which had accrued before his decease, this would enrich his estate, and perhaps strangers, instead of benefiting his dependents, and so defeat a primary purpose of the act. This is an erroneous application of the true theory of our [act]. The compensation accrued before the workman deceased, his right to it had vested, hence it survived to his estate. Had he collected it, it would have been his in lieu of the wages which, but for his incapacity, he would have received. It is possible that the accrued compensation constituting this award may go to the relatives of the deceased workman who were not his dependents, but it is far more probable that it will help meet the expenses which his incapacity and his illness preceding his decease have entailed.\"\n   <em>\n    Greenwood\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luby\n   </em>\n   , supra, 105 Conn. at 401-402,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.%20578\">\n    135 A. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An interpretation of \u00a7 7-433c that allows matured benefits to pass to the estate rather than the claimant's dependents may better effectuate legislative intent. As the city emphasizes in the present case, \u00a7 7-433c benefits are subject to pension offsets and caps. The payment of matured benefits to the estate will allow for a more rational application of the pension offsets under \u00a7 7-433b. The estate stands in the shoes of the employee and receives no greater or lesser benefit than had the\n   employee been paid during his lifetime. It is precisely because the employee was entitled to receive the benefits during his lifetime that entitles the estate to the benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, we conclude that matured \u00a7 7-433c benefits-those that accrued during the claimant's lifetime-prop-erly pass to the claimant's estate. The question that remains for our consideration is whether the benefits at issue in the present case had matured before the decedent's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The executrix contends that the disability benefits matured because the right to those benefits vested once the decedent reached maximum medical improvement on October 13, 1993, and, had the city timely paid those benefits starting from that date, all compensation due would have been paid to the decedent before he began receiving temporary total disability benefits on February 19, 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The executrix acknowledges that the decedent could have insisted on the payment of disability benefits. Nonetheless, she contends that, because of the city's economic distress and the decedent's desire for a lump sum payment to settle his entire claim, the decedent \"did not pressure the city for weekly payments, but rather agreed to wait for the city to have enough money to settle the claim in full.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The city claims that any benefits that it might be obligated to pay as a result of the decedent's permanent\n   disability had not matured because they were not payable to\n   him during his lifetime. The city asserts that the 1993 award was not definite enough to impose on the city an obligation to begin payments to the decedent during his lifetime because (1) his disability rating was not conclusively established until after his death, and (2) he chose to negotiate for a lump sum payment during his lifetime rather than obtain a final adjudication of the exact weekly compensation that the city would be obligated to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In response, the executrix contends that the amount of disability benefits due was certain, because the city and the decedent had reached a compromise disability rating of 77.5 percent in the course of their settlement negotiations. She further contends that, even if the statutory maximum (520 weeks of compensation) had been ordered, under any scenario, \"[h]ad the city fulfilled its obligation to make weekly payments in light of its financial inability to settle the case, [the decedent's disability] benefits would have been paid in full [before his death].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We conclude that, on the present record, we cannot state with certainty that the unpaid portion of the 80 percent permanent partial disability benefits necessarily matured before the decedent's death. Our uncertainty in this regard exists because the commissioner's decision does not include necessary findings on the critical issues, and we therefore leave open the possibility that the commissioner, on remand, may find that some portion of the benefits matured before the decedent's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Balloli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488738\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/367/#p17\">\n    324 Conn. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488738\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/367/#p17\">\n    151 A.3d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

The date of maximum medical improvement is the point at which the\n   <em>\n    permanency\n   </em>\n   of the condition and, hence, the\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to permanent disability benefits, is established, and it is\n   also the point at which the\n   <em>\n    degree\n   </em>\n   of permanent impairment (loss of, or loss of use of a body part) can be assessed, which will determine the employer's payment obligations (i.e., number of weeks of compensation owed). An employer's payment obligations, then, are not fixed until the establishment of entitlement to permanent disability benefits. General Statutes \u00a7 31-295 (c) provides in relevant part: \"\n   <em>\n    If the employee is entitled to receive compensation for permanent disability to an injured member in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 31-308\n   </em>\n   , the compensation shall be paid to him beginning not later than thirty days following the date of the maximum improvement of the member or members and, if the compensation payments are not so paid, the employer shall, in addition to the compensation rate, pay interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum on such sum or sums from the date of maximum improvement....\" (Emphasis added.)

However, because this issue was not addressed by the commissioner, and the case is being remanded to the commissioner for further proceedings, we leave open the possibility that the commissioner may conclude that some portion of the benefits matured during the decedent's lifetime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20710\">\n    304 Conn. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20A.3d%201033\">\n    41 A.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (concluding that\n   case should be remanded to trial court for further proceedings due to lack of findings on facts essential to court's legal conclusion regarding application of offset to disability pension);\n   <em>\n    Deschenes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Transco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714039\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/303/#p304\">\n    288 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304-306,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2013\">\n    953 A.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (concluding that case should be remanded to commissioner for further proceedings due to lack of findings on facts essential to commissioner's legal conclusion regarding apportionment of permanent partial disability benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We begin our explanation for this conclusion with the 1993 award. The 1993 award itself does not provide the necessary findings. That award reflects that the decedent had established a compensable condition under \u00a7 7-433c by way of a diagnosis of hypertension and heart disease during the course of his employment. The award did not find, however, that maximum medical improvement had been reached; nor did it adopt a permanency rating. It simply ordered the city to pay the decedent all of the benefits of \u00a7 7-433c to which he \"is or may become entitled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   No voluntary agreement containing these terms was submitted to the commissioner for approval during the decedent's lifetime. There is a draft settlement agreement in the record, apparently drafted by the decedent's counsel, with an accompanying motion to open and set aside the 1993 award. The city did not sign those documents. In his 2015 decision, the commissioner expressly found that the parties did not reach a final settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In that decision, the commissioner found that the decedent reached maximum medical improvement on October 13, 1993. Although the commissioner made no express finding as to whether there was a meeting of the minds on that matter before the decedent's death, the evidence in the record plainly reveals that to be the case. In a July, 1997 letter, the city acknowledged that\n   the decedent had a permanent impairment and had reached maximum medical improvement on October 13, 1993. But the degree of the permanency is not the subject of any finding or final agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The record not only fails to establish that there was a meeting of the minds on the degree of permanency to be assigned to that disability, it provides a clear implication to the contrary. The executrix relies on a provision in the draft settlement agreement adopting a \"compromise\" disability rating of 77.5 percent, but the city did not draft the agreement, it did not sign the motion seeking to submit that agreement to the commissioner, and it did not state in any of its communications to the decedent (in the record) that it had agreed to that rating. Had the commissioner found that there was a meeting of the minds on this matter, he either would have adopted this rating or explained why he had rejected it. However, the commissioner did neither, and in fact made no reference to the purported compromise rating. Most significantly, the commissioner duly considered, but ultimately found unpersuasive, the opinions of the city's medical experts\n   assigning lesser ratings of 50 percent and 75 percent. The commissioner's consideration of those ratings, as well as the executrix' higher rating that the commissioner ultimately adopted, is inconsistent with a finding that there had been a meeting of the minds as to permanency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We acknowledge that an argument could be made that there was a meeting of the minds that there was a permanent impairment of\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   50 percent. Although the executrix did not advance this argument, we see no impediment to the commissioner's consideration\n   of it after the case is remanded to the commissioner to resolve the open issues as to the proper beneficiary, benefit calculations, and setoffs. We note that this is an issue of first impression as to whether benefits could mature under such circumstance, and the board should be given an opportunity to weigh in on this matter should an appeal be necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, we leave to the commissioner the executrix' argument that, in part because of the city's economic distress, the decedent \"did not pressure the city for weekly payments, but rather agreed to wait for the city to have enough money to settle the claim in full.\" The commissioner made no findings relating to any such agreement or any such reliance argument. In the absence of such findings or clear evidence establishing such fact, the better course, in light of the pending remand, is to allow the commissioner, and the board if necessary, to consider this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, on the basis of the record before this court, we cannot conclude that the decedent's \u00a7 7-433c disability benefits for his 80 percent impairment to his heart function matured before his death. In accordance with the board's decision, the case will be remanded for further proceedings to decide the proper beneficiary of any benefits due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The decision of the Compensation Review Board is reversed only as to its determination that the commissioner improperly granted the motion to substitute the executrix as a party claimant and the case is remanded to the board with direction to affirm the commissioner's decision granting that motion and to remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings to determine the proper beneficiary and the amount of benefits due; the decision is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    We refer to Janet Brennan by name when addressing matters undertaken in her individual capacity and by her title as executrix when addressing matters undertaken in her capacity as fiduciary of the decedent's estate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    For persons hired prior to July 1, 1996, \u00a7 7-433c\"requires the payment of compensation to firemen and policemen who have successfully passed a physical examination which failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease and who subsequently die or are disabled as a result of such conditions.\"\n    <em>\n     Plainville\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Travelers Indemnity Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706552\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/178/664/#p670\">\n     178 Conn. 664\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 670,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=425%20A.2d%20131\">\n     425 A.2d 131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979) ; see Public Acts 1996, No. 96-230, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, codified at \u00a7 7-433c (b) (rendering persons hired on or after July 1, 1996, ineligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Brennan testified that the decedent's goal in settling the claim was to obtain benefits in a lump sum in order to pay off a mortgage.

This statement was correct, insofar as\n    <em>\n     Bassett\n    </em>\n    held that an employee's estate could not receive\n    <em>\n     unmatured\n    </em>\n    benefits whereas P.A. 89-346 would allow the employee's legal heirs, nondependent children, to receive such benefits. Insofar as the legislature declined to adopt a more expansive version of the bill that became P.A. 89-346, which would have permitted unmatured benefits to be paid to the employee's estate, rather than only to his dependents and adult children; see 32 H.R.

We note that the fiscal analysis for the proposed legislation, provided to legislators, only accounted for the possibility of increased costs arising from expanding the class of beneficiaries. See Office of Legislative Research, Fiscal Impact Statement, Substitute House Bill 7181, An Act Concerning the Payment of Certain Workers' Compensation Benefits (1989).
