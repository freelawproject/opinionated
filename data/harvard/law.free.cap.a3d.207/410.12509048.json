Therein, the trial court overturned\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records' (OOR) Final Determination and remanded Williams' underlying appeal to the trial court's designated judicial appeals officer. The trial court further ordered that the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office (DA) need not provide a copy of the venire list to Williams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams presents three issues for this Court's review: (1) whether Williams' appeal from the trial court's order was timely; (2) whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction since the DA did not render a final decision concerning all the items in Williams' Right-to-Know Law (RTKL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   request (Request); and (3) whether the DA must disseminate judicial documents. Upon review, the appeal is quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Williams is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Albion (SCI-Albion). On August 16, 2016, Williams submitted his Request to the DA's RTKL Office seeking his guilty plea, witness statements, voir dire notes, weapon item receipt number, and the venire list from his criminal trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original Record (O.R.) Item 11 (DA Trial Court Brief) Ex. A. By August 23, 2016 letter, the DA's open records officer B.J. Graham-Rubin (Graham-Rubin) responded that the guilty plea, witness statements, voir dire notes, and weapon item receipt number are criminal investigative records not subject to disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 11 Ex. B at 1. Graham-Rubin further declared: \"[T]he venire\n   list you requested is created by employees of the Pennsylvania judiciary. Accordingly[,] it is a non-financial record that is not subject to the RTKL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Section 304 of the RTKL,] 65 [P.S.] \u00a7 [67.]304;\n   <em>\n    Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna C\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    ty.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    v.

Item 11 Ex. B at 1. Graham-Rubin's response instructed, consistent with the Philadelphia County's open records procedures:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   This letter constitutes the response of [the DA's Open Records] Office to your RTKL request. Any appeal of the [DA's Open Records] Office's exercise of the Section 708(b)(16) [of the RTKL (relating to criminal investigative records) ] exemption must be filed with the First Assistant [DA] of the [DA's] Office, Appeals Officer, Three South Penn Square, Philadelphia, PA 19107, no later than 15 days from the date of this letter. Any appeal from this decision on other grounds must be filed with the [OOR], Commonwealth Keystone Building, 400 North Street, 4th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17120-0225, no later than 15 days from the date of this letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   O.R. Item 11 Ex. B at 2. On September 7, 2016, Williams timely appealed from the DA's entire denial to the OOR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 17 (OOR Certified Record) Attachment 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By September 8, 2016 letter, the OOR requested the parties' position statements and allowed them to supplement the record. On September 23, 2016, the DA submitted a position statement supported by Graham-Rubin's affidavit, wherein Graham-Rubin attested that the venire list \"relate[s] to a criminal investigation[,]\" and, since it \"contains the names of jurors who voted to convict [Williams,]\" \"providing it to [him] would endanger the safety of those jurors.\" O.R. Item 11 Ex. D (Graham-Rubin Affidavit) at 1. The DA also argued that the OOR lacked jurisdiction over the venire list because it was a judicial agency record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 6, 2016, the OOR issued its Final Determination remanding the portion of Williams' Request seeking his guilty plea, witness statements, voir dire notes, and weapon item receipt number to the DA's designated appeals officer, where Williams should have initially appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relative to the venire list, the\n   OOR granted Williams' Request and ordered the DA to produce it to Williams within 30 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 11 Ex. C (OOR Final Determination) at 6. The OOR therein reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [a]lthough the venire list is created by the Pennsylvania judiciary and contains the names of individuals summoned for jury duty, the [DA] fails to provide any evidence of how [it] is a record that documents the activities of judicial personnel .... Accordingly, the OOR has jurisdiction over the [DA's] denial of the venire list.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   O.R. Item 11 Ex. C at 5-6. The OOR further held that the DA's concerns for juror safety were conclusory and insufficient to withhold public access of the venire list under the RTKL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 11 Ex. C at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 20, 2016, the DA appealed from the OOR's Final Determination regarding the venire list to the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 2. The trial court held oral argument on April 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Item 18. On April 20, 2017, the trial court vacated the OOR's Final Determination as to the venire list, stating: \"[T]he [DA] need not provide ... the venire list to [Williams], because the OOR did not have jurisdiction over the venire list as it is a record of a judicial agency ... created by personnel of the judiciary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams Br.

On June 5, 2018, the trial court issued its opinion, stating that \"[t]he appeal may ... be denied as untimely[,]\" but nevertheless addressed Williams' substantive claims and reversed the OOR's order because \"[a] venire list is created by personnel of the Pennsylvania judiciary and is consequently a judicial record [and,] [t]he OOR therefore\n   lacked authority to require the [DA] to provide [it] to [Williams].\" Williams Br.
