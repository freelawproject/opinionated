At that time, Tieman and the victim were living at Tieman's mother and father's home in Fairfield, Maine. On August 24, 2016, Tieman was seen by several people with another woman with whom he had begun communicating on Facebook a week earlier. On the night of August 24, 2016, Tieman had sex with her. On that same night, the victim called Tieman thirty-one times between 5:46 p.m. and 10:22 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] The following day, August 25, 2016, a friend of both Tieman and the victim contacted the victim using Facebook's messaging platform, \"Facebook Messenger.\" The friend informed the victim that Tieman was \"getting caught up in other women and saying [that] they were separated.\" The victim responded to the friend, stating in several messages that Tieman had \"broke[n] [her] heart,\" but that \"it [would] all work out [because] God has a plan,\" and that Tieman would \"never find a better woman than [her]\" and he had \"lost [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] On August 26, 2016, Tieman moved into the home of the woman with whom he was having an affair and informed her that the victim had run off with another man. The same day, the victim's parents became concerned about the victim because she was not responding to their calls, text messages, or Facebook messages. In an attempt to communicate with the victim, the parents reached out to Tieman and asked how he and the victim were doing. Tieman responded the following day, stating: \"We are good. Thank you. Love her so much ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] On September 8, 2016, the parents of the victim had still not heard from her, so they called Tieman's father, who informed them that the victim was missing. The victim's parents then called Tieman, asking why he had not told them that the victim was missing. Tieman stated: \"I was waiting for her to contact you because I still would never bad mouth her. I still love you all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] The following day, September 9, 2016, the victim's father filed a missing person report with the Fairfield Police Department. Tieman explained to the victim's father, to Fairfield police, and to Maine State Police detectives that he had driven to Wal-Mart with the victim, had gone into the store alone, and when he had returned to the vehicle the victim had been gone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] On September 20, 2016, a search warrant was executed at the Tieman family home in Fairfield. Police dogs trained to detect human remains were employed at the scene and approximately five minutes into the search a police dog discovered a burial site behind the Tieman family home. The victim's body was in the burial site; she was wrapped in a blanket and buried with an assortment of items. Among those items was a note written to \"Joy-Joy\" from \"LUC-e-DA-Bear\" which stated, in part: \"forever I love you for always.... Rest in peace .... I can't wait to be with you and see you and hold you again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b69] Around the same time that the victim's body was exhumed, detectives questioned Tieman about the body. Tieman stated that the victim had died of an overdose and he had buried her in the backyard with a note and some flowers. Tieman also stated that the victim had suffered no physical injuries. However, an autopsy performed on September 21, 2016, revealed that the cause of the victim's death was gunshot wounds of the head and neck. Fragments and a portion of the jacket of a .45 caliber bullet were discovered in the victim's head during the autopsy, and a .45 caliber handgun had been seized from the Tieman residence during the execution of the search warrant on September 20, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b610] Tieman was arrested on September 21, 2016, and indicted on October 27, 2016, for the murder of the victim. Following a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on April 9, 2018. Tieman was sentenced to a term of fifty-five years' imprisonment with the Department of Corrections. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Facebook Messenger Records\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b611] Tieman raises two challenges to the court's admission of the Facebook\n   Messenger records, which were offered and admitted as State's Exhibit 74A over Tieman's objection. First, he contends that the court clearly erred or abused its discretion in finding that the Facebook Messenger records were authenticated pursuant to M.R. Evid. 901. Second, he asserts that the court abused its discretion by admitting the Facebook Messenger records pursuant to the hearsay exception that allows for the admission of a declarant's statement of his or her then-existing state of mind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.

Evid. 803(3). The Facebook Messenger conversations contained in State's Exhibit 74A include statements made by the victim and the friend who reached out to the victim. The court found that the victim's statements were admissible as \"an exception to the hearsay rule under [ M.R. Evid. 803(3) because] it is a statement of [the victim's] existing state of mind and emotion ....\" The court did not make any findings regarding the statements made by the friend that were contained within the Facebook Messenger records, but Tieman conceded at oral argument that he is not challenging the admissibility of those statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the focus of our analysis is solely on the admissibility of the messages sent by the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b617] Pursuant to Rule 803(3), statements of a declarant's then-existing state of mind or emotion are admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay, whereas statements of memory-pointing backwards to the past-are not admissible under that Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, some of the victim's statements contained in the Facebook Messenger conversation express her then-existing state of mind and emotion-for example, the victim stated: \"[we] still do have a good relationship\" and \"[h]owever it will all work out, God has a plan\" and \"[h]e will never find a better woman than me.\" However, the Facebook Messenger conversation also contains statements by the victim that referred to past incidents and looked backward, for example: \"[h]e broke my heart and wouldn't tell me who he kissed because I mentioned that I would kill her\" and \"he lost me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b618] Assuming that the statements are hearsay,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that some of the messages sent by the victim, that were related to past incidents, were improperly admitted under Rule 803(3), \"it is highly probable the error did not affect the jury's verdict and the error was therefore harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The evidence revealed that Tieman had purchased a .45 caliber handgun that was found in the residence where he and the victim were living, and that the .45 caliber handgun was used to fire the bullet of which fragments were recovered from the victim's head. The evidence also demonstrated that upon returning from South Carolina, Tieman began courting other women and began a sexual relationship with a woman the night before the victim was last heard from. The day after the affair and the victim's disappearance-which Tieman neglected to report to police-Tieman moved into the home of the other woman. Additionally, Tieman admitted to law enforcement and also at trial that he had buried the victim with an assortment of items, which were connected to Tieman by his statements to law enforcement, by his testimony at trial, and by video evidence admitted at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b621] Contrary to Tieman's contentions, there is ample evidence in the record-including but not limited to the above-referenced evidence-from which the jury rationally could have found every element of knowing or intentional murder proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State did not object to Tieman's request, and all of the compiled Facebook Messenger records of the victim were admitted in evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    There is, in fact, no indication that the victim's statements were being offered to establish that the defendant had \"broken her heart,\" that \"God has a plan,\" or that Tieman would never find a better woman. The State, however, never asserted that these statements were not hearsay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
