Bowie presiding in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, denying relief sought by applicant\u2019s first petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. Poff was convicted of grand larceny and breaking and entering with intent to steal. Poff contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The oath is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cB. The indictment against me was not a true bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201cC. My attorney refused to call four (4) witnesses who could testify in my behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201cD. The complaining witness perjured himself \u2014Mohammed Saleh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">In his contention concerning the constitutionality of the oath, applicant does not state what oath he is referring to, what part of it is unconstitutional, on what grounds it is unconstitutional, nor to whom the oath applies. This contention must be dismissed as a bald allegation. <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46, 227 A. 2d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">In his second allegation, applicant contends the indictment was defective because it gave the name \u201cMohammed Saleh\u201d when that name was not the real name of the witness; the witness\u2019s real name appears to be \u201cWilson.\u201d This contention is not a ground for relief since objections based on defects in the indictment, other than the indictment failing to show jurisdiction of the court or to charge an offense, must be raised by motion before-trial or they are waived. See Rule 725 (b) and <em>Williams v. Director, </em>4 Md. App. 721, 245 A. 2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">In his third contention, applicant claims that four witnesses were not called in his behalf. This contention may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>be construed either as questioning his counsel\u2019s trial tactics or competency. Under either construction, the contention lacks merit. Trial tactics are not grounds for post conviction relief. <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108, 227 A. 2d 375. Judge Bowie found the applicant was competently represented by a respected member of the bar. At the factual hearing, applicant\u2019s trial counsel was questioned as to his reasons for not calling each of the four witnesses and the hearing judge was satisfied with these reasons. In the application for appeal no reason is given to disturb the finding. See <em>Creswell v. Director, </em>2 Md. App. 142, 233 A. 2d 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Lastly applicant contends that Mohammed Saleh perjured himself when he said that he was \u201cborn with\u201d the name Mohammed Saleh. Assuming this contention is true, it is immaterial to applicant\u2019s rights whether Mohammed Saleh was given that name at birth or assumed it sometime later. In <em>Romans v. State, </em>178 Md. 588, 597, 16 A. 2d 642, <em>cert. den. </em>312 U. S. 695, 61 S. Ct. 732, 85 L. Ed. 1131 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cIf there is no statute to the contrary, a person may adopt any name by which he may become known, and by which he may transact business and execute contracts and sue or be sued. . . . Hence, if a person adopt or assume a name whereby he becomes known, so that the adopted or assumed name is sufficient for his identification, he may be prosecuted in his adopted or. assumed name... . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We perceive no reason why a similar rule should not apply to the victim of a crime or to a witness thereto. The false testimony, if any, did not relate to a material fact and, therefore, did not constitute perjury. <em>Brown v. State, </em>225 Md. 610, 171 A. 2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
