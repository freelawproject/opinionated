Mrs. Grunder was employed as a teller at the bank. Shortly before 2:00 P.M. she heard \u201ca scuffling sound and a shout or a cry.\u201d Then she heard a shot and turned and \u201csaw a colored man half-way over the counter with a gun smoking in his hand.\u201d The gun was in his right hand and he was reaching with his left hand for a cloth coin bag in the working area of another teller, Mrs. Garcia. Mrs. Grunder had been shot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThen they just said, \u2018Get down\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>I automatically got down\u201d behind the counter. \u201cThey pushed the alarm * * * the teller\u2019s alarm, A.D.T.\u201d She could not identify the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Mrs. Garcia was performing her duties as a teller when she saw the hands of a \u201ccolored person\u201d reaching over the counter for a bag of coins. She saw a gun in one of the hands, tried to hide beneath the counter and heard a shot. When she stood up a short time later she saw blood on the back of Mrs. Grunder\u2019s blouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nineteen dollars in pennies, contained in a cloth bank bag, had been stolen. It was money obtained by her from the bank for use in connection with her duties as a teller. She did not see the robber\u2019s face; she could not identify the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The manager of the bank branch, Frank Kanoke, was working at his desk about 1:45 or 1:50 P.M. on 7 March. \u201cI heard some scuffling and I heard screaming and a report or a sound like a gunshot fired going off. I got up from my desk to go back to find out what was going on. About this time the man was trying to get out the door. He had a pistol. He pointed it at me or at least to my area * * * and I ducked. * * * I didn\u2019t see his face well at all.\u201d He could not \u201cpositively identify the individual who robbed the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Mrs. Barbara Prkna was one of some thirty customers in the bank at the time of the robbery. She was at Mrs. Garcia\u2019s window. \u201cMrs. Garcia and I were talking and she was getting ready to cash my check and I felt there was someone close to me, somebody come in. And I noticed someone jumped up kind of leaned over the counter. Well, at the time I thought perhaps he was picking up for Mrs. Garcia or trying to get her attention or some reason or another. She looked up rather startled and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>person jumped up again and reached over the counter\u2014 a grill work on top \u2014 and. made a grab for the moneybag that was sitting. You could see him from where I was, but not from over the \u2014 from over two or three feet over, and I could tell then this person was trying to take the money from the next teller. She made a motion to go towards this money holding the bag down, and the gentleman had a gun in his hand, which at the time I thought was a starter pistol or playing gun, and he shot at her.\u201d Mrs. Prkna looked at his face. Asked how long she looked at his face she said, \u201cSeemed like quite awhile at the time. Three minutes ? Three or four minutes ?\u201d She made a positive in-court identification <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the appellant as the robber. This identification came into evidence at that point without objection. The robber grabbed the money bag and went to the door. \u201cHe was having trouble opening the door. He turned around, kind of waived his gun around. He was quite scared looking and then he got out * * *. He did have the money bag in his hand. He did manage to get off with one.\u201d On cross-examination it was elicited that Mrs. Prkna had attended a lineup at Central Police Station. She said the appellant was in that lineup. At this point defense counsel moved to strike her testimony \u201ctill the State establishes that that lineup was conducted fairly.\u201d He contended that until the State showed that the lineup was conducted fairly, \u201cuntil it was shown [the in-court identification] has not been tainted by a prior confrontation it should not be admitted.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court said it understood that the appellant moved to exclude the in-court identification and denied the motion. Defense counsel reserved the right \u201cto renew the motion at a later time in the course of the trial.\u201d He then examined the witness in detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>with respect to the lineup at the Central Police Station. He elicited that there were two or three other girls she knew who were at the lineup, that about five men were in the lineup, that she was told nothing about any of the men in the lineup, that all were \u201cNegroes,\u201d that the appellant had on dark clothing and a raincoat, a shirt but not a white shirt \u2014 a dark one, no tie, that she observed the men about five minutes, that the appellant did not have a mustache, that his hair was about the same length as his hair was at the trial, that others in the lineup were dressed in a manner similar to the appellant. It was also elicited from the witness that she had been shown photographs but she \u201cdid not positively identify from photographs.\u201d She had been asked to pick out a picture of anyone she thought resembled the robber and she picked out three \u201cbut not positively.\u201d The three photographs were of different men. She thought the appellant was among the three she picked out. She did not recall seeing in the lineup the other two men whose photographs she had picked out. She was shown photographs within an hour after the commission of the crime and on several occasions thereafter. The three photographs she picked out, \u201cnot positively\u201d as the photograph of the robber \u2014 \u201cbut there was a resemblance in the picture and one way or another to the person I remember seeing\u201d \u2014 were apparently not picked out at the same viewing but one each during the several occasions she was shown photographs. The last one she picked out was about four days before the lineup. After all this it was adduced that she had not positively identified the appellant as the robber at the lineup. She was then asked: \u201cIf you were not positive at the time of the lineup why are you positive that this is the man today?\u201d She replied: \u201cThe conditions were quite different at the lineup. They were standing on the platform and he had lights above him, all around him. I stated at the time I did think that was the individual, though he appeared taller in the lineup. And, a lighter complexion when I saw him in the Court. He was facing the exactly \u2014 excuse me \u2014 at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>hearing \u2014 what you would call it, he was facing me exactly as he did in the bank, and when he turned around I also remember seeing a full-view face of him and I was positive.\u201d It was then elicited from her that she had attended a preliminary hearing after viewing photographs and attending the lineup, that at the hearing no defendant other than the appellant was present, that \u201cthe police brought in just this one man at the preliminary hearing and the Judge at the preliminary hearing said, \u2018Michael Coleman, you are charged with assault with intent to murder and robbery with a deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d It was at that time that she first made a positive identification of the appellant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The appellant testified on the limited issue of the constitutionality of the lineup. He said that Officer Norman Woingust had advised him of his right to have an attorney present at the lineup and he requested the presence of a lawyer. \u201cThe officer went out and got a lawyer and the lawyer told me he was my lawyer.\u201d He did not know the lawyer\u2019s name and did not see him again after the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">Defense counsel renewed the motion to strike the testimony of Mrs. Prkna. The State offered the testimony of Officer Woingust on the issue of the lineup. He testified that he had advised the appellant of his right to be represented by counsel at the lineup, reading him a waiver of rights form. The appellant did not sign the waiver and said he wanted a lawyer. Woingust presented the request to the Municipal Court and later that afternoon was told by the judge that the Clerk of the Court would send an attorney to the lineup. The lineup was conducted at 8:00 P.M. on 2 April 1968 and James McAllister, Esq. was present at the lineup to represent the appellant. The lineup identification report was admitted in evidence. It consisted of two sheets. It showed that six \u201ccolored men\u201d were in the lineup, designating the age, height, weight and clothing of each. The appellant was originally in the fourth position. Twenty witnesses viewed the lineup. Four of them were listed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>first sheet. Of those four Sophia Ballinger positively identified No. 4 and William E. Bundy was not sure as to No. 4. Identification was negative as to the other two witnesses. Under \u201cremarks\u201d it was noted \u201c4 changed 6,\u201d but it did not indicate when the change was made. The second sheet listed 16 witnesses. Of these Gloria Baker and Carolyn Taylor positively identified the man in No. 5 position and Edward Lewis the man in No. 4 position. Under \u201cremarks\u201d it was noted \u201c#5 to #4\u201d but there was no indication when the change was made. Identification by the other 13 witnesses, including Barbara Prkna, Gladys Garcia, Gertrude Brunder and Frank Knoke (sic) was indicated as negative. The lineup report was not explained. Woingust said that neither he nor any other officer in his presence suggested to any witness that the appellant was the one to be identified and that Mr. Mc-Allister was present during the entire conduct of the lineup. Defense counsel again renewed his motion to strike Mrs. Prkna\u2019s in-court identification. The court denied the motion. It thought that the police \u201cat least took extraordinary precautions to comply with the Wade rule.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The legality <em>vel non </em>of the lineup is not the issue here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Prkna, whose in-court identification is challenged,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not identify the appellant at the lineup and, if the lineup report showed that other witnesses identified the appellant at the lineup, it is clear that the line<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>up report was received only as to the legality of the lineup and not as to substantive evidence of a pretrial identification. Nor is the fairness of the photographic viewings an issue as Mrs. Prkna made no identification by photograph. The question is, whether, in the totality of the circumstances here shown, the confrontation of the appellant by the witness at the preliminary hearing had the. effect of being so impermissibly suggestive as to taint her in-court identification and render it inadmissible. If so its introduction could not be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Chapman v. State of California, </em>386 U. S. 18, because the in-court identification by Mrs, Prkna was the only evidence to establish that the appellant was the perpetrator of the crimes charged. See <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, supra, </em>at 65. This question encompasses'two issues: (1) was the confrontation at the preliminary hearing so impermissibly suggestive as to be a denial of the appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law; and (2) if so, did the State establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification was based on observations of the suspect other than the confrontation identification,\u201d that is, that it had an \u201cindependent source.\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, supra, </em>at 240 and 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We have held that, with exceptions not here pertinent, a preliminary hearing is not such a critical stage of the criminal proceedings as to require the presence of counsel. <em>Crumb v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 98. And we held in <em>Tyler v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 265, at 272-273, that \u201cthe rationale of <em>Wade </em>and Gilbert<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is not applicable to confrontations at a public pretrial judicial hearing presided over * * * by a judicial officer since what occurred there is not only the antithesis of the \u2018privacy results in secrecy\u2019 element highlighted in <em>Wade, </em>but the accused has the opportunity for \u2018a meaningful confrontation\u2019 of the State\u2019s case at the trial through the ordinary process of cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses and the presentation of the evidence of his own witnesses, including, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>necessary, the judicial officer who presided at the hearing.\u201d See also <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, supra, </em>at 64, note 3; <em>Bowen v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 713, 715; <em>Palmer v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 691, 698; <em>Boswell and Poe v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 571, 581. But we also noted in <em>Tyler, </em>at 273, \u201c [T] he manner and mode of the identification at the preliminary hearing is capable of reconstruction at trial so that the trier of fact may * * * be in a position effectively to scrutinize the pretrial identification process as it affected the identification at trial.\u201d Although the identification procedure at the preliminary hearing in <em>Tyler </em>left \u201cmuch to be desired,\u201d we did not think that the identification at the preliminary hearing there \u201cwas in any sense prejudicially inspired.\u201d We said that the fact that a previous identification had been made by the in-court identifying witness upon a fair photographic procedure, that the witness had an ample opportunity to observe the accused during the crime, and that the witness testified at trial that he did not make a positive identification of the accused at the preliminary hearing until, when on the witness stand, he \u201clooked right at his face,\u201d were factors entitled to consideration in determining whether the identification at trial was independent of and unstimulated by the identification made at the preliminary hearing. In the light of those factors we concluded that the in-court (trial) identification was not the product of an unconstitutionally tainted pretrial confrontation. 5 Md. App. at 274. Thus we have recognized that a confrontation at a preliminary hearing, not <em>per se </em>illegal by the absence of counsel, may nevertheless taint an identification made at trial, and whether it does or not depends upon all the relevant circumstances in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We cannot say, in the unusual circumstances existent in this case, that the identification at the preliminary hearing was not \u201cprejudicially inspired.\u201d It is not contradicted that the appellant alone was brought to the bench by police officers, that the judge indicated that the appellant was the accused by reading the charge to him, saying in substance, \u201cMichael Coleman, you are charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>with assault to murder and robbery with a deadly weapon,\u201d that the police knew the witness had been unable to identify the appellant on previous occasions when given the opportunity to do so, and that it was thereafter at the hearing that the witness for the first time positively identified the appellant as the man she had seen committing the crimes. Although other people were in the courtroom, the only people in front of the judge were the identifying witness, several other witnesses, the police and the appellant. We said in <em>Watson v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 225, 234: \u201c[i]t is readily evident that where the police, by pre-design, arrange a one-to-one confrontation between the victim [or eyewitness] and the accused in the police station, such a circumstance, of itself, would necessarily have great bearing on the question of whether there has been a denial of the accused\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law.\u201d See <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>[388 U. S. 293], at page 302, where the Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d Of course a preliminary hearing is a proper, but not necessary, proceeding. <em>Weddle v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 85, 92. Its basic purpose is to have a judicial determination whether to hold the accused for action of the grand jury. <em>Timbers v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 672, 673. If the authorities here thought it desirable to have a preliminary hearing, in order to assure that the determination to hold the appellant for action of the grand jury was fairly resolved in the light of the failure of Mrs. Prkna to identify the appellant on prior occasions, it was entirely feasible for them to arrange, with the consent of the hearing judge, that the confrontation not be one-to-one and that it not be made apparent to the witness that the appellant was the one who stood accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We hold that the confrontation at the preliminary hearing, in the circumstances, was so impermissibly suggestive as to violate the appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law. See <em>Palmer v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>supra; </em>Cf. <em>Smith v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 23; <em>Coit v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 70; <em>Wethington v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We now turn to the question whether the in-court identification was properly admitted as having a source independent of the pretrial identification. The State must show by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification was based upon observations of the appellant other than the illegal confrontation at the preliminary hearing. The test for such determination was set forth in <em>United States v. Wade, supra, </em>at 241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cWe think it follows that the proper test to be applied in these situations is that quoted in <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U. S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, \u2018[W]hether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. Maguire, Evidence of Guilt, 221 (1959).\u2019 See also <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U. S. 293, 309, 87 S. Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374. Application of this test in the present context requires consideration of various factors; for example, the prior opportunity to observe the alleged criminal act, the existence of any discrepancy between any pre-lineup description and the defendant\u2019s actual description, any identification prior to lineup of another person, the identification by picture of the defendant prior to the lineup, failure to identify the defendant on a prior occasion, and the lapse of time between the alleged act and the lineup identification. It is also relevant to consider those facts which, despite the absence of counsel, are disclosed concerning the conduct of the lineup.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Mrs. Prkna had the opportunity to observe the criminal act. She was two or three feet from the robber when he committed the crime and said she looked at his face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>as he was \u201ctrying to jump up to the counter.\u201d She also saw his face when he turned while attempting to get out ' the door of the bank. Asked how long she looked at his face, she said that \u201call told\u201d it \u201cseemed like quite awhile at the time. Three minutes? Four minutes?\u201d In her testimony at trial she was able to describe his clothing\u2014 \u201che had dark clothes on, dark pants, dark shirt.\u201d It was not shown what description she had given the police. She said she was not afraid during the commission of the crime and was not excited. \u201cI got excited later, but I wasn\u2019t excited at that particular time.\u201d On cross-examination she was asked, \u201cIs there anything distinctive about the face of the man you saw rob the bank that v/ould make you remember it? Was there a scar? Was there any marks on him? Was there any difference in his haircut? Or his mustache? Or anything that would make you recognize this man above all other?\u201d She replied, \u201cNone the things you mentioned. The first thing that might help was that he was quite younger.\u201d She thought, he was not more than 21 or 22. But there was nothing distinctive about his physical features or his clothes. She thought he was about 5 feet 7 inches in height.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, her opportunity to observe the criminal act must be considered in the light of her subsequent attempts to identify the robber. She viewed photographs on several occasions. On three different times she picked out a picture without being certain that it was of the appellant. The record does not reveal precisely how many times she was shown photographs by the police or how many photographs were shown her or when they were shown her, or whether or not any one or more of the photographs she picked out was of the appellant (she thought one of them was) but from the rebuttal testimony of Officer Woingust it appears that at some time a photograph of the appellant was among those viewed by her. She did not identify the appellant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lineup. She said she \u201cdid not positively identify\u201d the appellant at the lineup but the lineup report as to her shows identification as negative, although as to another witness the designation is \u201cnot sure.\u201d She explained her ability to identify the appellant at the preliminary hearing and her inability to identify him at the lineup as due to the fact that \u201cthe conditions were quite different at the lineup. They were standing on a platform and he had lights above him, all around him * * * and a lighter complexion when I saw him in the Court.\u201d At the hearing \u201che \u25a0was facing me exactly as he did in the bank, and when he turned around I also remembered seeing a full face of him and I was positive.\u201d But it is patent that she had ample opportunity to observe the appellant carefully at the lineup and that he was standing in the full glare of lights. We understand it is the usual practice to display those in a lineup both full face and profile. Her explanation must be considered in the light of the facts concerning the confrontation at the hearing. Not only was it a one-to-one confrontation but it was made apparent to her that the appellant was the person the police had charged with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We are unable to say, in the circumstances here, as disclosed by the evidence before us, that the State met its burden of showing by <em>clear </em>and <em>convincing </em>evidence that the in-court identification of the appellant by Barbara Prkna was based on observations of him other than the illegal confrontation at the preliminary hearing. We are constrained to conclude that the in-court identification had been come at by exploitation of the impermissibly suggestive confrontation at the preliminary hearing rather than by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. Compare <em>Joyner v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in not excluding the in-court identification. As that identification was the only evidence to show the criminal agency of the appellant,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the error was <em>not </em>harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the judgments must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We point out in summary of the rules of law here pertinent to the admission of an in-court identification that ordinarily it is properly admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">(1) if not shown to be tainted by an illegal pre-trial confrontation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">(2) even when a pre-trial confrontation was illegal, if the in-court identification is shown by the State to have an independent source by clear and convincing evidence that it was come at by observations of the defendant other than at the illegal confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Thus, it may well be that on retrial of the case the State will be able to adduce more comprehensive evidence as to the circumstances attending the confrontation of the appellant by Mrs. Prkna at the preliminary hearing which would be sufficient to overcome an initial showing by the appellant that the pre-trial confrontation was impermissibly suggestive. If so, the confrontation at the preliminary hearing would not taint an in-court identification by Mrs. Prkna and such in-court identification would be properly admissible. Or if the State cannot overcome a showing that the confrontation at the preliminary hearing was illegal, .it may be able to adduce evidence which would be clear and convincing that an in-court identification by Mrs. Prkna was based on observations of the appellant by her other than the illegal confrontation identification, in which event her in-court identification would be properly admissible. Or, if the State cannot adduce such evidence, it may be able to produce witnesses other than Mrs. Prkna who could make a properly admissible in-court identification sufficient to establish the criminal agency of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed: ease remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-12\">.
