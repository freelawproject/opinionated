The first conviction was invalidated by his election to void the indictment under the <em>Schowgurow </em>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was re-indicted on 12 May 1966 and his conviction of murder in the second degree under that indictment was set aside by this Court for the reason that the testimony of two witnesses at the first trial was read into the record at the second trial on an insufficient predicate to support the introduction of the testimony. <em>Lindsay v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 330. On remand, he was tried for the third time, convicted of murder in the second degree by a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, and sentenced to 18 years from 26 May 1963 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He now attacks the third conviction, contending:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>I. The evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">II. A legal presumption deprived him a basic constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">III. The trial court erred in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">IY. His \u201cpersonal, civil, legal, constitutional and inalienable rights\u201d were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by presenting two questions. He asks whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for judgment of acquittal <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and whether the verdict was against the evidence. The denial of the motion made at the close of all the evidence permits us to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to justify its submission to the jury. The test as to its sufficiency is whether the evidence either showed directly or supported a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the jury could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant\u2019s guilt of murder in the second degree. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450, 459. When properly submitted to the jury, the weight of the evidence is a matter for the jury. <em>Minor v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 82, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Homicide was proved. The Chief Medical Examiner of the State of Maryland testified that an autopsy was performed on the body of James Brown. He described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the nature of the injuries to the deceased in detail. The report of the autopsy was admitted in evidence. It included the opinion that Brown \u201cdied of a stab wound of the chest and heart. The manner of death is homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE_\">The testimony of Willie Boswell, Jr. was in substance that he saw the appellant, whom he identified, stab Brown in the neck during a \u201cskirmish.\u201d He had left a tavern a block away, had walked to his home at 700 Saratoga Street, and upon entering, heard an \u201cahhh\u201d sound outside. He looked out, saw the appellant and Brown, walked to an adjacent alley and watched the \u201cskirmish.\u201d He saw the appellant stick a knife in Brown\u2019s collarbone area, stab a second time, kick the now fallen Brown, walk away about five feet, return and pull Brown off the trolley tracks and walk away. He said he did not see Brown with a weapon. This testimony, if believed, was sufficient to show the criminal agency of the appellant. It also showed the use of a deadly weapon. The testimony of the Medical Examiner and the report of the autopsy showed that the weapon had been directed to a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. He had been stabbed three times, and one stab wound was in the front of the chest located four inches below the jugular notch and two and a half inches to the left of the midline, so that it overlay the area of the heart. It went into the heart. This was sufficient to show malice, constituting the homicide as murder in the second degree. <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87; <em>Bagley v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 375. The credibility of Boswell and other witnesses was for the jury to determine, as was the weight to be given to their testimony. <em>Williams v. State, supra. </em>We do not find that the testimony of Boswell was so contradictory as to come within the ruling in <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, and such contradiction as may have been present in his testimony went only to its weight. <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 8. The case also went to the jury on manslaughter. The determination beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of malice or the absence of excuse, justification or a mitigating circumstance was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>As the evidence as above summarized met the test- of sufficiency, the case was properly submitted to the jury. Thus there was no error in the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">- We stated in considering the sufficiency of the evidence that the showing of the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the victim\u2019s body established malice. This is so because in the circumstances established by the evidence malice wa;s inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Malice is \u201cthe intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification. It includes any wrongful act done wilfully or purposely.\u201d <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 105. Malice is the indispensable ingredient of murder; by its presence, homicide is murder; in its absence, homicide is manslaughter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Malice is divided into express and implied malice. Express malice exists whenever an accountable person kills another intentionally unless the killing is justifiable or excusable or unless there is a mitigating circumstance. <em>Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes, </em>6th Ed., \u00a7 10.06, p. 578. But a specific intent to kill is not a requisite of murder. One may commit murder without an actual intent to kill, for the law will imply malice in some unintentional killings and this is called \u201cimplied malice\u201d or - \u201cconstructive malice\u201d or \u201cmalice in law.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two of such classes of unintentional killing, committed without justification or excuse or a mitigating circumstance, in which malice is implied, are where (1) there was an intent to inflict great bodily harm; and (2) conceding that there was no actual intent to injure, an act was done or duty omitted wilfully, the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 579-580. So implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>malice in those classes is a matter of drawing inferences from the evidence; upon proof of certain facts, malice is inferred. If a man voluntarily and wilfully does an act, the natural and probable consequences of which is to cause another\u2019s death, an intent to kill may be inferred from the doing of the act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So, it has been consistently held, that in the absence of excuse, justification, or a mitigating circumstance,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> malice is inferred from the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the body. <em>Chisley v. State, supra; Bagley v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The appellant claims that there is a presumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201call homicides are murder in the second degree in which malice aforethought exists as a matter of law.\u201d He urges that this presumption is in direct conflict with the presumption of innocence and that if one must yield to the other, the presumption of innocence must be left unimpaired. This presumption is broader in scope than the inference of malice arising from an act, the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm, for conceivably the presumption would arise only from the fact of a homicide. He assumes the existence of this presumption from language in <em>Chisley v. State, supra, </em>at 105:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cThe law presumes all homicides to be committed with malice aforethought and to constitute murder. The burden is on the accused to show circumstances of alleviation, excuse or justification, which will reduce the offense to manslaughter. * * * Where the law divides murder into grades, such a homicide is presumed to be murder in the second degree and the burden is on the State to show that the killing was wilful, deliberate and premeditated, if the crime is -to be elevated to first degree murder. * * *.\u201d (citationsomitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">But we need not decide whether <em>Chisley </em>actually determined that there is a presumption such as the appellant suggests, separate and distinct from and broader in scope than the rule with respect to \u201cimplied malice;\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>there is such a presumption, whether it is now constitutional. See <em>Leary v. United States, </em>89 S. Ct. 1532, decided 19 May 1969. Resort to such a presumption is not necessary to a determination of the instant case; it may be resolved, as we have done, by an application of the rule with respect to implied malice. We shall, therefore, confine our discussion to the question of the constitutionality of the rule whereby malice may be inferred from acts of the accused apart from the mere fact of a homicide committed by him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The inference of malice under the implied malice rule is comparable to the rule under which there is an inference that a person in exclusive possession of recently stolen goods is the thief in the absence of satisfactory explanation of non-culpatory possession. As to each rule the inference arises from the proof of facts \u2014 with respect to the \u201cpossession\u201d rule, the facts that goods were recently stolen and that the accused is in exclusive possession of them and with respect to the \u201cmalice\u201d rule, the facts that the accused committed a homicide and that it was committed with an actual intent to injure or by an act the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm. In each the inference is rebut-table' \u2014 with respect to the \u201cpossession\u201d rule, by a reasonable non-eulpable explanation by the accused of the possession of the goods and with respect to the \u201cmalice\u201d rule by a showing by the accused that the homicide was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>excused, justified or extenuated. As to each rule the reasonableness and legality- of permitting the inference is explained by the rule that there may be drawn ah inference of - one fact from proof of another or others if there is some rational connection between the fact or facts proved and the ultimate fact inferred so that the inference drawn from the proof is not so farfetched as to be arbitrary. See <em>Anglin v. State, </em>244 Md. 652, 656-659. Anglin argued that the \u201cpossession\u201d rule was unconstitutional, claiming that the holding of <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U. S. 609 (there can be no comment at the trial on the failure of the accused to take the stand) and a suggestion in footnote 37 in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 468 (\u201c* * * it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation\u201d) combined to require that no presumption or inference may be drawn from his failure to explain how he came into possession of the goods. The Court held that these claims on the constitutional issue must fail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cIt is not \u25a0 unreasonable \u2022 to require the possessor to cause the facts of his possession to be explained if he desires to overcome the prima facie case against him arising from the permissible inference of fact flowing from his possession, because the facts as to that possession are peculiarly within his knowledge and ordinarily are not known or available to the State.\u201d 244 Md. at 652.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We think the same rationale is apposite to the \u201cimplied malice\u201d rule. Nor do we see any violation of the presumption of innocence. The inference of malice is disputable and'that it arises does not shift the burden of proof to the accused. The .inference merely provides <em>prima facie </em>evidence of malice, although it may be of controlling weight unless dispelled by the circumstances or the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the accused are accounted for in some way to show that malice did not in fact exist. But even in the face of the inference the accused stands innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; the risk of non-persuasion of the trier of fact remains with the prosecution. Just as where there is evidence of express malice, the determination of malice <em>vel non </em>beyond a reasonable doubt is for the trier of facts. Nor do we think that the inference violates due process of law. In <em>Leary v. United States, supra, </em>at 1548, the Court found that a criminal statutory presumption \u201cmust be regarded as \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary\u2019, and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Applying this test to the inference of malice here we believe it can be said with substantial assurance that the fact of malice is more likely than not to flow from the proved facts on which it was made to depend and so was not arbitrary or irrational. It is readily distinguishable from the presumption held unconstitutional in <em>Leary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We hold that the \u201cimplied malice\u201d rule is constitutional. We see no violation of the constitutional rights of an accused for society, in an attempt to achieve maximum protection for human life, to read in the mental element of malice whenever a defendant, acting without provocation, justification or excuse, could or should have foreseen that the consequences of his behavior might result in death to another person. See <em>Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes, supra, </em>\u00a7 10.06, p. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As the appellant recognizes, having made no objection to the instructions to the jury, he may not assign error as of right on appeal. Md. Rules 756f and 756g. However, he claims plain error material to his rights in the instructions taken as a whole and particularly as to an alleged redundancy by the judge in his definition of malice and the failure to mention \u201cthe geographic-time conflict of testimony between State witnesses,\u201d and asks that we take cognizance of and correct the alleged error. We have carefully reviewed the instructions and see no merit in the claim. The judge explained the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof, and defined murder, manslaughter, express malice, and implied malice. His instructions were full and complete and correctly stated the law. We find no plain error material to the appellant\u2019s rights which we feel we should recognize and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The fourth contention, incorporated in the appellant\u2019s brief at his insistence, consists of numerous allegations of denial of rights. Some of the allegations are factually incorrect, some are not supported by the record and some challenge procedures in the conduct of the trial which were patently proper. His complaints about his counsel on appeal appear to be without real substance and he raised no objection below to his trial counsel. As presented, the allegations are without sufficient specificity or clarity and we do not consider them. We note that the appellant claims that Willie Boswell, Jr., a State\u2019s witness, was not present at the trial. It is clear from the transcript of the proceedings that Boswell was present, was called, sworn, was examined by the State and cross-examined at length by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We point out again that there is no provision in the Maryland Rules of Procedure for the filing of supplemental or amended briefs <em>pro se. </em>See <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 160; <em>Jones v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 608; <em>Fabian v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-14\">. <em>Schowgurow v.

At his first two trials he was also tried and convicted of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sault on Richard Green Clark and the judgment on each of those convictions was also set aside. At his third trial his motion for a separate trial on the assault charge was granted. The record before us does not show the disposition of this charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\">. The appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the State. At that point the court granted the motion as to first degree murder because the appellant had been acquitted of that offense at a prior trial. See <em>State v. Barger, </em>242 Md. 616. The motion was again made at the close of all the evidence. The appellant argues that we should also consider the propriety of the denial of the motion as to second degree murder and manslaughter made at the close of the evidence offered by the State because he offered evidence only through a witness who had previously testified for the State. But the witness was the appellant\u2019s when called by him and by adducing evidence from him he withdrew the first motion. Md. Rule 755b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">. \u201cThe essential distinction between murder and manslaughter * * * jg presenCe or absence of malice.\u201d <em>Chisley v.

There are four classes, the other two being not here relevant. They are when death was caused during the commission of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>or attempt to commit, some other felony; and when death was caused while resisting lawful arrest or obstructing an officer in an attempt to suppress a riot or affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>Hochheimer, Criminal Law, </em>1st Ed., \u00a7 674, p. 394, states, \u201cAn act done for the purpose of committing a felony is murder, only if known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death. The old doctrine, that a mere intent to commit any felony renders a homicide murder is \u2018as much mistaken in law as it is repugnant to common sense and humanity and would probably be repudiated by every modern tribunal.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\"><em>Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes, supra, </em>\u00a7 10.07, p. 587 limits the felonies to burglary, arson, rape, robbery and larceny, citing <em>Stephen, Digest of the Criminal Law, </em>art. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In Maryland, by statute, murder is divided into first degree and second degree. All murder perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or by any kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 407; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate any rape, sodomy, mayhem, robbery, burglary, or in the escape from any jail or penal institution, \u00a7 410; or in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any arson, \u00a7 408; or in the burning or attempting to burn specifically designated structures, \u00a7 409, shall be murder in the first degree. All other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree, \u00a7 411. The statutes, thus, do not define \u201cmurder\u201d', but merely designate the degree of murder. They leave the common law sense of murder \u2014 unlawful homicide with malice aforethought \u2014 unimpaired, seeking only to graduate the measure of punishment according to the circumstances under which murder is committed. <em>Davis v. State, </em>39 Md. 355, 374. \u201cMurder is still a common law crime in Maryland, although it is divided into two degrees carrying different penalties.\u201d <em>Webb v. State, </em>201 Md. 158, 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">. tinder the so-called _ \u201cfelony-murder\u201d rule, the decisions at common law did not require that the act done shall have been of such a nature as to endanger life, or threaten great bodily harm, but the malice necessary to constitute murder is implied from the fact that the accused was committing or attempting to commit a felony. <em>Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes, supra, </em>\u00a7 10.07, p. 588.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">.

We note that since <em>Chisley </em>the Court of Appeals has repeatedly pointed out that the charge of the trial court to the jury in a murder case, in referring to the presumption that all homicides are committed with malice, should include the instruction that malice may be inferred \u201cin the absence of justification, excuse or some circumstance of mitigation.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>204 Md. 44, 61. See also <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 103; <em>Gunther v. State, </em>228 Md. 404, 411; <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 98. This Court has consistently stated the rule in those terms. See <em>Dyson v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 453, 456; <em>Bagley v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 375, 379; <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 238, 242; <em>Williams v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 170, 176; <em>Leyva v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 120, 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. We note that in the cases decided by the Court of Appeals and this Court in which the presumption stated in <em>Chisley, </em>as ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>plained in subsequent decisions, is set out, it appears that the facts permitted implied malice to be inferred. We are not aware of a case in which malice was \u201cpresumed\u201d only from the fact of a homicide and without a showing of an act by the accused sufficient to show an intent to inflict great bodily harm, or without the showing of an act the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm.

The constitutional issue was not expressly raised or decided below and ordinarily would not be before us for decision. Md. Rule 1085. But the overruling of the motion for judgment of acquittal as to second degree murder necessarily rested on the basis that an inference of malice could be validly drawn in the absence of excuse, justification or a mitigating circumstance, and thus implicitly, the constitutionality of the rule that permitted the inference was raised and decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">. In <em>Leary </em>the Court did not reach the question whether a criminal presumption which passes muster when so judged must also satisfy the criminal \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof of the crime charged or an essential element thereof depends upon its use. 89 S. Ct. at 1548, note 64. But the Court of Appeals said in <em>Chisley v.
