On this appeal appellant claims that he was illegally arrested and that, consequently, the narcotics seized from his person at that time should not have been admitted into evidence because the search was not incident to a lawful arrest, nor was it a proper frisk for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">At approximately 1:80 p.rn. on February 6, 1968, Detective Milton Spencer, a plainclothes member of the Vice Squad with nine years experience in lottery operations, entered Max\u2019s Pool Room in Baltimore to make a \u201croutine inspection.\u201d Spencer testified that \u201cI walked in and walked around the back part of the poolroom there. I noticed the defendant here * * * bending over the rear pool table writing on this brown paper bag.\u201d Spencer further testified that appellant \u201cwas writing numerals 960, 069, 906 and then 609. At this time he realized I was looking at this paper. He had just started to make a small dash behind the first zero of the first number, and, 960, when he saw me he started to draw a line through the 96. At this time I identified myself as a police officer, took this bag from him, and told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that I believed this was a non-conventional lottery slip that he was making, and that he was under arrest. * * *\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cQ. [State\u2019s Attorney] * * * Now, in your opinion, as an expert in lottery what do those numbers, which you have read out to the court, as written on that brown paper bag, represent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">A. [Detective Spencer] It appears he was combinating 960, and, he had done it in its five phases. And, there is one more he could have written; and, of course, I stopped him and went back to the top this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArR\">No other numbers were found on the bag. On cross-examination, Detective Spencer testified with reference to the appellant that \u201cI have, seen him around, and until this occurred I did not know his name\u201d; that appellant was standing in the poolroom by himself; and that after he arrested appellant, he searched his right coat pocket and found fifty gelatin capsules of cocaine hydrochloride, seventy-one gelatin capsules containing heroin hydrochloride, and $201 in cash. Appellant was then taken to police headquarters where he was examined and found to have \u201cneedle and track marks on both arms too numerous to count.\u201d At that time appellant admitted to a daily dose of 60 to 70 capsules of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Testifying on his own behalf, appellant admitted that he had been using drugs for twenty-five years but claimed that he was not an addict. He stated that he was a gambler, that he had not worked in the last three years, and that he was familiar with lottery numbers. He claimed that he picked up the bag from the poolroom floor to write down a telephone number; that \u201cthere was four telephones around the wall, and I was going to call somebody back later\u201d; that he couldn\u2019t remember seeing the numbers on the bag; that he was in the process of tearing the bag to write the number down when he was approached by Detective Spencer; that \u201ceverybody knows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that I don\u2019t write no numbers\u201d; and that \u201c[i]f I was going to play like the officer made a statement about 960 combination, why would I put five numbers down and put the whole six, wouldn\u2019t have to; give it to a number writer and just say, give me 96 for a combination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It is, of course, elementary that a warrantless arrest is valid where the arresting police officer has probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor has been or is being committed in his presence and that the arrestee is the misdemeanant. <em>Winebrenner v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 440; <em>Robinson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 515; <em>Salmon v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 513. In determining whether a misdemeanor has been committed in the officer\u2019s presence the term \u201cpresence\u201d denotes that the commission of the misdemeanor is perceptible to the officer\u2019s senses, whether they be visual, auditory, or olfactory. <em>Davids v. State, </em>208 Md. 377; <em>Ramsey v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 563. And in determining whether probable cause exists to justify the arrest, \u201conly the probability, and not a <em>prim,a facie </em>showing of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause.\u201d <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637, 645. More specifically, the rule of probable cause is a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify a conviction, but more evidence than would arouse a mere suspicion. <em>Edwardsen v. State, </em>243 Md. 131; <em>Radcliffe v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 285; <em>Cornish v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 167; <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We think it clear that Detective Spencer had probable cause at the time he arrested appellant to believe that he was committing a misdemeanor in his presence or view, <em>viz., </em>that he was writing and in possession of a non-conventional lottery slip or record in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 362. Spencer was an experienced Vice Squad detective familiar with illicit lottery operations. The expertise of the arresting officer in lottery cases is an important factor in assessing the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>istence of probable cause. <em>Spriggs v. State, </em>226 Md. 50; <em>LeFaivre v. State, </em>208 Md. 52; <em>Chernock v. State, </em>203 Md. 147. Spencer\u2019s observations were made in a poolroom in a depressed neighborhood \u2014 a typical place where lottery slips are often made and exchanged. Appellant was standing near a bank of phones useful in the transmission of lottery information. Most importantly, Spencer actually observed appellant writing a sequence of three-digit numbers of the kind used in conventional lottery operations on a brown paper bag in such an order as appeared to represent the various combinations of a single three-digit number. It is well known that such combinations represent a particular way of betting a three-digit number such that the occurrence of any of these combinations as the day\u2019s \u201cnumber\u201d renders the player of that combination the winner of a sum of money. The probability of criminal activity being the measure of probable cause, <em>Spinelli v. United States, supra, </em>Detective Spencer could have reasonably believed that appellant was a numbers writer or runner who, after receiving a request from a player to \u201ccomb\u00ednate 960,\u201d wrote out the possible combinations to avoid missing a \u201chit,\u201d <em>Le., </em>the play of a winning number on which payment would have to be made. In any event, as a prohibited lottery slip includes, in our opinion, any writing of such three-digit numbers on any piece of paper, including, as here, a paper bag, where the purpose is to use it in an illicit lottery, we find on the facts and circumstances of this case that the arrest was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Appellant\u2019s arrest being legal, Detective Spencer was authorized to conduct incident thereto a search of appellant\u2019s person for evidence of the crime and for weapons. <em>Boddie v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 523; <em>Harris v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 7. When, in the lawful course of that search, Spencer discovered the cache of narcotics in appellant\u2019s pocket, he was entitled to seize them, it being well settled that if the circumstances make an arrest lawful for one crime, there may be a reasonable seizure of items in the possession of the arrestee, and a conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>quent right to use the items so seized as evidence to convict for a crime different from that which justified the arrest. See <em>Gamble v. </em>State, 2 Md. App. 271, and cases cited at page 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
