Hackett Turner, Jr., sitting in the Circuit Court for Caroline County, denying Post Conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The record indicates that subsequent to the hearing upon applicant\u2019s petition, Judge Turner granted the State\u2019s motion for an additional hearing at which Chief Judge J. DeWeese Carter, who presided at applicant\u2019s original trial on charges of storehouse breaking, was permitted to testify in rebuttal to certain testimony given by applicant\u2019s witnesses at the original Post Conviction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In this application for leave to appeal, it is contended: (1) that permitting Judge Carter to testify was a \u201cviolation of the spirit of Md. Rule BK44 c;\u201d (2) that it was error \u201cto allow additional testimony to be taken;\u201d and (3) that \u201cit was clearly erroneous for the trial court to find petitioner\u2019s counsel at his original trial to be competent.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">While it is true that Md. Rule BK44 c provides that a Post Conviction hearing shall not be conducted by the \u201cjudge who sat at the trial at which petitioner was convicted,\u201d without petitioner\u2019s consent, it is clear from the record before us that Judge Turner, not Judge Carter, presided at the hearing. Judge Carter\u2019s only participation in the hearing was in the role of a witness and his testimony consisted simply in denying that he had told the family of the applicant, as they had testified at the first hearing, that they need not appear at the original trial of the applicant since \u201cthere was nothing much against petitioner and that he would soon be home.\u201d In our opinion, neither the letter nor the spirit of Md. Rule BK44 c was violated. See <em>Snyder v. Warden, </em>227 Md. 644, <em>cert. den., </em>368 U.S. 1001; <em>Taylor v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Nor was there error in permitting Judge Carter to review the transcript of testimony at the first hearing or in permitting the State to have an additional hearing in order to adduce Judge Carter\u2019s testimony, notwithstanding, as alleged in the application, Judge Carter might have been called by the State at the original hearing since he \u201cwas in his chambers not more than twenty (20) feet from where Defendant\u2019s counsel sat during the hearing * * These were matters within the sound discretion of the hearing judge and since it was apparently done to promote the ends of justice, (see Md. Rule BK44 d) we see no abuse of the hearing judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">As to the third contention, we cannot say, after reviewing the reasons advanced by Judge Turner in his Supplemental Memorandum, that he was clearly erroneous in finding no merit in applicant\u2019s contention that his trial attorney was incompetent. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
