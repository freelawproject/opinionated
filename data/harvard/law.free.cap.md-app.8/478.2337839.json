The State, in answer to appellant\u2019s motion, declined to provide such a list, but stated that defense counsel could inspect all such physical evidence by contacting designated police officers. The appellant excepted to the sufficiency of the State\u2019s answer, a hearing was held, and the court overruled appellant\u2019s exceptions. He then appealed to this court from that order. The State moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was taken from a pretrial interlocutory order and, hence, was not immediately appealable, a position with which we agree for reasons set forth in detail in <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 468 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; costs to be paid by appellant; the mandate of this court to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
