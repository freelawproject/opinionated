Nor would it appear that he had the benefit of any testimony from applicant\u2019s trial counsel, testimony that would appear to be particularly enlightening under the circumstances of this case. While we have held that a guilty plea, knowingly and intelligently made, stands for a conviction of the highest order, <em>Kitonis v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 110, 113, the <em>sina qua non </em>to such conviction is a convincing demonstration that the guilty plea was knowingly and intelligently entered. As we stated in <em>Silverberg v. Warden, </em>7 Md. App. 657, 662: \u201cMaryland has long followed the rule that there is reversible error where the record does not disclose that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly entered his guilty plea. <em>Edwards v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 327.\u201d Since it would appear that the record before the hearing judge was not adequate to permit him to make a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tion whether the applicant\u2019s pleas were knowingly and intelligently entered at the time of his trial, we shall grant the application for leave to appeal and remand the case in order that such a determination may be made upon a proper record.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\n<em>Application granted; case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
