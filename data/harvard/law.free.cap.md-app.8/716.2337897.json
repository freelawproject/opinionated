Each presents the same arguments in support of the contention: (1) neither had a clear recollection of the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime; and (2) the court failed to inform either fully of the constitutional right against self-incrimination and the right of cross-examination of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">We had occasion to review the requirements of an effective acceptance of a plea of guilty in <em>Holloway v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 618 (1970). We found that the record must show that the plea of guilty was entered by an accused:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">(1) voluntarily; and</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">(2) with an intelligent understanding:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">(a) of the nature of the offense; and</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">(b) of the possible consequences of the plea; and</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">(3) unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">Here the court thoroughly canvassed the matter with each accused. See <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>89 S. Ct. 1709; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Silverberg v. Warden, </em>7 Md. App. 657. We find that the record affirmatively shows that the plea was voluntary as not entered by reason of coercion, terror, inducements, or subtle or blatant threats, that it was made with an intelligent understanding of its possible consequences, and that it was not conditional. Appellants argue, however, that they did not enter the'pleas with an intelligent understanding of the nature of larceny because their explanation of the facts and circumstances of the commission of the offense \u201cwas somewhat contradictory of that plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Upon inquiry by the court Obey gave his version of the facts and circumstances surrounding the events leading to his arrest. He said that he and Miss Thompson had come directly from a night club in New York to Elk-ton to get married. \u201cWe had been out all night and we were sitting in a tavern around here, waiting for the bus to come and about 6:30 we left the tavern to go across the street where the bus was,\u201d according to information they had received. It appeared that the bus usually stopped in front of the Colonial Jewelry Store. The door providing actual entrance to the store was set back from the street, so that there was a display window fronting on the street and also on the side approaching the entrance door. It was cold so they waited for the bus beside the window in the area leading to the entrance door. As they were awaiting the bus the side window got broken, although he did not remember how \u2014 \u201cI know it got broken.\u201d He did remember picking rings off the ground but did not remember whether or not he took rings out of the window; \u201cI was slightly intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Colleen Thompson said they went to wait for the bus as Obey had recounted. Only the two of them were present when the window broke. At first she said Obey had not broken the window \u201cintentionally,\u201d but when asked, \u201cHow did he come to break it?\u201d, she said that she did not know, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember.\u201d She said that she picked the rings off the ground and they were in her hand when she was arrested; Obey had none in his pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>session. Called upon for further explanation, Obey then said that he did not remember whether he picked any rings up or not. They left the scene, going down the block. They saw the bus drive away and he went into a tavern to make a telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">It appeared that the bus driver saw Obey with his hand in the window \u201cshuffling around the glass\u201d and saw Colleen Thompson run toward the bus trying to wave it down.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">From a statement Obey gave the police <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it seemed that while they were waiting in the doorway of the jewelry store he remarked, \u201cLook, the window is broke.\u201d He saw \u201ca couple of rings laying on the ground and I picked them up and I handed them to her and I was getting ready to go further into the window. My fiancee said here comes the bus, and all of a sudden the glass shattered and the alarm started ringing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I panicked and I started running. I left her there, I had one ring on my pinky. I ran in a back yard and the ring fell off, I ripped my pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Eight rings of a total value of $166.50 were found in the possession of Colleen Thompson. She complained about \u201ctaking cheap rings,\u201d interpreted by the State\u2019s Attorney from the gist of her remarks that she was mad because he didn\u2019t get a big haul and that they were in trouble about \u201csomething small.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">It was brought out by defense counsel that Obey had an I. Q. of 145, and that he was employed by the New York Life Insurance Company as a computer programmer. Colleen Thompson \u201cis by birth from the West Indies\u201d and was four months pregnant with \u201cchild of Obey.\u201d The State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the remaining counts in each criminal information. The court then accepted each plea of guilty to grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>We find that the acceptance of the plea of guilty as to each defendant was proper and effective. It does not necessarily follow that because they alleged they did not have a clear recollection of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, that they did not have an intelligent understanding of the nature of the offense to which they pleaded guilty. In any event, the acts they did recall were sufficient to constitute grand larceny \u2014 a wrongful taking of the personal property of another of the value of $100 or more with intent to deprive the person entitled thereto of his ownership therein, <em>Robinson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 515 \u2014 particularly in the light of the evidence available to the State as was laid before them and the court. They now suggest that the court was obliged to pursue the intimation that they were intoxicated, relying on <em>Wayne v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 424. Obey said they had been drinking. But he also said that he was only \u201cslightly intoxicated\u201d and the testimony as to the actions of each of them belied that either was intoxicated to a significant degree. We do not believe that, in the circumstances, the court was obliged to conduct further inquiry on the degree of intoxication of either of them, neither with regard to the general intent required for criminal conduct nor the specific intent required for larceny. See <em>Parker v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 167; <em>Clarke v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 447; <em>Michael v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 243. <em>Wayne, </em>in which the defendant said he was pleading guilty because he was insane, is patently not apposite.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The contention that the court failed to inform the appellants fully of the right against self-incrimination and the right of cross-examination of witnesses is without merit. Its recitation of their rights included the right to trial, either by jury or the court \u201cwith the right to be confronted by the witnesses who would be here to accuse you;\u201d of the presumption of innocence at trial; of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>right not to testify; of the absence of any implication of guilt if they desired not to testify. They said they understood each of these rights. What the court told them was sufficient for them to understand that they had the right against self-incrimination and the right of cross-examination of witnesses appearing against them on trial. No specific ritual is required. See <em>Church v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We hold, as to each appellant, that there was no error in the acceptance of the plea of guilty. Compare <em>Holloway v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-16\">. The briefs give the name as \u201cColette Evette Thompson.\u201d It appears in the criminal information and throughout the record as \u201cColleen Evette Thompson.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"><em>. </em>Obey expressly stated that the fact a statement had been given by him to the police had nothing to do with his entering a plea of guilty. Each defendant specifically waived, in open court, any evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the confession was freely and voluntarily made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\">. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s impression was that after the original breaking and while the window was being looted, the glass remaining in the window shattered, setting off the alarm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. Each appellant here said, \u201cYes,\u201d in answer to the court\u2019s question, \u201cYou are pleading guilty because in truth and in fact you are guilty and for no other reason, is that correct?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
