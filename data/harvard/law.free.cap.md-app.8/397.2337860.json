Howard in the Criminal Court of Baltimore denying relief sought by applicant in his first petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. The application is granted and the matter remanded for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Judge Howard summarized the ease to this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cPetitioner, Alexander Payne, was convicted of second-degree murder (Indictment No. 5067/ 1967) by Judge Albert L. Sklar on January 9, 1968 and sentenced to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am5I\">\u201cAn appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was filed on January 10,1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201cA denial of an application for review of sentence was filed by the Review Panel on May 24, 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">\u201cThe judgment was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals on January 30, 1969, in an unreported opinion (Alexander Payne v. State of Maryland, No. 195, Sept. Term, 1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\u201cThis post-conviction petition was filed on May 20, 1969, and a hearing was held before this Court on August 25,1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201cThe petitioner has raised the following contentions :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">\u201cHis court-appointed attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">\u201c(a) failed to file a petition for a writ of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">certiorari from the Court of Appeals of Maryland. . .\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">As to contention (a) the hearing judge found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">\u201cTrial counsel for the petitioner, Michael Kaplan, Esq., testified that he filed an appeal for Payne on January 10, 1968, the day after he was convicted. He did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Court of Appeals because the petitioner, in response to a letter written by Kaplan informing him of the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, informed Kaplan that he was being fired and that his services were no longer wanted by the petitioner. The Court feels that trial counsel did all that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>required of him in this regard; this contention is therefore denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We do not think this finding adequately disposed of the contention. Maryland Rule 719 b 7 (b) (Effective September 1,1967), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u201cWhere counsel has been appointed to represent an indigent appellant or appellee on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals the authority and duty of such counsel shall continue from the date of such appointment until the expiration of the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Special Appeals. Counsel shall be obliged to advise the indigent appellant or appellee concerning his right to apply for certiorari and, if directed by the accused, shall assist in the preparation of a petition for certiorari and shall file same over the signature of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The docket entries show that appellate counsel was appointed by the court. We do not think appointed counsel\u2019s duty under this rule is affected by his \u201cfiring\u201d by an appellant. Since the hearing judge made no findings as to whether or not counsel advised applicant of his rights to file a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>we grant the application for appeal and remand the case for further findings as outlined in <em>Scott v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 200, 251 A. 2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Since it is possible applicant will be granted a belated writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the Court of Appeals, we do not consider the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\n<em>Application granted and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\">. This contention is not entirely clear from the original petition, but we assume the issue was clarified at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
