Volunteers not having been obtained, that number amongst whom was the plaintiff, were drafted; these men were mustered into service in April and discharged in June 1865. By an Act, passed March 10th 1865, the road commissioners of any township in Erie county were authorized \u201c to pay a bounty not exceeding $300 to any man who may be drafted and held to service, or who shall furnish an acceptable substitute, and levy taxes'therefor.\u201d The general Act of March 15th 1865 authorizes a bounty to be paid \u201c to any person, drafted into the service of the United States and serving therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-12\">On the trial before Vincent, J., the plaintiff gave the order in evidence and proved that it had been presented for payment about January 1st 1867 to the township treasurer, who declined to pay it, saying, that he had no money. Baldwin, one of the commissioners, testified that he had signed the order; that they had meetings to decide the bounty question and decided to give $200 to each man; the meetings were in June and in the fall of 1865; that the order in suit was given under that decision; that the orders were delivered to their clerk to hold till further action, they having heard that the law had been decided unconstitutional. There was other evidence of the same character. The road commissioners, in March 1867, adopted resolutions rescinding those for payment of the orders to drafted men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-13\">There were a number of points submitted' by the defendant, which it is not important to state, relating mainly to the validity of the Acts of Assembly above referred to.

F. Smith 432, that the decided cases were those of volunteers, and not of drafted men, and that the Act of 15th March 1865 leaves the payment of bounties to the latter wholly discretionary. The special act, relating to Erie county, of March 10th 1865, Pamph. L. 312, leaves it also discretionary. Neither is peremptory, and the road commissioners were therefore not required by the law to act under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In the present case no resolution was passed to pay bounties to drafted men, until after the close of the war, and after the plaintiff had been discharged from service. It is clear there was no obligation, by statute or otherwise, to compel payment of a bounty to him \u2014 not even a moral obligation to support a promise. The service of a drafted soldier is not performed for the state, hut for the United States. It is not voluntary but compulsory under the demand of law. Unlike the case of a volunteer, who need not serve unless he choose, and who may therefore create a contract relation by his acceptance of an offered bounty, that of the drafted soldier rests alone on the performance of a strictly legal duty, which Congress had a right to demand of him. There was, therefore, not only no contract here, but no consideration to support a contract; and the order of the road commissioners on the treasurer was a mere gratuity, which it was competent for them to countermand, and which they did withdraw by their resolution rescinding and repealing their former resolution, before the money had been paid by the treasurer. Their warrant, like that of county commissioners, is hut an authority to the treasurer to pay the sum stated, and, if unsupported by a valid consideration, can be revoked. We are of opinion, therefore, that the learned judge below erred in suffering a recovery on the undisputed facts of the case, and the judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
