Between the 27th of November and the 16th of December 1867, C.

On the 21st of March 1868, R. Lamberton recovered against Lynch &amp; Brown a judgment for $1680. On the 23d of March, Lamberton issued an execution on his judgment. To this execution the sheriff returned that on the 26th of March he had levied on a lot of personal property (as per schedule annexed), and had in his hands as the proceeds of sale, after deducting costs, $608.97. Amongst the articles sold were a portable steam-engine and fixtures sold for $468; tubing and sucker-rods $105; lease $29'; \u201c carpenter\u2019s rig\u201d and irons $21.50, &amp;c., in all $632.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">On the 17th of April 1868 Robson &amp; Co. filed a claim against Lynch &amp; Brown for the articles sold by them as above stated, setting out that the defendants were tenants of a leased estate of lot No. 30 of the Curtin Oil Company, situate, &amp;c.; that they had erected on the lot certain improvements, an engine, machinery and fixtures, &amp;e., and averring that they were entitled to a lien under the Acts of Assembly, upon the interest of Lynch &amp; Brown in lot No. 30, and upon the improvements, \u25a0 engine, &amp;e., for the materials furnished by them. They then set forth the names of the respective parties, their own bill of materials in detail, and conclude:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">\u201c 3. The locality of said improvements, engine-pump, machinery, fixtures, engine-house and derrick is on said lot No. 30 (thirty) above mentioned, and they are the same usual and necessary on leases of oil territory, and the machinery and fixtures requisite in boring and operating oil-wells.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF52\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>November 1st 1869,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">On the 3d of June 1868 they issued a scire facias on their lien, on which they obtained judgment July 28th 1868, and on the 29th the prothonotary liquidated the damages at $781.81. The money made under Lamberton\u2019s execution was paid into court August 6th 1868, and George R. Snowden, Esq., was appointed auditor to make distribution. Amongst the claimants on the fund before the auditor were Lamberton claiming under his execution, and Robson &amp; Co. claiming under their lien for materials, under the Act of February 17th 1858, Pamph. L. 29, relative to mechanics\u2019 liens in Schuylkill and Luzerne counties, extended by the Act of April 11th 1866, Pamph. L. 649, to Yenango and other counties; and the Act of April 8th 1867, relating to mechanics\u2019 liens in Yenango county, Pamph. L. 752.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">The auditor reported that the claim of Robson &amp; Co. was not covered by the Act of 1866, and after deducting the expenses of audit awarded the whole found in court, $555.84, to Lamberton. Exceptions to the report were filed by Robson &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">The court confirmed the report. Robson &amp; Co. appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned the decree of confirmation for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>W. McNair, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1a\">referred to the Acts of 1858 and 1866; Esterley\u2019s Appeal, 4 P. F. Smith 192; Thomas <em>v. </em>Smith, 6 Wright 73; Street <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 W. &amp; S. 212.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-9\">There was no paper-book for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"AZa\">by Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHg4\">By the first section of the Act of 11th April 1866, it is enacted \u201c that the several provisions of \u2018 An act entitled An act relating to mechanics\u2019 liens, in the counties of Luzerne and Schuylkill,\u2019 approved the 17th day of February 1858, be and they are hereby extended to the counties of Erie, Crawford, Warren and Yenango. <em>Provided further, </em>that the provisions of said act shall be extended to and apply in like manner to parties furnishing propping timber, for mining purposes, who shall have remedy by lien on the personal property on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The Act of 1858 provided that, \u201c the several provisions of an act entitled \u2018 An act relating to the liens of mechanics and others upon buildings,\u2019 approved the 16th day of June 1836, and the several supplements thereto, are hereby extended to all improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens and fixtures, erected or put up by tenants of leased estates, on land of others, in the counties of Luzerne and Schuylkill, and to all mechanics, machinists and material-men, doing work or furnishing the articles or the materials therefor: <em>Provided, </em>that the lien hereby created shall extend only to the interest of the tenant or tenants, lessee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>or lessees therein, and to the improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens and fixtures erected, repaired or put (up) by the mechanics, machinists, persons or material-men entering liens thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The various supplements to the Act of 1836, which are to be found in Bright. Dig. 710, are extended by the Act of 1866 to the county of Yenango, and are to be considered in the application of the Act of 1858 as applied to mining for oil. Robson &amp; Co. furnished materials to Lynch &amp; Brown for use on the leasehold 'premises, and filed their claim as material-men to a lien upon the ipterest of Lynch &amp; Brown, the lessees, in lot No. 30, and upon the improvements, engine, pump, machinery and fixtures thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In filing their claim for materials and work, Robson &amp; Co. say: \u201c Third. The locality of said improvements, engine, pump, machinery, fixtures, engine-house and derrick is on said lot No. 30 (thirty), above mentioned, and they are the same usual and necessary on leases of oil territory, and the machinery and fixtures requisite in boring and operating oil-wells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The balance of the sheriff\u2019s sale remaining in court, according to the auditor\u2019s report, was $555.84, and the question is, shall it go to the plaintiff in the execution, or to the material-men ? Their bill is $759.04, and from an examination of it, nearly the whole of it must have gone into the machinery, fixtures, engine-house and derrick of the oil-well, and if so they have a lien on the premises \u2014 a cart-load of bricks furnished to a building gives a lien, and yet each brick is separate, and to be separately put in place. In the sale the portable engine1 and fixtures brought $468, and is by name covered by the lien ; so one string of tubing and sucker-rods, clearly a part of the machinery, brought $105, the two sums overbalancing the sum in court, and covered by Robson &amp; Co.\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Upon a fair construction of the law, it is therefore clear that the balance in court belongs to the appellants, and not to the plaintiff in the execution, who had no lien under the Act of 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The decree is reversed, and it is ordered, decreed and adjudged that the balance in court, amounting to $555.84, be paid to the appellants, Charles Robson &amp; Co. Appellee to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
