Young, be disbarred. We order the respondent disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The PCC found the following facts. On August 30, 1998, J.L. was employed by Developmental Services of Sullivan County, Inc. (DSSC) as a caregiver for DSSC\u2019s patients. While J.L. was working that evening at DSSC, a developmentally disabled patient physically and sexually assaulted her. She sued DSSC and other defendants to recover for injuries resulting from the assault. The respondent represented J.L. in her suit, and filed a writ in the superior court on September 28, 1998, alleging the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Shortly after she began her shift, at 5 p.m., [J.L.] was violently raped by [a DSSC patient]. [The patient] pinned [J.L.] to a couch, and assaulted her by biting, licking and touching her on her face, breast and arms. He pulled his pants down and put his hand inside [J.L.\u2019s] shorts. He digitally fondled her. [The patient] punched, hit and bit [J.L.], and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her by twisting her wrist and pinning her arms behind her, then by forcing his weight upon her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The respondent also represented J.L. in related workers\u2019 compensation and whistleblower\u2019s claims. In December 1999, DSSC settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim for $85,000. DSSC disbursed the settlement to the respondent in two installments: a payment of $15,000 on December 23, 1999, and a payment of $70,000 on January 11, 2000. The respondent deposited the $15,000 disbursement into his law office operating account as \u201cfees earned\u201d and deposited the $70,000 disbursement into a trust account at Claremont Savings Bank (Trust Account).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>As of January 12, 2000, the Trust Account carried a balance of $70,400. Of that amount, the defendant held $70,000 in trust for J.L. On January 16, the respondent disbursed $54,116.99 from the Trust Account to one of his other clients, leaving less money in the account than was owed to J.L. On January 18, the Trust Account received a deposit of $78,000. On that same day, the respondent wrote a check to J.L. for $17,300 and wrote \u201cfull settlement\u201d on the check. Considering the $17,300 disbursement, as well as an advance given to J.L. and additional fees, the respondent still held $41,500 in trust for J.L. on January 18. As of March 13, the respondent had made no further disbursement to J.L. On that date, he transferred $40,000 from the Trust Account into two of his operating accounts, leaving a balance of $1,975.56 in the Trust Account. The respondent had one other trust account, an IOLTA account at Fleet Bank, but this account carried a total balance of only $100.94 from March 12 through March 31. On April 3, the respondent transferred $3,500 from one of his operating accounts to his Fleet IOLTA account and marked the $3,500 as a refund to J.L. for unneeded legal fees and expert witness fees, thus increasing the total money owed to her to $45,000. On April 13, the respondent transferred $30,800 from one of his operating accounts into his Fleet IOLTA account. He then wrote J.L. two checks from the Fleet IOLTA account: one for $35,000 and another for $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">At approximately the same time that the respondent disbursed the $45,000 to J.L., she terminated her attorney-client relationship with the respondent. She subsequently hired David Cole and James Mulligan as co-counsel and filed a PCC complaint against the respondent. Approximately one year later, in April 2001, the respondent informed Mulligan that he intended to pursue a lien in the amount of $45,000 against J.L. Mulligan repeatedly requested documentation, such as invoices, to support the lien claim, but the respondent failed to supply such documentation. In a letter dated November 21, 2001, addressed to Mulligan, the respondent stated that he also intended to file a lawsuit against J.L. based upon \u201cher knowing and willful participation in a fraud.\u201d The letter alleged that J.L. had fabricated the sexual nature of the assault that occurred at DSSC. The letter stated that J.L. did not tell her supervisor, Deborah Dow, her boyfriend, Chris Hohn, or multiple other people close to her about \u201cany sexual overtones of the [patient\u2019s] attack\u201d until she met with the respondent\u2019s former co-counsel, Kenneth Gordon. Gordon and J.L. had met privately in late September 1998, a few days before the respondent filed the writ in superior court alleging that J.L. suffered a sexual assault while working at DSSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In early December 2001, Mulligan filed a motion in superior court to determine the nature of the attorney\u2019s lien. The respondent filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>objection on December 14, in which he included allegations similar to those in his November 21 letter. Paragraph five of the objection stated, \u201cIt was only after a meeting attended only by [J.L.] and Gordon did the instance of sexual abuse come to light.\u201d Paragraph six implied that Gordon and J.L. fabricated the sexual nature of the assault: \u201cPrior to that meeting, [J.L.] had not told her good friend, Heather Bressette, Chris Hohn, her boyfriend and soon to be fianc\u00e9, Deborah Dow, and her therapist (until after her conversation with Gordon), about any instance of sexual abuse by a resident of DSSC, only physical abuse.\u201d The respondent and J.L. later settled the attorney\u2019s lien litigation. As part of this settlement, the respondent signed a sworn affidavit, which stated, in part, that the respondent never found that J.L. was not truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">As a result of the respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud, DSSC filed a motion in superior court to rescind its settlement with J.L. The Superior Court <em>[Morrill, </em>J.) allowed for discovery and subsequently denied DSSC\u2019s motion. In its decision, the court relied in part upon a deposition given by Dow during the litigation against DSSC in which she stated that J.L. generally described the assault soon after it occurred, and that, within three days from the time of the assault on August 30,1998, J.L. told Dow that the patient had digitally penetrated her vagina. The trial court found that, because the respondent was aware of Dow\u2019s deposition, he knew that J.L. told Dow about the sexual nature of the assault well before the September 1998 meeting between J.L. and Gordon. The trial court also found that it was reasonable for J.L. to have not told her boyfriend or other people about the details of the assault. Accordingly, the trial court found that the respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud in the December 14 objection were misleading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">I believe that Attorney Young\u2019s representation in paragraph 5 is either intentionally or accidentally misleading, but the suggest <em>[sic] </em>it raises is not supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">... Attorney Young\u2019s representation in paragraph 6 of his objection with respect to Deborah Dow misrepresents what he actually believed and knew to be the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">On March 10, 2005, the New Hampshire Supreme Court Attorney Discipline Office brought eight disciplinary charges against the respondent, alleging violations of the New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct (Conduct Rules) and the Supreme Court Rules. The respondent stipulated to three charges, and disciplinary counsel conceded that there was insufficient evidence to support a fourth. The first stipulated charge was failure to safeguard client property in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(1) and Supreme Court Rule 50(2)(C). Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(1) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Property of clients or third persons which a lawyer is holding in the lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation shall be held separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be deposited in one or more clearly designated trust accounts in accordance with the provisions of the New Hampshire Supreme Court Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Supreme Court Rule 50(2)(C) states: \u201cOnly those retainer fees, that are refundable if not earned, and as to which the attorney has so informed the client, shall be deposited in the trust account(s) described above. These shall not be withdrawn from the account of the attorney or firm organization until earned.\u201d The respondent stipulated that he was consistently out of trust with J.L.\u2019s proceeds from the workers\u2019 compensation settlement. He further stipulated that he withdrew money from the Trust Account that belonged to J.L. and used that money for his own benefit and for the benefit of another client. Also, the respondent stipulated to transferring J.L.\u2019s funds to himself prior to earning those funds and without proper authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The second stipulated charge was failure to maintain proper records in violation of Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(2) and Supreme Court Rules 50(2)(A) and 50(2)(F). Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(2) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">Records shall be maintained by the lawyer of the handling, maintenance and disposition of all funds and other property of the client at any time in the lawyer\u2019s possession from the time of receipt to the time of final distribution____The lawyer shall maintain the minimum financial records specified in the New Hampshire Supreme Court Rules____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Supreme Court Rule 50(2)(A) requires handling of client funds similar to that required by Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(2), and also requires that the attorney or firm maintain \u201ca ledger or system showing all receipts and disbursements from the trust account or accounts with appropriate entries identifying the source of the receipts and the nature of the disbursement ----\u201d Supreme Court Rule 50(2)(F) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">Each bank account required by Rule 50 ... shall be reconciled by the lawyer or law firm on a monthly basis. Such reconciliation shall disclose (a) the balance of the account according to the bank\u2019s records; (b) the balance of the account according to the lawyer or law firm\u2019s records; (c) a detailed listing of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>differences between items (a) and (b); (d) a listing of all clients\u2019 funds in the accounts as of the reconciliation date; and (e) a detailed listing of all differences between items (b) and (d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The respondent stipulated that, on March 13, 2000, when he transferred $40,000 from the Trust Account into two of his operating accounts, he did so because he relied upon what he called a \u201cfalse surplus,\u201d meaning that he thought that he had more money in the Trust Account than he actually did. The respondent thus stipulated that he failed to properly reconcile his trust account bank statements with his ledger on a monthly basis and failed to properly maintain his trust accounting system. The stipulation, and the respondent\u2019s argument on appeal, include the respondent\u2019s assertion that his mishandling of J.L.\u2019s money occurred for two reasons: (1) because his bookkeeper, Stacia Yonce, presented him with a false statement regarding the amount of money in the Trust Account; and (2) because he was often out of his office during the fall and winter of 1999 to 2000 due to his work on a political campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The third stipulated charge was a violation of Conduct Rule 8.4(a). Rule 8.4(a) states, in pertinent part, that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Conduct Rules. Because the respondent stipulated to violating other Conduct Rules, he also violated Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The remaining four charges alleged violations of Conduct Rules 8.4(c), 3.3(a)(1) and 3.3(a)(3) based upon the respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud against J.L. in his November 21 letter and his December 14 objection to Mulligan\u2019s motion to determine attorney\u2019s lien. A hearing panel held a hearing on the merits of the alleged violations. One of the respondent\u2019s main arguments was that the terms \u201csexual overtones\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d that he used in the letter and the objection were not intentionally misleading because he used those terms in a specific manner. Those phrases referred only to digital penetration, not to the general sexual nature of the assault as evidenced by conduct such as the patient pulling his pants down, touching J.L.\u2019s breasts, or putting his hand up her shorts. This distinction should not have escaped Mulligan or the trial court, the respondent argued, because both were aware of documents and deposition testimony adduced in the DSSC litigation stating that conduct that appears sexual to the average person might not be intentionally sexual if committed by a mentally handicapped person. Intentional sexual conduct by a mentally handicapped person requires an overt act, such as penetration, the respondent argued. Accordingly, the respondent asserted that the letter and the objection questioned only whether J.L. fabricated the digital penetration aspect of her claim, and the recipients of the letter and the objection should have recognized this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Not persuaded by the respondent\u2019s argument, the hearing panel found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation and dishonesty in his November 21 letter in violation of Conduct Rule 8.4(c), which provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The hearing panel also found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent intentionally made false statements of material fact in his December 14 objection in violation of Conduct Rules 8.4(c), 3.3(a)(1) and 3.3(a)(3). Rule 3.3(a)(1) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201cmake a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\u201d Rule 3.3(a)(3) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201coffer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">After determining the respondent\u2019s violations, the hearing panel held a sanctions hearing. At that hearing, the respondent notified the healing panel that he intended to call Judge Morrill as a witness. Disciplinary counsel objected to Judge Morrill testifying to the merits of whether the respondent misled the court, but stated that there was no objection to Judge Morrill testifying as a character witness for the respondent. The healing panel ruled that Judge Morrill could both testify as a character witness and testify to the specific issue of why he did not file a professional conduct complaint against the respondent. Judge Morrill subsequently testified that the alleged misrepresentations made by the respondent in his December 14 objection were \u201cprobably an exaggeration, probably careless, but I didn\u2019t find it [to] rise to the level of something I would report.\u201d After the sanctions hearing, the hearing panel recommended that the respondent be suspended for two years. The hearing panel stated that it would normally agree with disciplinary counsel\u2019s recommendation of disbarment; however, the hearing panel stated that the respondent still can make positive contributions to the Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In its petition to this court, the PCC reviewed the hearing panel\u2019s reports and agreed with the findings of violations. The PCC disagreed with the hearing panel\u2019s admission of Judge Morrill\u2019s testimony, however, concluding that the testimony was inadmissible under the deliberative process privilege. The PCC also disagreed with the hearing panel\u2019s recommended sanction and petitioned this court to disbar the respondent. The PCC found that the respondent knew that the facts asserted in his November 21 letter and December 14 objection were false when he wrote them.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In response to the PCC\u2019s petition, the respondent first argues that the PCC erred when it found that there was clear and convincing evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>he engaged in misrepresentation in his November 21 letter and in his December 14 objection. Next, he argues that the hearing panel violated his due process rights by adding a charge against him without first giving him notice and an opportunity to be heard on that charge. Third, he argues that the PCC wrongfully excluded Judge Morrill\u2019s testimony. Finally, he argues that, even if this court sustains all factual findings made by the PCC, disbarment is not the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\n<em>I. Misrepresentations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The respondent argues that his November 21 letter did not contain misrepresentations or dishonesty in violation of Conduct Rule 8.4(c), and that his December 14 objection did not contain intentionally false statements of material fact in violation of Conduct Rules 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(2), and 8.4(c). Neither the letter nor the objection were dishonest, he argues, due to the distinction between a sexual assault committed by an average person and a sexual assault committed by a mentally handicapped person. He contends that when he stated that J.L. never informed anyone, including Deborah Dow, about the \u201csexual overtones\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d in the assault until after the meeting with Gordon, he referred only to the overtly sexual act of digital penetration. Accordingly, the respondent argues that the PCC erred in finding that these statements were misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The PCC\u2019s findings of violations of the Conduct Rules must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. SUP. Ct. R. 37A, 111(d)(2)(C). In attorney discipline matters, we defer to the PCC\u2019s factual findings if supported by the record, but retain \u201cultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. 710,714 (2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The PCC found that in the November 21 letter, the respondent falsely stated that J.L. did not inform Dow of the sexual overtones of the attack until after speaking with Gordon. The PCC also found that multiple statements in the respondent\u2019s December 14 objection were false, including: (1) that the instance of sexual abuse came to light only after a meeting attended only by J.L. and Gordon; and (2) that J.L. did not tell Dow about the sexual abuse until after' speaking with Gordon. The PCC found that the respondent knew that his statements in both the letter and objection were false when he wrote them.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The record supports the PCC\u2019s findings. Even if the respondent truly intended terms like \u201csexual overtones\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d to refer only to digital penetration, the record contains Dow\u2019s testimony that J.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>told her in early September 1998 that the patient had digitally penetrated J.L. In his order on DSSC\u2019s motion to rescind, Judge Morrill also found that J.L. told Dow about the digital penetration shortly after the incident. The record is clear that the respondent was aware of Dow\u2019s testimony when he wrote the letter and the objection, which supports the finding that the respondent knew that his statements were false when he wrote them. We conclude that the record supports the PCC\u2019s findings that the respondent violated Conduct Rules 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(3) and 8.4(c) by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>II. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Although the hearing panel found violations based upon his misrepresentation and dishonesty, the respondent argues that the panel\u2019s true concern was its finding that he threatened J.L., and that the hearing panel gave improper weight to that finding when determining what rules he violated and what sanctions he should receive. Because the notice of charges did not charge him with threatening a former client, the respondent argues that he was given no notice that the hearing panel would consider such conduct, and, thus, he was denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We disagree with the respondent\u2019s interpretation of the hearing panel\u2019s decision. Our reading of the decision reveals that the hearing panel consistently focused upon the respondent\u2019s misrepresentations. The respondent quotes in part the hearing panel\u2019s statement that the November 21 letter \u201cwas intended by the Respondent to threaten [J.L.],\u201d and cites this as support for his argument that the hearing panel improperly focused upon the threatening nature of the letter. The respondent fails to quote, however, the remainder of that sentence, which continues by stating, \u201cand it did contain material misrepresentations, most notably in paragraph 3.\u201d The respondent also fails to consider other language in the hearing panel\u2019s findings and in its sanctions report that demonstrate its focus upon the respondent\u2019s misrepresentations and dishonesty. In its findings, the hearing panel stated, \u201cWe specifically find \u2014 by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 that Respondent did engage in conduct involving misrepresentation and dishonesty in his letter to James Mulligan, Esquire of November 21, 2001 ____This is a violation of Rule 8.4(c).\u201d The hearing panel made a similar finding regarding the December 14 objection. In its sanctions report, after stating the recommended sanctions for the mismanagement of J.L.\u2019s money, the hearing panel stated, \u201cHis other violations for dishonesty, misrepresentation and false statement are viewed as far more serious by the Panel.\u201d These statements make clear that the hearing panel based neither its findings of violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>nor its sanctions upon the uncharged conduct of threatening a former client. Thus, we find no basis for the respondent\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\n<em>III. Exclusion of Judge Morrill\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The respondent argues that the PCC erred in ruling that Judge Morrill\u2019s testimony from the sanctions hearing was inadmissible under the deliberative process privilege because the authority to rule on the admissibility of evidence is not among the powers granted to the PCC under the Supreme Court Rules. That authority belongs instead to the hearing panel, the respondent argues, and the PCC does not have the authority to reverse the hearing panel\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">For the purposes of our sanctions review, we will assume without deciding that the PCC improperly excluded Judge Morrill\u2019s testimony. As we have the entire record before us, we will consider Judge Morrill\u2019s testimony in making our final determination of the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>TV. Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The respondent argues that disbarment is not the appropriate sanction. He suggests that an admonition or reprimand is the appropriate sanction for his violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">As stated above, we retain \u201cthe ultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, 152 </em>N.H. at 714 (quotation omitted). In determining a sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of attorney discipline is not to inflict punishment, but rather \u201cto protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Richmond\u2019s Case, 152 </em>N.H. 155, 159-60 (2005). We judge each attorney discipline case on its own facts and circumstances, taking into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating circumstances appearing in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 160. \u201cThe gravity of unprofessional conduct is not determined solely by the number of rules broken or by the particular rules violated, but is determined largely with reference to the attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>Morgan\u2019s Case, </em>148 N.H. 475, 477 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Although we have not adopted the ABA\u2019s STANDARDS FOR IMPOSING Lawyer Sanctions (1992) (Standards), we look to them for guidance. <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, 152 </em>N.H. at 714. The Standards list the following factors for consideration in imposing sanctions: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors. Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3.0; <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, 152 </em>N.H. at 714. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>applying these factors, the first step is to categorize the respondent\u2019s misconduct and identify the appropriate sanction. <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 714. We then consider the effect of any aggravating or mitigating factors on the ultimate sanction. <em>Richmond\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The respondent\u2019s misconduct falls into two main categories: his failure to safeguard his client\u2019s property and maintain proper financial records, and his intentional misrepresentations. We begin by considering the intentional misrepresentations and false statements of material fact that the respondent made in the November 21 letter and the December 14 objection. As stated above, the record supports the PCC\u2019s finding that the respondent violated Conduct Rules 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(3) and 8.4(c). The Standards state that \u201c[d]isbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, with the intent to deceive the court, makes a false statement ... and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a party ....\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 6.11. The Standards state that \u201c[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer has not acted with intent to deceive the court ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6.12. The record supports the PCC\u2019s findings that the respondent intended to deceive the court in this case; thus, suspension is not appropriate under the Standards. The respondent\u2019s misleading statements also caused significant potential injury to his client, as his statements in the objection sparked a motion to rescind settlement by the DSSC. The false statements thus placed J.L.\u2019s $85,000 settlement award at risk, and fall within the type of conduct for which the STANDARDS recommend disbarment. As we have had to state too often, \u201cThe privilege of practicing law does not come without the concomitant responsibility of truth, candor and honesty. Because no single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie, attorney misconduct involving dishonesty justifies disbarment.\u201d <em>Cohen\u2019s Case, </em>143 N.H. 169, 172 (1998) (ellipses and brackets omitted). We note that the sanction of disbarment in this case is in accord with our prior decisions. <em>See, e.g., Basbanes\u2019 Case, </em>141 N.H. 1, 6-7 (1996) (disbarring a lawyer for intentionally misleading a marital master regarding the settlement in a related case).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">We next consider the effect of mitigating or aggravating factors with respect to this sanction. The PCC found no mitigating factors related to this sanction. As for aggravating factors, prior disciplinary offenses constitute an aggravating factor. <em>Wollerbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 716. The respondent has received three prior reprimands from the PCC. Multiple offenses are another aggravating factor. <em>Id. </em>at 717. In the instant case, the respondent has violated Conduct Rules 1.15(a)(1), 1.15(a)(2), 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(3), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c), and Supreme Court Rules 50(2)(A), 50(2)(C) and 50(2)(F). In the case of multiple charges of misconduct, the ABA recommends that the sanction imposed \u201cshould at least be consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the sanction for the most serious instance of misconduct among a number of violations; it might well be and generally should be greater than the sanction for the most serious misconduct.\u201d AMERICAN Bar ASSOCIATION, Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and STANDARDS 341 (1999 ed.); <em>see Richmond\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 160. Additionally, the PCC found that the respondent \u201cshowed no remorse at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Considering the above facts, the findings by both the hearing panel and the PCC, the arguments made by both parties, and the aggravating factors, we order the respondent disbarred based upon his violations of Conduct Rules 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(3) and 8.4(c). This sanction satisfies the goals of the attorney discipline system by protecting the public and preserving the integrity of the legal profession. We further order the respondent to reimburse the attorney discipline system for all expenses incurred in the investigation and enforcement of discipline in this case. SUP. Ct. R. 37(19). In light of our ruling, we need not determine what the appropriate sanction would be for the respondent\u2019s failure to safeguard his client\u2019s property and maintain proper financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
