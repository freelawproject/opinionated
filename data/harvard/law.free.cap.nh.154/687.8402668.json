We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The parties submitted a stipulation of facts for the purpose of resolving the coverage issue. It provided that the petitioner \u201cwas involved in an incident while within the scope of his employment\u201d driving a large truck. When an unidentified vehicle failed to yield the right of way to the petitioner, he was forced \u201cto jam on his brakes,\u201d which caused the straps holding a box saw in his truck to break and the saw to shift. The petitioner thought he had been struck by the vehicle behind him and stopped his truck. When he observed that the saw had shifted and was now leaning over the gate of the truck, he pulled the truck to the side of the road to reposition it. He then saw gasoline pouring from the saw onto the roadway. When he attempted to move the saw to resecure it, he suffered injuries for which he sought coverage under the uninsured motorist provision of his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The petitioner\u2019s policy provided that EIC \u201cwill pay compensatory damages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of \u2018an uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 ... caused by an accident.\u201d The sole issue before us is whether the petitioner suffered a bodily injury caused by an accident and hence was entitled to coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Our review in this case is limited to the interpretation and application of the petitioner\u2019s insurance contract. <em>See State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pitman, 148 </em>N.H. <em>499, 501 (2002). </em>The interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. EnergyNorth Natural Gas v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>146 N.H. 156, 159 (2001). We construe the language as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole. <em>Godbout v. Lloyd\u2019s Ins. Syndicates, </em>150 N.H. 103, 105 (2003). Policy terms are construed objectively; where the terms are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In this case, the trial court concluded that the petitioner was not injured as a result of an accident, but rather as the result of an intentional act by the insured that broke the chain of causation. We have previously held that \u201caccident\u201d is reasonably understood to mean \u201can undesigned contingency,... a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Marikar v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 395, 398 (2004). As EIC correctly states, the accident occurred in this case \u201cwhen the phantom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>vehicle allegedly failed to yield the right of way to Hartley causing him to jam on his brakes and cut to the left to avoid striking that vehicle.\u201d We then must determine whether the accident caused the injury for coverage purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 356 (unabridged ed. 2002) defines to \u201ccause\u201d as \u201cto serve as cause or occasion of: bring into existence: make.\u201d The parties have cited no cases and we have found none in which we have previously addressed whether the policy language \u201cinjury caused by an accident\u201d requires that the causal relationship between the accident and the injury must be a direct proximate cause. <em>See </em>8A L. Russ et al., COUCH ON INSURANCE 3D \u00a7 119:29, at 119-46 (Thomson/West 2005). In <em>Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 439 (1992), we were asked to determine whether insurance coverage existed where the policy provided that the injury \u201cmust result from\u201d the use of the uninsured motor vehicle. We noted that generally a causal connection must exist between the resulting harm and the use of the vehicle to invoke coverage. <em>Id. </em>Although proximate causation was not required to establish coverage under New Hampshire law, a tenuous connection was insufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In this case, the actions of the unidentified driver resulted in a series of events not naturally to be expected that brought into existence the plaintiff\u2019s injury. While the plaintiff did not observe the gasoline leaking from the saw until he had moved the truck to the side of the road, he concluded that it posed a continuing danger to the public that required his immediate attention. The shift in the saw\u2019s position was directly attributable to the actions of the unidentified driver. We conclude that the facts establish that the actions of the unidentified vehicle resulted in an accident that caused the injuries of the petitioner triggering coverage under the policy. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling to the contrary, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b715-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
