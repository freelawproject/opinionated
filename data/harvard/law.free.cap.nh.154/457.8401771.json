(GE), appeals the decision of the Superior Court <em>(Fitzgerald, </em>J.) granting motions filed by the defendant, New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (department), to dismiss for lack of standing and for summary judgment. We reverse the grant of the motion to dismiss and affirm the grant of the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The record supports the following facts. This case involves business profits taxes paid by GE from 1990 through 1999 (the tax years). GE is a New York corporation with its principal offices in Connecticut, and with a place of business in Somersworth, New Hampshire. GE is the parent corporation of numerous affiliated corporations both domestic and foreign. None of GE\u2019s foreign affiliates was domiciled in or transacted business within New Hampshire during the tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">During the tax years, GE transacted business within New Hampshire as a \u201cbusiness organization\u201d and was subject to the business profits tax (BPT). RSA 77-A.T, I (2003) (amended 2004), :2 (2003), :6, I (2003). GE paid the BPT during the tax years, but maintains that its tax liability was miscalculated resulting in overpayment. Specifically, GE challenges the constitutionality of RSA 77-A:4, IV (2003), which permits a parent corporation to take a deduction for dividends received from its corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>subsidiaries when the gross business profits of the subsidiaries have already been subject to tax in New Hampshire. The department denied GE\u2019s requests to use this deduction for dividends it received from its foreign subsidiaries, since they did not transact business in the state and therefore their gross business profits were not subject to tax in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">GE and the department executed two settlement agreements agreeing, among other things, that GE would receive a refund of approximately $3.15 million should the foreign dividend deduction issue be resolved in GE\u2019s favor. GE subsequently filed with the department requests for refunds and petitions for redetermination and reconsideration regarding its BPT returns. Because the department\u2019s hearings officer lacked the authority to determine the constitutionality of RSA 77-A:4, IV, GE petitioned the superior court for review pursuant to RSA 21-J:28-b, IV (2000) (amended 2003). GE moved for summary judgment and the department moved to dismiss and for summary judgment. The trial court granted the department\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that GE lacked standing to challenge RSA 77-A:4, IV. The trial court alternatively granted the department\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding that, even if GE had standing to challenge the statute, the deduction in RSA 77-A:4, IV does not discriminate against foreign commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We begin with a review of New Hampshire\u2019s BPT regime. Calculation of a business\u2019s tax liability requires an initial determination of whether the business is \u201cunitary\u201d within the meaning of RSA 77-A:l, XIV (2003). A \u201cunitary business\u201d is \u201cone or more related business organizations engaged in business activity both within and without this state among which there exists a unity of ownership, operation, and use; or an interdependence in their functions.\u201d RSA 77-A:l, XIV. Neither party disputes that GE and its subsidiaries operate as a unitary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The tax liability of a unitary business is calculated using a combined reporting method that apportions the income of the unitary business to the state. RSA 77-A:l, XIII, XV, XVI (2003). The income from all domestic members of the unitary business, which are collectively referred to as the \u201cwater\u2019s edge combined group,\u201d RSA 77-A:l, XV, is aggregated in the combined report. RSA 77-A:l, XVI. The income of foreign members of the unitary business is excluded from the combined report if the foreign members qualify as an \u201coverseas business organization!].\u201d RSA 77-A:l, XV. \u201cOverseas business organizations\u201d (OBOs) are those business organizations \u201cwith 80 percent or more of the average of their payroll and property assignable to a location outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\u201d RSA 77-A:l, XIX (2003). Although an OBO is not considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>part of the water\u2019s edge combined group, it may still qualify as a unitary member. RSA77-A:1, XIV, XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Once the net income from all members of the water\u2019s edge group is combined, any domestic \u201cintergroup activity\u201d such as the payment of dividends or royalties is excluded in determining the \u201cgross business profits\u201d of the group. N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Rev 302.10(b); <em>see </em>RSA 77-A:3, I (2003). The \u201cgross business profits\u201d are then apportioned to the state using three factors: property, payroll and sales. RSA 77~A:3, I. The resulting amount constitutes the \u201cNew Hampshire water\u2019s edge taxable business profits\u201d of the group. <em>See </em>RSA 77-A:l, IV, XV, XVI; N.H. Admin. RULES, Rev 301.02. In this calculation, the dividends of an OBO that are paid to a member of the water\u2019s edge combined group are initially excluded from the group\u2019s gross business profits and are apportioned separately to determine the \u201cNew Hampshire foreign dividends taxable business profits.\u201d RSA 77-A:3, 11(b) (2003); N.H. Admin. Rules, Rev 311.24(a), (f). The \u201cNew Hampshire foreign dividends taxable business profits\u201d are then added to the \u201cNew Hampshire water\u2019s edge taxable business profits\u201d to produce \u201cNew Hampshire taxable business profits.\u201d RSA 77-A:3, 11(b)(6). The applicable tax rate is then applied, resulting in the tax due. RSA 77-A:2 (2003). In this manner, dividends paid by a foreign member of the unitary group to domestic members are apportioned to New Hampshire and taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Pursuant to the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, GE and its domestic unitary affiliates are to be treated as one water\u2019s edge combined group within the meaning of RSA 77-A:l, XV. As such, the income of GE\u2019s foreign subsidiaries was excluded from the calculation of GE\u2019s tax liability for the tax years because each was an OBO within the meaning of RSA 77-A:l, XIX. However, pursuant to RSA 77-A:3, 11(b), the dividends paid to GE by its foreign subsidiaries remained subject to an apportioned tax. It is the inclusion of these foreign dividends in calculating GE\u2019s taxable business profits that GE contests in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">RSA 77-A:4, IV provides for the following deduction from gross business profits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">In the case of a corporation which is the parent of an affiliated group pursuant to the provisions of chapter 6 of the United States Internal Revenue Code as defined in RSA 77-A.T, XX, a deduction of such amounts of gross business profits as are derived from dividends paid to the parent by a subsidiary or subsidiaries whose gross business profits have already been subject to taxation under this chapter during the same taxable period. The purpose of this deduction is to prevent double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>taxation on the identical gross business profits of a controlled corporation or group of corporations and its parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">RSA 77-A:4, IV has traditionally been used by corporations with affiliates or subsidiaries that file separately, and not under the combined reporting method. In such instances, RSA 77-A:4, IV allows a deduction for dividends paid to taxable parent corporations by subsidiaries that conducted business in the state and were therefore subject to a separate BPT. The dividends received from foreign subsidiaries that do not conduct business in the state and, accordingly, pay no BPT, do not qualify for the deduction allowed by the statute. RSA 77-A:4, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On appeal, GE argues that the trial court improperly granted the department\u2019s motion for summary judgment and that by limiting the dividends-received deduction to those parents whose subsidiaries conduct business in the state, the statute facially discriminates against foreign commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. GE also appeals the trial court\u2019s grant of the department\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon a lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>I. Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">In considering a motion to dismiss, our standard of review is whether the allegations in the plaintiffs pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. We assume the plaintiffs pleadings to be true and construe all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom most favorably to it. We need not assume the truth of statements in the plaintiffs complaint, however, which are merely conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\"><em>In re Juvenile 2004-789, </em>153 N.H. 332, 334 (2006) (quotation and brackets omitted). Since the trial court applied RSA 77-A:4, IV to an undisputed set of facts, this appeal presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">For a court to hear a party\u2019s complaint, the party must have standing to assert the claim. <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. 148, 154, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 899 (1991). The general rule in New Hampshire is that a party has standing to raise a constitutional issue only when the party\u2019s own rights have been or will be directly affected. <em>Hughes v. N.H. Div. of Aeronautics, </em>152 N.H. 30, 35 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The trial court found that GE failed to show that \u201cRSA 77-A:4, IV directly and specifically affect[ed] its rights.\u201d Adopting the department\u2019s statutory application argument, the court found that the statute did not apply generally to parents with foreign subsidiaries. The court also found that RSA 77-A:4, IV did not apply specifically to GE since \u201cthe purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the statute is to prevent double taxation\u201d and GE\u2019s foreign subsidiaries were never subject to taxation in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">To qualify for the dividend-received deduction, RSA 77-A:4, IV requires that the dividend recipient must qualify as a \u201cparent of an affiliated group\u201d as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC). RSA 77-A:4, IV. Section 1504(a) of the IRC defines \u201caffiliated group,\u201d in part, as: \u201c1 or more chains of includable corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1504(a)(1)(A) (2000). This term is further defined in the statute to require minimum stock ownership of eighty percent between the parent and its affiliates and to limit the type of corporations that are considered \u201cincludable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1504(a)(2)(B) (2000). Foreign corporations are specifically excluded from the definition of \u201cincludable corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1504(b)(3) (2000). The trial court relied in part upon this exclusion to find that GE does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of RSA 77-A:4, IV because GE\u2019s challenge relates only to its foreign subsidiaries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The plain language of RSA 77-A:4, IV shows that the phrase \u201cparent of an affiliated group\u201d refers to the parent company\u2019s status, and not that of the subsidiaries. In other words, as long as the stock requirements are met with regard to an includable subsidiary, it satisfies the first condition of the statute in order to receive the dividend-received deduction, which GE does. By its terms, the deduction is not necessarily limited to parents with dividend-paying subsidiaries that are also members of the affiliated group. Therefore, we hold that GE qualifies as a \u201cparent of an affiliated group\u201d under RSA 77-A:4, IV. However, we express no opinion as to whether the statute would apply to a parent having <em>only </em>foreign subsidiaries, as that is not the case presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The department also argues, and the trial court agreed, that GE lacks standing to challenge RSA 77-A:4, IV because \u201cGE is a unitary business and RSA 77-A:4, IV does not apply and/or affect the way in which GE was taxed in New Hampshire during the applicable tax years.\u201d As a unitary business, GE is required to file under the combined reporting method discussed above. RSA 77-A:l, XIII-XVI, :3, I-III (2003). Under the combined reporting method, it makes no difference whether a corporation\u2019s subsidiaries do business in-state or out-of-state because the income from every member of the unitary group is combined and apportioned. However, because New Hampshire uses the water\u2019s edge method of apportionment, the combined income is limited to that derived from domestic members of the unitary group. RSA 77-A:l, XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Any income from a foreign member of GE\u2019s unitary group was excluded from GE\u2019s combined report and was not taxed. Further, because none of GE\u2019s foreign subsidiaries did any business in New Hampshire, they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>file separate tax returns with the state. The department argues on appeal that since the purpose of RSA 77-A:4, IV is \u201cto prevent double taxation,\u201d the statute is not applicable to GE\u2019s tax status because its foreign subsidiaries did not file separate returns in New Hampshire, were never subject to income taxation, were not taxed twice, and therefore were not entitled to receive the dividend-received deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Even if we were to accept the department\u2019s argument \u2014 that RSA 77-A:4, IV does not apply to GE\u2019s foreign dividends because of GE\u2019s unitary status and usage of the water\u2019s edge combined reporting method\u2014 standing is conferred upon GE to challenge the statute for the very reason that it was denied the statute\u2019s benefit. The fact that none of GE\u2019s subsidiaries conducted business within the state and thus filed no separate BPT returns or that GE operates as a unitary business does not preclude GE from challenging RSA 77-A:4, IV. Any corporate parent that pays BPT in New Hampshire but is ineligible for the dividend-received deduction in RSA 77-A:4, IV is a proper party to bring suit for a determination of whether the basis upon which it is ineligible is constitutionally permissible. Such an adjudication directly and specifically affects GE\u2019s rights as a parent corporation paying BPT in the state. <em>See Hughes, </em>152 N.H. at 35; <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. at 154. We hold that GE has sufficient interest in the outcome of this litigation to bring a constitutional challenge to RSA 77-A:4, IV. Accordingly, we reverse the order granting the department\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>II. Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Next, we consider whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the department. A motion for summary judgment may be granted only where no genuine issue of material fact is present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Soper v. Purdy, </em>144 N.H. 268, 270 (1999). In determining whether summary judgment should be granted, we consider the affidavits and other evidence submitted below, and any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The trial court based its ruling upon a determination that \u201cRSA 77-A:4, IV does not discriminate against foreign commerce and therefore, does not violate the United States Commerce Clause.\u201d The facts are not disputed by the parties and the question of whether RSA 77-A:4, IV violates the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Caterpillar Inc. v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>144 N.H. 253, 255 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1021 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Before we address the underlying issue of facial discrimination, we must first address GE\u2019s statutory construction argument regarding RSA chapter 77-A (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>A. Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">GE argues that since foreign subsidiaries are not included as part of the water\u2019s edge combined group, they must file a separate BPT return if they conduct business in the state, thereby allowing use of the dividend-received deduction. <em>See </em>RSA 77-A:l, I (defining business organization); RSA 77-A-.2 (imposing BPT on every business organization); RSA 77-A:6,1 (requiring a BPT return). The department largely ignores this argument, focusing nearly its entire brief upon a comparison of domestic subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries. However, the issue on appeal, which is consistent with GE\u2019s argument below, focuses specifically upon whether RSA 77-A:4, IV facially discriminates against parents of dividend-paying foreign subsidiaries which do not conduct business in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The department addresses this scenario summarily, asserting that any dividends from a foreign unitary group member paid to a member of the domestic unitary group that have been subject to taxation will already be excluded from the taxable business profits in order to prevent double taxation in violation of the Federal Constitution. To support this assertion, the department cites only to RSA 77-A:4, X (2003), which merely provides for the addition of expenses to gross business profits where a corporation has excluded gross business profits related to those expenses \u201cpursuant to federal constitutional law.\u201d The department concludes from this that \u201cRSA 77-A:4, IV never enters the analysis in a combined reporting regime.\u201d GE counters that the taxing regime does not operate in this manner and that foreign subsidiaries conducting business in the state would be required to file a separate BPT return, and any dividends paid to the parent would be deducted pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">We note that GE does not have any foreign subsidiaries that conduct business in the state. It is uncertain, therefore, exactly how the state taxing regime, including RSA 77-A:4, IV, would operate if it did. Essentially, GE asks us to evaluate a hypothetical situation. Typically, we will not invalidate a statute based upon a hypothetical factual scenario that is not before us. <em>New England Dragway v. M-O-H Enters., </em>149 N.H. 188, 192 (2003). However, in the context of New Hampshire\u2019s tax system, a facial attack on RSA 77-A:4, IV does raise broad constitutional concerns and is likely to come before us again. In order to reach the merits of this claim, we accept GE\u2019s hypothetical and assume without deciding that the parent of a foreign subsidiary doing business in the state might, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>certain circumstances, be entitled to the dividend-received deduction in RSA77-A4, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The department also argues that the dividend-received deduction is of limited scope, allowing a deduction only up to the amount of gross business profits already taxed. In contrast, GE argues that RSA 77-A:4, IV allows a \u201cfull deduction for a dividend received from a foreign subsidiary doing business in New Hampshire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">This court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Appeal of Ann Miles Builder, </em>150 N.H. 315, 318 (2003). When the issue raised presents a new question of statutory construction, we begin our analysis with an examination of the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>We are also mindful of the well-established principle of statutory construction that all words used should be given their ordinary meaning unless a different meaning is indicated from the context in which they are used. <em>Dupont v. Chagnon, </em>119 N.H. 792, 794 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The statutory construction urged by GE, which would allow a \u201chyper-deduction\u201d regardless of the amount of the tax paid in New Hampshire, might well run afoul of the Commerce Clause. However, we agree with the department that the statute, by its terms, only allows a limited dividend deduction for the amount of business profits already taxed by the state. RSA 77-A:4, IV; <em>cf. First Financial Group of N.H., Inc. v. State, 121 </em>N.H. 381, 385 (1981); <em>Concord Inv. Corp. v. N.H. Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>114 N.H. 105, 109 (1974). The purpose of the dividend-received deduction is \u201cto prevent double taxation on the <em>identical </em>gross business profits\u201d of a subsidiary and its parent. RSA 77-A:4, IV (emphasis added). Allowing a full deduction for dividends paid to a parent when the subsidiary conducted only a small amount of business in the state and thus was only taxed on a small amount of its profits yields an absurd result. Although the amount of business conducted in the state by the subsidiary may allow the parent to deduct the full amount of the dividend received in some situations, this will not always be the case. We therefore continue our analysis with the understanding that when RSA 77-A4, IV does allow for a dividend-received deduction, the deduction is limited by the amount of income already taxed in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\n<em>B. Commerce Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">This brings us to the central issue in this case: Whether RSA 77-A:4, IV facially discriminates against foreign commerce by permitting a deduction for dividends received from foreign corporations doing business in New Hampshire, while denying a deduction for dividends received from foreign corporations not doing business in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution reserves to Congress the right to \u201cregulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states.\u201d U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. This clause also imputes a \u201cnegative aspect\u201d which prohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening interstate and foreign commerce. <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>144 N.H. at 257 (quotation omitted). In <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274 (1977), the United States Supreme Court outlined the test for determining whether a state taxing regime survives a challenge under the Commerce Clause. To be valid, the tax must: (1) have a \u201csubstantial nexus with the taxing State\u201d; (2) be \u201cfairly apportioned\u201d; (3) \u201cnot discriminate against interstate commerce\u201d; and (4) be \u201cfairly related to the services provided by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Supreme Court has defined Commerce Clause \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in numerous ways over the years. In 1977, the Court found discrimination where a tax \u201cprovid[ed] a direct commercial advantage to local business.\u201d <em>Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>429 U.S. 318, 329 (1977) (quotation omitted). In 1994, the Court defined it as \u201cdifferential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\u201d <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Oreg., </em>511 U.S. 93, 99 (1994). In 1996, the Court upheld the principle that a state taxing regime is discriminatory if it \u201ctaxes a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the State.\u201d <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 331 (1996) (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cState laws discriminating against interstate commerce on their face are virtually <em>per se </em>invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The party challenging the constitutionality of a state tax bears the burden of proving discrimination. <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>144 N.H. at 258. In order to prove that a state tax statute violates the Commerce Clause, the taxpayer need not show the extent of disparate tax treatment or demonstrate a minimal level of discriminatory effect; the taxpayer need only prove discrimination against commerce. <em>Id. </em>However, statutes are presumed constitutional, and they will only be declared invalid \u201cupon inescapable grounds.\u201d <em>Baines v. N.H. Senate President, </em>152 N.H. 124, 133 (2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">GE argues that \u201cRSA 77-A:4, IV discriminates in violation of the commerce clause because it affords a deduction for dividends received from corporations that do business in New Hampshire, while it denies a deduction for dividends received from corporations that do not do business in New Hampshire.\u201d The department responds that it is constitutional for states to proportionately tax foreign source income and that GE fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>show that \u201cforeign commerce is taxed more heavily than intrastate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">As an initial matter, we note that the state\u2019s right to tax foreign dividends is not contested. In <em>Mobil Oil Corporation v. Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. 425 (1980), the Supreme Court upheld the states\u2019 right to tax foreign-source dividend income when the dividend is received by a corporation doing business in the state. In <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>we upheld the inclusion of royalty and interest payments made by a foreign subsidiary in the net income calculation of a New Hampshire business filing a combined report. <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>144 N.H. at 258-59. There, we noted that these payments \u201cwere expenses to the foreign members, deducted on each payor\u2019s foreign income tax return ... [and as such] ... constituted income to the domestic recipients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We begin our Commerce Clause analysis with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kraft General Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance, </em>505 U.S. 71 (1992). Although the tax system in <em>Kraft </em>differs from the one before us, the principles enumerated in that decision are helpful to the resolution here. In <em>Kraft, </em>the income of domestic subsidiaries that did not conduct business in Iowa was not taxed, and the in-state parent was permitted to deduct dividends received from them. In contrast, the in-state parent was not permitted to deduct dividends received from its foreign subsidiaries doing business abroad. <em>Id. </em>at 74. Noting that \u201cIowa is not a State that taxes an apportioned share of the entire income of a unitary business,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 74 n.9, the Court held that the tax system was discriminatory, because, among other things, Iowa taxed neither the income of, nor dividends paid by, domestic members of the unitary group that did not conduct business in the state. <em>Id. </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In its analysis, the Court added a footnote that has been the focus of many state court decisions over the past fourteen years. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">If one were to compare the aggregate tax imposed by Iowa on a unitary business which included a subsidiary doing business throughout the United States (including Iowa) with the aggregate tax imposed by Iowa on a unitary business which included a foreign subsidiary doing business abroad, it would be difficult to say that Iowa discriminates against the business with the foreign subsidiary. Iowa would tax an apportioned share of the domestic subsidiary\u2019s entire earnings, but would tax only the amount of the foreign subsidiary\u2019s earnings paid as a dividend to the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">In considering claims of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause, however, it is necessary to compare the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>taxpayers who are \u201cmost similarly situated.\u201d A corporation with a subsidiary doing business in Iowa is not situated similarly to a corporation with a subsidiary doing business abroad. In the former case, the Iowa operations of the subsidiary provide an independent basis for taxation not present in the case of the foreign subsidiary. A more appropriate comparison is between corporations whose subsidiaries do not do business in Iowa.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 80 n.23 (citation omitted). Thus the Court distinguishes between a single entity filing system where income from out-of-state domestic subsidiaries is not taxed at all and a combined reporting method system where out-of-state domestic income is taxed through apportionment. This distinction has been relied upon by some state courts to uphold ostensibly discriminatory taxation provided a combined reporting method is properly used. <em>See, e.g., Appeal of Morton Thiokol, Inc., </em>864 P.2d 1175 (Kan. 1993); <em>Du Pont de Nemours v. State Tax Assessor, </em>675 A.2d 82 (Me. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Distinguishing its taxing system from that in <em>Kraft, </em>the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the state\u2019s combined reporting tax formula which permitted in-state corporations to deduct dividends received from domestic subsidiaries, but included dividends received from foreign subsidiaries in the calculation of taxable income. <em>Thiokol, </em>864 P.2d at 1185. The court essentially held that this formula effectively \u201cbalanc[ed] the [tax] burdens\u201d of each entity and accepted the state\u2019s argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">the aggregate tax imposed by [the state] on a unitary business with a domestic subsidiary would not be less burdensome than that imposed by [the state] on a unitary business with a foreign subsidiary because the income of the domestic subsidiary would be ... taxed while only the dividend of the foreign subsidiary would be taxed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Similarly, in <em>Du Pont, </em>the Maine Supreme Judicial Court followed the reasoning of <em>Thiokol </em>and upheld an analogous taxing formula. <em>Du Pont, </em>675 A.2d at 83. The court found that by proportionately taxing the income received from domestic subsidiaries and the dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, the state\u2019s taxing system \u201cprovid[ed] a type of \u2018taxing symmetry.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88. The court further held that \u201cthe inclusion of dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries does not constitute ... facial discrimination against foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The <em>Thiokol </em>and <em>Du Pont </em>courts looked at the overall tax burden placed upon the unitary business to determine whether the general taxing formula discriminated against foreign commerce. <em>Thiokol, </em>864 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>1186; <em>Du Pont, </em>675 A.2d at 88. Several other courts have upheld the principles outlined in <em>Thiokol </em>and <em>Du Pont, </em>although some have invalidated taxing regimes as discriminatory for other reasons not applicable here. <em>See Hutchinson Technology v. Com\u2019r of Revenue, </em>698 N.W.2d 1, 17 (Minn. 2005) (\u201cBut in contrast to the circumstances in <em>Morton Thiokol </em>and <em>Du Pont, </em>which involved taxes imposed by the same state for which the dividend-received deduction was intended to compensate, the additional tax liability for which the dividend-received deduction would compensate here is <em>federal </em>tax liability\u201d); <em>Emerson Elec. Co. v. Tracy, </em>735 N.E.2d 445, 448-49 (Ohio 2000) (recognizing the validity of the \u201ctaxing symmetry\u201d principle where domestic and foreign subsidiaries are both taxed once); <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Taxation &amp; Revenue Dept. </em>931 P.2d 730, 735 (N.M. 1996) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1112 (1997); <em>Bernard Egan &amp; Co. v. State, Dept. of Rev., </em>769 So. 2d 1060, 1061 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000) (upholding similar taxing regime as constitutional because domestic and foreign subsidiary income was equally treated under the consolidated reporting method), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 995 (2001); <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. C.I.R., </em>568 N.W.2d 695, 701 (Minn. 1997) (adopting similar analysis as applied to foreign interest and royalty payments), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1112 (1998); <em>Fujitsu IT Holdings v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>15 Cal. Rptr. 3d 473, 489-90 (Ct. App. 2004) (adopting the \u201ctaxing symmetry\u201d principle in <em>Du Pont, </em>and upholding a taxing regime which taxed foreign dividend income but excluded dividend income from domestic subsidiaries).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">While we recognize that GE does not challenge the state\u2019s combined reporting method but rather focuses only upon the alleged disparate treatment between foreign subsidiaries doing business in the state and those that do not, we find the principles of \u201caggregate tax\u201d burdens and \u201ctaxing symmetry\u201d enumerated in these cases helpful to the analysis here. The United States Supreme Court requires analysis of the aggregate tax burden when reviewing a claim that a tax discriminates in violation of the Commerce Clause: \u201ca proper analysis must take the whole scheme of taxation into account.\u201d <em>Halliburton Oil Well Co. v. Reily, </em>373 U.S. 64, 69 (1963) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>Kraft, </em>505 U.S. at 80-81 &amp; n.23 (speaking in terms of the \u201caggregate tax imposed by [a state] on a unitary business\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Following the reasoning in these cases, we assess New Hampshire\u2019s taxing regime as a whole and look at the aggregate tax imposed upon a unitary business. \u201cA state tax must be assessed in light of its actual effect considered in conjunction -with other provisions of the State\u2019s tax scheme.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725, 756 (1981). Viewing RSA 77-A:4, IV not in isolation, but as a part of a larger taxing system, we find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>improper discriminatory treatment. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that a foreign subsidiary conducting business in New Hampshire is subject to the BPT under RSA chapter 77-A and must pay a tax apportioned upon its profits attributable to the state. RSA 77-A:l, IV; RSA 77-A:3, I. Any dividends paid to a parent corporation also located within the state may be deducted pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, IV up to the amount of business profits already taxed. RSA 77-A:4, IV; <em>First Financial, </em>121 N.H. at 385. This ensures that the income of the business entity is taxed only once. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a foreign subsidiary that does not conduct business in the state is not subject to the BPT and its income is therefore not directly taxed. RSA 77-A:l, I. Therefore, any dividends paid to an in-state parent corporation are apportioned and taxed as income; they are not subject to a deduction under RSA 77-A:4, IV because that dividend income has been taxed only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Accordingly, the New Hampshire BPT regime contains the type of \u201ctaxing symmetry\u201d upheld in <em>Du Pont </em>and the \u201cbalancing the burdens\u201d formula affirmed in <em>Thiokol. </em>Although the in-state parent is not taxed directly in the first example given above, because by nature of the unitary business concept the parent and its subsidiary are considered a single business entity, it follows that the parent ultimately pays the BPT of its subsidiary. <em>See Concord Inv. Corp., </em>114 N.H. at 109; <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>144 N.H. at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Furthermore, by viewing the state\u2019s taxing regime as a whole, we conclude that RSA 77-A:4, IV does not facially discriminate by any means offensive to the Commerce Clause. Since both the unitary business with the foreign subsidiary operating in New Hampshire and the unitary business with the foreign subsidiary not operating in New Hampshire are each only taxed once, there is no \u201cdifferential treatment\u201d that benefits the former and burdens the latter, <em>Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 99; the latter is not taxed more heavily than the former, <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 331; and the former is not given a \u201cdirect commercial advantage\u201d over the latter, <em>Boston Stock Exchange, </em>429 U.S. at 329 (quotation omitted). Although the total tax assessed in the end may not be exactly equal, we have noted before that the state\u2019s taxation methods need \u201cnot apportion income perfectly[;] the Federal Constitution does not require mathematical exactitude, only a rough approximation.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Inc., </em>144 N.H. at 262 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In spite of these decisions, GE argues that \u201c[ejvery court that has examined dividends received deduction statutes substantially the same as RSA 77-A:4, IV has struck down the provisions as violating the Commerce Clause.\u201d GE cites several decisions to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In <em>Dart Industries, Inc. v. Clark, </em>657 A.2d 1062 (R.1.1995), the Supreme Court of Rhode Island invalidated a statutory provision which effectively excluded domestic dividends but required inclusion of foreign dividends in the calculation of a corporation\u2019s Rhode Island net income. <em>Id. </em>at 1063-64. The court held that the statute contained the same \u201cfatal flaw\u201d as the statute in <em>Kraft, </em>and found that \u201cRhode Island\u2019s [taxing regime] treats dividends paid by a foreign corporation less favorably than those paid by domestic corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1066. Similarly, in <em>D.D.I., Inc. v. Stale ex rel. Clayburgh, </em>657 N.W.2d 228, 231 (N.D. 2003), the court noted that the tax commissioner conceded that the state\u2019s dividends received deduction was discriminatory and focused instead upon the commissioner\u2019s argument that it was constitutional as a compensatory tax. Therefore, no further analysis was conducted regarding facial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In two cases from California, two separate courts of appeal invalidated statutes that permitted a deduction only for dividends paid out of income that had already been subject to tax in the state. <em>Farmer Bros. Co. v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>134 Cal. Rptr. 2d 390 (Ct. App. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1178 (2004); <em>Ceridian Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 611 (Ct. App. 2000). <em>But see Fujitsu IT Holdings, </em>15 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 489-90. In <em>Ceridian, </em>the Franchise Tax Board for the State of California (FTB) argued that the provision was not unconstitutional because it \u201cavoids double taxation.\u201d <em>Ceridian, </em>102 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 619. The court rejected this argument as inconsequential, since the statute facially discriminated against out-of-state corporations by \u201cfavor[ing] domestic corporations over their foreign competitors in raising capital among California corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. Similarly, in <em>Farmer Brothers, </em>the court held that the dividend-received deduction was discriminatory on its face because it \u201cfavors dividend-paying corporations doing business in California and paying California taxes over dividend-paying corporations which do not do business in California and pay no taxes in California.\u201d <em>Farmer Bros., </em>134 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 398. The court relied, in part, upon <em>Fulton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In <em>Fulton, </em>the Supreme Court held that North Carolina\u2019s \u201cintangibles tax\u201d assessed against corporate stock owned by state residents \u201cfacially discriminates against interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 333. The tax was calculated using a formula that allowed taxpayers who owned stock in in-state corporations, which were subject to tax in North Carolina, to take a limited \u201cpercentage deduction equal to the fraction of the issuing corporation\u2019s income subject to tax in North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We do not agree that these cases require a finding that RSA 77-A:4, IV is discriminatory. <em>Fulton </em>is not analogous to the present case because there, the state taxing regime taxed stock ownership and treated in-state stock more favorably than stock held in out-of-state corporations. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>333. In the present case, the state is instead taxing a proportionate share of dividend <em>income </em>coming into the state. <em>See generally Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 187-88 (1983) (distinguishing taxing regime which taxed property from regime which taxed income); <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>445 U.S. at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In addition, we do not find the decisions of the California appellate courts and in <em>Dart </em>and <em>D.D.I. </em>to be persuasive here. While the deduction provisions invalidated in these cases appear similar to the New Hampshire dividend-received deduction at issue, it may be that in those cases, there was no taxing symmetry as there is here. Regardless, we do not agree with their analysis. We also note that a more recent California Court of Appeals decision, which cited <em>Du Pont, </em>upheld a limited deduction for dividends received from foreign corporations while allowing a full deduction for dividends received from domestic corporations. <em>Fujitsu IT Holdings, </em>15 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As stated above, we examine our state taxing regime as a whole, and look at the aggregate tax assessed against the unitary business in New Hampshire. We conclude that RSA 77-A:4, IV does not facially discriminate against a dividend-paying foreign subsidiary that does not conduct business in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">There being no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and the department being entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of the department\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because we hold that RSA 77-A:4, IV is not unconstitutional on its face, we need not address the compensatory tax issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed in paH.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
