The trial court interpreted the New Hampshire Insurance Guaranty Association Act (Guaranty Act), RSA 404-B:l <em>et seq. </em>(1998), not to require NHIGA to partially reimburse OB/GYN for the payment OB/GYN made to settle a professional negligence action against itself and one of its physicians whose professional liability insurer had become insolvent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The facts are not in dispute. While under the care of Leonard Wasserman, M.D., a physician employed by OB/GYN, Hanh Tran died of complications from childbirth. Wasserman was insured by PHICO Insurance Company (PHICO). OB/GYN was insured by Covenant Health Systems Insurance, Ltd. (Covenant).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Tran\u2019s estate sued Wasserman, OB/GYN, St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, and another physician, Sayed Elsiah, M.D., who was not employed by OB/GYN. The estate\u2019s claims against OB/GYN were based solely upon \u00d3B/GYN\u2019s vicarious liability for Wasserman\u2019s actions. During the pendency of the suit, PHICO was declared insolvent and placed in court-ordered liquidation. Thereafter, NHIGA assumed Wasserman\u2019s defense pursuant to RSA 404-B:8,1(b). Shortly before trial, NHIGA concluded that it was not required to participate in settlement until OB/GYN had exhausted all the coverage available under its Covenant policy to satisfy the estate\u2019s claims. Ultimately, OB/GYN agreed to settle the wrongful death claims against itself and Wasserman for $500,000. Of the total settlement, $300,000 was paid on Wasserman\u2019s behalf. OB/GYN paid the settlement from its own funds and never made a claim against Covenant. In exchange for OB/GYN\u2019s payment on his behalf, Wasserman assigned his rights under his PHICO policies to OB/GYN.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">OB/GYN then filed a declaratory judgment action against NHIGA, asserting it was entitled, under its assignment from Wasserman, to recover $300,000 from NHIGA, the statutory maximum NHIGA would have been obligated to pay the wrongful death plaintiff on its claims against Wasserman in the absence of other available coverage. <em>See </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>404-B:8,1(a). OB/GYN contended that NHIGA\u2019s obligation to reimburse it for the payment it made on Wasserman\u2019s behalf was triggered even though it never made a claim against its Covenant policy and used its own funds to settle the claims against itself and Wasserman.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">NHIGA moved for summary judgment contending that OB/GYN was required, under RSA 404-B:12,1, to exhaust all solvent insurance available to satisfy the underlying plaintiff\u2019s claims before NHIGA\u2019s obligation to assume PHICO\u2019s obligations would be implicated. NHIGA further argued that OB/GYN\u2019s claim against it was not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d because OB/GYN settled with the underlying plaintiff from its own funds, thus precluding the existence of an \u201cunpaid claim,\u201d which is part of the statutory definition of a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 404-B:5, IV. OB/GYN filed a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing, in part, that NHIGA breached its statutory duty to pay the claim it held under the Wasserman assignment because NHIGA\u2019s duty to participate in settlement with the underlying plaintiff did not depend upon exhaustion of the Covenant policy. The trial court granted NHIGA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied OB/GYN\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On appeal, OB/GYN argues that the trial court erred by ruling that: (1) NHIGA was not time-barred, under RSA 491:22, III (1997), from arguing that the Covenant policy provided coverage relieving NHIGA of any obligation to reimburse OB/GYN for the part of the settlement it paid Tran\u2019s estate on Wasserman\u2019s behalf; (2) the Covenant policy had to be exhausted before NHIGA\u2019s duty to pay on the estate\u2019s claims against Wasserman could have been triggered; and (3) there was coverage that OB/GYN failed to exhaust that was available under the Covenant policy to satisfy the estate\u2019s claims, even though OB/GYN and Covenant agreed that there was no coverage. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">OB/GYN first argues that the trial court erred by allowing NHIGA to litigate the construction of the Covenant policy because NHIGA\u2019s reliance on that policy in defense of OB/GYN\u2019s petition was, in effect, a request for a declaratory judgment to determine insurance coverage and was, therefore, time-barred under RSA 491:22, III. We do not agree. We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Tech-Built 153 v. Va. Surety Co., </em>153 N.H. 371, 373 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">According to the plain language of the declaratory judgment statute, the limitation period pertains to \u201cpetition[s]... under this section to determine coverage of an insurance policy.\u201d RSA 491:22, III. As OB/GYN readily acknowledges, NHIGA never filed a petition for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>declaratory judgment, and the statute pertains only to petitions for declaratory judgment, not to legal arguments about insurance coverage advanced in other pleadings. <em>See Ryan James Realty v. Villages at Chester Condo. Assoc., </em>153 N.H. 194, 199 (2006) (\u201cWhen a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous ... we will not... add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>cf. Craftsbury Co. v. Assurance Co. of America, </em>149 N.H. 717, 721 (2003) (holding that parties are not collaterally estopped from litigating policy coverage issues in a subsequent action even when an earlier declaratory judgment action was dismissed as untimely). Thus, OB/GYN\u2019s characterization of NHIGA\u2019s reliance upon the Covenant policy as a <em>\u201cde facto </em>declaratory judgment action\u201d does not advance OB/GYN\u2019s argument. RSA 491:22, III does not apply, and NHIGA was not time-barred from asserting a defense that relied upon an interpretation of the Covenant policy. Moreover, because the declaratory judgment process is not mandatory, <em>see Craftsbury, </em>149 N.H. at 721, NHIGA\u2019s failure to file a declaratory judgment petition is of no legal consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">OB/GYN next argues that the trial court erred by ruling that exhaustion of the Covenant policy to satisfy the claims of the Tran estate was a necessary prerequisite to OB/GYN\u2019s right, under its assignment from Wasserman, to be reimbursed by NHIGA. Again, we disagree. We interpret the Guaranty Act by focusing first upon its language, then by considering the context of the overall statutory scheme, and finally, by looking for guidance to other states\u2019 interpretations of similar statutes. <em>Benson v. N.H. Ins. Guaranty Assoc., </em>151 N.H. 590, 595 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Guaranty Act is intended, in part, \u201cto provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer ... and to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.\u201d RSA 404-B:2. The association established by the Guaranty Act is \u201ca nonprofit unincorporated legal entity,\u201d RSA 404-B:6, funded by assessments from insurers, RSA 404-B:8,1(c), which insurers are authorized to recoup from premiums paid by their policyholders, RSA 404-B:16.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In a recent opinion, we described the overall statutory scheme of the Guaranty Act, characterized NHIGA as the insurer of last resort, and explained that the protection NHIGA provides is limited based upon its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. <em>Benson, </em>151 N.H. at 598-99. We quoted with approval two opinions describing the operation of the California Insurance Guaranty Association:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>While CIGA\u2019s general purpose is to pay the obligations of an insolvent insurer, it is not itself an insurer and does not \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of the insolvent insurer for all purposes. CIGA is <em>not </em>in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of insurance____Its \u201cbusiness\u201d is providing insureds with a limited form of protection from financial loss occasioned by the insolvency of their insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 599 (brackets and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The Guaranty Act limits NHIGA\u2019s obligations in a variety of ways. For example, NHIGA will not pay \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise.\u201d RSA 404-B:5, IV. In addition, NHIGA will provide no coverage for claims arising more than thirty days after an insurer\u2019s determination of insolvency, RSA 404-B:8, 1(a), and, except in the case of an insolvent workers\u2019 compensation carrier, it will pay a maximum of $300,000 on a covered claim, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The limitation at issue in this case is contained in a section of the Guaranty Act titled \u201cNonduplication of Recovery,\u201d which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">Any person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, including but not limited to the provisions of uninsured motorist coverage of any policy, shall be required to exhaust first his right under such policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">RSA 404-B:12, I. As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals explained, when interpreting a virtually identical statutory provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">This section requires: 1) that a claimant with an alternative source of insurance coverage for a covered claim must first exhaust that alternative source[] before seeking compensation from the DCIGA, and 2) that the DCIGA\u2019s obligation be reduced by the amount of duplicate coverage of the covered claim from alternative sources of insurance. These two clauses together provide that where an individual has more than one insurance policy that covers the same claim, the amount paid by the other policy should be deducted from the total amount payable as damages for the claimant\u2019s injuries caused by the covered occurrence. The nonduplication of recovery and exhaustion requirements prevent a situation in which an injured collects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>amount of the total loss from one insurance company and then gets an additional sum from the DCIGA. Thus, the provision prevents claimants from double recovery or windfall by virtue of an insurance company\u2019s insolvency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><em>Zhou v. Jennifer Mall Restaurant, Inc., </em>699 A.2d 348, 352 (D.C. 1997) (quotations, brackets and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In <em>New Hampshire Insurance Guaranty Association v. Pitco Frialator, </em>142 N.H. 573 (1998), we held that the term \u201cclaim\u201d in the nonduplication of recovery provision \u201cencompasses <em>both </em>the insured\u2019s claim against NHIGA and the third party\u2019s underlying claim against the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. By extension, the term \u201cclaim against an insurer\u201d in the first sentence of RSA 404-B:12, I, necessarily encompasses both an insured\u2019s claim against a solvent insurer and the third-party claim against the insured that gives rise to the insured\u2019s claim against its solvent insurer. <em>See Bird v. Norpac Foods, Inc., </em>934 P.2d 382, 387 (Or. 1997) (\u201cit is more plausible that the legislature intended that the word \u2018claim\u2019 refer simply to a generic assertion of a right to property or money arising out of a common injurious event\u201d). We acknowledge that our opinion in <em>Piteo </em>could be read as implying that our decision in that case was based upon the special nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance vis-a-vis liability insurance, but in <em>King-Jennings v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>144 N.H. 559 (1999), we explained that \u201c[a]n employer obtains workers\u2019 compensation insurance... in order to avoid personal liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that would be due to an employee who suffers a work-related injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 561, thus establishing that it is the employer\u2019s risk of liability for an employee\u2019s injuries rather than the employee\u2019s risk of injury that is insured by workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Accordingly, an injured employee stands no closer, legally, to his employer\u2019s solvent workers\u2019 compensation carrier than an injured patient stands to her medical provider\u2019s solvent liability carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The term \u201ccovered claim\u201d refers to a claim against an insolvent insurer to which the Guaranty Act applies. RSA 404-B:5, IV. Like the trial court, we assume without deciding that the claim against PHICO that Wasserman assigned to OB/GYN meets the statutory definition of \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Thus, the case before us involves one covered claim \u2014 the claim against PHICO that Wasserman assigned to OB/GYN \u2014 and two claims against insurers: the Tran estate\u2019s claim against Wasserman (who was covered first by PHICO, then by NHIGA) and the Tran estate\u2019s vicarious liability claim against OB/GYN (which is covered by Covenant). Under RSA 404-B:12,1, if the Tran estate\u2019s claim against OB/GYN is also the covered claim, then any insurance available to cover the claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>OB/GYN must be exhausted before NHIGA has any obligation to cover the covered claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In determining whether the Tran estate\u2019s claim against OB/GYN is also the covered claim in this case, <em>i.e., </em>Wasserman\u2019s claim against PHICO that was assigned to OB/GYN, we are mindful of our decision in <em>Pitco. </em>In that case, a bagel shop employee was injured at work and received more than $300,000 in benefits from his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. <em>Pitco, </em>142 N.H. at 574. Subsequently, the injured employee sued Pitco, manufacturer of the equipment he was using when he was injured. <em>Id. </em>During the pendency of the employee\u2019s suit against Pitco, Pitco\u2019s liability insurer was declared insolvent. <em>Id. </em>at 575. Pitco settled the suit by paying the injured bagel shop employee $500,000 of its own funds, <em>id., </em>and then sought reimbursement of $300,000 from NHIGA, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">NHIGA filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination that it was not obligated to reimburse Piteo, and when the case reached us, we held that the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was a \u201cclaim against an insurer\u201d as that term is used in the first sentence of RSA 404-B:12,1. <em>Id. </em>at 579. We further held, under the second sentence of RSA 404-B:12, I, that the employee\u2019s receipt of more than $300,000 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits relieved NHIGA of any obligation to reimburse Pitco. <em>Id. </em>at 580. Our resolution of <em>Pitco </em>necessarily entailed a determination that the employee\u2019s claim against his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier was also the covered claim, <em>i.e., </em>Pitco\u2019s claim against its insolvent insurer to cover the employee\u2019s products liability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">NHIGA relies upon <em>Piteo </em>to support its argument that before it had an obligation under the Guaranty Act to contribute to a settlement with the Tran estate, or pay a claim, OB/GYN was required to exhaust its available coverage under the Covenant policy to satisfy the Tran estate\u2019s claims. According to OB/GYN, <em>Piteo </em>is no bar to its recovery from NHIGA because an injured employee\u2019s claim against his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier is different from the claim at issue in this case, which is a claim against a third party tortfeasor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The Tran estate\u2019s claim against OB/GYN is also the covered claim in this case because the only theory of liability the estate asserted against OB/GYN is vicarious liability for Wasserman\u2019s actions; no acts or omissions by OB/GYN were alleged, nor was any theory of direct liability asserted against OB/GYN. The claims against Wasserman and OB/GYN are the same because they are based upon identical factual allegations and legal assertions concerning nothing other than Wasserman\u2019s professional negligence. In other words, the Tran estate brought the same claim \u2014 that Wasserman provided negligent treatment \u2014 against two different entities each with legal responsibility for Wasserman\u2019s actions: Wasserman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>himself and his employer, OB/GYN. Thus, a recovery from OB/GYN would necessarily duplicate a recovery from Wasserman. <em>See Zhou, </em>699 A.2d at 352-53 (explaining purpose of nonduplication of recovery provision is to prevent double recovery or windfall and holding that negligence claim against drunk driver and dram shop claim against restaurant that served drunk driver were different claims, because dram shop action could not have been brought under drunk driver\u2019s insurance). Similarly, in <em>Piteo, </em>a single allegation of fault, <em>i.e., </em>a manufacturer\u2019s fault in making and selling defective equipment, was sufficient to support two separate claims, one against the manufacturer and one against the employer whose employee was injured while using the defective equipment. In other words, the employee brought a claim that he was injured by Pitco\u2019s equipment under his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>See Zhou, </em>699 A.2d at 353. Accordingly, recovery <em>from </em>the manufacturer would have duplicated the employee\u2019s recovery from his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. As in this case, two different insurance policies were available, at least theoretically, to cover the same allegation of fault. If the employee\u2019s claims against the employer and the equipment manufacturer in <em>Piteo </em>were the same claim, for the purpose of RSA 404-B:12, I, then the two claims in this case \u2014 resting as they do on a single allegation of fault against Wasserman \u2014 are without question the same claim. Because the Tran estate\u2019s claim against OB/GYN is also the covered claim, OB/GYN\u2019s coverage under the Covenant policy must be exhausted before NHIGA has an obligation to cover Wasserman\u2019s claim against PHICO by reimbursing OB/GYN.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">OB/GYN\u2019s Covenant policy has not been exhausted. It is undisputed that OB/GYN did not make a claim against that policy. According to OB/GYN, it did not make a claim and did not file a declaratory judgment action to determine the policy\u2019s coverage because it lacked a good faith belief that the policy covered the estate\u2019s claims against it. OB/GYN is not obligated to pursue insurance coverage to which it may arguably be entitled. But because OB/GYN was on notice that the source from which it intended to seek reimbursement, NHIGA, required exhaustion of available solvent insurance as a precondition to its payment on a covered claim, OB/GYN was not free to satisfy the exhaustion requirement by unilaterally conceding that it was not entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Of the cases OB/GYN cites in support of its position that it was not required to exhaust the Covenant policy as a prerequisite to its right to recover from NHIGA under its assignment from Wasserman, the most relevant is <em>Medical Malpractice JUA of R.I. v. RIIIF, </em>703 A.2d 1097 (R.I. 1997). While the Rhode Island guaranty act\u2019s nonduplication of recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>provision is substantially similar to our statute, <em>compare </em>R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 27-34-12(a) <em>with </em>RSA 404-B:12,1, the facts of the Rhode Island case and our case are materially dissimilar. The Rhode Island case involved not just joint liability but also joint tortfeasors; different doctors (with different insurers), each of whom contributed to the underlying plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 1098,1099. The case before us involves joint liability, but it does not involve joint tortfeasors. OB/GYN is not alleged to have directly harmed Tran in any way; it is only alleged to be vicariously liable for Wasserman\u2019s alleged negligence. This is an important distinction \u2014 with codefendants who are joint tortfeasors, each alleged to have made its own independent contribution to a plaintiff\u2019s injury, a claim against one defendant (with solvent insurance) could not, as a logical matter, also be a covered claim, <em>i.e., </em>a claim made against a second defendant with insolvent insurance. Because <em>Medical Malpractice JUA of R.I. </em>arose from a professional negligence action against joint tortfeasors, it does not support OB/GYN\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The trial court correctly held that under the circumstances of this case, exhaustion of the Covenant policy was a prerequisite for OB/GYN\u2019s claim against NI-IIGA under the Wasserman assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">OB/GYN also contends that the trial court erred by ruling that there was coverage available under the Covenant policy. The interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pitman, </em>148 N.H. 499, 500 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The insurance policy Covenant issued to OB/GYN provided that Covenant would \u201creimburse amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages ... for medical professional injury that results from health care professional services provided, or which should have been provided; by or for a protected person.\u201d The policy defined \u201c[protected person [as] any person or organization who qualifies as a protected person under the Who is Protected Under this Agreement section of this agreement.\u201d That section of the agreement established that OB/GYN was a protected person and also recited that \u201cno intern, extern, resident, or dental, osteopathic or medical doctor is a protected person for any direct patient care that they provided or should have provided.\u201d The policy defined \u201c[mjedical professional injury [as] injury, including death, to others that results from health care professional services provided, or which should have been provided, by or for a protected person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">OB/GYN argues that the Covenant policy provided no coverage for the estate\u2019s claims because it expressly excluded coverage for the negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>of physicians providing direct care to patients. NHIGA concedes that Wasserman was not a protected person under the policy but contends that coverage was available because the treatment Wasserman provided, as OB/GYN\u2019s employee, was provided by or for a protected person, namely OB/GYN. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our interpretation of the relevant policy language is governed by the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">When interpreting a written agreement, we give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, considering the circumstances and the context in which the agreement was negotiated, and reading the document as a whole. Absent ambiguity, however, the parties\u2019 intent will be determined from the plain meaning of the language used in the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\"><em>Ryan James Realty, </em>153 N.H. at 197 (quotation omitted). The question before us is straightforward: whether Wasserman\u2019s treatment of Tran was provided \u201cby or for\u201d OB/GYN.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">It is beyond reasonable dispute that the medical services Tran received were provided \u201cfor\u201d OB/GYN. In common usage, the meaning of the word \u201cfor\u201d includes \u201cin place of,\u201d \u201cin behalf of,\u201d and \u201cin support of.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 886 (unabridged ed. 2002). Wasserman was OB/GYN\u2019s employee. Thus, it is axiomatic that regardless of whether Wasserman was legally OB/GYN\u2019s agent or an independent \u2022 contractor, he provided treatment to Tran in place of, in behalf of, or in support of OB/GYN. <em>Cf. Singh v. Therrien Management Corp., </em>140 N.H. 355, 358 (1995) (defining agency \u201cas the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act\u201d (citation and quotation omitted)); <em>Boissonnault v. Bristol Federated Church, </em>138 N.H. 476, 477 (1994) (affirming trial court ruling that volunteer church worker \u201cwas performing services <em>for the Church </em>as an independent contractor\u201d (quotation omitted; emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">OB/GYN\u2019s strongest argument against the trial court\u2019s construction of the Covenant policy is that neither it nor Covenant intended for the policy to cover claims such as the estate\u2019s claim against Wasserman. However, because OB/GYN has identified no ambiguity in the policy language, we have no cause to examine the asserted intent of the parties to the policy. <em>See Concord Hosp. v. N.H.
