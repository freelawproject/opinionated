Goupil, was convicted in Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) of five counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2,1(c) (Supp. 2005), and one count of theft by unauthorized taking, <em>see </em>RSA 637:3 (1996). The defendant appeals the denial of his pretrial motions to suppress, the admission of photographic evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>exclusion of demonstration evidence at trial, the denial of his motions to dismiss and for directed verdict, and the denial of his motions to set aside the verdict based upon alleged juror misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The jury could have found the following relevant facts. At the time of the incident, the victim lived in a first-floor apartment in Laconia. In the early morning of April 23, 2004, two men broke into her apartment and entered her bedroom. They repeatedly punched her in her face, head, neck and back. The victim was screaming and attempting to defend herself when one of the men placed a knife to her neck and said, \u201c[S]hut up, stop screaming or ... you\u2019re going to f \u2014 ing die.\u201d The men continued to threaten the victim and she stopped screaming. They blindfolded and gagged her, and then searched her apartment. The first assailant, the man with the knife, then straddled her while she lay on the bed and began to ask personal questions about her sexual past. He removed her clothing and forced her into the shower. The victim, who was still blindfolded, could see that the first assailant was Caucasian. He then removed his own clothes and got into the shower, where he fondled her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The victim and the first assailant returned to the bedroom where she complied with his order to lie down on the bed. The assailant told her to remain quiet and keep her eyes closed, after which he removed the blindfold. The victim testified that she was still in shock and \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going to happen. I still didn\u2019t know if 1 was going to get cut with the knife, I still didn\u2019t know if I was going to live or die. The one thought I know I had, I remembered in the back of my mind I wanted to keep myself alive and just try to survive this ordeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The first assailant then sexually assaulted the victim. While he was on top of her, she opened her eyes and saw a \u201cred and black tribal looking tattoo\u201d on his left upper arm. Once the first assailant stopped sexually assaulting the victim, he ordered her to have sex with \u201cCorey,\u201d the second assailant. After Corey sexually assaulted her, the first assailant said, \u201c[Ajlright, we\u2019re done now.\u201d He then ordered the victim to turn around and look at the wall. When she complied, she noticed that the second assailant was standing in the doorway holding a knife and pointing it at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Later, the first assailant asked the victim where her car keys were and she told him. He then blindfolded her, picked up her cordless phone, and told her to not get up or say anything for five minutes to give them time to leave. After she heard the assailants begin to drive away, she looked out the window and watched them drive down the street in her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The victim ran to a neighbor\u2019s apartment for help; the neighbor called 911. An ambulance took the victim to Lakes Region General Hospital, where evidence was collected using a sexual assault kit, and she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>treated and released. The victim then gave a detailed tape-recorded statement to Detective Jeffrey Stiegler at the Laconia police station. During that interview, she stated that she recalled seeing a tattoo on the left bicep of the smaller of the two assailants that was red and black and looked like a tribal design. She also stated that the two assailants were white, and that the first assailant had a tattoo, was shorter than the other, was the leader, and did most of the talking. These were the only identifying statements the victim made with regard to her assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Later that morning, Detective Sergeant William Clary began to investigate the home invasion and sexual assaults. Based upon information developed during the investigation, he, Stiegler and another Belmont police officer went to interview the defendant at his grandmother\u2019s house in Belmont. The defendant\u2019s grandmother answered the door and the officers identified themselves and asked to speak with the defendant. She let the officers into the house, told them that the defendant was sleeping and went to wake him.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">When the defendant entered the kitchen, Clary noticed that the defendant had a red and black tattoo on his shoulder. Clary, Stiegler and the defendant were seated at the kitchen table while the other police officer and the grandmother were standing in the kitchen. The officers asked the defendant if he would speak with them and he agreed. They explained that they were investigating a burglary, sexual assault and theft of a motor vehicle that had occurred in Laconia. During the conversation, the defendant stated that he had been with his cousin, Douglas Jenot, that morning but was unable to account for his whereabouts between 1:30 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. The officers asked the defendant if they could take a photograph of his tattoo and if he would give them a hair sample; he consented to both. However, he refused the officers\u2019 request to obtain a DNA sample by swabbing the inside of his mouth. When it became clear that the defendant would give the officers no further information, they terminated the interview, which did not exceed fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">On April 27, the victim again met with Stiegler. Stiegler showed her the photograph of the defendant\u2019s tattoo. She was not informed of, and did not know, the identity of the person whose arm and tattoo were depicted in the photograph. Nor were there any identifying markers on the photograph. The victim was asked if the tattoo was the same one she saw when she was attacked. She was unable to positively identify the tattoo. Consistent with the statement she gave to Stiegler during that meeting, the victim testified at trial that when shown the photograph of the tattoo, it looked \u201csomewhat familiar\u201d in that it was red and black and had a tribal design. However, she also testified that she did not remember seeing a bulldog in the tattoo on the first assailant\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>On May 5, Stiegler obtained a search warrant to obtain a DNA sample, in the form of a saliva swab to be taken from the defendant. The DNA in the sperm collected from the victim matched the defendant\u2019s DNA. On May 11, 2004, the defendant and Douglas Jenot were both arrested. The police officer who booked Jenot testified that Jenot had no tattoos.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The defendant was indicted on five counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, one count of burglary, and one count of theft by unauthorized taking. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress: (1) statements that he made at his grandmother\u2019s home; (2) the photograph of the tattoo on his arm; and (3) the DNA evidence obtained from the saliva swab. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">A six-day jury trial was held in March 2005. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments, and the court denied the motion. The defendant was convicted of five counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault and one count of theft by unauthorized taking, and acquitted of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Soon after the jury returned the verdicts, the trial court was informed that prior to jury selection, Juror 2 \u2014 the jury foreman \u2014 had posted comments on a web log, or \u201cblog,\u201d that referenced his upcoming jury duty. The court conducted a chambers conference at which the defendant moved to vacate the verdicts. Among other things, he argued that Juror 2\u2019s statements expressed bias against criminal defendants and indicated that he did not understand the presumption of innocence or the burden of proof. The court denied the motion but granted the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors. The trial court conducted a comprehensive <em>voir dire </em>of each juror, after which the defendant again unsuccessfully moved to vacate the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Shortly thereafter, Juror 2 was considered for jury duty in another criminal case. In that case, the Trial Court (Perkins, J.) granted defense counsel\u2019s motion to strike Juror 2 for cause. Based upon that action, the defendant again moved to set aside the jury verdict. The trial court reaffirmed its prior finding that Juror 2 had been a fair and impartial juror, and concluded that nothing in the subsequent jury selection process altered that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motions to set aside the jury verdicts based upon alleged improper conduct and partiality of Juror 2; (2) not dismissing the aggravated felonious sexual assault indictments for failure to present a <em>prima facie </em>case; (3) not directing verdicts of acquittal on the aggravated felonious sexual assault charges; (4) denying his request to stand up in the court room to display his height to the jury; (5) not suppressing statements made at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>grandmother\u2019s house; and (6) admitting evidence of a photograph depicting his tattoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<em>I. Juror Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant argues that Juror 2\u2019s blog contained derogatory and biased opinions regarding criminal defendants and the judicial process, and that his constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated. <em>See </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The blog entries at issue are as follows. Prior to jury selection, Juror 2 wrote, \u201cLucky me, I have Jury Duty! Like my life doesn\u2019t already have enough civic participation in it, now I get to listen to the local riff-raff try and convince me of their innocence.\u201d He also made general comments regarding his impression of the jury selection process, his desire not to serve as a juror, and his disgust at possibly being chosen as a juror for an unrelated child pornography case. Once he was seated on the defendant\u2019s jury, but prior to the start of the trial, Juror 2 wrote: \u201cAfter sitting through 2 days of jury questioning, I was surprised to find that I was not booted due to any strong beliefs I had about police, God, etc.\u201d Prior to trial, Juror 2 also posted: (1) a photograph depicting a woman\u2019s deformed face after she was hit by a drunk driver; and (2) a statement containing his views on a United States Supreme Court decision ruling against the death penalty for juveniles. During the defendant\u2019s trial, Juror 2 made a blog entry that referenced an unrelated shooting incident in Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The trial court learned of Juror 2\u2019s blog soon after the jury returned the verdicts and was released from duty. The court conducted a chambers conference at which it denied the defendant\u2019s first motion to set aside the verdicts, but ruled that further inquiry into Juror 2\u2019s blog and its impact, if any, on the remaining jurors was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The following day, the trial court conducted individual <em>voir dire </em>with each of the jurors, including the alternates. The court began with Juror 2, who acknowledged having a blog. The court then asked the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">Q: Okay. And on that web log you posted, I guess it was February 9th, something to the effect of now you get to listen to the local riff raff trying to convince me of their innocence. And I recognize that that was before you were instructed. Did you understand the instructions that I gave both on a general basis when you first came in and more specifically on this case that the burden of proof is on the state to prove guilt, rather than the defendant to prove innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">A: I did, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Q: Okay. Did you follow those instructions in the course of your deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">A: I did, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">Q: Okay. Did your feeling before those instructions that it is the responsibility of quote, local riff raff to convince you of [their] innocence, did your feeling there in any way interfere with your ability to follow the instructions with respect to the actual burden being on the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">A: It did not, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Q: Okay. Your postings also indicated two other areas that I just want to ask you about. One is you mentioned in your web log certain news articles that you\u2019ve been following.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">First, I want to ask, during the course of this trial from the time \u2014 I know you didn\u2019t come up to the bench, but at any time did you read \u2014 up until the verdict did you read, listen or watch any press coverage of the <em>State v. Goupil </em>case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">A: I did not, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Q: Okay. Your web log mentioned certain coverage with respect to the shootings in Atlanta and certain security concerns raised by that. Did that in any way interfere with your ability to deliberate this case based on the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">A: Absolutely not, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">Q: Okay. Your web log also indicated certain reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion with respect to the death penalty for juveniles. Did that in any way have any impact on your deliberations in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">A: Absolutely not, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">Q: Did you raise any of these issues in terms of the context of this case with any of your colleagues on the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">A: Absolutely not, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">The trial court then consulted with counsel, and defense counsel requested that the court ask Juror 2 additional <em>voir dire </em>questions; the court agreed. When directly asked what his general knowledge was prior to jury selection with respect to the burden of proof in a criminal case, Juror 2 denied having any predisposition or thoughts on who had the burden of proof. The trial court then asked, \u201cSo what was the genesis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the riff raff? Convince me of the innocence remark [sic].\u201d Juror 2 answered, \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t even recall making that remark and it was probably an off-hand remark. There was no real thought behind it.\u201d In response to further questions, Juror 2 stated that he understood the proper burden of proof when he deliberated as a juror on the defendant\u2019s case. He also: (1) denied being exposed to any press coverage regarding this case prior to being drawn as a juror; (2) stated that no one responded to his postings on the web log that related to his jury service on this or any other case; (3) denied receiving any responses to his blog; (4) denied being contacted by anyone trying to influence his decision as a juror; (5) stated that nothing interfered with his ability to follow the jury instructions with respect to the law of the case; and (6) stated that he was absolutely able to make a fair and impartial verdict based upon his evaluation of the evidence in the case as applied to the law given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">During its individual <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors, the trial court informed each juror that one of the jurors had been making postings on a web log that may have influenced the defendant\u2019s case. The court then asked: (1) whether there was any discussion by the jurors about the case before deliberations began; (2) whether each juror understood the burden of proof and presumption of innocence; (3) whether there was any discussion of the shootings in Atlanta as they might possibly relate to this case; and (4) whether there was any reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding the death penalty for juveniles. All of the jurors indicated that there had been no discussion of this case prior to deliberation. All of the jurors indicated their understanding of the State\u2019s burden of proof. All jurors except Juror 13, an alternate, stated that there had been no discussion regarding either the Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding the death penalty for juveniles or the unrelated shootings in Atlanta. Juror 13, however, stated that he vaguely remembered a general discussion regarding the unrelated Atlanta shootings but could recall no specifics.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">All jurors except Juror 4 indicated that they understood the presumption of innocence. Juror 4 initially stated that he believed that the jury did not understand this principle because \u201c[the jurors] were wondering why [the defendant] didn\u2019t take the stand in defense of himself.\u201d Nevertheless, when further questioned, Juror 4 stated that both he and the jury understood the court\u2019s instruction that the defendant had no obligation to take the stand. Juror 4 also indicated that he \u201cunderstood that the obligation to take the stand would be inconsistent with the state\u2019s burden of proving guilt.\u201d At defense counsel\u2019s request, the trial court further questioned Juror 4 in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Q: [Juror 4], in the course of the deliberations you said that there were some jurors who may have wondered why the defendant did not take the stand. In terms of the reaching of the verdicts, was there any question that the jury and all the jurors individually understood by the time the verdicts were rendered that the fact that the defendant [did not take] the witness stand should have no impact on their deliberations whatsoever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Q: I just want to make sure I understand what your no means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">No what? Let me ask it again,... when the jury rendered its verdict ... did you understand any juror to think that they were ... making the finding of guilty because the defendant did not take the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">Q: Okay. All the jurors understood at that point that the defendant had no obligation to take the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">Q: All the jurors at that point understood that the burden of proof is entirely on the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s request to broaden its inquiry further, the trial court specifically asked whether Juror 2 was one of the jurors who expressed confusion regarding why the defendant may not have taken the witness stand; Juror 4 answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">At the conclusion of the individual <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court found that Juror 2 was credible and that he and the remaining jurors understood the law regarding the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court was also satisfied that Juror 2 and the remaining jurors followed the court\u2019s instructions with respect to these principles, as well as other points of law contained in the instructions. The trial court found that there was no indication that there had been any postings on the blog regarding either the defendant\u2019s case or anything that would question Juror 2\u2019s impartiality. Furthermore, the trial court granted defense counsel additional time to submit evidence of any postings to the blog; none was forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erroneously denied his initial motion to set aside the verdicts despite <em>prima facie </em>evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>misconduct by Juror 2. He asserts that Juror 2 published derogatory and biased opinions regarding criminal defendants and the judicial process in his blog, which was available to the public and other jurors sitting on the case. He also asserts that Juror 2 failed to answer the trial court\u2019s pretrial <em>voir dire </em>questions honestly. When considered in conjunction with the cumulative effect of the public information and statements published in his blog, the defendant argues, this constitutes <em>prima facie </em>evidence of partiality and misconduct by Juror 2. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The decision regarding whether to set aside a jury verdict and grant a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Anderson v. Smith, </em>150 N.H. 788, 790 (2004). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it is an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>We first address the issues under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226,231 (1983), and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u201cIt is a fundamental precept of our system of justice that a defendant has the right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Petition of Mello, </em>145 N.H. 358, 361 (2000) (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. Generally, a juror is presumed to be impartial. <em>State v. Rideout, </em>143 N.H. 363, 365 (1999). When a juror\u2019s impartiality is questioned, however, the trial court has a duty to determine whether or not the juror is indifferent. <em>Id. </em>This is a fact-specific determination, which we will not reverse absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion or a finding that the decision is against the weight of the evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u2018When a party makes a colorable claim that a jury is biased or tainted by extrinsic contact or communication, the court must undertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged incident occurred and, if so, whether it was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>Voir dire </em>examination serves to protect the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury by exposing possible biases, both known and unknown, of jurors. <em>Cf. State v. VandeBogart, </em>136 N.H. 107, 110 (1992) (discussing <em>voir dire </em>of potential jurors). \u201cThe trial court has broad, though not unlimited, discretion to determine the extent and nature of its inquiry.\u201d <em>Rideout, </em>143 N.H. at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In a criminal case, the defendant alleging juror bias generally bears the burden to demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>Rideout, </em>143 N.H. at 366. The following two forms of communications with jurors, however, are presumptively prejudicial: (1) communications between jurors and persons associated with the ease about matters unrelated to the case; and (2) unauthorized communications between jurors and others about the case. <em>Id. </em>When presumptively prejudicial communication occurs, the State bears the burden of establishing that the communication was harmless. <em>Id. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>have previously recognized that the following factors are relevant to determining prejudice: (1) whether the matter pending before the court was discussed; (2) whether the party involved was connected with the case and whether the juror knew of the connection; (3) whether the party involved had a substantial role in the case; (4) whether other jurors became aware of the communication or contact; (5) whether the communication or contact extended over a prolonged period of time; (6) the point in deliberations the communication or contact occurred; and (7) the effect of any pertinent instructions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">At the initial chambers conference, the trial court correctly identified the statement regarding \u201cthe local riff-raff\u201d as being the most troubling blog entry. The court, however, recognized that varying inferences could be drawn from that statement as well as other blog entries and concluded that the communications, in and of themselves, did not compel vacating the verdicts. We agree. The meaning of the phrase \u201cthe local riff-raff\u201d is unclear on its face. What Juror 2 meant when he used that phrase is equally unclear. While this statement would reasonably have a negative connotation, we agree with the trial court that it does not constitute sufficient grounds to set aside the jury verdicts without further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Furthermore, during the chambers conference, the defendant alleged only that the communication was posted on the Internet and available to the public. In order to be presumptively prejudicial, the communication had to be either: (1) between jurors and persons associated with the case about matters unrelated to the case; or (2) between jurors and others about the case. <em>See Rideout, </em>143 N.H. at 366. Here, the defendant did not allege that any other jurors even knew of Juror 2\u2019s blog. Nor does the statement, on its face, reference anything specifically related to the defendant\u2019s case. Thus, we cannot conclude that the statement was presumptively prejudicial. Consequently, the defendant had the burden to demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>See id. </em>Absent evidence that other jurors were aware of the blog <em>or any of </em>the statements contained therein, we cannot conclude that the blog, on its face, actually prejudiced the defendant. Nor can we conclude, from the record, that Juror 2 failed to answer the trial court\u2019s pretrial <em>voir dire </em>questions honestly. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s first motion to set aside the verdicts was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred when it failed to set aside the verdicts after conducting <em>voir dire </em>of the entire jury panel. He argues that the <em>voir dire </em>failed to clarify whether the jurors understood the presumption of innocence and burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In <em>VandeBogart, </em>we recognized that, \u201cIt is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>VandeBogart, </em>136 N.H. at 111 (quotation omitted). By extension, this principle applies to a juror\u2019s preconceived or inaccurate understanding regarding the presumption of innocence and proper burden of proof. In this case, we do not dispute that the posted blog statements could reasonably be construed as being derogatory towards criminal defendants. The issue, however, is whether Juror 2 could lay aside this opinion and render a verdict based upon the evidence presented at trial in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions as to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The trial court\u2019s individual <em>voir dire </em>of Juror 2 was comprehensive and thorough. The court found credible Juror 2\u2019s explanation that the riff-raff statement was an off-hand remark. It also found that, despite any misapprehensions Juror 2 may have had prior to reporting for jury selection, he understood and followed the court\u2019s instructions with respect to the proper burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. The trial court concluded that Juror 2 fairly and impartially reviewed the evidence and applied the law as instructed and was, therefore, qualified to sit on the jury panel. We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s findings are against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Moreover, the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the remaining jurors were not affected by the existence of Juror 2\u2019s blog. Each stated that there had been no discussion of the case prior to deliberations, that he or she understood the burden of proof and presumption of innocence as explained in the jury instructions, and that he or she was able to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the facts presented at trial. Thus, the record supports the conclusion that any brief discussions that may have occurred regarding either the unrelated shooting or the United States Supreme Court decision did not taint the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s individual <em>voir dire </em>of the jury panel was inadequate because the court failed to ask two specific questions that the defendant requested: namely, whether each juror had read or responded to Juror 2\u2019s blog while on the panel, and whether the apparent confusion regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to testify came from a juror other than Juror 2. With respect to the first question, none of the jurors indicated that he or she had any discussion regarding the defendant\u2019s case before deliberations. Furthermore, on two occasions, Juror 2 denied receiving any response to statements posted on his blog that were related to the defendant\u2019s case. Thus, based upon the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>before us, there is no indication that further questions on this issue were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Nor are we persuaded that the trial court erred by not further questioning the jury panel regarding purported discussions about the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We have previously recognized that intrajury communication is generally regarded as less serious than extrinsic contact. <em>State v. Bathalon, </em>146 N.H. 485, 488 (2001). Unlike <em>Bathalon, </em>no comment was made in the instant case regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence before the close of the case. Rather, one juror indicated that, during deliberations, some jurors wondered why the defendant did not take the stand. Through its subsequent <em>voir dire of </em>Juror 4, the trial court found Juror 4 and the entire jury panel to be fair and impartial. In light of the trial court\u2019s thorough <em>voir dire, </em>its decision not to further inquire into this matter did not constitute an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See id. </em>(recognizing that courts frequently reject claims of jury taint based upon intra-jury communication).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Next, the defendant argues that, because Juror 2 was disqualified for cause from sitting on a subsequent case, he should have been disqualified from sitting on the defendant\u2019s case. That another trial court subsequently disqualified Juror 2 for cause does not mean that the trial court in this case should have also struck Juror 2. In this case, the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding Juror 2\u2019s impartiality was made after extensive <em>voir dire, </em>and the record supports the trial court\u2019s decision not to set aside the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that he was deprived of his right to exercise a peremptory challenge due to the late disclosure of Juror 2\u2019s blog. The defendant contends that Juror 2 dishonestly remained silent when the trial court asked potential jurors the preliminary <em>voir dire </em>questions and failed to disclose either his blog or his \u201cstrong feelings\u201d referenced in the blog.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court reasoned that it \u201ccannot speculate as to whether the defendant would or would not have exercised a peremptory challenge if he had known of [Juror 2\u2019s] \u2018riffraff\u2019 posting. It is not the court\u2019s function to guess as to the type of information that may be important to a party when exercising a peremptory challenge.\u201d Because the defendant did not request <em>voir dire </em>inquiry as to whether any juror had ever made public (or Internet) comments inconsistent with the presumption of innocence or the burden of proof, and the court made no such inquiry, the trial court found that Juror 2\u2019s silence cannot be construed as a false response. This ruling is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>supported by the record before us. Based upon our conclusions stated above, we hold that the trial court\u2019s ruling was neither untenable nor unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The State Constitution provides at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution under these circumstances. <em>Anderson, </em>150 N.H. at 792; <em>see also United States v. Boylan, </em>898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st Cir. 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 849 (1990). Accordingly, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>II. Motions to Dismiss and for Directed Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The defendant argues the trial court should have dismissed the five aggravated felonious sexual assault charges because the State failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case based upon the language of the indictments. The language in each indictment is identical except for the specific .act of sexual penetration described. Each indictment asserted, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">1. STEPHEN GOUPIL, IN CONCERT WITH AND AIDED BY DOUGLAS JENOT, ENGAGED IN SEXUAL PENETRATION WITH ... [the victim], SPECIFICALLY [a particular act],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">2. STEPHEN GOUPIL AND/OR DOUGLAS JENOT THREATENED TO USE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE UPON [the victim], BY TELLING HER SHE WOULD BE HARMED OR KILLED IF SHE DID NOT SUBMIT TO THE ACT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">3. [The victim].BELIEVED GOUPIL AND/OR JENOT HAD THE PRESENT ABILITY TO EXECUTE THE THREATS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">4. STEPHEN GOUPIL ACTED KNOWINGLY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">The defendant argues that the indictments required the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he verbally threatened the victim prior to each sexual assault by expressly telling her that she would be harmed or killed if she did not submit. He argues that, although the State presented evidence that the victim was verbally threatened before and while the defendant and Jenot searched her apartment, the State presented no evidence that she was verbally threatened before each separate sexual assault. The defendant points to the victim\u2019s testimony that her attackers did not verbally tell her that they would kill her or harm her prior to each separate sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\u201cTo succeed on a sufficiency of the evidence claim, the defendant must show that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. All reasonable inferences derived from the evidence are viewed in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d <em>State v. Grimes, </em>152 N.H. 310, 311-12 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">RSA 632-A-.2,1(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">I. A person is guilty of the felony of aggravated felonious sexual assault if such person engages in sexual penetration with another person under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">(c) When the actor coerces the victim to submit by threatening to use physical violence or superior physical strength on the victim, and the victim believes that the actor has the present ability to execute these threats.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Although this issue is one of first impression, our decision in <em>State v. Kulikowski, </em>132 N.H. 281 (1989), is instructive. In <em>Kulikowski, </em>the defendant was found guilty of, among other things, three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault based upon indictments that alleged a violation of a prior version of the statute here at issue, RSA 632-A:2, III, which required proof that the defendant \u201ccoerce[d] the victim to submit by threatening to use physical violence or superior physical strength on the victim, and the victim believe[d] that the actor ha[d] the present ability to execute these threats.\u201d <em>Kulikowski, </em>132 N.H. at 285. In substance, the indictments in <em>Kulikowski </em>alleged that the defendant coerced his victim into submitting to a sexual act by repeatedly threatening her with physical violence or superior physical strength on numerous previous occasions, some of which occurred more than six years prior to the warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 286. In that case, the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the indictments, arguing that they failed to allege the element of coercion by present threats. <em>Id. </em>at 285. While we acknowledged that the threat and the act of sexual penetration must be close in time, we ruled that threats against the victim may be implicit and may arise from earlier incidents. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that the indictments were sufficient because they alleged present coercion occasioned by repeated prior threats. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Similar to our decision in <em>Kulikowski, </em>we conclude that there need not be an overt, express verbal threat prior to each separate act in order to satisfy the requirements of RSA 632-A:2, 1(c) or the language of the indictments. As detailed above, the victim testified that her attackers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>repeatedly punched her face, head, neck and back, placed a knife to her neck, and threatened to kill her. She testified that, once she stopped screaming, she was told not to move or scream, \u201cor I\u2019m going to cut you up.\u201d While the assailants initially searched the apartment, the victim was left blindfolded in the bedroom. When they returned, the assailant with the tattoo exerted physical force over the victim by sitting on her and ripping her clothes off. The victim testified that, while lying on the bed naked and blindfolded, she was afraid to fight back because \u201c[the assailant] made it very clear if I moved, if I resisted, if I screamed, I would ... die, I would get cut. So I didn\u2019t fight back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The victim\u2019s testimony demonstrates that the threat of force and bodily injury was implicit and ongoing throughout the sexual assaults. There was no break in time between the assailants\u2019 initial entry and physical attack and the subsequent sexual assaults. Nor was there any significant break in time between the different sexual assaults. Although the assailant with the tattoo did not verbally tell her that he was going to kill her, use the knife on her, or beat her before each separate sexual assault, he did tell her repeatedly during the initial search of the apartment and after making her lie down on the bed that he would hurt her if she did not comply. We conclude, therefore, that the initial repeated verbal threats, along with the actual physical assaults and threats with the knife, constituted an implicit threat throughout the entire ordeal. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to interpret RSA 632-A:2,1(c) to require proof of a separate express verbal threat immediately before each separate sexual assault. We also decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to narrowly interpret the indictments as alleging an express verbal threat prior to each sexual assault. The threats were implied throughout the entire ordeal, <em>see Kulikowski, </em>132 N.H. at 285-86, and the evidence presented at trial, when taken in the light most favorable to the State, supports the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We similarly reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have directed verdicts of acquittal on all five counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. \u201cIn an appeal of the denial of a motion for a directed verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant carries the burden of proving that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence most favorably to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Surette, </em>137 N.H. 20, 22 (1993). Given that this standard is the same as the one applied in reviewing the denial of the motion to dismiss the aggravated felonious sexual assault claims, this argument fails for the reasons given above.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\n<em>III. Height Demonstration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The defendant next challenges the denial of his request that he be allowed to stand up in the courtroom and demonstrate his height to the jury. The trial court ruled that the demonstration was inadmissible on relevancy grounds. The defendant argues that the identity of the assailants, and, specifically, the height disparity between them, was a relevant physical characteristic that was admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">All evidence must be relevant to be admissible. N.H. R. Ev. 402. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Relevancy determinations are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not overturn such determinations absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Yates, </em>152 N.H. 245, 249 (2005). \u201cTo demonstrate that the trial court exercised unsustainable discretion, the defendant must show that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">At trial, the victim testified that there was a height disparity between the two assailants and that the assailant with the tattoo was shorter than the other. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony regarding the specific height of each assailant. The victim, however, consistently described the assailants in terms of their height relative to each other. While the defendant alleges that his height was a fact of consequence in this case, it was of consequence only as it compared to the height of the second assailant, who was not present at trial. Therefore, the trial court reasonably found that having the defendant stand up and demonstrate his actual height to the jury had no tendency to make the existence of the height disparity between the two assailants any more or less probable. Accordingly, we find that the trial court\u2019s determination that the height demonstration was inadmissible was neither untenable nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>IV. Suppression of Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The defendant argues that the statements he made during the interview in his grandmother\u2019s home on April 23,2004, should have been suppressed because the police placed him in custody and interrogated him without first notifying him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The police have no obligation to issue <em>Miranda </em>warnings when the person being interviewed is not subject to custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Carroll, </em>138 N.H. 687, 696 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Whether a defendant is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>is essentially a question of fact, and we will uphold the trial court\u2019s finding unless contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence or the result of an error of law. A defendant is in custody if subject to formal arrest or restraint of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest. In the absence of formal arrest, the trial court must consider how much the suspect\u2019s freedom of movement was curtailed and how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood the situation. Factors that the trial court should consider include the suspect\u2019s familiarity with the surroundings, the number of officers present, the degree to which the suspect was physically restrained, and the interview\u2019s duration and character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">After reviewing the record, we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the police did not conduct a custodial interrogation. Three policemen, two of whom were not in uniform, knocked on the door of the defendant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home, asking if they could enter to speak with her grandson. The grandmother consented to the officers\u2019 entrance. The police asked the defendant if he wished to speak with them and he agreed. The ensuing interview occurred in the defendant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home \u2014 surroundings that were both comfortable and familiar to him. He was not physically restrained, and he was clearly free to decline requests from the police, as evidenced by his refusal to allow them to take a DNA swab. When the defendant indicated that he no longer wished to cooperate, the police terminated the interview. The interview did not exceed fifteen minutes. Based upon these facts, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not in custody is neither contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence nor the result of an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>V. Suppression of Photograph</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The defendant argues that the photograph of his tattoo taken during the April 23, 2004 interview was taken in violation of Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution because it was \u201cseized\u201d by the police without a warrant and without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">We will assume, without deciding, that photographing the defendant\u2019s exposed tattoo constituted a seizure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>A voluntary consent free of duress and coercion is a recognized exception to the need for both a warrant and probable cause. The burden is on the State to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent was free, knowing and voluntary. Voluntariness is a question of fact, based on the totality of the circumstances. We will disturb the trial court\u2019s finding of consent only if it is not supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>State v. Watson, </em>151 N.H. 537, 540 (2004) (citations omitted). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant verbally consented to an officer\u2019s request to take a photograph of the tattoo, and that he was aware that he was not required to consent to the photograph because, during the same interview, he refused to allow the police to take a DNA swab of his mouth. Further, as stated above, the April 23 interview was not a custodial interrogation. Accordingly, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The defendant additionally argues that the photograph should have been excluded from evidence because its introduction resulted from an unnecessarily suggestive out-of-court procedure and because the victim failed to identify the tattoo. The out-of-court procedure to which the defendant refers occurred on April 27, 2004, when Stiegler showed the victim the photograph of the tattoo. Stiegler did not tell the victim where the picture was taken or to whom the tattoo belonged. Stiegler showed her the photograph by itself, instead of in an array of photographs. Upon seeing the photograph, the victim was unable to say with any certainty that the tattoo shown was the tattoo belonging to one of her assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The defendant and the State agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that she did not identify the tattoo in the photograph as belonging to her attacker. Accordingly, we need not undertake an analysis of whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive because no identification took place. What the defendant appeals is not a ruling on a motion to suppress an identification, but, rather, a ruling on the admissibility of the photograph. At trial, the State entered the photograph into evidence during direct examination of Kevin Butler, a detective in the Laconia Police Department, who observed the tattoo on the defendant\u2019s arm while processing his arrest. The defendant objected to the introduction of the photograph, stating only, \u201cWe would maintain our position, Judge.\u201d This vague objection apparently reasserted the defendant\u2019s suppression arguments made prior to trial. Our interpretation of the defendant\u2019s objection is consistent with the argument made in his brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cWe will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. To show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Lavoie, </em>152 N.H. 542, 544 (2005) (citation omitted). Because the defendant does not contest the admissibility of the photograph for any reasons other than those addressed prior to trial in the suppression hearing, which are not relevant to the admissibility of the photograph through this witness, we conclude that he has failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
