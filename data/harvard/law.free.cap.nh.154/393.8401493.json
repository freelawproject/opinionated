We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">In January 2005, the plaintiff, a resident and taxpayer in the town of Bedford (town), notified town officials that defendant Christopher Evans had allegedly violated the zoning ordinance governing the merger of two non-conforming lots. The town\u2019s zoning administrator investigated the matter, contacted the town\u2019s legal counsel, and decided against pursuing an enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">In March, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Bedford Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) challenging the decision of the zoning administrator. At the hearing before the ZBA in April, the plaintiff acknowledged that he had no interest in the zoning enforcement matter different from any other citizen in the town and that he was \u201cjust a Bedford resident who would like to see the zoning ordinance enforced.\u201d The ZBA denied the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal on grounds that he lacked standing because he was not an aggrieved party. <em>See </em>RSA 676:5,1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">The plaintiff had earlier filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the superior court requesting that it: (1) order the town to investigate and enforce its zoning ordinance, cancel Evans\u2019 existing permits, and enjoin both the issuance of any further permits to him and his future sale of the lots; (2) declare the lots merged; and (3) award him fees and costs for having to take action as a private citizen to enforce the ordinance. The plaintiff asserted that he had a right to mandamus relief because of his status as a resident of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">In May, at a hearing held in the superior court on the plaintiff\u2019s request for relief, the town filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s petition contending that he lacked standing to bring it. Following the hearing, the trial court granted the town\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The plaintiff argues that because he is a resident and taxpayer in the town, he has standing to appeal a decision of the zoning administrator not to enforce a local zoning ordinance. In ruling on a motion to dismiss, usually \u201cthe trial court is required to determine whether the allegations contained in [a] plaintiff\u2019s pleadings are sufficient to state a basis upon which relief may be granted. To make this determination, the court would normally accept all facts pled by the plaintiff as true, construing them most favorably to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ossipee Auto Parts v. Ossipee Planning Board, </em>134 N.H. 401, 403 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen, however, the motion to dismiss does not contest the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s legal claim, but instead, as in the present case, challenges the plaintiff\u2019s standing to sue, the trial court must look beyond the plaintiff\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations and determine, based on the facts, whether the plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated his right to claim relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We agree with the trial court that the authority to challenge local administrative decisions concerning the enforcement of zoning ordinances is governed by statute. Whether the plaintiff has standing to do so is, therefore, a matter of statutory interpretation. \u201cIn any statutory interpretation case, this court\u2019s task is to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Silva v. Botsch, </em>120 N.H. 600, 601 (1980). \u201cIn making that determination, we begin with the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018When that language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute itself for further indications of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Pursuant to RSA 676:5,1, \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d by any decision of an administrative officer may appeal to the ZBA. \u201c[T]he selectmen, any party to the action or proceedings, or any person directly affected thereby may apply for a rehearing\u201d within thirty days after a decision of the ZBA. RSA 677:2 (Supp. 2006). An appeal from the ZBA\u2019s decision on the motion for rehearing may then be brought in the superior court within thirty days by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d by the order or decision of the ZBA. RSA 677:4 (Supp. 2006). The same statute defines \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d as \u201cany party entitled to request a rehearing under RSA 677:2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">To demonstrate that he is a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d the plaintiff must show some \u201cdirect definite interest in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Caspersen v. Town of Lyme, </em>139 N.H. 637, 640 (1995). \u201c[Standing will not be extended to all persons in the community who might feel that they are hurt by\u201d a local administrator\u2019s decision. <em>Nautilus of Exeter v. Town of Exeter, </em>139 N.H. 450, 452 (1995) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u2018Whether a party has a sufficient interest in the outcome of a planning board or zoning board proceeding to have standing is a factual determination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>each case.\u201d <em>Weeks Restaurant Corp. v. City of Dover, </em>119 N.H. 541, 544-45 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The pertinent statutes plainly limit standing to appeal a decision of an administrative official concerning enforcement of a zoning ordinance either to the ZBA (RSA 676:5) or to the superior court (RSA 677:4) to \u201cpersons aggrieved.\u201d At oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that under the <em>Nautilus </em>decision, he did not qualify as an aggrieved person under the statutory scheme. He argues, however, that he has standing as a town resident and taxpayer to seek mandamus relief to require the town to enforce its zoning ordinance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>Nautilus, </em>the plaintiffs, owners of health clubs in the town of Exeter, sought review in the superior court of approval granted by the local planning board and ZBA of Exeter Hospital\u2019s site plan for the construction of an exercise center. <em>Nautilus, </em>139 N.H. at 451. The plaintiffs claimed standing to appeal based upon their status as \u201ccitizens of the town, property owners, taxpayers, and owners of a business within the commercial district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the superior court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs did not fit the category of \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d because \u201cthe only adverse impact that may be felt by [them] as a result of the ZBA\u2019s decision is that of increased competition with their businesses,\u201d a harm that did not entitle them to standing. <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Because the plaintiff concedes that he is not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under the statutes, he lacks standing to appeal the decision of the administrative officer to the ZBA. Because he lacks standing to appeal to the ZBA, we conclude that he also lacks standing to bring a mandamus action. To hold otherwise would allow the plaintiff to circumvent the clear intent of the legislature to limit standing for zoning appeals to persons aggrieved. <em>See Hooksett Conservation Comm\u2019n v. Hooksett Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>149 N.H. 63, 68 (2003). The zoning statutes are primarily intended to protect the public at large and not the interests of individuals. <em>See </em>RSA 672:1 (1996) (purpose of zoning is to enhance the public health, safety and general welfare). As the trial court correctly concluded, \u201cSince [the plaintiff] has proffered no evidence that he has an interest in this action beyond that of a concerned resident and taxpayer, ... [he] lacks standing to seek mandamus relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-9\">Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
