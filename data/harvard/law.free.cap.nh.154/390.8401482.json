We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The following facts appear in the record. The plaintiff operates Portsmouth Toyota, a new and used motor vehicle dealership in Portsmouth. His property is abutted on three sides by residential districts. The ZBA denied the plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the code enforcement officer\u2019s determination that motor vehicles being offered for sale on the plaintiff\u2019s exterior lot constituted \u201coutdoor storage\u201d and, thus, ran afoul of article II, section. 10-208 (35) of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, which prohibits outdoor storage within 200 feet of a residential or mixed residential district. The plaintiff appealed to the superior court, which affirmed the ZBA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">On appeal, the only issue is the interpretation of the ordinance, a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Duffy v. City of Dover, </em>149 N.H. 178, 181 (2003). Because the traditional rules of statutory construction generally govern our review, the words and phrases of an ordinance should be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we will not guess what the drafters of the ordinance might have intended, or add words that they did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>If the language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the ordinance itself for further indications of legislative intent. <em>Motion Motors v. Berwick, </em>150 N.H. 771, 773 (2004). Words used with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>plain meaning in one part of an ordinance are to be given the same meaning in other parts of the ordinance, unless a contrary intention is clearly shown. <em>Appeal of Denton, </em>147 N.H. 259, 260 (2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Article II, section 10-208 (35) is part of a permitted uses section of the ordinance which designates whether a particular use is acceptable or not. Article II, section 10-208 (35) is the permitted use designation for motor vehicle dealerships. It allows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Motor vehicle sales, renting or leasing, including accessory repair services, for vehicles not requiring tractor registration plates and weighing less than 32,000 pounds; provided, outdoor storage areas are located at least forty feet from the street right-of-way and two hundred feet from any Residential or Mixed Residential district; and, all accessory uses are located within a building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The ordinance defines \u201coutdoor storage\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Storage of materials on a lot without benefit of a structure with four walls and a roof to protect said material from the elements. This definition shall not be deemed to include the outside storage of junk (regulated separately) or as a temporary structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The plaintiff argues that the plain meaning of \u201cmaterials\u201d does not include motor vehicles. The city counters that motor vehicles fall squarely within the definition of \u201cmaterials.\u201d It contends that motor vehicles are the \u201cmaterials\u201d necessary for the selling of motor vehicles and that materials include the \u201ctools or the apparatus for the performance of a given task.\u201d The city advances \u201cgoods,\u201d \u201carticles,\u201d \u201cmerchandise\u201d and \u201cconsumer goods\u201d as synonyms.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The term \u201cmaterials\u201d is not defined in the ordinance. The plain meaning of the noun material(s) is \u201cthe basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, building, fabric) is made.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1392 (unabridged ed. 2002). Under the relevant definition, motor vehicles are not \u201cmaterials,\u201d as they are not \u201cbasic matter\u201d from which \u201cthe whole or the greater part of something physical ... is made.\u201d The nature of materials is that they must be combined with other materials to make a greater whole. A motor vehicle is such a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">We find support for our interpretation in other sections of the zoning ordinance, which distinguish between \u201cmaterial\u201d on the one hand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cvehicles\u201d on the other. For instance, article II, sections 10-209 (38) and (39) refer to outdoor storage of \u201craw or partially finished material, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\u201d The same language appears in the table for airport districts in article II, section 10-210 (32). Material and vehicles are separate entities in the tables for permitted uses. The term material does not subsume vehicles. Thus, under the ordinance, when regulation of vehicles and material is at issue, they are different things.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Although \u201cgoods,\u201d \u201carticles,\u201d \u201cmerchandise\u201d and \u201cconsumer goods\u201d may be synonymous with \u201cmaterials\u201d in other contexts, they are not so in the context of this zoning ordinance. The ordinance differentiates \u201cmaterials\u201d from \u201cgoods\u201d in the definitions section of article I. For example, \u201cIndustrial Occupancies\u201d is defined in terms of \u201cgoods <em>and </em>materials as manufactured and produced on [the] premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, \u201cManufacturing Facility\u201d is defined as a \u201cfacility for the process or operation of making goods <em>or </em>any material produced by hand or machine.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The conclusion we reach is based in part upon the plain meaning and common usage of the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d in these sections of the ordinance. <em>See Merrill v. Great Bay Disposal Serv., </em>125 N.H. 540, 543 (1984). The word \u201cand\u201d is defined as \u201calong with or together with,\u201d \u201cadded to or linked\u201d and \u201cas well as____\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 80 (unabridged ed. 2002). The word \u201cor\u201d is defined as \u201ca function word to indicate an alternative between different or unlike things____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1585. These definitions alone support the conclusion that separate or alternative classes were created by using the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d <em>See Merrill, </em>125 N.H. at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">For all of the above reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision affirming the ZBA\u2019s determination that a variance was necessary and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-12\">Broderick, C.J., and Galway, J., concurred; Hicks, J., with whom DUGGAN, J., joined, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b418-13\">HICKS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMX\">dissenting. The majority employs a dictionary definition to arrive at the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the term \u201cmaterials\u201d to support its conclusion that motor vehicles are not materials subject to the setback requirements for outdoor storage provided in article II, section 10-208(35) of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. The dictionary entry cited, however, contains a number of definitions, one of which I believe supports the city\u2019s argument that the term materials means \u201ctools\u201d or \u201capparatus\u201d for performing a task and that \u201c[t]he \u2018materials\u2019 necessary for the task of a successful car sales operation [are] cars.\u201d Thus, unlike the majority, I find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the term \u201cmaterials\u201d as used in Portsmouth\u2019s zoning ordinance to be ambiguous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">I believe that in such a case we should show some deference to the zoning board\u2019s interpretation of the ordinance. \u201cThe administrative construction of [an] ordinance by the zoning authorities ... [while] neither conclusive nor binding, ... is entitled to consideration.\u201d <em>Trottier v. City of Lebanon, </em>117 N.H. 148, 150 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">As the plaintiff suggests, \u201cone must assume that the code official for the City of Portsmouth made a determination that \u2018for sale\u2019 motor vehicles were \u2018materials\u2019\u201d for purposes of the definition of \u201coutdoor storage.\u201d I believe this \u201cconstruction effectuates the evident purpose of the zoning ordinance and cannot be said to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In the absence of contrary evidence in the record, I presume that the purposes article II, section 10-208(35) are intended to serve are the promotion of aesthetics and safety, and, if nothing else, to prevent unsightly collections of material in offensive proximity to single family homes. <em>Cf. Taylor v. Town of Plaistow, </em>152 N.H. 142, 145 (2005) (noting trial court finding that the \u201cTown primarily focused on aesthetics, safety and planning concerns when drafting and enacting [a] 1,000-foot buffer between vehicular dealerships\u201d). The zoning board\u2019s decision is an appropriate application of the ordinance. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would uphold the trial court\u2019s affirmance of the zoning board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-6\">Duggan, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
