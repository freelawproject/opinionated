J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKg\">Petitioner, a professional property manager, hired an unlicensed and uninsured contractor to install rain gutters on a condominium building, and an employee of the contractor was seriously injured on the first day of the job. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) concluded that petitioner was the employer liable for workers\u2019 compensation. Petitioner contends that the WCAB erred because petitioner was instructed to hire the unlicensed contractor as the agent of the condominium homeowners association or the condominium owners, which were found not liable for workers\u2019 compensation under the Labor Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We conclude that petitioner and the unlicensed contractor were dual employers that are jointly and severally liable for workers\u2019 compensation. The unlicensed contractor employed the injured employee, and petitioner hired the unlicensed contractor as a professional property manager and the agent of the homeowners association. The homeowners association was not an owner or exempt employer under the Labor Code. Even if petitioner were the agent of the condominium owners, an agent may be liable for performing an act authorized by the principal whose rights are not imputed to the agent. Since liability for an agent\u2019s authorized act is imputed to the principal and the homeowners association was a legal entity separate from the owners, we further conclude that the liability of petitioner as agent is imputed to the homeowners association as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Accordingly, the WCAB\u2019s decision is affirmed in part and annulled in part, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Petitioner, Robert P. Heiman, individually, and doing business as Pegasus Properties (Pegasus), a property management business, entered into a condominium management agreement (Agreement) with Montana Villas Homeowners Association (Association), an unincorporated association of residential condominium owners. The Agreement provided that Pegasus as the agent of the Association would manage the condominium property and arrange for repairs of the common area for a fee. The Agreement further provided that employees hired by Pegasus to maintain or repair the property would be employees of the Association, although Pegasus had responsibility to comply with labor laws. The Agreement also provided that expenditures in excess of $100 required approval by the Association, and that Pegasus would be reimbursed for any advances or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">At an Association meeting, condominium owners agreed that new rain gutters should be installed on part of the condominium building as recommended by Pegasus. Pegasus hired Mark Hruby doing business as Rube\u2019s Rain Gutter Service (Hruby), an unlicensed contractor that was also uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation. The job contemplated was no more than two days and the cost was $1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Hruby hired Freddy Aguilera to perform some of the work at $65 a day. On November 5, 1997, the first day of the job, a rain gutter contacted a high-voltage electrical wire and Aguilera was severely shocked and fell and was seriously injured. Hruby completed the job and was paid by check.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Aguilera filed for workers\u2019 compensation naming Hruby as the employer, and the Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (Fund),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pegasus, the Association and the individual condominium owners (owners) were joined as defendants. The parties proceeded to trial and Hruby and Aguilera testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) determined that Hruby was the employer of Aguilera and was liable for workers\u2019 compensation including 90 percent permanent disability. In the opinion, the WCJ explained that even though Hruby did not have the required contractor\u2019s license and was not an independent contractor under section 2750.5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the owners were not employers under section 3351, subdivision (d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because Aguilera had not worked sufficient hours under section 3352, subdivision (h)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Cedillo </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 227 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 581] <em>(Cedillo).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, Aguilera did not. have enough hours for casual employment under section 3715, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The WCJ also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>reasoned that, \u201cthe agents, whether the Association or Pegasus, would be entitled to the rights and liabilities of the owners and should, be deemed owners within Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 3351(d) and 3352(h).\u201d Aguilera petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration that he was permanently totally disabled, and agreed with the Fund that the Association may be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The WCAB granted reconsideration and determined that Hruby \u201cdid not possess a valid contractor\u2019s license at the time of the injury and therefore is not the employer of applicant for purposes of liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d The WCAB determined further that Hmby was hired by Pegasus, \u201ca professional property management business\u201d and \u201can agent for the homeowners\u2019 association,\u201d and \u201ctherefore under Labor Code section 2750.5, became the employer of applicant, Freddy Aguilera.\u201d The WCAB awarded Aguilera workers\u2019 compensation to be paid by Pegasus. The WCAB also ordered further development of the record by the WCJ to determine whether Aguilera was permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Pegasus petitions for writ of review and contends that the WCJ was correct that it was the agent of the Association or owners and not liable under sections 3351, subdivision (d), 3352, subdivision (h) and 3715, subdivision (b). Pegasus also claims that the Association or owners selected Hruby from three bids and paid for the rain gutter installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Fund answers that sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) do not apply since Pegasus was not an owner, even if Pegasus was the agent of the owners or the Association. Pegasus was the joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>employer of Aguilera under section 2750.5 since Pegasus hired Hruby, an unlicensed contractor, as expressly found by the WCJ and WCAB. In addition, all the defendants may have liability as employers under section 3715, subdivision (b) because Aguilera\u2019s labor cost was in excess of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Aguilera answers that he is permanently totally disabled and the Association, which is a separate legal entity, may be liable because Pegasus hired Hruby on behalf of the Association. This court requested further briefing from the parties regarding ownership of the property and liability under the principles of agency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The WCAB responds that Hruby was hired by Pegasus as agent of the Association, which is indicated by the Agreement and minutes from an Association meeting. The WCAB concludes that as the principal the \u201chomeowners\u2019 association may also be held liable as a joint employer of the unlicensed contractor under Labor Code section 2750.5.\u201d The Association is not an exempt employer under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) because it was not an owner and \u201chomeowner associations are separate and independent legal entities from the unit owners.\u201d Even if the Association was an owner, the WCAB reasons, \u201cthe unlicensed contractor\u2019s work for the homeowners\u2019 association was not \u2018personal\u2019 because it was in the course of the association\u2019s trade or business, management of the common areas of the condominium complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Pegasus responds that it hired Hruby as instructed by the directors of the Association and in compliance with the Agreement. It argues the Association is not an owner according to the governing documents and the Civil Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is a liable employer unprotected by sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h); therefore, Pegasus and the directors are not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The owners answer that the Association should be deemed an owner under the Labor Code because homeowners associations have rights and liabilities of owners under the Civil Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Otherwise, the owners contend, they would not receive the benefit of sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) as intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">a. <em>Factual Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\"><em>A </em>decision by the WCAB that is based on factual findings which are substantial evidence is generally affirmed by the reviewing court. <em>(Western Growers Ins. Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 233 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].) However, the reviewing court is authorized to reject factual findings that are erroneous, unreasonable, illogical, improbable, or inequitable when viewed in light of the entire record and the overall statutory scheme. <em>(Western Growers, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 233; <em>Bracken </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 246, 254 [262 Cal.Rptr. 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">b. <em>Statutory Interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Interpretation of governing statutes or application of the law to undisputed facts is decided de novo by the reviewing court, even though the WCAB\u2019s interpretation is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous. <em>(Boehm &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 513, 515-516 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 486] <em>(Boehm &amp; Associates); Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 820, 828 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] <em>(Ralphs Grocery Co.).) </em>The Legislature\u2019s intent should be determined and given effect when interpreting and applying statutes. <em>(DuBois, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 387; <em>Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) The Legislature\u2019s intent is normally determined from the plain meaning of the statutory language, unless the language or intent is uncertain or ambiguous. <em>(DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 387-388; <em>Moyer, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 230.) Interpretation of the statutory language should be consistent with the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>statute and the statutory framework as a whole. <em>(DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 388; <em>Moyer, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 230.) Where statutory language or the Legislature\u2019s intent is uncertain or ambiguous, rules of construction, legislative history or historical use may aid in determining the meaning or intent. <em>(DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 387-388, 393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">2. <em>Hruby Was an Unlicensed Contractor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">A general or specialty contractor must be licensed to perform the contracted work. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7057 et seq., 7065 et seq.)  A contractor that selects, cuts, shapes, fabricates and installs sheet metal such as rain gutters is a specialty contractor who is required to have a class C-43 license. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, \u00a7 832.43.) Hruby testified at trial that he was hired to install rain gutters on the condominium building, and did not have the required class C-43 license on the date of Aguilera\u2019s injury. (See <em>Zellers v. Playa Pacifica, Ltd. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 129, 133-134 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 919] [workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy under \u00a7 2750.5 where property owner hired licensed contractor whose license was expired when employee injured].) This testimony was \u00fancontradicted and unimpeached and is substantial evidence that supports the WCAB\u2019s finding that Hruby was an unlicensed contractor. (See <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317-318 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451]; <em>LeVesque </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 639 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Legal Consequences of Hiring an Unlicensed Contractor.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Among the legal consequences of hiring an unlicensed contractor who is injured or whose employee is injured performing the work is that different employment relationships may arise with respect to \u201cemployer\u201d liability for workers\u2019 compensation or tort damages. For example, in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 5 [219 Cal.Rptr. 13, 706 P.2d 1146] <em>(State Fund), </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a homeowner, who hired an unlicensed contractor that fell from a scaffold, was required to assume the status of \u201cemployer\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation liability; this is so because section 2750.5 requires an independent contractor to be licensed as a matter of law. In <em>Blew v. Homer </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1380 [232 Cal.Rptr. 660] <em>(Blew), </em>a general contractor who hired an unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor was determined to be the \u201cemployer\u201d of the subcontractor and. the subcontractor\u2019s injured employee, and workers\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>compensation was the exclusive remedy against the general contractor. (See also <em>Nick Hagopian Drywall </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 767, 771-772 [251 Cal.Rptr. 455] [licensed and insured contractor \u201cemployed\u201d unlicensed subcontractor\u2019s injured employee who is not estopped for subcontractor\u2019s misrepresentation he had license], which cites <em>Rinaldi v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 217, 221 [244 Cal.Rptr. 637] [licensed and uninsured general contractor \u201cemployed\u201d unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor\u2019s injured employee, who is not estopped for subcontractor\u2019s misrepresentation he had license].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">However, the owner or occupant of a <em>residential </em>dwelling who hires an unlicensed contractor whose employee is injured may not be the \u201cemployer\u201d liable for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5 or section 3351, subdivision (d) unless the employee worked sufficient hours under section 3352, subdivision (h). <em>(Cedillo, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 235-236; see also <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Schriefer </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1608 [280 Cal.Rptr. 16] [matter remanded to determine whether homeowner \u201cemployed\u201d injured unlicensed painter under \u00a7 3352, subd. (h), which controls over \u00a7 2750.5].) Nevertheless, a homeowner may be an \u201cemployer\u201d liable in tort under section 2750.5, and the unlicensed contractor who was also uninsured may be a dual employer with tort liability under section 3706.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Cedillo, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 236-237.) Since Hruby was an unlicensed contractor when he contracted with Pegasus and at the time Aguilera was injured on the job, it is necessary for us to examine the potential employment relationships in order to determine liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">3. <em>Hruby Is a Liable Employer Under Division 4 of the Labor Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The WCAB determined that Pegasus was the \u201cemployer\u201d hable for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5 and the Labor Code. Pegasus contends that the WCJ correctly found that Hruby was the liable employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Generally, employment relationships that result in workers\u2019 compensation liability are predicated more upon the definitions pertaining to employees under section 3351 et seq. than employers under section 3300 et seq. <em>(In-Home Supportive Services </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 720, 727-728 [199 Cal.Rptr. 697] <em>(In-Home Supportive Services).)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>definitions are an outgrowth and expansion of common law employment concepts such as the employer\u2019s right of control over service provided by the employee. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 727-729.) In addition, the definitions are part of division 4 of the Labor Code, which specifically addresses workers\u2019 compensation. Section 2750.5 is part of division 3 of the Labor Code which supplements' and does not override the division 4 definitions of employers and employees. <em>(State Fund, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 9-15; <em>Cedillo, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 232-234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Applying these principles, we conclude that Hruby was a dual employer of Aguilera and is liable for workers\u2019 compensation under division 4 of the Labor Code. It is undisputed that Hruby hired Aguilera to perform service within the meaning of sections 3351 and 3300.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By rendering service, Aguilera is presumed to be Hruby\u2019s employee under section 3357.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Aguilera rendered the service as an employee, and not as an independent contractor under sections 3357 and 3353,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because Hruby was in the business of rain gutter installation, contracted with Pegasus, paid wages and controlled Aguilera\u2019s work and hours. (See <em>S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 350-355 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"> In addition, section 2750.5 supplements and does not negate application of the division 4 definitions of employer and employee to Hruby. Although the WCAB determined that Pegasus and not Hruby was the \u201cemployer\u201d solely liable for workers\u2019 compensation, <em>Cedillo </em>indicates that there may be dual employment of an injured employee by the unlicensed contractor under division 4 of the Labor Code <em>and </em>the contractor\u2019s hirer under section 2750.5. <em>(Cedillo, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 235-236.) In <em>Cedillo, </em>the unlicensed contractor contended that he could not be the employee of the homeowner under section 2750.5 and the employer of the injured employee at the same time. The court explained that a similar claim was rejected in <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Chavez Roofing, Inc. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1092 [286 Cal.Rptr. 919], where the unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor was potentially liable in tort under section 3706, even though the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>contractor was licensed and insured for workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(Cedillo, </em>supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 236.) Section 3706 is part of division 4 of the Labor Code and subjects employers under the division to an action at law as if the division did not apply for failing to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation. In addition to the civil action authorized by section 3706, workers\u2019 compensation is a cumulative remedy under section 3715.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (See <em>Le Parc Community Assn. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 408] <em>(Le Parc).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In this case, Hraby admitted at trial that he was an unlicensed contractor and illegally uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation when Aguilera whom he had hired was injured on the job. Consequently, Hraby is liable to Aguilera for workers\u2019 compensation under section 3715, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and is potentially liable in tort under section 3706. <em>(Cedillo, </em>supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 235-236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">4. <em>Pegasus Is a Liable \u201cEmployer\u201d Under Section 2750.5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The WCAB determined that Pegasus is the liable \u201cemployer\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5, <em>State Fund </em>and <em>Blew </em>because Pegasus hired Hraby who was an unlicensed contractor when Aguilera was injured. Pegasus contends that the WCAB erred because the Association or owners selected Hraby from three bids and instructed Pegasus to hire Hraby as indicated by the Agreement and payment from the Association\u2019s account. The Fund answers that the claimed bids and payment are not part of the record, and the WCAB\u2019s finding that Pegasus hired Hraby is based on substantial evidence and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">a. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Finding That Pegasus Hired Hruby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Only the invoice from Hraby, which was billed to Pegasus, is part of the record and the alleged bids and documentation of who actually paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the work is not. However, the WCJ reported that the owners agreed to the installation of new rain gutters at an Association meeting, and the WCAB indicates that Pegasus was authorized to obtain bids based on the Association\u2019s minutes. We also note that the Agreement provides that repairs in excess of $100 must be approved by the Association, and that Pegasus was the Association\u2019s agent. The Agreement further provides that Pegasus was an independent contractor in the business of managing properties, which is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the Association or owners received bids, instructed Pegasus who to hire or had- any direct involvement with Hraby. In addition, Hraby testified at trial that he agreed to install rain gutters on the condominium building with Pegasus, and did not recall contact with the owners of whose check paid for the job. These facts confirm that the agreement for installation of the rain gutters was between Hraby and Pegasus, which was an independent contractor in the business of managing properties that was acting on behalf of the Association. Therefore, the WCAB\u2019s determination that Hraby was hired by Pegasus is supported by substantial evidence. Since Hraby was an unlicensed contractor when Aguilera was injured on the job <em>and </em>when Pegasus hired Hraby, Pegasus was an \u201cemployer\u201d that is jointly and severally liable for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5, <em>State Fund </em>and <em>Blew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">b. <em>Pegasus Was the Association\u2019s Agent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Pegasus contends further that even if it hired Hraby, the WCJ was correct that it was the agent of the Association or owners and should be deemed an owner and exempt employer under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) and <em>Cedillo. </em>However, the WCAB determined that Pegasus was the agent of the Association and neither were owners. The Fund argues that Pegasus was not an owner regardless of agency status. Although Pegasus concedes it was not an owner, we shall address whether Pegasus was the agent of the Association or owners and should be deemed an owner within the meaning of sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">(1) <em>The Agreement. .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">There is substantial evidence supporting the WCAB\u2019s finding that Pegasus was the Association\u2019s agent when Pegasus hired Hraby. An agent generally represents the principal in dealings with third persons (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2295), may be authorized to do any act the principal may do (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2304), and receives authority either by prior agreement or ratification (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2307). Prior authority was clearly provided by the Agreement and the Association meeting. The Agreement was between the Association and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Pegasus, and was also executed by the Association\u2019s president and treasurer and Pegasus. Moreover, the Agreement provides that Pegasus is an independent contractor in the business of managing properties and the agent of the Association. The Agreement also states that Pegasus is authorized to manage the condominium building and provide for repairs, including the hiring of others, with Association oversight, approval of expenditures over $100 and reimbursement for advances or costs. Pursuant to the Agreement and the Association meeting, the rain gutter repair and installation was authorized and Pegasus hired Hruby, who completed the job and was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">(2) <em>The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The agency relationship between Pegasus and the Association under the Agreement is also consistent with the statutory scheme under Civil Code section 1350 et seq., which specifically address common interest developments such as condominium projects and associations and is known as the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. (See <em>Lamden v. La Jolla Shores Clubdominium Homeowners Assn. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 249, 252 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 237, 980 P.2d 940] (Lamden) [property damage from unincorporated homeowners association spot treatment of termite infestation is subject to good faith business judgment rule and not personal injury negligence standard].) Under Civil Code section 1363, subdivision (a), \u201cA common interest development shall be managed by an association that may be incorporated or unincorporated.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cthe association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the common areas\u201d under Civil Code section 1364, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">It is also well established that a homeowners association is a separate legal entity apart from the owners, whether incorporated or not, with standing to sue or be sued even by a member. In <em>White v. Cox </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 824, 828-831 [95 Cal-Rptr. 259] <em>(White), </em>the court concluded that an unincorporated condominium association was a separate legal entity, which could be sued for negligence by a condominium owner. Similarly, the Supreme Court in <em>Frances T. v. Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 490, 499-500 [229 Cal.Rptr. 456] <em>(Frances T.) </em>cited <em>White </em>with approval in concluding that an unincorporated condominium association has a separate legal existence, and could be held to a landlord\u2019s duty of care to provide safety to its members. (See also <em>Lamden, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp 260-261; Corp. Code, \u00a7 18105 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Civil Code section 1363.2 also provides for a \u201cmanaging agent,\u201d which under subdivision (f) is defined as \u201ca person or entity, who for compensation, or in expectation of compensation, exercises control over the assets of the association\u201d and \u201cdoes not include a full-time employee of the association.\u201d The statute further provides that the \u201cmanaging agent\u201d is authorized to receive funds belonging to the association for deposit into a trust fund account. (See also Corp. Code, \u00a7 18065, which was enacted in 2004 and provides: \u201cExcept to the extent this title provides a specific rule, the general law of agency, including Article 2 (commencing with Section 2019) of Chapter 2 of Title 6 of, and Title 9 (commencing with Section 2295) of, Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, applies to an unincorporated association.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In this- case, the Association was unincorporated and a separate legal entity that delegated management and maintenance of the condominium building to Pegasus as the \u201cmanaging agent\u201d under the Agreement and the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. Consistent with the Civil Code, the Agreement further provided that Pegasus was a paid independent contractor and not an employee, whose duties included collecting and depositing into the Association\u2019s account membership dues, fees, or assessments and preparing checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">c. <em>Pegasus\u2019s Liability Is Unchanged by Its Agency Status.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Pegasus contends that as the agent of the Association or owners, it has the same rights or legal status as its principal under Civil Code section 2330<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and is an owner and exempt employer under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Civil Code section 2330 plainly states that' rights and liabilities accrue from the agent\u2019s authorized acts to the principal. The statute does not state that the principal\u2019s rights or defenses accrue to the agent. Moreover, Pegasus was the agent of the Association, not the owners, as determined by the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>It is also well established that an agent may be liable for his or her own acts on behalf of the principal whether or not the principal is liable. (See <em>Frances T., supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 505, 511.) For example, in <em>Cowell v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 172, 176-177 [78 P.2d 1016] <em>(Cowell), </em>a corporate cement business, which also managed the stockholders\u2019 ranch and hired the ranch hand who was injured, was determined to be the agent and joint employer. And although liability of the county as the state\u2019s agent was not addressed in <em>In-Home Supportive Services, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at pages 729-730, the state as principad was determined to be a dual employer because the county hired the injured employee and both had the right of supervision and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In this case, Hruby was hired directly by Pegasus as the \u201cmanaging agent\u201d on behalf of the Association. Since Pegasus was also an independent contractor in the business of managing properties and Hruby had no dealings with the Association, Pegasus \u201cwas in the best position to make the determination whether the price of the contract reflected the cost of insurance for workers\u2019 compensation purposes and whether Mr. Hruby was properly licensed to perform the work\u201d as stated by the WCAB. Moreover, the Agreement provided that Pegasus had responsibility for labor laws even though employees hired to perform maintenance or repairs would be employees of the Association. For these reasons, we conclude that Pegasus is an \u201cemployer\u201d liable for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5, and is not exempted under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) whether the agent of the Association or the owners. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2330; <em>Cowell, supra, </em>11 Cal.2d at pp. 176-177; <em>In-Home Supportive Services, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at pp. 729-730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">5. <em>The Association Is Liable as Principal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Throughout the proceedings, Aguilera, the Fund, Pegasus and the WCAB have taken the position that the Association is liable because Hruby, who was an unlicensed contractor, was hired by Pegasus as the agent of the Association. As we have already noted, we have concluded that Pegasus is an employer that is jointly and severally liable for workers\u2019 compensation under section 2750.5, <em>State Fund </em>and <em>Blew. </em>In addition, we have concluded that Hruby was hired by Pegasus as the agent of the Association, which is the principal and a separate legal entity. We have also explained that liability for an agent\u2019s authorized acts may be imputed from the agent to the principal pursuant to Civil Code section 2330, <em>Cowell </em>and <em>In-Home Supportive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Services.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even if the Association were also the agent of the owners as reasoned by the WCJ, the Association may be liable for it's own acts. (See <em>Frances T., supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The owners admit the agency relationship between P\u00e9gasus and the Association but contend, as determined by the WCJ, that the Association should be deemed an owner and exempt \u201cemployer\u201d under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h). Otherwise the owners will not benefit from sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h) as the Legislature intended, \u201csince imposing liability on the homeowner\u2019s association would necessarily impose liability on each individual homeowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">However, we need not decide whether the Associ\u00e1tion should be deemed an owner and an exempt \u201cemployer\u201d since we agree with the WCAB that the duties of Hruby and Aguilera were not \u201cpersonal\u201d and were in the \u201ctrade or business\u201d of the Association contrary to section 3351, subdivision ,(d). The owners do not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Although under section 3351, subdivision (d) an employee is a person \u201cwhose duties are incidental to the ownership, maintenance, or use of the dwelling, including the care and supervision of children, <em>or </em>whose duties are- personal- and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of the owner or occupant\u201d (italics added), the WCAB\u2019s interpretation that the language defining duties should be read together rather than separately is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous. (See <em>Boehm &amp; Associates, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th atpp. 515-516; <em>Ralphs Grocery Co., supra,, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 828; <em>Nunez v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 584, 587 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 914].) We note that when the Legislature added and revised section 3351, subdivision (d)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and Insurance Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>sections 11590<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and 11591,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> so that homeowner liability policies would provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for residential employees,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> coverage for duties performed in the business of the insured was expressly excluded. Moreover, each statute contains language or references to the other statutes that indicate the Legislature intended these statutes to be interrelated and read together.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, the WCAB\u2019s interpretation of section 3351, subdivision (d), that the language defining duties should be read together, is consistent with the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In addition, the WCAB\u2019s determination that the rain gutter repair and installation was not \u201cpersonal\u201d and was in the \u201ctrade or business\u201d of the Association under section 3351, subdivision (d) is consistent with the record, the Labor Code and the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. The Association managed the condominium building and provided for maintenance or repairs pursuant to the Agreement and Civil Code section 1364, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>subdivision (a).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The services provided by Hruby and Aguilera were also for maintenance or repairs within the meaning of section 3355,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and management and maintenance by the Association were provided on a regular basis under the Agreement and section 33 56.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, the Association had corporate powers to finance, contract and conduct business under Civil Code section 1363, subdivision (c)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and Corporations Code section 7140.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Association performed these functions through its officers or directors and Pegasus as the paid \u201cmanaging agent\u201d under the Agreement and the Civil Code. Consequently, the duties performed by Hruby and Aguilera were not \u201cpersonal\u201d and were in the \u201ctrade, business\u201d of the Association, and the Association was not an owner and exempt \u201cemployer\u201d under sections 3351, subdivision (d) and 3352, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Therefore, the Association is liable for workers\u2019 compensation as the principal of Pegasus.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">6. <em>The Owners Are Not Liable for Workers\u2019 Compensation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We agree with the WCJ and the WCAB that the owners are not liable for workers\u2019 compensation as either an \u201cemployer\u201d under section 2750.5 or an employer under section 3351, subdivision (d) because Aguilera did not work sufficient hours under section 3352, subdivision (h). <em>(Cedillo, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 235-236.) Even if the Association or Pegasus is the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>of the owners as suggested by the WCJ, \u201cemployer\u201d liability for workers\u2019 compensation is not imputed to the owners as principals because of the statutory immunity provided under the Labor Code. (See <em>ECC Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ganson </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 572, 575-576 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 292] [condominium owners not personally liable under Corp.

Nor are the owners \u201cemployers\u201d that are liable for workers\u2019 compensation solely for being members of the Association since generally \u201c[a] member of an unincorporated association does not incur liability for acts of the association or acts of its members which he did not authorize or perform.\u201d <em>(White, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 827 citing <em>Orser </em>v. <em>George </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 660, 670-671 [60 Cal.Rptr. 708]; <em>Security-First Nat.

The WCAB\u2019s decision awards Aguilera workers\u2019 compensation to be paid <em>solely </em>by Pegasus.
