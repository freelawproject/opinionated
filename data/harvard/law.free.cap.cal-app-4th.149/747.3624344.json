J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akn\">Appellant Roger Schlafly, former husband of respondent Julie Schlafly, appeals from an order modifying child support. Roger<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claims that the court erred in imposing a child support payment that deviated from the guideline amount and in retroactively modifying child support without using actual income figures. Roger also claims the court erred in imposing an attorney\u2019s fees order contradicting an earlier order by the court. We conclude that the court erred in imputing $3,000 of nontaxable income per month based on Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing. We therefore reverse the December 20, 2005 child support order and remand the action for further proceedings. We affirm the attorney\u2019s fees order.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Roger and Julie married in December 1996 and have two minor children, Millicent (bom in 1997) and Geneva (bom in 1999). Millicent was bom three weeks after Julie graduated from law school, about six months into the marriage, and Julie remained at home throughout the marriage to care for the children. Roger, a mathematician, is self-employed and is an independent contractor in the computer software industry. In addition to other assets, Roger owns a minority interest in a closely held corporation, several patents, his own business, and a mortgage-free home.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The couple separated in October 2003, and Julie filed for dissolution of marriage. The parties initially split custody of the children 50-50 by mutual agreement, and, in July 2004, the court ordered Roger to provide Julie a temporary support payment of $3,000 per month. The court also set a hearing in August 2004 to discuss financial issues and ordered Roger to file and serve an income and expense declaration and to provide recent tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">During the August 30, 2004 hearing, the court (the Hon. Thomas Kelly presiding) chastised Roger for providing \u201cevasive\u201d answers and incomplete information regarding his financial situation. The court ultimately ordered $2,759 in child support, retroactive to July 1, 2004. hr doing so, the court deviated from the guideline amount of $1,697 based on Roger\u2019s \u201cliving mortgage-free in house worth 3K/month.\u201d The additional $1,062 increased Roger\u2019s total support payment to $4,000 per month. The support order was made retroactively modifiable so that it could be revised when the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cmore information on father\u2019s actual income\u201d and on Julie\u2019s efforts to enter the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On November 16, 2004, Roger\u2019s custody percentage decreased from 50 percent to approximately 20 percent. On May 13, 2005, the court conducted another status hearing regarding financial issues. Judge Kelly modified the temporary support figures to reflect the adjusted timeshare, retroactive to November 16. In doing so, the court expressly stated'that it was not taking into account the fact that Roger lived in a mortgage-free house: \u201cSince today is a snapshot, temporary order, I\u2019m not going to depart from guideline [based on a lack of mortgage] .... But she\u2019s going to make an argument next month I should depart from guideline as I did before.\u201d The child support order thus was modified to $2,575, the DissoMaster guideline amount based on the financial information then available. The court again ordered Roger to produce financial documents, intending to address the mortgage-free housing issue at a later hearing when the court believed more accurate information would be available. The support orders were again made retroactively modifiable, and the court entered a judgment of dissolution as to status only.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Roger provided Julie with his 2004 tax return in October 2005, and a new hearing was set for December 2005 before Commissioner Irwin H. Joseph, who took over the case from Judge Kelly. On December 20, 2005, the court issued a new child support order of $2,525, effective January 1, 2006, \u201cbased on changed income and timeshare for father.\u201d The court ordered further modification, effective January 23,-2006, to $2,112, based on an anticipated increase in Roger\u2019s timeshare to 50 percent. In calculating the new payments, the court imputed a 3 percent rate of return for Roger\u2019s stock market portfolio as taxable income and imputed $3,000 in nontaxable income per month based on Roger\u2019s m\u00f3ftgage-ff\u00e9e housing. After calculating the guideline amount, the coto added $500 to provide for the children\u2019s education and activities, split evenly between the parties. Julie waived her rights to any future spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the December 20 order, the court also addressed past support payments. The court modified the child support order, effective November 16, 2004, to account for Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing, noting that \u201cJudge Kelly failed to perpetuate his calculated deviation for father\u2019s housing circumstance. \u201d In this instance, the court adopted Judge Kelly\u2019s approach and added $1,062 to the guideline amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Roger filed a motion for modification, deemed a motion for reconsideration, contesting both the December 20 child support order and a December 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>order regarding attorney\u2019s fees. The court denied the motion on February 16, 2005. Roger timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Statutory guidelines regulate the determination of child support in California. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4050-4203.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The guidelines set forth several important principles relating to child support determinations, including that (1) the interests of the child are the state\u2019s top priority, (2) a parent\u2019s principal obligation is to support his or her children \u201caccording to the parent\u2019s circumstances and station in life,\u201d (3) \u201c[b]oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,\u201d (4) \u201c[e]ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,\u201d (5) children should share in both parents\u2019 standard of living, and (6) in cases \u201cin which both parents have high levels of responsibility for the children,\u201d child support orders \u201cshould reflect the increased costs of raising the children in two homes and should minimize significant disparities in the children\u2019s living standards in the two homes.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subds. (a), (b), (d)-(g).) The guideline amount of child support, which is calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the relative incomes of the parents, is presumptively correct. (See \u00a7\u00a7 4055, 4057, subd. (a); <em>In re Marriage of de Guigne </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1359 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 430] <em>(de Guigne).) </em>\u201cThe court may depart from the guideline only in \u2018special circumstances\u2019 set forth in the child support statutes. (\u00a7 4052.)\u201d <em>(County of Stanislaus </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1419 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 819].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">A child support order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Marriage of Cheriton </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 269, 282 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] <em>(Cheriton); </em>see also <em>In re Marriage of Destein </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1393 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 487] <em>(Destein) </em>[\u201cA trial court\u2019s decision to impute income to a parent for child support purposes based on the parent\u2019s earning capacity is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d].) We determine \u201cwhether the court\u2019s factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.\u201d <em>(de Guigne, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1360.) We do not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court, but determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In this case, Roger claims the court \u201cerroneously deviated from [the] guideline\u201d amount by imputing a rate of return to his stock portfolio that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>exceeds the actual rate of return, by including $3,000 of nontaxable income based on his mortgage-free housing, and by imposing a discretionary add-on for the children\u2019s activities. He also claims the court failed to comply with section 4056, modified a temporary child support order using inaccurate figures, and erred in ordering him to pay an additional $6,500 in Julie\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">A. Imputation of 3 Percent Rate of Return</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Roger first objects to the court\u2019s imputation of a 3 percent rate of return on his stock market portfolio. At the time of the order, Roger\u2019s portfolio contained approximately $2.9 million in assets and, according to Roger, paid dividends of about 1.6 percent annually.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Roger conteiids that because the portfolio was income producing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court was required to use the actual income received and was not authorized to impute additional income. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Section 4058, which defines annual gross income for purposes of child support calculations, expressly provides: \u201cThe court may, in its discretion, consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent\u2019s income, consistent with the best interests of the children.\u201d (\u00a7 4058, subd. (b).) This earning capacity doctrine \u201cembraces the ability to earn from capital as well as labor.\u201d <em>(de Guigne, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 1363; see also <em>Mejia v. Reed </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 657, 671 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 390, 74 P.3d 166] [\u201c[i]n assessing earning capacity, a trial court may take into account the earnings from invested assets\u201d].) \u201cJust as a parent cannot shirk his parental obligations by reducing his earning capacity through unemployment or underemployment, he cannot shirk the obligation to support his child by <em>underutilizing </em>income-producing assets.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Dacumos </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 150, 155 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 159] <em>(Dacumos), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In this case, the court implicitly determined that Roger\u2019s 1.6 percent return on almost $3 million of assets was an underutilization of the assets and that imputing a higher rate of return was in the best interests of the children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The court explained that the 3 percent figure was a more accurate reflection of the value of the assets; unless Roger was earning at least 3 percent annually in the stock market, he would invest in bonds and be guaranteed a 3 percent return. This determination was within the court\u2019s discretion. (See <em>In re Marriage of LaBass &amp; Munsee </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1340 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 393] (LaBass) [\u201cSection 4058 is unmistakably clear that the only qualification to the discretionary imputation of income is that it be consistent with the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d]; <em>Destein, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1396 [\u201c[O]ur Supreme Court has refused to read any limitation into a trial court\u2019s discretion to impute income when in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The court\u2019s decision is well supported by California case law. <em>Dacumos, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 150 provides one persuasive example. In that case, the father owned two rental properties that generated higher expenses than the amount received in rent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 153.) The trial court nevertheless imputed rental income based on the fair market rental value of the properties, and the father\u2019s net equity in the properties. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate court concluded that a broad \u201cdefinition of earning capacity to include income that could be derived from income-producing assets as well as from work is in accord with the legislative intent\u201d and found no error. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 154-155.) We find no basis to distinguish <em>Dacumos, </em>in which the properties were utilized as rentals but were underperforming, from the case at hand. Roger\u2019s $2.9 million stock market portfolio earns only the barest amount of \u201cincome,\u201d and, thus, is underutilized as an income-producing asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Roger cites as support <em>In re Marriage of Pearlstein </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1374-1375 [40, Cal.Rptr.3d 910], in which the court held that stock received in the sale of the father\u2019s business was a capital asset, not income. The court\u2019s holding is not contrary to the approach taken in this case. The <em>Pearlstein </em>court in fact held that although the stock was a capital asset, \u201cin the court\u2019s discretion, a reasonable rate of investment return could be imputed to the value of the stock that was available for sale, and that amount added to [the father\u2019s] gross income . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1376.) That is precisely the approach taken in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Roger\u2019s argument that the imputation is invalid because the court has no authority to direct his investment strategy also is unavailing. The trial court has broad discretionary authority to impute income and need not defer to the parent\u2019s choice of investment. <em>(Destein, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1391.) Roger\u2019s decision to prioritize future value over current income does not mean that the $2.9 million in assets must be disregarded as a source of support. As the <em>Destein </em>court explained, quoting an opinion by the New York Court of Appeals, a parent \u201c \u2018may be required to make his considerable assets earn income which, by an objective standard, is commensurate with at least a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>conservative estimate of what they are capable of producing, and, when he fails to do so, he may be treated as though he had; his decision to let them grow for his own future benefit is not one which the courts are obliged to honor in all circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1395, quoting <em>Kay v. Kay </em>(1975) 37 N.Y.2d 632 [339 N.E.2d 143, 376 N.Y.S.2d 443].) Ignoring the stock market portfolio, or recognizing only a small fraction of its substantial value, would \u201ceffectively permit[] [Roger] to avoid his obligation to support his children according to his \u2018ability,\u2019 his \u2018circumstances and station in life,\u2019 and his \u2018standard of living.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cheriton, </em>supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 292, quoting \u00a7 4053, subds. (a), (d) &amp; (f); see also <em>Destein, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1395 [noting that a parent may not place a source of possible income \u201c \u2018 \u201coff-limits\u201d \u2019 \u201d through his or her choice of investment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We next consider the court\u2019s use of 3 percent as a reasonable rate of return. As Roger rightly contends, \u201cfigures for earning capacity cannot be drawn from thin air; they must have some tangible evidentiary foundation.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Cohn </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 923, 931 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 866].) In this case, however, we find ample support for the imputed rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">At the December hearing, the court explained that 3 percent represents the minimum anticipated return on investment for bonds or certificates of deposit. Roger did not contest the assumption that 3 percent was a reasonable rate of return for these types of investments, just that they were not his preferred forms of investment; in fact, Roger acknowledged that certificates of deposit and some bonds would pay 3 percent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore find that the application of a 3 percent rate of return\u2014an estimate that is supported by common knowledge and common sense\u2014is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Finally, we reject Roger\u2019s argument that the court erred in failing to comply with section 4056. Section 4056 requires the court, among other things, to state in writing or on the record the reasons it deviated from the guideline amount and why the deviation is in the best interests of the children. (\u00a7 4056, subd. (a).) The court\u2019s decision to substitute earning capacity for actual income is not, however, a deviation that requires compliance with section 4056. <em>(LaBass, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1336-1337.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The imputation of income relates to an input in the guideline calculation, and is not a deviation from the final guideline amount. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1337.) We therefore find no error in the court\u2019s failure to note \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d justifying the imputation of a 3 percent rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In sum, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s imputation of income relating to Roger\u2019s $2.9 million stock market portfolio.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">B. Mortgage-free Housing</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Roger next objects that the court erroneously \u201cdeviated\u201d from the guideline in including $3,000 in the income calculation to account for his mortgage-free home.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The impact of free housing on child support payments has been discussed in several different cases. In two <em>cases\u2014Stewart v. Gomez </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1748 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 531] <em>(Stewart) </em>and <em>County of Kern v. Castle </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1442 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 874] (Kern)\u2014the court characterized the fair value of the obligor parent\u2019s free housing as income. In <em>Stewart, </em>the father lived rent free on an Indian reservation. <em>(Stewart, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1754-1755.) The trial court included \u201cthe reasonable value of the free rent he received\u201d as part of the father\u2019s section 4058 income in calculating child support. <em>(Stewart, </em>at p. 1752.) The appellate court affirmed, citing subdivision (a)(3) of section 4058, which gives the court discretion to consider as income \u201c \u2018employee benefits or self-employment benefits, taking into consideration the benefit to the employee, <em>any corresponding reduction in living expenses, </em>and other relevant facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stewart, </em>at p. 1755-1756.) The court concluded that there was \u201cno reason to distinguish an employee housing benefit from an Indian reservation housing benefit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1755.) Thus, the trial court \u201cproperly included the reasonable rental value of [the father\u2019s] house as income.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The appellate court in <em>Kern, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at pages 1456-1458, found that the lower court erred in excluding from income any consideration of the benefits the father received as a result of his $1 million inheritance. Citing <em>Stewart, </em>the court observed that, among other things, \u201cthe trial court here could have discretionarily considered as income the mortgage-free housing [the father] was living in because he paid the mortgage off with part of the proceeds from his inheritance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The Fourth District, in <em>In re Marriage of Loh </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 325, 333-336 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 893] <em>(Loh), </em>discussed at length the propriety of incorporating nontaxable benefits into child support calculations and ultimately disagreed with the approach set forth in <em>Stewart </em>and recognized in <em>Kern. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Reiterating that income tax returns are presumptively correct in calculating a parent\u2019s income, the <em>Loh </em>court observed that <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Kern </em>\u201cdeparted altogether from an income tax model of section 4058 income with regard to certain free housing benefits.\" <em>(Loh, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 332-333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The <em>Loh </em>court first questioned the limits of a rale that allows courts to consider anything that reduces living expenses as income, pointing out that it leads to support payments based on money the parent does not have. <em>(Loh, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 334.) Moreover, the <em>Stewart </em>rale, which recognizes as income free housing provided by third parties, is incongruous when compared to the prohibition on considering free housing provided by a new partner or spouse in ordering child support. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 334-335.) Second, the court noted that section 4058, subdivision (a)(3) refers to <em>employee </em>benefits that reduce living expenses, and found no statutory justification for interpreting the.plain language of the statute to include as income reductions in living expenses not related to employment. (93 Cal.App.4th at p. 335.) The <em>Loh </em>court therefore concluded that if a trial court determines that a parent\u2019s housing situation (or other lifestyle factors) renders application of the guideline amount inappropriate or unjust, such a fact may be considered in a deviation from the guideline, but may not be included as nontaxable income. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 335-336.) \u201c[T]he proper course [i]s to first calculate the guideline amount in light of the parents\u2019 incomes as revealed by such evidence as tax returns, income and expense declarations and pay stubs, and,then, under section 4057, to adjust the amount upward in light of the free housing benefit. Such an approach respects the rebuttable correctness of the mechanically calculated guideline amount, and allows child support awards to properly reflect the parents\u2019 standard of living without doing violence to the word \u2018income\u2019 in a way that would make the Sheriff of Nottingham proud.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We believe that the approach outlined in <em>Loh </em>is better suited to the facts of this case. Under the plain language of section 4058, the court\u2019s ability to consider housing benefits as income is limited to cases involving employment-related housing benefits. An upward adjustment pursuant to section 4057, as <em>Loh </em>suggests, ensures that the court specifies the basis for its deviation from the guideline amount, but still allows the court to recognize the impact a parent\u2019s free housing may have on the parent\u2019s living expenses and resources. (See \u00a7 4057, subd. (b) [requiring the court to state its reasons for departing from the guideline on the record or in writing pursuant to \u00a7 4056].) Under section 4057, subdivision (b)(5), the presumption that the guideline amount of child support is correct is rebuttable based on evidence showing that application of the guideline formula \u201cwould be unjust or inappropriate due to special circumstances in the particular case.\" \u201cSpecial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>circumstances\u201d may include the fact that one parent, in a case with substantially equal custody, uses a much higher or lower percentage of income on housing. (\u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(5)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Turning to this case, we note that it involves both the approach outlined approvingly in <em>Loh </em>and the approach used in <em>Stewart. </em>Judge Kelly used the Loh-sanctioned approach and elected not to include the $3,000 rental value of Roger\u2019s house as nontaxable income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court instead departed from the guideline amount, after the guideline amount was calculated, by approximately $1,000 to reflect the fact that Roger had fewer housing expenses than otherwise would be expected. The court referred specifically to the \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d of Roger\u2019s having reduced living expenses and cited <em>Loh </em>as support for the deviation. We find no error in this consideration of Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing situation in determining the appropriate amount of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Similarly, we find no error in Commissioner Joseph\u2019s subsequent order modifying the temporary child support order, effective November 16, 2004, to account for Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing. Commissioner Joseph deferred to Judge Kelly\u2019s calculation of Roger\u2019s increased ability to pay support based on his housing situation, and, like Judge Kelly, deviated upward from the guideline amount by $1,062. Contrary to Roger\u2019s argument, this modification did not impose a payment that Judge Kelly had rejected, but instead implemented the deviation that Judge Kelly intended to reconsider once updated financial information was available.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In calculating the child support payments effective January 1 and January 23, 2006, in contrast, Commissioner Joseph adopted the approach used in <em>Stewart. </em>In the order, the court acknowledged that it \u201ccalculated the housing benefit to father different than Judge Kelly\u201d and explained that it included $3,000 of nontaxable income as \u201ca part of the dissomaster calculation.\u201d The $3,000 of imputed income, based only on the purported rental value of the house, bears little or no relation to Roger\u2019s actual monthly income. Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing is not an employee benefit, nor is there evidence that it resulted from ah effort to funnel income into a form that would not be recognized in the DissoMaster calculation. We therefore conclude the court abused its discretion in including the purported rental value of Roger\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>residence as nontaxable income. We reverse the December 20 child support order and remand to the court to determine the proper guideline amount. On remand, the court may again consider whether Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing is a special circumstance under section 4057 justifying deviation from the guideline amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">C. Discretionary Add-on for Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In the December 20, 2005 order, the court included a discretionary add-on of $500, to be split evenly by the parties. Roger objects to the add-on, arguing that child support payments must be based solely on income, and that the court has no authority to impose payments for optional activities that one parent considers important.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Section 4062 \u201cmakes discretionary (\u2018the court may order\u2019) additional child support <em>for educational or special needs of a child </em>or for travel expenses for visitation. Among the family law bench and bar, these are usually referred to as . . . discretionary add-ons.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Fini </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1039 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 749] <em>(Fini), </em>italics added.) \u201cThe amounts in Section 4062, if ordered to be p\u00e1id, shall be considered additional support for the children and shall be computed in accordance with the following: [f] (a) If there needs to be an apportionment of expenses pursuant to Section 4062, the expenses shall be divided one-half to each parent, unless either parent requests a different apportionment pursuant to subdivision (b) and presents documentation which demonstrates that a different apportionment would be more appropriate.\u201d (\u00a7 4061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">In the December 2005 status report, in preparation for the December hearing on modification of child support, Julie included a detailed list of the girls\u2019 activities over several months and the attendant expenses. Julie testified during the December hearing regarding the children\u2019s diminished standard of living since the divorce, including attendance at public school instead of private school. She also testified regarding the approximate cost of the girls,\u2019 various recreational and educational activities and specified the activities she could no longer afford. After hearing Roger\u2019s arguments on the subject, the court included a discretionary add-on of $500 in the child support order: \u201cAnd that takes care of diminished ability to provide for things as varied as private school, tap dance, gymnastics, dance, dance teams, and other stay-at-home mom activities. [][] I valued that roughly at $500 a month as being the obligation in order to maintain a standard that was previously enjoyed, half of which will be father\u2019s obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We find no abuse of discretion. Section 4062 provides for discretionary add-ons to account for the specific needs of the children; including their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>educational needs. Moreover, the guidelines stress that the parents are mutually responsible for the support of the children, and that the children should be supported according to each parent\u2019s ability to pay and standard of living. (See \u00a7 4053, subds. (b), (d) &amp; (f).) The court\u2019s approach is consistent with the case law, and is a valid exercise of the broad authority entrusted to the court to mitigate a decline in the children\u2019s standard of living postdissolution. (See, e.g., <em>de Guigne, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1364-1365 [increases over guideline amount justified to \u201cmitigate an overall decline in the children\u2019s standard of living\u201d; $15,000 child support award \u201crationally related to the children\u2019s predissolution standard of living and expenses, and to [father\u2019s] ability to pay\u201d]; see also <em>Fini, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1044 [\u201c[T]he court in child support proceedings, to the extent permitted by the child support statutes, must be permitted to exercise the broadest possible discretion in order to achieve equity and fairness in these most sensitive and emotional cases.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">D. Improper Modification</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Roger further argues that it was error for the court to modify the temporary child support orders without using \u201cactual\u201d income figures. This argument is without merit. First, after reviewing the prior orders and the parties\u2019 evidence regarding income, Commissioner Joseph concluded that <em>no change </em>was necessary to the temporary orders based on the updated financial information provided. The court\u2019s only modification to the past support payments was based on the mortgage-free housing issue, discussed above: \u201cThe court has reviewed all previous support orders and concludes as follows: Effective July 1, 2004, Spousal Support was set for $1241 and Child Support at $2759 . . . This computation seems correct, [f] Effective November 16, 2004, there was a timeshare change. Spousal Support was set at $1885 and Child Support at $2575. However, Judge Kelly failed to perpetuate his calculated deviation for father\u2019s housing circumstance. Therefore Child Support until December 31, 2005 should have been set at $3637.\u201d Second, Roger points to no specific differences between the income figures used to calculate the temporary awards and the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d income figures he contends were overlooked. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s modification, or lack thereof, of the temporary support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">E.

Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The December 20, 2005 child support order is reversed with directions to recalculate the base child support payments, effective January 1 and January 23, 2006, omitting $3,000 in nontaxable income attributed to Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing. On remand, the court may consider whether Roger\u2019s mortgage-free housing is a special circumstance under section 4057 justifying deviation from the guideline amount. The attorney\u2019s fees order is affirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">McAdams, J., and Duffy, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\"> Because the parties share a common surname we use their given names to avoid confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> All further statutory references are to the Family Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> Roger cites no support for his claim that the stock portfolio pays dividends of about 1.6 percent, other than to claim that a 1.6 percent rate of return is approximately the stock market average.

Departing from guideline is based -on father not having any house expense. And again the Loh case is the authority I\u2019m relying on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> Roger also argues that Julie lives rent free due to a boyfriend, and questions why that is not incorporated in the guideline calculation. Section 4057.5 prohibits such a consideration. Roger further challenges the basis for the finding that the fair rental value is $3,000. Because we reverse the order imputi\u00f1g $3,000 in fair rental value, we do not reach this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 747.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
