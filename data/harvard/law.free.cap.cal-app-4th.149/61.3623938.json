Code, \u00a7 300) lawfully impose sanctions under section 128.7? (2) May a juvenile court <em>referee </em>lawfully do so? (3) If lawfully made, was the sanctions order justified on the record in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">For reasons that follow, in the published portion of the opinion, we answer the first two questions, \u201cYes.\u201d In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude the sanctions imposed in this case were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In appeal No. C049885, Leslie B., the mother of minors Mark B., Jr., Elijah G., Angelique G., and Caryssa C., sought review of the juvenile court\u2019s findings and orders as to the minors; in addition, Leslie B.\u2019s attorney, Julie Lynn Wolff, sought review of the court\u2019s order sanctioning Wolff pursuant to section 128.7. In appeal No. C050371, Wolff additionally sought review of the court\u2019s further order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to opposing counsel on the sanctions motion. We consolidated the appeals on our own motion. Thereafter, we dismissed the appeal in case No. C049885 for mootness as to the minors, but not as to Wolff. This leaves Attorney Wolff\u2019s appeals from the sanctions orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The motion for which Attorney Wolff was sanctioned attacked the Sacramento County juvenile court\u2019s contract system for. appointing dependency conflict counsel. Under that system, established in 1999 and subsequently amended, Attorney Dale S. Wilson (respondent on appeal) undertook to create entities to represent indigent adults, then to supervise the entities administratively while maintaining a \u201cglass wall\u201d between them and his own practice, as well as between the entities themselves. Wolff\u2019s motion asserted the entities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>were Wilson\u2019s alter egos and all counsel appointed in the case had conflicts of interest. Wilson, not an attorney of record in these proceedings, sought and obtained leave from the juvenile court to oppose the motion, then additionally moved for sanctions under section 128.7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>After denying Wolff\u2019s motion, the juvenile court referee granted the sanctions motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>The juvenile court\u2019s appointment system</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The Sacramento County juvenile court appoints counsel for indigent adults in dependency proceedings under a standing order. The order in effect at the time of these proceedings provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cAppointment of Counsel for Mothers and Presumed Fathers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201cPursuant to [Welf. &amp; Inst. Code] section 317[, subdivision] (c)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and [Cal. Rules of Court] rule 1438(a)(2)(B), [now rule 5.660] the Court has entered into a contract with the Law Office of Dale Wilson, a qualified provider, for the representation of parents in dependency matters, to be compensated on an annual basis for all appearances by that party during the fiscal year. That office is automatically appointed to represent each mother and presumed father of a child who is the subject of a section 300 or 342 dependency petition. ... [f] ... [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">\u201cThe Law Office of Dale Wilson shall organize itself into separate divisions under its administrative supervision and/or contract with other conflict-counsel as are necessary to accept the automatic appointments to represent parents in dependency proceedings. A \u2018glass wall\u2019 protocol, consistent with the requirements of <em>People </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 986 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 867], shall be maintained to prevent the sharing of any confidential or privileged information by members of any division of the Law Office of Dale Wilson with members of the other divisions or with other conflict-counsel. Such divisions shall include, but are not limited to, the Parent Advocates of Sacramento (PAS), Dependency Associates of Sacramento (DAS) and Sacramento County Juvenile Defenders (SCJD).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cUpon such automatic appointment of the Law Office of Dale Wilson to represent .parents in a dependency case, it shall examine the circumstances of the case and determine whether a legal conflict of interest exists that would prevent a single lawyer from that office from representing all of the parents named in the petition. Upon the determination' of such a conflict, the Law Office of Dale Wilson shall assign the representation of the parents for whom a conflict of interest would exist to separate divisions of its office or other conflict-counsel under its administrative supervision, to the extent required by the contract with the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The amended contract operative at the time of these proceedings provides that the Law Offices of Dale S. Wilson, a firm that represents indigent parties in dependency proceedings, is authorized to provide legal representation for up to four indigent parents, subcontracting as necessary, so long as no conflict of interest arises for Wilson. The contract requires Wilson to meet performance standards for provision of these services and to report periodically to the court on the matters covered by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">To implement the original contract, which provided for two levels of conflict representation, Wilson created PAS (Parent Advocates of Sacramento) and DAS (Dependency Associates of Sacramento). When the contract was amended to add two more levels of representation, Wilson began to use independent contract attorneys for the third and fourth adults rather than create additional entities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>Appointment of counsel in these proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">DAS was appointed to represent the father of minor Mark B., Jr. An attorney from SCJD was appointed to represent the father of minor Caryssa C. A different attorney from SCJD (Sacramento County Juvenile Defenders) was appointed to represent another biological father in the case, after the Law Offices of Dale S. Wilson received the original appointment. Leslie B., the mother, was initially represented by PAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\n<em>Wolff\u2019s appearance and filings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">After the initial jurisdictional and dispositional hearing, appellant Julie Lynn Wolff substituted in as Leslie B.\u2019s retained counsel on July 20, 2004. Almost immediately thereafter, Wolff filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Attorneys for Actual, or Apparent, Undisclosed Conflict of Interest\u201d (the conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>motion). She filed a \u201cSupplement\u201d to the motion on September 1, 2004, shortly before it was scheduled to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\n<em>The conflict motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The conflict motion, which does not attach any supporting evidence, asserts: \u201cThe Law Offices of Dale Wilson are appointed to represent the adults in a dependency case. Despite any claim of PAS/DAS, or other appointments, all appointments are through the Law Offices of Dale Wilson, with attorneys sometimes identifying themselves as PAS or DAS (not legally recognized entities in California according to the undersigned\u2019s research into the matter), and other times as \u2018The Law Offices of Dale Wilson.\u2019 It is Dale Wilson who is expected to pay for transcripts for either PAS or DAS, ... on whose behalf objections are made, and who, per the Court\u2019s statements, is required by the Presiding Judge to make all appointments for court ordered attorneys for adults in Sacramento County juvenile dependency cases. . . . Mr. Wilson, one way or the other, is in charge of all the appointments of attorneys in dependency cases. This was never disclosed to mother. No waiver was ever requested, no oral or written disclosures made by counsel, no waiver ever given.\u201d This arrangement violates rule 3-310 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (avoiding the representation of adverse interests), mandating the dismissal of the attorneys \u201cappointed by/employed by\u201d Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>The \u201csupplement\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Wolff\u2019s 100-page \u201csupplement\u201d purports to provide evidence and argument to support the motion\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\n<em>Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The supplement sets out the court\u2019s standing order as part of Wolff\u2019s supporting declaration. As exhibits, it attaches: (1) the court\u2019s contract with Wilson (in several versions); (2) photocopied Yellow Pages advertisements and listings for Wilson\u2019s law firm (showing its address as 2001 21st Street, Sacramento, and its telephone number as 454-2889); (3) a State Bar online entry for Attorney Scott M. Fera dated August 22, 2004, showing the County Counsel\u2019s office as his employer; (4) a letter on PAS letterhead dated April 1, 2004, showing the address \"2001 21st Street, Suite 100, Sacramento, California 95818, the telephone number (916) 731-4981, and 'a masthead, which includes Fera as well as \u201cManaging Attorney\u201d John P. Passalacqua; (5) a State Bar online entry for Passalacqua dated August 21, 2004, apparently showing the Law Offices of Dale S. Wilson as his employer but giving the address and telephone number shown on the letter from PAS; (6) a State Bar online entry for Dale S. Wilson dated August 21, 2004, showing the address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>2001 21st Street #200, Sacramento, California 95818, and the telephone number (916) 454-2889; and (7) an undated Web site entry for the Law Offices of Dale S. Wilson, showing Passalacqua as an attorney with that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\n<em>Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The \u201csupplement\u201d asserts among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Wilson is compensated for all appointed attorneys, regardless of their labels. They are under his supervision, and control and he is expressly responsible for their performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">. An \u201camendment\u201d to Wilson\u2019s contract dated July 1, 2001, which states that it supersedes prior agreements and newly authorizes Wilson to represent the third and fourth parents in juvenile proceedings, gives Wilson until August 25, 2001, \u201cto comply with ethical standards by instituting a \u2018glass wall.\u2019 \u201d This language shows that Wilson had not yet done so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">Attorneys working for Wilson are required to violate their clients\u2019 confb dences insofar as they also represent the clients in drug court under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">The contract does not require Wilson to disclose his representation of multiple parties, to reveal conflicts to clients, or to obtain waivers from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">The Law Offices of Dale Wilson is not a California corporation and the entities PAS, DAS, and SCJD have no fictitious business names on file. These entities are really one, and Wilson is \u201cthe sole legal entity behind all those labels.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">Wilson has one office at 2100 21st Street, Sacramento, where all attorneys for PAS and DAS work. There is only one entrance to Wilson\u2019s office for all his clients, whether private or court-appointed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">. Wilson\u2019s Yellow Pages advertisements claim his office has handled over 25,000 cases. A number so great must include the cases nominally handled by the entities. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In the present case, the appointed attorneys, including Leslie B.\u2019s original counsel, have provided ineffective assistance and revealed actual conflicts of interest in numerous ways. In one instance, DAS Attorney Jessica Taphom had possession of Leslie B.\u2019s drug court file, tried to interview her, and was scheduled to represent her in drug court before Wolff, who had already substituted in as Leslie B.\u2019s counsel, intervened.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>Witness list</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Leslie B. \u201canticipates\u201d calling, among others, Wilson; all attorneys appointed in Sacramento County juvenile dependency proceedings since the inception of Wilson\u2019s contract, including six named attorneys with PAS, five with DAS, and five with SCJD; the juvenile court\u2019s presiding judge; all juvenile court referees; all juvenile dependency court reporters; and all other adult parties in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>Wilson\u2019s opposition and notice of intent to seek sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">After obtaining the court\u2019s permission to oppose the motion, Wilson retained counsel and filed opposition. He also gave notice of intent to seek sanctions against Wolff.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\n<em>The opposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The opposition, supported by declarations from Wilson, PAS Managing Attorney John Passalacqua, DAS Managing Attorney Stephen Nelson, and DAS Attorney Jessica Taphom, asserts: Wilson has created the \u201cglass wall\u201d required by <em>People v. Christian, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 986 <em>(Christian).</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Each entity has a separate office, telephone number, letterhead, pleading paper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>business cards, confidential files, support staff, computers, and printers. The managers of Wilson\u2019s office and the entities supervise only their own staffs. All staff are trained to recognize the entities\u2019 separateness and to treat other entities as opposing counsel with respect to client confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">All files for clients assigned to independent contract attorneys are maintained by those attorneys, not by Wilson\u2019s office, PAS, or DAS. No one from Wilson\u2019s office has access to such files or knows any confidential information about those clients. Wilson does not supervise, hire, or fire such attorneys or their staff. PAS and DAS treat those attorneys as opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Wilson is the administrative director of PAS and DAS and the managing attorney of his own finri. His contract requires him to report to the juvenile court on the caseload of PAS, DAS, and independent contract attorneys, to assign cases, and to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise. However, PAS and DAS are separate from Wilson\u2019s office. Each has its own managing attorney. Wilson has no hiring, firing, or disciplinary authority over PAS and DAS employees. Although PAS, DAS, and Wilson\u2019s office are in the same building, each has its own separate locked office, telephone number, equipment, supplies, and support staff.' All PAS files are kept in white file folders, all DAS files in red file folders, and all files of Wilson\u2019s clients in blue folders. All staff are trained in the \u201cglass wall\u201d principle, and any infraction is grounds for discipline by that staff person\u2019s managing attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Leslie B. had argued that <em>Christian, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 986, was inapposite because a public agency, not\" a private attorney, created the separate units and firms described ther\u00e9. However, the decision does not make that distinction! Moreover, as in <em>Christian, </em>a public agency (the county) funds all attorneys appointed under Wilson\u2019s contract. Wilson may not represent any party in a case in which he has referred another party to PAS, DAS, or an independent contractor, regardless of how he would be paid..</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Wilson\u2019s contract also requires him to provide an attorney to attend dependency drug court, which operates a treatment and .recovery program known as STARS. Nonconfidential STARS reports are sent to PAS or DAS; all such reports for non-PAS and non-DAS clients are placed in a file folder and taken to drug court for the attorney representing the STARS client. DAS attorney Jessica Taphom was assigned to dmg court on August 4, 2004. DAS Managing Attorney Stephen Nelson instructed her to give Leslie B.\u2019s STARS reports to her attorney, Wolff. Taphom did so. At no time did Taphom or other DAS attorneys have Leslie B.\u2019s PAS dependency file.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\n<em>Notice of intent to seek sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Along with Wilson\u2019s opposition, he requested a continuance of the hearing on the motion to \u201callow [the] Court to consider sanctions against Julie Lynn Wolff under [] section 128.7.\u201d Wilson\u2019s retained counsel, Charles Post, declared as relevant that he had written to Wolff on December 24, 2004, advising her he would seek sanctions if she did not withdraw the motion, and Wolff had refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>The sanctions motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">On January 11, 2005, Wilson served a motion for sanctions against Wolff under section 128.7, citing all grounds specified in the statute. The motion was filed on February 2, 2005. Wilson asserted that juvenile courts can order section 128.7 sanctions, but did not cite any authority on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\n<em>The court\u2019s ruling on the conflict motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">On March 29, 2005, Juvenile Court Referee Carol Chrisman issued a written order denying the conflict motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">On the merits, Referee Chrisman found: (1) It did not per se violate the \u201cglass wall\u201d principle for a private law office, rather than a government agency or a nonprofit entity, to be the contractor in a conflict counsel arrangement. (2) The Wilson law offices had set up the required \u201cglass wall.\u201d (3) Leslie B. had failed to show any breach of the \u201cglass wall\u201d or any actual conflict of interest as to any appointed counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Referee Chrisman also found: Although Wolff had indicated \u201cthere were a plethora of witnesses with relevant testimony, should the matter advance to trial,\u201d she declined to make offers of proof and submitted on the pleadings. Juvenile courts may decide disputed matters without trial if the party raising the issue refuses to make an offer of proof. Here, the pleadings did not set forth sufficient evidence to warrant a trial. In any event, there was no showing that any possible transgression had had or could have any continuing effect on the proceedings; Leslie B. had already used the State Bar\u2019s administrative remedy; and PAS and DAS no longer represented any parties in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">\n<em>The court\u2019s orders on the sanctions motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">On March 9, 2005, after argument on the sanctions motion, Referee Chrisman requested supplemental briefing on the juvenile court\u2019s authority to order Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 sanctions. Only Wilson responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>On April 20, 2005, Referee Chrisman. granted the motion and ordered sanctions in the amount of $1,000 payable to the court, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses to Wilson as per proof. We set out her key findings in part III of the Discussion, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On June 3; 2005, after reviewing Wilson\u2019s documentation of his fees and expenses, Referee Chrisman ordered Wolff to pay the sum of $5,989.50 as attorney\u2019s fees to the Law Offices of Dale Wilson.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The order notes that Wolff did not file an objection or any other response to Wilson\u2019s claimed fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The first issue is whether the juvenile court in dependency proceedings may impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. We conclude it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">\u201c(b) By presenting to <em>the court </em>... a pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper, an attorney ... is certifying that to the best of [his] knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\u201c(1) It is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\u201c(2) The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">\u201c(3) The allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or ... are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

HQ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201c(h) A motion for sanctions brought . . . primarily for an improper purpose . . . shall itself be subject to a motion for sanctions.

Statum </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 682, 689 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 50 P.3d 355].)  Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 repeatedly speaks of \u201cthe court\u201d or \u201ccourts\u201d without restriction. It cites the full range of pleadings that may be filed in civil court, whether in an action or a special proceeding. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 21-23.) Juvenile dependency proceedings are special proceedings. <em>(In re Chantal S. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 196, 200 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 866, 913 P.2d 1075]; <em>In re Shelly J. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 322, 328 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 922].) Section 128.7 expressly covers both \u201ccomplaint[s],\u201d which commence civil actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 350), and \u201cpetition[s],\u201d which commence special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>proceedings (see, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1069, 1086, 1103, 1281.2, 1354-1355). Thus, section 128.7 on its face applies to all civil courts and civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Furthermore, the internal organization of a code may aid in understanding a statute\u2019s purpose <em>(Medical Board v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 163, 175 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 403]), and chapter and section headings in the codes may be considered in determining legislative intent. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Laff) </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 703, 727 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 323, 23 P.3d 563]; <em>People v. Hull </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 266, 272 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 526, 820 P.2d 1036].) Following its introductory provisions, the Code of Civil Procedure has four parts: part 1, \u201cOf Courts of Justice\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 33-286); part 2, \u201cOf Civil Actions\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 307-1062.20); part 3, \u201cOf Special Proceedings of a Civil Nature\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1063-1822.60); and part 4, \u201cMiscellaneous Provisions\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1855-2107). Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 is located within part 1, which applies generally to all civil proceedings, not within parts 2 or 3, which apply only to specified proceedings. This location suggests the Legislature meant section 128.7 to apply across the board in, every civil court and proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In addition, because Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 is modeled on rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.), we may look to the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of that rule. <em>(Eichenbaum v. Alon </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 967, 975, fn. 6 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 296].) They have held that rule 11 applies to all types of civil courts and proceedings, unless some more specific sanctioning rule or statute controls. (See, e.g., <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 384, 391-393 [110 L.Ed.2d 359, 372-374, 110 S.Ct. 2447]; <em>Tri-State Steel Const. Co., Inc. v. Herman </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 164 F.3d 973, 980; <em>Child </em>v. <em>Beame </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1976) 412 F.Supp. 593, 599-601 [rule 11 applicable to complaint brought by children placed with foster care agencies, alleging malfeasance and violations of state law].) The statutory scheme defining our juvenile dependency system does not include any such specific statute or rule. (\u00a7\u00a7 300-395; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 5.660-5.740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Finally, the policy underlying Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 favors its use in dependency proceedings. The statute enables courts to deter or punish frivolous filings which disrupt matters, waste time, and burden courts\u2019 and parties\u2019 resources. Such evils are especially pernicious in dependency proceedings, which should be conducted as informally and nonadversarially as possible to protect the minors\u2019 interests. (\u00a7 350, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>This case makes the point starkly: According to the sanctions order, Wolffs conflict motion derailed the pending proceedings and \u201cset into action a series of hearings that delayed the proceedings for [eight] months.\u201d If anything, juvenile courts hearing dependency cases need section 128.7 even more than do civil courts in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The contrary arguments of Wolff and amicus curiae County Counsel are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Wolff and County Counsel note that \u201c[a] superior court convened as and exercising the special powers of a juvenile court is vested with jurisdiction to make only those limited determinations authorized by the legislative grant of those special powers. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Lisa R. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 636, 643 [119 Cal.Rptr. 475, 532 P.2d 123]; accord, <em>People v. Nguyen </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1619 [272 Cal.Rptr. 523]; <em>In re Jody R. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1615, 1622-1623 [267 Cal.Rptr. 746].) They then assert that the \u201cdetermination\u201d to impose sanctions is not within this legislative grant of power because sections 300 through 395, the enabling legislation for dependency proceedings, do not expressly incorporate Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 or any other sanctions provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if a sanctions order is a \u201cdetermination\u201d as the cited cases use that term, the conclusion drawn by Wolff and County Counsel does not follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding the absence of specific authorization to make particular determinations, a juvenile court is nevertheless vested with the authority to make such determinations which <em>[sic] </em>are incidentally necessary to the performance of those functions demanded of it by the Legislature pursuant to the Juvenile Court Law.\u201d <em>(In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 643 [power to determine parentage]; accord, <em>In re Ashley M. </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 237]; <em>In re Jody R., supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 1623.) Within part 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, section 128.7 appears in article 2 (\u201cIncidental Powers and Duties of Courts\u201d) of chapter 6 (\u201cGeneral Provisions Respecting Courts of Justice\u201d), immediately following section 128, which authorizes \u201cevery court\u201d to control its proceedings by means other than sanctions. Read together, these sections constitute an express legislative grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to all courts of the incidental power to take all steps, including sanctions, necessary to perform their designated functions efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In a related argument, Wolff and County Counsel contend that Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 sanctions are outside the juvenile court\u2019s power because that court is governed by its own rules and statutes, to which the \u201crequirements\u201d of the Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure do not apply unless otherwise specified. (Cf. <em>In re Chantal S., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 200; <em>In re Shelley J., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 328; <em>In re Jennifer R. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 704, 711 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 759]; <em>Jones T. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 240, 245, fn. 3 [264 Cal.Rptr. 4]; <em>In re Angela R. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 257, 273 [260 Cal.Rptr. 612].) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In <em>In re Chantal S., </em>our Supreme Court merely stated: \u201cDependency proceedings in the juvenile court are special proceedings with their own set of rules, <em>governed, in general, by the Welfare and Institutions Code.\" (In re Chantal S., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 200, italics added.) The court did not hold that provisions of other codes are inapplicable unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Our review of the cases cited by the parties on this question reveals that none involved application of a statute found in part 1 (\u201cOf Courts of Justice\u201d; \u00a7\u00a7 33-286) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Thus, <em>In re Chantal S., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th. 196, held Family Code section 3190, applicable to custody or visitation disputes, did not apply in a dependency case because \u201cthe Legislature knows how to make the Family Code applicable to the juvenile court when it intends to do so . . . .\u201d (13 Cal.4th at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\"><em>In re Jennifer R., supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 708, and <em>Jones T. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 240, both held former Civil Code section 4600 (related to family law custody and visitation orders) inapplicable in dependency cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\"><em>In re Angela R., supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d 257, held Code of Civil Procedure section 585, applicable to defaults in civil \u201cactions,\u201d was inapplicable in a \u201c \u2018special proceeding\u2019 \u201d brought under former Civil Code section 232. (212 Cal.App.3d at p. 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The provisions of part 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cOf Courts of Justice\u201d)' are of a different nature from any of the foregoing statutes. The statutes in part 1 provide for the fundamental empowerment of the courts, including the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Thus, to pick but a few examples, Code of Civil Procedure section 71 provides that, \u201c[t]he process of superior courts shall extend throughout the state.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 74 provides, \u201cAdjournments from day to day, or from time to time, are to be construed as recesses in the sessions, and shall not prevent the Court from sitting at any time.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 128 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Every court shall have the power to do all of the following: [f] (1) To preserve and enforce order in its immediate presence. [j[] (2) To enforce order in the proceedings before it, or before a person or persons empowered to conduct a judicial investigation under its authority. [][] (3) To provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it, or its officers, [f] (4) To compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein, [f] (5) To control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto, [f] (6) To compel the attendance of persons to testify in an action or proceeding pending therein, in the cases and manner provided in this code. HO (7) To administer oaths in an action or proceeding pending therein, and in all other cases where it may be necessary in the exercise of its powers and duties. [][] (8) To amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Could anyone contend that these provisions of part 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing for the fundamental power and authority of <em>all </em>courts, do not apply to a juvenile court hearing a dependency case? We think not. Rather, we believe it beyond dispute that many statutes in part 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure must apply to juvenile courts hearing dependency cases without express incorporation in the Welfare and Institutions Code. In our view, Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 is one of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Wolff and County Counsel contend juvenile courts lack \u201cinherent power\u201d to impose sanctions and exceed their jurisdiction by doing so. (Cf. <em>Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626, 635-639 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942] [superseded by statute, as stated in <em>Olmstead v. Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 804, 809 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 86 P.3d 354].) But Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 authorizes juvenile courts, like other civil courts, to impose sanctions without resort to \u201cinherent power\u201d; therefore the use of that authority does not exceed their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Finally, County Counsel asserts public policy does not favor sanctions in dependency proceedings. But if sanctions are authorized by statute, contrary \u201cpublic policy\u201d arguments must fail because statutes codify public policy. County Counsel\u2019s speculative \u201cparade of horribles\u201d\u2014a \u201cchilling effect on the filing of juvenile dependency petitions\u201d and an \u201cincrease [in] the volume of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>juvenile dependency appeals\u201d\u2014is better addressed \u201con,the other side of Tenth Street, in the halls of the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Osborn </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 703, 711 [252 Cal.Rptr. 613].) In any event; we have already said that the policy underlying Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 favors its use in dependency proceedings. (See Discussion, <em>ante, </em>at pp. .76-77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">For all the above reasons, we conclude that the juvenile courts may order sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 in dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The next issue is whether a juvenile court <em>referee </em>is authorized to order sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. We conclude the answer is \u201cyes\u201d because a juvenile court referee in dependency proceedings has essentially the same powers as a judge and any differences are not material to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Government Code section 71622 authorizes trial courts to appoint subordinate judicial officers, including referees. Sections 247.5 through 254 define juvenile court referees\u2019 powers and duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u201cA referee shall hear such cases as are assigned to him or her by the presiding judge of the juvenile court, with the same powers as a judge of the juvenile court, except that a referee shall not conduct any hearing to which the state or federal constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy apply unless all of the parties thereto stipulate in writing that the referee may act in the capacity of a temporary judge.\u201d (\u00a7 248.) Except for orders removing minors from their homes, which require the express approval of a juvenile court judge (\u00a7 249), all orders issued by referees become immediately effective and continue in full force and effect until vacated or modified upon rehearing by order of a juvenile court judge. (\u00a7 250.) Although a party may petition for rehearing of. any referee\u2019s order by a juvenile court judge, the judge may deny rehearing if the proceedings before the referee were officially transcribed. (\u00a7 252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Thus, the statutory scheme authorizes a juvenile court referee in dependency proceedings to make almost any order (subject to rehearing by a juvenile court judge) which a judge could make. This authority necessarily includes the authority to order sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u2022 County Counsel disagrees, citing article VI, section 22 of the California Constitution, which states: \u201cThe Legislature may provide for the appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>by trial courts of record of officers such as commissioners to perform <em>subordinate judicial </em>duties.\u201d (Italics added.) But the Legislature has provided that the \u201csubordinate judicial duties\u201d juvenile court referees may perform in dependency proceedings include almost all the duties juvenile court judges may perform, subject only to rehearing by such judges. (\u00a7\u00a7 248-252.) Unless this statutory scheme is unconstitutional, which County Counsel does not argue, its more specific language controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">County Counsel also cites <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727 at page 732 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406]; <em>In re Damon C. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 493 at page 498 [128 Cal.Rptr. 172, 546 P.2d 676]; and <em>In re Darrell P. </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 916 at page 923 [175 Cal.Rptr. 682]. However, it fails to explain how these decisions support its argument. We conclude they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><em>In re Edgar M. </em>and <em>In re Damon C. </em>construe a now repealed provision (former \u00a7 558, repealed by Stats. 1976, ch. 1068, \u00a7 17, p. 4781), which governed juvenile <em>criminal </em>proceedings. <em>(In re Damon C., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 498; <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 732.) <em>In re Darrell P </em>holds that a juvenile court in a criminal proceeding can constitutionally order a rehearing under section 252 without first obtaining a transcript of testimony heard by a referee. <em>(In re Darrell P, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d at p. 918.) None of these decisions holds or implies that juvenile court referees may not order sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Finally, County Counsel asks us to decide whether, if referees have the authority to order sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, those orders are subject to rehearing by juvenile court judges under section 252. County Counsel has requested judicial notice of purported Sacramento County juvenile court orders in other cases which hold that referee-made sanctions orders are not subject to rehearing. Although we granted the request for judicial notice, we conclude the question is not properly before us because Wolff did not seek rehearing of the sanctions order against her. We decline to issue an advisory opinion on this point. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Slayton </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1076, 1084 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 32 P.3d 1073].)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The judgment (order of sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees) is affirmed.

In addition, attorneys from the two offices remained physically apart, had no access to each other\u2019s files, and adhered to a well-known policy of keeping all legal activities completely separate, such that the offices were separate \u2018firms.\u2019 There was no evidence that those \u2018ethical walls\u2019 had been ineffective in avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>conflicts of interest between the two offices; hence, an ethical separation existed in fact between the two.\u201d <em>(Christian, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 986.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b92-15\"> Referee Chrisman disallowed a substantial part of the sum Wilson sought. Though his claimed hourly rates for counsel were reasonable, some expenses were not reasonably expended in pursuing the sanctions motion, and the descriptions of others had been redacted so that Referee Chrisman could not determine whether they were incurred on the sanctions' motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> Ironically, amicus curiae County Counsel cites this provision to show why sanctions should not be allowed in dependency proceedings'. County Counsel overlooks the fact that a frivolous filing in a dependency proceeding will normally kill any chances to keep matters informal and nonadversarial, as Wolff\u2019s motion did here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\"> County Counsel notes that section 247.5 expressly incorporates Code of Civil Procedure sections 170 and 170.6 (which, like Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.7, belong to pt. 1 of that code) into juvenile proceedings, and asks why legislation was needed to do so if part 1 provisions apply to all civil courts. The answer is twofold. First, as we discuss below, section 247.5 belongs to the statutory scheme defining the powers and duties of juvenile court referees, and its main point is to spell out what happens if a referee is disqualified, which the Code of Civil Procedure provisions do not address. Second, the fact that the Legislature sometimes expressly incorporates Code of Civil Procedure provisions into the Welfare and Institutions Code does not prove that this is the only way such provisions can apply to juvenile court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\"> We have no occasion to discuss other possible sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
