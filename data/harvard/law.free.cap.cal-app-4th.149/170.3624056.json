Auto Gallery (TAG) for, among other things, violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.; CLRA). Kim appeals from the January 10, 2006, order denying his motion for attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>following entry of a stipulated judgment pursuant to a settlement agreement. Kim contends the trial court erred in finding that, because the matter was resolved by settlement agreement prior to trial, there could be no prevailing party. We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The complaint alleges that, on September 8, 2003, Kim traded in his 2001 Porsche Boxster to lease a used 2001 Porsche 996 Turbo (the vehicle) from TAG. According to the lease.agreement, the \u201cgross capitalized cost\u201d of the vehicle at lease signing was $88,366.51 and the total amount Kim would have to pay on the lease by the end of the 48-month lease term would be $66,844.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the estimated amount Kim, would have to pay for official fees and taxes was $4,533.38. Along with the lease, Kim received a written warranty. Over the next year, Kim brought the vehicle back to TAG for various repairs, as a result of which the vehicle was out of service for over 78 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In separate letters on September 21, 2004, Kim\u2019s attorney notified Porsche and TAG that Kim was revoking his acceptance of the vehicle under Commercial Code section 2608 (revocation of nonconforming, goods) and demanding a refund pursuant to the CLRA (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the letter to TAG stated: \u201c[Pjursuant to [the CLRA] [Kim] demands that, in order to put the client in the same position he was in prior to the formation of the contract, you correct, repair, replace or otherwise rectify said violations of [the CLRA] by canceling the sale of the subject vehicle, by accepting the return of the subject vehicle, and by refunding all monies expended.\u201d Porsche and TAG refused Kim\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">On November 2, 2004, Kim filed this action against Porsche and TAG.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint stated causes of action for breach of written contract; revocation; rescission; breach of express warranty; breach of implied warranty of merchantability; violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Song-Beverly Act) (\u00a7 1790 et. seq.); violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty\u2014Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq.); as well as violations of the CLRA. By the complaint, Kim sought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>following relief: actual, incidental and consequential damages; a civil penalty pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act; an order enjoining defendants\u2019 unlawful methods, acts, and/or practices; return of Kim\u2019s down payment and all payments made by Kim under the lease; an order of restitution; an order of rescission of the lease agreement including refund of all monies paid by Kim and termination of the lease, requiring defendants to pay off the balance of the lease and ordering Kim to return the vehicle; cost of suit and expenses; prejudgment interest; attorney fees; and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In September 2005 the parties reached a partial settlement: Kim dismissed with prejudice the first through fifth causes of action, and eighth and ninth causes of action in their entirety, and the tenth cause of action against Porsche, only. In exchange, Porsche and TAG both agreed to waive \u201cany and all attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with the dismissed causes of action.\u201d Thus, following the dismissal, the sixth and seventh causes of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act alleged against Porsche and TAG, and the tenth cause of action for violation of the CLRA as to TAG only, remained outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">' Kim settled with TAG a few months later. According to the mutual general release and settlement agreement entered into by Kim and TAG (the settlement agreement), the consideration for settlement was the following: (1) Kim agreed to turn over the vehicle to TAG, and to execute all documents necessary to transfer his interest in the vehicle to TAG; (2) TAG agreed to pay Kim an amount equivalent to the remaining lease obligation ($69,818.78) and to take steps necessary to terminate the lease agreement; and (3) TAG agreed to pay Kim \u201cthe lump sum settlement amount of $10,000.\u201d Regarding attorney fees, paragraph 2 of the settlement agreement, entitled \u201cConsideration,\u201d states that the $10,000 payment to Kim was \u201cmade in full and final settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims Kim has or may have against TAG, <em>excluding attorney\u2019s fees and costs (the attorney\u2019s fees and costs are discussed below).\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Paragraph 3 of the settlement agreement, entitled \u201cNo Admissions,\u201d states that neither party was admitting liability and \u201cneither party agrees that the other is the prevailing party. A determination of which, if any, party is the prevailing party will be' made by the court as part of [Kim\u2019s] motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs . . . .\u201d Paragraph 19 of the settlement agreement, entitled \u201cKim\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Fees and' Costs,\u201d states: \u201cKim hereby reserves his right to make an application to the Court in an attempt to recover his reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs with respect to TAG in connection with his CLRA claim. TAG reserves the right to oppose the motion on grounds it deems appropriate.\u201d Finally, paragraph 22 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>settlement agreement, entitled \u201cEnforcement. of Agreement,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he Parties agree that, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, the Court may retain jurisdiction over the Parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On November 23, 2005, Kim filed a motion for attorney fees and costs under section 1780, subdivision (d) (section 1780(d)), part of the CLRA. TAG opposed the motion on the grounds that Kim was not the prevailing party, that Kim was improperly seeking attorney fees attributable to the litigation against Porsche and that the amount of fees being sought was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On January 10, 2006, the parties appeared for an OSC (order to show cause) regarding dismissal and hearing on Kim\u2019s attorney fee motion. At the hearing, the trial court asked the following rhetorical question: \u201cHow is it that this court is expected to determine who the prevailing party is when there is a settlement? That is what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d The court concluded that the fact the matter was settled pursuant to an agreement made it impossible to determine whether there was a prevailing party and, based on this reasoning, denied the motion. At this hearing, the trial court also dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Kim filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Kim contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for attorney fees on the grounds that there was no prevailing party. As we understand his argument, it is that the trial court\u2019s determination that there was no prevailing party was based entirely on an incorrect belief that there could be none because the matter was settled by agreement of the parties prior to trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The parties disagree on the standard of review. Kim maintains the standard is de novo and TAG argues abuse of discretion. Kim is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Generally, the trial court\u2019s determination of the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees is an exercise of discretion, which should not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of - discretion. <em>(Jackson v. Homeowners Assn. Monte Vista Estates-East </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 773, 789 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 363] <em>(Jackson), </em>quoting <em>Reveles v. Toyota by the Bay </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1153 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 543] <em>(Reveles), </em>disapproved of on another point in <em>Snukal v. Flightways Manufacturing, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 754, 775, fn. 6 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 3 P.3d 286].) But the determination of the legal basis for an attorney fee award is subject to independent review. <em>(Corbett v. Hayward Dodge, Inc. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 915, 921 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 741] [independent review of interpretation of statute allowing attorney fees to defendant upon finding that plaintiff prosecuted the action \u201c \u2018not in good faith\u2019 \u201d].) In such a case, the issue involves the application of the law to undisputed facts. (See <em>Damian </em>v. <em>Tamondong </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1119 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 262] <em>(Damian) </em>[independent review of whether defendant in action brought under Rees-Levering Automobile Sales Finance Act can be \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of attorney fee award after voluntary dismissal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Here, it is undisputed that Kim\u2019s complaint alleged, among other things, a cause of action under the CLRA; that the action was dismissed prior to trial pursuant to the terms of a written settlement agreement; and in that settlement agreement, Kim expressly reserved the right to make application to the court for recovery of his attorney fees and costs in connection with his CLRA claim. Thus, the issue here involves applying the relevant law relating to the legal, basis of an attorney fees award to these undisputed facts. Under, these circumstances, we independently reyiew the trial court\u2019s expressed belief that there was no legal basis to find. Kim to be a prevailing plaintiff because the parties entered into a settlement agreement. As we shall explain, that finding was contrary to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We would come to the same conclusion under the more lenient abuse of discretion standard. This is because \u201c \u2018discretion may not be exercised whimsically arid,' accordingly, reversal is appropriate \u201cwhere no reasonable basis for the actiori is shown.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Common Cause v. Stirling </em>(19.83) 147 Cal.App.3d 518, 522 [195 Cal.Rptr. 163] [trial court abused discretion in denying attorney fees to plaintiff in action brought under the Brown Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54950 et seq.)]). A failure to exercise discretion is an abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Orabuena </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 84, 99 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 99].) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Action that transgresses the confin\u00e9s of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 148 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 273] <em>(Graciano).) </em>Here, because it incorrectly believed that there can be no prevailing party when the parties agree to a pretrial settlement, the trial court failed to exercise its discretion to determine whether or not Kim was a prevailing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">2. <em>Civil Code Section 1717</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Under what is known as the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his or her own attorney fees. <em>(Flannery </em>v. <em>California Highway Patrol </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 633 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 632].) The rule is codified at Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, which provides: \u201cExcept as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys ... is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The availability of attorney fees authorized by an agreement between the parties is governed by section 1717 which, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cWhere an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case, there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.\u201d (\u00a7 1717, subd. (b)(2).) Thus, where attorney fees are a matter of contract, pretrial settlement of the action precludes an award of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">But the mere existence of an attorney fee provision in the parties\u2019 contract does not necessarily bring the issue of attorney fees within section 1717, subdivision (b)(2). There are two theoretically applicable exceptions. First, the parties may waive application of section 1717, subdivision (b)(2) and submit the question of attorney fees to the trial court for resolution. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 782; see also <em>Reveles, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1149.) In <em>Jackson, </em>the court held that \u201ca settlement agreement which provides that the trial court will determine the prevailing party in the action, and the amount of the attorney fee award, if any, is valid and enforceable.\u201d (93 Cal.App.4th at p. 776.) However, this exception applies only where the dismissal is not filed before the attorney fee issue is resolved. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 784\u2014785, distinguishing <em>Reveles, supra, </em>at p. 1150 [attorney fee issue preserved where no dismissal filed] from <em>Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 698, 707-708 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 376] [attorney fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>issue waived where dismissal filed].) Here, because the dismissal was filed before the attorney fee issue was resolved, the exception does not apply. This does not end our inquiry, however, because of the second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Section 1717, subdivision (b)(2) does not bar a fee award where the prevailing party\u2019s right to recover fees arises under a fee-shifting statute. (See, e.g., <em>Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 331, 101 P.3d 140] (Graham) [American rule not applicable where attorney fees sought pursuant to \u00a7 1021.5]; <em>Parrott v. Mooring Townhomes Assn., Inc. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 873, 878-879 [\u00a7 1717, subd. (b)(2) not applicable where attorney fees sought pursuant to \u00a7 1354, subd. (f)]; <em>Damian, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 1124 [same, where attorney fees sought pursuant to \u00a7 2983.4]; <em>Reveles, supra, </em>57 Cal.App4th at pp. 1150-1151 [same, where attorney fees sought pursuant to \u00a7 1021.5]; <em>Elster v. Friedman </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1443-1444 [260 Cal.Rptr. 148] (Elster) [same, where attorney fees sought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 527.6, subd. (h).) The CLRA includes a fee-shifting statute at section 1780(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">3. <em>Section 1780(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Section 1780(d) provides: \u201cThe court <em>shall </em>award court costs and attorney\u2019s fees to a <em>prevailing plaintiff </em>in litigation filed pursuant to this section. Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff\u2019s prosecution of the action was not in good faith.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 is usually deemed mandatory, unless a mandatory construction would not be consistent with the legislative purpose underlying the statute.\u201d <em>(West Shield Investigations &amp; Security Consultants v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 935, 949 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 612].) Our Supreme Court has observed that \u201cthe availability of costs and attorneys, fees to prevailing plaintiffs is integral to making the CLRA an effective piece of consumer, legislation, increasing the financial feasibility of bringing suits under the statute.\u201d <em>(Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066, 1086 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 988 P.2d 67].) Thus, a mandatory construction of the word \u201cshall\u201d in section 1780(d) is consistent with the legislative purpose underlying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Accordingly, an award of attorney fees to \u201ca prevailing plaintiff\u201d in an action brought pursuant to the CLRA is mandatory, even where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>litigation is resolved by a pretrial settlement agreement, absent an enforceable agreement to the contrary. Obviously a plaintiff who is not prevailing is not entitled to attorney fees. We turn to the phrase \u201cprevailing plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">4. <em>Definition of \u201cPrevailing Plaintiff\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The CLRA does not define \u201cprevailing plaintiff.\u201d In <em>Reveles, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th 1139, the court applied the general definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d found in Code of Civil Procedure section 1032.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It concluded that a plaintiff is the prevailing party under section 1780(d) \u201cif he obtained a \u2018net monetary recovery\u2019 on his [CLRA] claim.\u201d <em>(Reveles, </em>at p. 1154.) More recently, the court in <em>Graciano, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at page 150, held that, in deciding prevailing party status under the CLRA, \u201cthe court should adopt a pragmatic approach, determining prevailing party status based on which party succeeded on a practical level. [Citations.] Under that approach, the court exercises its discretion to determine \u2018the prevailing party by analyzing which party realized its litigation objectives.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Other cases that define the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the context of different fee-shifting statutes are also instructive. For example, in <em>Elster, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 1439, the appellate court affirmed an award of attorney fees to the plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6, subdivision (h), which gives the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action for an injunction prohibiting harassment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Noting that the statute did not define \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the court in <em>Elster, </em>like the court in <em>Reveles, </em>looked to the definition contained in the more general Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. <em>(Elster, supra, </em>at p. 1443.) Applying that definition, the <em>Elster </em>court concluded that even though the injunction there imposed reciprocal duties on both sides, the plaintiffs legally could be entitled to prevailing party status. \u201cA plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>prevails, in essence, when he gets most or all of what he wanted by filing the action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1443-1444.) In <em>Elster, </em>the plaintiffs were the prevailing party because \u201cwhat they wanted\u201d was to enjoin the defendant from harassing them and that is the relief they obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In <em>Coltrain v. Shewalter </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 94 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 600], the court held that the critical issue for the prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c) (the anti-SLAPP statute) \u201cis which party realized its objectives in the litigation.\u201d In cases concluding by way of dismissal, that is usually the defendant. \u201cSince the defendant\u2019s goal is to make the plaintiff go away with its tail between its legs, ordinarily the prevailing party will.be the defendant. The plaintiff, however, may try to show it actually dismissed because it had substantially achieved its goals through a settlement or other means . . . .\u201d <em>(Coltrain, </em>at p. 107; see also <em>Graham, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 571 [within the context of the private attorney general statute (\u00a7 1021.5), the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d means the party that achieves its objectives].) .</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">5. <em>Application to Present Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Here, the trial court believed that Kim could not be a prevailing plaintiff solely because the matter was resolved prior to trial by a settlement agreement: \u201cMy question is, you settled. How is the court supposed to determine who the prevailing party is? How do I do that?\u201d \u201cWhat you all are asking the court to do here, and this is what I have a problem with, in asking me to determine the prevailing party, in light of the fact that you have settled, you\u2019re asking me to say financially that you ended up in a situation that was better than he did, is basically what it comes down to. [][] And so you\u2019re asking me as a judge to step in as an expert witness and to evaluate the value of the Porsche, the value of what it meant to the defense not to have to try it and what their legal fees would have been had they gone to trial and what the potential downside was and to take into consideration all kinds of things that I, as a court, don\u2019t believe that I should do. [f] .. . I have never been asked to determine, after the parties have agreed in a written settlement agreement, who the prevailing party is. [\u00b6] To me that is just like an antithetical request. It\u2019s a non sequitur. How can I do that? [f] The answer is this court does not believe that it can. All right? I cannot make a determination of prevailing party irrespective of the [CLRA].\u201d \u201cI just think that it really strikes against the concept of settling a case and ending it and then coming back and saying, \u2018Now, Judge, tell us who is the winner.\u2019 I can\u2019t do that. And I am not going to. [If] I\u2019m trying to give you a really good record so that if you decide to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>take this up on appeal, that the Court of Appeal is very clear on why I\u2019m doing this. All right? And that is because there is no case that allows this. There is no case that says that this is the way that it is to be handled. [\u00b6] So if they decide they want to carve out a place in the law whereby after a settlement agreement they want to put into effect a mechanism whereby a court can give me guidance on how I can determine a prevailing party, well, then, when it comes right back down, I will just do exactly what they say. But right now I don\u2019t think that is what the law is. [][] And queen\u2019s gambit decline[d], I\u2019m not going to. [][] So the motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is denied. [][] [COUNSEL FOR TAG]: Thank you, Your Honor, [f] THE COURT: The court finds there is no prevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Although we appreciate the trial court\u2019s dilemma, it still has an obligation to determine whether or not plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing plaintiff\u201d under law. A plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney fees under the CLRA is not inherently antithetical to a pretrial settlement agreement. Because Kim\u2019s right to attorney fees arises not from contract, but under section 1780(d), Kim is not precluded from obtaining an award of attorney fees even though the litigation was resolved by a settlement agreement. Moreover, the express language of section 1780(d) makes such an award mandatory, not discretionary, if Kim shows that he was the \u201cprevailing plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Determinations of whether Kim is a \u201cprevailing plaintiff\u201d and the amount to be awarded, if any, are to be made, in the first instance, by the trial court in the sound exercise of its discretion. This is because, while TAG obtained a dismissal in the settlement agreement, Kim obtained many of his litigation objectives including return of the car, cancellation of the lease and a monetary recovery. By analogy to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, this case therefore falls within the category of \u201csituations other than as specified\u201d in which \u201cthe \u2018prevailing party\u2019 shall be as determined by the court.\u201d Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether Kim is a prevailing plaintiff either because he obtained a net monetary recovery or because he achieved most or all of what he wanted by filing the action or a combination of the two. If the trial court determines that Kim is a prevailing plaintiff, it shall also determine the amount of attorney fees to be awarded to him. <em>(Glendora Community Redevelopment Agency v. Demeter </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 474 [202 Cal.Rptr. 389] [the amount to be awarded as attorney fees is left to the sound discretion of the trial court because it is in the best position to evaluate the services rendered by an attorney in its courtroom].) We do not intend by this opinion that the trial court must determine that plaintiff is a prevailing plaintiff; only that it must make the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the trial court to exercise its discretion to determine whether Kim was the prevailing plaintiff within the meaning of section 1780(d), and if so, the amount of attorney fees he shall recover. Kim shall recover his costs on appeal. '</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Cooper, P. J., and Boland, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> This amount was comprised of: $10,000 due at lease signing; plus a total of $57,696.00 in lease payments; plus a $350 termination fee; minus the $1,202.00 first monthly lease payment (which was included as part of the initial $10,000 payment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> All further undesignated section references are to the Civil Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\"> Porsche is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-11\"> TAG argues that Kim waived his right to appeal because the settlement agreement required Kim to file a request for dismissal with prejudice within seven calendar days of the ruling on Kim\u2019s attorney fee motion. The contention is not well taken. The right of appeal should not be considered waived or abandoned except where the record clearly establishes it. <em>(People y. Vargas </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1661-1662 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 445].) Here, the record does not demonstrate any knowing waiver of the right to appeal. The only reasonable interpretation of the attorney fees provision in the settlement agreement is that Kim reserved the right to apply to the trial court for attorney fees and to appeal an unfavorable ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> For purposes of an award of costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1021, section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) defines \u201cprevailing party\u201d as \u201cthe party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. When any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\"> In <em>Elster, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action seeking to enjoin their downstairs neighbors from further harassing them. The trial court brokered a stipulated judgment in which both sides agreed to refrain from harassing or annoying the other. A few months later, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs including attorney fees, which the trial court awarded over the defendants\u2019 objection that they, too, were prevailing parties. The appellate court affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
