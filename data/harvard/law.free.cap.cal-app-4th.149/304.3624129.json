(Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (f)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends the trial court erred by failing to exercise its discretion under section 290, subdivision (g)(2) to declare his offense a misdemeanor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In . 2001, Gonzalez suffered two separate convictions for annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 (\u00a7 647.6, subd. (a)), and was ordered to register as a sex offender pursuant to section 290. In 2006, Gonzalez was arrested, and told officers that he had been homeless for two years. The officers discovered that his last annual registration as a sex offender had been in April 2004 when he had been informed that, as a transient, he was required to register every 30 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Gonzalez was charged with failure to file a change of address (\u00a7 290, subd. (f)(1)), failure to update his registration annually (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1)(C)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>failure to update his registration every 30 days <em>(ibid.) </em>and public intoxication (\u00a7 647, subd. (f)). The three section 290 offenses were charged as felonies. In a plea agreement, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to felony failure to file a change of address (\u00a7 290, subd. (f)(1)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the other charges were dismissed. The trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Gonzalez on formal probation subject, among other conditions, to serving 90 days in county jail. The trial court issued a certificate of probable cause permitting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Section 290, subdivision (g)(2) provides that failure by a sex offender registrant to notify authorities of a change of address constitutes a felony if the underlying offense requiring registration is a felony. (\u00a7 290, subd. (g)(2).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Subdivision (g)(9) establishes the misdemeanor of providing false information on a registration form and requites additional punishment for that misdemeanor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gonzalez makes the novel claim that the reference to subdivision (g)(9) in subdivision (g)(2) converts subdivision (g)(2) into a \u201cwobbler\u201d statute because subdivision (g)(9) pertains to a misdemeanor. Based on this claim, Gonzalez contends that the trial court erred by failing to exercise its discretion to impose felony or misdemeanor punishment. (\u00a7 17, subd. (b).) We disagree. The reference to subdivision (g)(9) in subdivision (g)(2) appears misplaced and, perhaps, confusing, but it does not convert subdivision (g)(2) into a statute that gives the court discretion to impose either felony or misdemeanor punishment for a registration violation when registration was required as the result of a felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Upon changing address or location, a sex offender registrant must inform the law enforcement agency where the registrant previously resided of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>his or her new address or location. (\u00a7 290, subd. (f)(1).) A violation of the statute can be either a misdemeanor or a felony depending on whether the registrant\u2019s underlying sex offense was a felony or misdemeanor. (\u00a7 290, subd. (g)(1), (2); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hofsheier </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1185, 1196 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 821, 129 P.3d 29].) Subdivision (g)(1) provides for imprisonment in county jail if the registerable offense is a misdemeanor, while subdivision (g)(2) provides for imprisonment in state prison if the registerable offense is a felony. Section 290, subdivision (g)(2) is a mandatory sentencing provision that requires the imposition of a felony sentence whenever a person is required to register based on an underlying felony sex offense. (See <em>People v. Prothero </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 126, 130, 134 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 779].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Gonzalez\u2019s second section 647.6, subdivision (a) conviction was a felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, his current violation of section 290, subdivision (f)(1) was properly charged as a felony (\u00a7 647.6, subd. (c)), and requires a felony sentence pursuant to. section 290, subdivision (g)(2). The reference to subdivision (g)(9) in section 290, subdivision (g)(2) does not affect this result by giving the court discretion to impose a misdemeanor punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The only reasonable interpretation of the language , \u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraphs (5), (7), and (9)\u201d contained in subdivision (g)(2) is that a sentence for the misdemeanor must be added to the felony sentence otherwise required by subdivision (g)(2).  The words of a statute must be read in context consistently with their statutory purpose, and parts of a statute must be construed harmoniously. <em>(People v. King </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 59, 69 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The legislative intent in adding section 290, subdivision (g)(9) in 2005 was to create a substantive crime, not to fundamentally alter section 290, subdivision (g)(2). Subdivision (g)(9) was enacted because \u201c[t]he Department of Justice indicates it has seen a recurring problem in how to charge registrants who either give false information on a registration form or omit required information, and that some courts have rejected these charges because the statute does not specifically recite these violations.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2527 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) June 15, 2004.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">While the legislative drafting might have been better, Gonzalez\u2019s interpretation of section 290, subdivision (g)(2) is not plausible. Subdivision (g)(2) is a critical element in the section 290 statutory scheme whose manifest purpose is to require a felony sentence for a registration violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>when the registration requirement was imposed as the result of the commission of a felony. Gonzalez\u2019s position would eviscerate subdivision (g)(2) by allowing a court to sentence a registration violation as a misdemeanor in every case where the registration requirement was imposed as the result of an underlying felony conviction. \u201cWe do not abandon our common sense when we become judges.\u201d <em>(People v. Buena Vista Mines, Inc. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1036 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 21].) Section 290, subdivision (g)(2), provides exclusively for felony punishment and section 290, subdivision (g)(9) provides exclusively for misdemeanor punishment. Neither gives the trial court discretion to treat any registration violation as either a felony or misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Gilbert, P.
