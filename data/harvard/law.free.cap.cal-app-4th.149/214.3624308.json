In connection with these offenses, the People asserted gang enhancements pursuant to Penal Code section 186.22, alleging the crimes were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. Prior to trial Albarran sought to exclude evidence of his gang affiliation and the other gang evidence arguing it was irrelevant to the charges and was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 352. After conducting an Evidence Code section 402 hearing, the court concluded a sufficient factual foundation existed to support the gang allegations and that the gang evidence was relevant (and not overly prejudicial) on the issues of intent and motive for the underlying charges. The jury convicted Albarran, and found the gang allegations true. Thereafter, Albarran filed a motion for a new trial asserting sufficient evidence did not support the gang allegations and that admission of irrelevant and prejudicial gang evidence warranted a new trial on all charges. The trial court granted the new trial motion with respect to the gang allegations, but denied it as to the underlying charges, finding the gang evidence was relevant to issues of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">On appeal from the judgment, Albarran asserts the trial court should <em>not </em>have admitted the gang evidence in the first instance (and/or should have granted his new trial motion in its entirety) because the gang evidence was completely irrelevant and highly prejudicial. He further asserts the erroneous admission of this evidence constituted prejudicial error under state law and also rendered the trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of federal due process. As we shall explain, the trial court should have granted Albarran a new trial on all charges. Our review of the entire record convinces us that certain extremely prejudicial gang evidence was not relevant to the underlying charges; the People failed to present sufficient evidence these crimes were gang motivated. Furthermore, given the highly inflammatory nature of the gang evidence presented, we cannot say the error in admitting the evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Crimes. On March 14, 2004, Michael Bacelis hosted a birthday party for a family member at his home in Palmdale. About 1:00 a.m., Bacelis, who was in an upstairs bedroom putting a child to bed, heard gunfire from outside in front of his house. At the time there were still 20 to 25 people in the house and backyard. After the gunfire began, Bacelis ran to the front entrance of his house. He observed two male Hispanics with shaved heads standing about three houses away, holding guns. One of the young men had a shotgun while the other had a handgun. They continued to fire at the front of Bacelis\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Bryan Monterrosa was sitting in a parked car near Bacelis\u2019s house. He also heard the gunfire and looked up and saw two young men with guns pointed at the house. One of the shooters stood 7 to 10 feet away from Monterrosa and the other shooter, later identified as Albarran, was holding a handgun arid stood about a foot away from where Monterrosa sat inside the car. When interviewed by police, Monterrosa identified the shooters as Hispanic males with shaved heads. Monterrosa did not identify Albarran' as one of the shooters; he stated he did not see their faces well enough to recognize either of them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">After the shooting stopped, Bacelis jumped into his SUV, which was parked in front of his house, and began to follow the shooters as they fled down the street on foot. The young men turned a comer and as Bacelis, turned he saw a car with its lights off at the end of that street. The car appeared to be backing up; it then came to a istop and Bacelis saw the two shooters jump into the car. Bacelis initially thought the car was the getaway vehicle and he proceeded toward it. The car turned left in front of Bacelis\u2019s SUV and Bacelis crashed his car into it. Two males jumped out of the car and fled on foot. Bacelis was unable to identify the shooters.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The car was driven by Lizette Arvizu, Bacelis\u2019s neighbor. According to Arvizu, shortly before her car was struck by Bacelis\u2019s SUV, she had driven to the area with her cousin, Andrea, her friend Monique and Monique\u2019s cousin Frankie. Lizette was driving, Andrea rode in the front passenger seat and Monique\" and Frankie sat in the backseat. Lizette had been driving toward Monique\u2019s house when she heard gunfire'and saw people mnning toward her car. Lizette put her car in reverse intending to back out of the area. A male holding a long gun suddenly jumped into the backseat of the vehicle. The male told her to \u201cjust drive, go.\u201d As she started to make a left turn to leave the area; her car was struck by Bacelis\u2019s SUV. Monique testified that she was struck in the head by the long gun. After the collision, another male jumped into the backseat and Frankie jumped out and ran. The second male' carried a shorter gun and may also have said \u201cdrive\u201d or \u201cgo.\u201d Lizette told the young men to get out of the car because it would not drive. Both young men got out and fled on foot. The young women stated they were frightened, upset, and under stress but also got quick (one-to-two second) glances at both young men. They told the jury the second male was a Hispanic teenager.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>About six weeks later, Lizette, Andrea and Monique identified Albarran from a one-of-six-array photo lineup. The young women stated Albarran was the second male who carried the small handgun. Though none of the young women had mentioned it to the police during the investigation, the young women said they recalled the second young man had a small mole/birthmark on his face and recognized Albarran from the photos because he too had a small mole/birthmark on his face. The young women also conceded that they discussed the facts, including their respective identifications, on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Albarran\u2019s Arrest and the Trial Proceedings. According to Deputy Robert Gillis (the deputy who arrested Albarran), when Albarran was taken into custody, Albarran told the officer: \u201cMan, this is messed up. We jumped into that bitch\u2019s car when we got in that shooting and she drove us out of the area.\u201d The officer also stated Albarran remarked: \u201cWell, whatever. She got hit by a guy and I just told her to go, go, go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Albarran was charged with: (1) attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder of Michael Bacelis (count 1); (2) shooting at an inhabited dwelling (count 2); (3) three counts of attempted kidnapping for carjacking (as to Lizette Arvizu, Andrea Arvizu and Monique Gonzalez) (counts 3-5); and (4) three counts of attempted carjacking (as to Lizette Arvizu, Andrea Arvizu and Monique Gonzalez) (counts 6-8). As to each charge the People also alleged various enhancements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including a gang enhancement pursuant to Penal Code section 186.22. The enhancement alleged the crimes had been committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in \u00e1ssociation with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further or assist in criminal conduct by gang members. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Prior to trial Albarran filed a motion to challenge the admission of any evidence of Albarran\u2019s gang affiliation and evidence concerning whether the crimes were gang related as irrelevant. He also argued the evidence was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 352. The prosecutor argued the case presented a \u201cclassic\u201d gang shooting and that the entire purpose of the shooting was to gain respect and enhance the shooters\u2019 reputations within the gang community, and to intimidate the neighborhood\u2014essentially to \u201cearn one\u2019s bones\u201d within the gang. The prosecutor noted, however, that he had no percipient witness or evidence to prove the crime was gang related or motivated, but instead would be relying on testimony of the sheriff\u2019s gang expert, Deputy Gillis, who was most familiar with Albarran and his gang, the 13 Kings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>During the Evidence Code section 402 hearing, Deputy Gillis testified to his numerous contacts with Albarran and to Albarran\u2019s admission that he was an active member of the 13 Kings street gang. Deputy Gillis described the types of crimes committed by the 13 Kings, Albarran\u2019s gang tattoos, and gang graffiti at Albarran\u2019s house. While he conceded he was aware of no direct evidence (no gang signs shown, announcements or gang graffiti) that specifically linked the 13 Kings or Albarran to these crimes, he believed the offenses were gang related because there were two shooters involved, and the crime would intimidate people. Gillis conceded, however, he did not know the exact reason for the shooting, though he was told there were members of another gang, Los Compadres, at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The court denied Albarran\u2019s Evidence Code section 402 motion, concluding that the prosecutor had laid a sufficient foundation for the expert testimony on the gang enhancements and gang evidence (including Albarran\u2019s gang affiliation, tattoos, gang behavior, activities, crimes). The court also concluded the evidence- was' relevant to the issues of motive and intent as to the underlying charges.' The trial court further noted it had assessed the evidence under Evidence Code section 352 and determined that its probative value outweighed any resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The case proceeded to trial. During the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument, he made a number of references to Albarran being a member of a \u201cdangerous\u201d street gang, the 13 Kings. The prosecutor also showed a picture of Albarran\u2019s gang tattoos, describing one of the tattoos as a \u201creference to the Mexican Mafia, which is a violent prison street gang that controls the Hispanic street gangs.\u201d The prosecutor noted that when a person has such a tattoo it shows allegiance to the Mexican Mafia.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">During the trial, two other sheriff\u2019s deputies, in addition to Deputy Gillis, testified that Albarran was a member of the 13 Kings street gang. Deputy Gillis testified he had 20 face-to-face contacts with Albarran in the prior two years. He described in detail Albarran\u2019s gang involvement, his tattoos and his gang moniker, \u201cFlaco.\u201d He testified that the shooting occurred in the 13 Kings\u2019 gang area not far from Albarran\u2019s home. Deputy Gillis stated Albarran had been \u201cjumped into\u201d the gang and that Albarran\u2019s brother had been recently jumped in as well. Deputy Gillis explained Albarran had a number of gang tattoos, including one referencing the Mexican Mafia. He also testified concerning the prevalence of 13 Kings graffiti around Albarran\u2019s home. Deputy Gillis described one piece of graffiti he attributed to Albarran\u2019s gang which contained a specific threat to murder police officers. He also identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>a number of 13 Kings gang members by name and monikers and described arresting them. Gillis told the jury the 13 Kings committed a number of criminal offenses, including robberies, driveby shootings, carjackings, and felony vandalism. Deputy Gillis explained how gang members gain respect by committing crimes and intimidating people. Deputy Gillis stated that during the commission of a crime a gang member makes himself known and can gain respect by showing or \u201cthrowing\u201d gang signs, yelling out an announcement of his presence or tagging. Gillis conceded that there was no evidence in this case that any of the shooters had made themselves known\u2014 the shooters made no announcements, did not throw any gang signs and there was no graffiti referring to the crime. Nonetheless, Gillis insisted that the shooters would gain respect within the gang absent such evidence because the people present at the party would know who was present at the party and would also know the shooters. Deputy Gillis testified that \u201cby word of mouth, word on the street,\u201d it was known the Los Compadres gang was at the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Deputy Gillis opined that the shooting of Bacelis\u2019s house was gang related and intended to benefit the 13 Kings street gang because; (1) the shooting occurred in Palmdale; (2) it occurred at a party and gang members often <em>commit </em>crimes during parties; and (3) more than one shooter was involved. Deputy Gillis stated that when these crimes were committed the 13 Kings were involved in an active gang war. Deputy Gillis also testified that Michael Bacelis was a member of another gang, the Pierce Boys Gang, but he admitted he was unfamiliar with the Pierce Boys Gang and knew of no rivalry between Albarran\u2019s gang and the Pierce Boys Gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Deputy Gillis also described how Albarran had \u201cconfessed\u201d to his involvement in the shooting when Gillis arrested him. Before Deputy Gillis was cross-examined, the court admonished the jury concerning the limited use of the evidence\u2014the court told the jury that the gang evidence could not be considered to prove that Albarran was a person of bad character or that he had a disposition to commit crimes, but could only be considered if it tended to show that the crimes committed were for the benefit of a street gang. The jury was also instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.09 concerning the proper and limited use of the gang evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Albarran presented an alibi defense from a number of family members and friends who testified Albarran was at a party with his family in Sun Valley at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>During his closing, the prosecutor made a number of references to Albarran\u2019s gang involvement. He told the jury that the crime was gang motivated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor also argued that because Albarran was a gang member his alibi was unbelievable. He also warned the jury not to be fooled by Albarran\u2019s \u201caltar boy\u201d appearance at trial; he reminded the jury that Albarran was an active member of the 13 Kings with gang tattoos.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The jury convicted Albarran on counts 1 through 5 and found him not guilty on counts 6 through 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to counts 1 through 5 the jury also found the gang enhancement allegation true.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Albarran filed a motion for a new trial asserting that insufficient evidence supported the gang enhancement allegations. He also asked for a new trial on the underlying charges, arguing that absent the gang allegations, the gang evidence was irrelevant and overly prejudicial. The court granted the new trial motion as to the gang enhancements and denied it as to the underlying charges. The gang allegations were dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Albarran appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Before this court, Albarran complains the gang evidence presented at his trial was irrelevant and inadmissible. Specifically he argues the trial court should haVe excluded the evidence prior to trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, Albarran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>asserts, the court thereafter having found the gang evidence was insufficient to prove the gang allegations, should have also concluded the gang evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial as to the underlying charges, and thus, the court should have granted his new trial motion in its entirety. Albarran further asserts the erroneous admission of the gang evidence requires reversal because it amounts to prejudicial error under state law and deprived him of his constitutional due process rights under federal law to a fair trial. We address Albarran\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A. <em>Admission of Gang Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">California courts have long recognized the potentially prejudicial effect of gang membership. As one California Court of Appeal observed: \u201cIt is fair to say that when the word \u2018gang\u2019 is used in Los Angeles County, one does not have visions of the characters from the \u2018Our Little Gang\u2019 series. The word gang . . . connotes opprobrious implications. . . . [T]he word \u2018gang\u2019 takes on a sinister meaning when it is associated with activities.\u201d <em>(People v. Perez </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 470, 479 [170 Cal.Rptr. 619].) Given its highly inflammatory impact, the California Supreme Court has condemned the introduction of such evidence if it is only <em>tangentially </em>relevant to the charged offenses. <em>(People v. Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 660 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351].) In fact, in cases not involving gang enhancements, the Supreme Court has held evidence of gang membership should not be admitted if its probative value is minimal. <em>(People v. Hernandez </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1047 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 94 P.3d 1080].) \u201cGang evidence should not be admitted at trial where its sole relevance is to show a defendant\u2019s criminal disposition or bad character as a means of creating an inference the defendant committed the charged offense.\u201d <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1449 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 16].)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Thus, as general rule, evidence of gang membership and activity is admissible if it is logically relevant to some material issue in the case, other than character evidence, is not more prejudicial than probative and is not cumulative. <em>(People v. Avitia </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 185,192 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 887].) Consequently, gang evidence may be relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s motive, intent or some fact concerning the charged offenses other than criminal propensity as long as the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 193 [66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]; see generally Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s gang affiliation\u2014including evidence of the gang\u2019s territory, membership, signs, symbols, beliefs and practices, criminal enterprises, rivalries, and the like\u2014can help prove identity, motive, modus operandi, specific intent, means of applying force or fear, or other issues pertinent to guilt of the charged crime. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 1049.) Nonetheless, even if the evidence is found to be relevant, the trial court must carefully scrutinize gang-related evidence before admitting it because of its potentially inflammatory impact on the jury. <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 193; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1194 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 553, 70 P.3d 981] [evidence of defendant\u2019s gang membership although relevant to motive or identity creates a risk the jury will improperly infer defendant has a criminal disposition and is therefore guilty of the charged offense and thus must be carefully scrutinized].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We review the court\u2019s order denying the motion for a new trial de novo. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ault </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1262 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 95 P.3d 523] .)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the decision on whether evidence, including gang evidence, is relevant, not unduly prejudicial and thus admissible, rests within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avitia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 193.) \u201cWhere, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion \u2018must not be disturbed on appeal <em>except </em>on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1], original italics; see <em>People v. Olguin </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1369-1370 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 596].) It is appellant\u2019s burden on appeal to establish an abuse of discretion and prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 308, 316 [228 Cal.Rptr. 197, 721 P.2d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In his pretrial motion to exclude the gang evidence, Albarran argued the gang evidence was irrelevant and otherwise inadmissible under Evidence Code section 352. In connection with his motion for new trial he argued that the gang evidence was irrelevant to the underlying charges, inflammatory, unduly prejudicial, and constituted \u201cbad character\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">At the hearing on the new trial motion, the court announced its tentative ruling to grant the motion as to the gang allegation and to deny it as to the underlying charges. The court then gave both sides an opportunity to argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Albarran agreed with the court\u2019s view that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the gang allegation. He also asserted, however, that the gang evidence admitted was only relevant to the gang allegation and that absent the gang allegation none of the other gang evidence was relevant or admissible to the underlying charges. Albarran argued that but for the gang evidence he would have been acquitted. The court then asked Albarran whether at least \u201csome\u201d of the gang evidence would have been admissible even without the gang allegation. Albarran answered in the negative. The court disagreed, responding that gang evidence is admissible absent a Penal Code section 186.22 allegation for the limited purpose to prove motive and intent. Albarran then responded that the evidence was nonetheless inadmissible because there was no evidence of any particular motive in the case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that the gang evidence was used to create a motive not otherwise suggested by the evidence. When the prosecutor was given an opportunity to speak, he stated his agreement with \u201cthe court\u2019s analysis with respect to the relevance of gang evidence when there is no longer a gang allegation .... that it is relevant to motive [and] intent.\u201d The prosecutor continued that in his view \u201cwhat we\u2019re left with . . . it\u2019s a 352 issue . . . what is the weight of the evidence against Mr. Albarran in making a determination on that 352 issue and whether or not that evidence was\u2014its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d The prosecutor also emphasized that at the pretrial Evidence Code section 402 hearing the court admitted the evidence to prove the gang allegation and to prove motive and intent for the underlying charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">At the conclusion of the argument the court stated: \u201cThe court did consider the arguments raised that the sheer introduction of the gang evidence in and of itself, in essence, poisoned the well and was too prejudicial and inflammatory. In its review of the evidence, the court considered the independent strength of the evidence, including the identifications in this case. The statements attributed to the defendant, in determining whether or not the gang evidence that did come in, which the court would not describe as being overwhelming, but whether or not that gang evidence in and of itself, if it did come in, would affect the jury\u2019s verdict as to the remaining charges. The court\u2019s opinion is that it would not have affected the verdict one way or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Though the trial court did not expressly so state, a fair reading of the transcript from the hearing on the new trial motion indicates' the trial court held the view that at least some of the gang evidence was relevant and admissible to the issue of motive or intent for the underlying crimes, irrespective of the fact that the gang evidence was not sufficient to prove the gang allegations (i.e., that the crimes were gang related and/or committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang). The same bench officer presided over the pretrial, trial and posttrial proceedings. The court\u2019s question and comments at the hearing on the new trial motion concerning the relevancy of the gang evidence to issues of motive and intent clearly echoed the views it had earlier expressed at the Evidence Code section 402 hearing when it ruled the evidence was admissible to prove the underlying charges. In addition, the language the court used in expressing its ruling implies it engaged in, as suggested by the prosecutor, a type of Evidence Code section 352 balancing of prejudicial versus probative values and such an analysis presupposed the relevance of the gang evidence to the underlying charges. Consequently, we have no doubt the court continued to hold the view the gang evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>relevant to the motive and/or intent and that such an opini\u00f3n played a significant role (even though the court did not so expressly state in its ruling) in the court\u2019s decision to deny the new trial motion as to the underlying charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">At trial the prosecutor argued the motive for the shooting was to gain respect and enhance the shooter\u2019s reputation\u2014essentially to \u201cearn one\u2019s bones\u201d within the gang (i.e., the \u201crespect\u201d motive). In our view, however, there was insufficient evidence to support the contention that this shooting was done with the intent to gain respect. On the contrary, the motive for the underlying crimes, in particular the shooting at Bacelis\u2019s house, was not apparent from the circumstances of the crime. The shooting occurred at a private birthday party for Bacelis\u2019s cousin. Although according to Deputy Gillis, Bacelis was a member of the Pierce Boys Gang, Bacelis\u2019s gang did not have any known or relevant gang rivalries. Deputy Gillis testified that gang members commit crimes to gain respect and enhance their status, within .the gang, He noted a gang member gains such respect if his identity (or the identity of his gang) becomes known to the victim(s), within the gang community and/or the neighborhood. Yet this shooting presented.no signs of gang members\u2019 efforts in that regard\u2014there was no evidence the shooters announced their presence or purpose\u2014before, during or after the shooting. There was no evidence presented that any gang members had \u201cbragged\u201d about their involvement or created graffiti and took credit for it. In fact, at the Evidence Code section 402 hearing Deputy Gillis conceded he did not know the reason for the shooting, though he had \u201cheard\u201d that gang members were present at the party. There is nothing inherent in the facts of the shooting to suggest any specific gang motive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the final analysis, the only evidence to support the respect motive is the fact of Albarran\u2019s gang affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Even if we were to conclude that evidence of Albarran\u2019s gang membership and some evidence concerning gang behavior were relevant to the issue of motive and intent, other extremely inflammatory gang evidence was admitted, which had no connection to these crimes. The prosecution presented a panoply of incriminating gang evidence, which might have been tangentially relevant to the gang allegations, but had no bearing on the underlying charges. Deputy Gillis testified at length<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> about the identities of other 13 Kings members, the wide variety of crimes \u25a0 they had committed and the numerous contacts between the various gang members (other than Albarran) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>and the police. He described a specific threat 13 Kings had made in their graffiti to kill police officers. The jury heard references to the Mexican Mafia both during the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument and in Deputy Gillis\u2019s testimony. All of this evidence was irrelevant to the underlying charges and obviously prejudicial. Evidence of Albarran\u2019s gang involvement, standing alone, was sufficient proof of gang motive. Evidence of threats to kill police officers, descriptions of the criminal activities of other gang members, and reference to the Mexican Mafia had little or no bearing on any other material issue relating to Albarran\u2019s guilt on the charged crimes and approached being classified as overkill.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the court did admonish the jury concerning the proper use of the gang evidence, certain gang evidence admitted was so extraordinarily prejudicial and of such little relevance that it raised the distinct potential to sway the jury to convict regardless of Albarran\u2019s actual guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We are troubled by the lack of scrutiny given to the gang evidence (and its potential for prejudice) when the court denied the new trial motion on the underlying charges. When viewed in the full context of the arguments of counsel and discussion at hearing on the new trial motion, the trial court effectively endorsed the conclusions it had reached pretrial about the relevance of the gang evidence to the issues of motive and intent. The court impliedly found that \u201csome\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the gang evidence was in fact relevant before proceeding to quasi-Evidence-Code-section-352/prejudice analysis in which it concluded the'gang evidence presented did not affect the verdict in view of the strength of the other non-gang evidence. As previously addressed, howbver, certain of the gang evidence, i.e., threats against police, reference to the Mexican Mafia, and descriptions of other crimes committed by other gang members, was irrelevant, cumulative and presented a substantial risk of undue prejudice. The paramount function of this evidence was to show Albarran\u2019s briminal disposition\u2014a f\u00e1fct emphasized in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument when he argued: \u201c[Albarran] is all about being a gang member day in and day out, every day, every night, despite efforts of the deputies .... He\u2019s all about it:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">B. <em>Prejudicial Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We turn then to the issue of prejudice. Albarran does not base his appeal solely on the argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting gang evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>violated rules of evidence and prejudiced the verdict under state law. If this were so, we would now examine whether the result of the trial would have been the same, absent the error, under the \u201creasonably probable\u201d standard of <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Instead, he claims that the erroneous admission of this evidence was so serious as to violate his federal constitutional rights to due process, rendering his trial fundamentally unfair. (See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 62, 70 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 112 S.Ct. 475]; <em>People v.

If Albarran demonstrates the admission of evidence violated federal due process rights, he need not demonstrate the <em>Watson </em>standard for prejudicial error. Under <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824], in the case of a deprivation of federal due process, reversal is required unless the state can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. (See <em>People v. Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 428 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391] <em>[Watson </em>standard applies to prejudicial-error analysis for errors of state law, while beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18 applies to similar analysis for federal constitutional errors].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">To prove a deprivation of federal due process rights, Albarran must satisfy a high constitutional standard to show that the erroneous admission of evidence resulted' in an unfair trial.

Even then, the evidence must \u2018be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.\u2019 [Citations.] Only under such circumstances can it be inferred that the jury must have used the evidence for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>{Jammal v.

The trial court\u2019s ruling on the new trial motion in which it broadly concluded the gang evidence was admissible to prove motive and intent for the underlying charges was arbitrary and fundamentally unfair. As we have concluded elsewhere, the prosecution did not prove that this gang evidence had a bearing on the issues of intent and motive. We thus discern \u201cno permissible inferences\u201d that could be drawn by the jury from this evidence. <em>(Jammal </em>v. <em>Van de Kamp, supra, </em>926 F.2d at p. 920, italics omitted.) From this evidence there was a real danger that the jury would improperly infer that whether or not Albarran was involved in these shootings, he had committed other crimes, would commit crimes in the future, and posed a danger to the police and society in general and thus he should be punished. Furthermore, this gang evidence was extremely and uniquely inflammatory,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> such that the prejudice arising from the jury\u2019s exposure to it could only have served to cloud their resolution of the issues.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In our view, looking at the effect of this evidence on the trial as a whole, we believe that this prejudicial gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>evidence was \u201c \u2018of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jammal v.

However, in cases such as this, where the trial court denied the motion for a new trial, the authorities are less clear regarding the standard of review. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1262, fn. 7 [noting the lack of uniformity in the standard of review].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">For example, in <em>People v.

Based on these premises,.the dissent endeavors to analyze the issue of prejudice by offering an analogy to law governing joinder and severance, describing the question as \u201cwhether admission of the gang evidence, even though the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that evidence admissible at the time of the section 402 hearing, \u2018actually resulted in \u201cgross unfairness\u201d amou\u00f1ting to a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">As we have elsewhere explained, however, we question whether (even considering the gang allegations) certain gang evidence (i.e., threats against police, reference to the Mexican Mafia) should have been excluded pretrial as irrelevant or unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352. In addition, we read the trial court\u2019s ruling at the hearing on the new trial motion to have included an implicit (and erroneous) finding that at least some (unidentified) gang evidence was relevant to the issues of motive and intent for the underlying charges. Thus, in our view the reliance on an analogy from the law governing joinder and severance, which was not offered, suggested or even briefed by any of the parties, is both unnecessary and inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Instead, the analysis of prejudice properly proceeds to examine whether the <em>erroneous admission </em>of gang evidence was so serious as to violate Albarran\u2019s federal constitutional right's to due process, rendering his trial fundamentally unfair under tests formulated by <em>Jammal </em>and <em>Reiger.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> Indeed, more than one California court has recognized references to the Mexican Mafia are extremely prejudicial.

Thus, in the joinder and severance context, if the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to sever is correct at the time it was made, the appellate court must nevertheless reverse the judgment if the \u201c \u2018defendant shows that joinder actually resulted in \u201cgross unfairness\u201d amounting to a denial of due process.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

The issue is not whether the evidence is sufficient to support the convictions on the joined counts, independent of the evidence on other counts. \u201c \u2018The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lane, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 449 [106 S.Ct. 725].) In further explaining the \u201csubstantial influence analysis,\u201d the Supreme Court stated: \u201c[I]f one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Kotteakos, supra, </em>328 U.S. at p. 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Applying this \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test, given the extremely inflammatory nature of certain gang evidence, we cannot say (even considering the other evidence against Albarran) that the verdict was not substantially swayed by the error. Thus, even under the severance and joinder analogy, reversal is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The dissent, however, while citing <em>Lane </em>and <em>Kotteakos, </em>does not actually use the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test derived from its joinder and severance analogy. Instead the dissent borrows the test from another entirely unrelated context, namely, the prejudicial error test applied to assess the impact of discovery and <em>Brady </em>violations <em>(Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194]). (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>pp. 239-240.) Specifically, in the discovery/Brady violation context a wronged defendant must convince the court that \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability\u2019 that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed documents had been disclosed to the defense.\u201d <em>(Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 263, 289-290 [144 L.Ed.2d 286, 119 S.Ct. 1936], quoting <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 419, 433, 434 [131 L.Ed.2d 490, 115 S.Ct. 1555] [\u201c \u2018The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In this formulation of the \u201cfundamental fairness\" test as derived from this case law involving discovery errors and <em>Brady </em>violations, the dissent has weighed the (non-gang) evidence against what it characterizes as the \u201cpotential\u201d prejudicial impact of the gang evidence and concludes the independent evidence establishing guilt was so strong that no gross unfairness occurred which undermines the confidence in the verdict. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 239-240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">We cannot agree with the dissent\u2019s choice of fundamental fairness test or how the dissent applies it. A Brady/discovery violation is a procedural error in the trial; it concerns the failure to produce evidence which ultimately may or may not have benefited the defendant and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>may or may not have been even presented or even considered- by the jury. Thus the likely impact of a Brady!discovery error on the verdict is far from certain, and extremely difficult to measure. Thus, the fundamental fairness test in the <em>Brady </em>context attempts to determine prejudice by looking at whether, without the <em>Brady </em>evidence, the defendant nonetheless received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">In contrast, here the error concerns, not the omission or exclusion of evidence from the trial, but evidence which the jury actually heard and which was emphasized throughout the trial. Where, as here, the trial is infused with gang evidence, it is simply not possible to assess the fairness of the trial in its absence, as is the case in the <em>Brady </em>context. The gang evidence in this case was plainly and without question prejudicial to defendant. Legions of cases and other legal authorities have recognized the prejudicial effect of gang evidence upon jurors. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Cardenas </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 897, 904-905 [184 Cal.Rptr. 165, 647 P.2d 569] [where a defendant -is a known gang member, evidence of gang membership creates a real danger the jury will infer the defendant is guilty because of his membership standing alone]; Howarth, <em>Representing Black Male Innocence, </em>(1977) 1 J. Gender Race &amp; Just. 97, 139 [\u201cGangs are a social phenomenon, in which the individual\u2019s identity is linked (often brutally) to the group. At least in theory criminal trials focus on individual culpability. [But in the case of introducing gang evidence] individual guilt or innocence [may become] hazy and faded behind the wall of group identity and group guilt\u201d].) Indeed, because of the way in which gangs terrorize the community, the crimes they commit, and their prevalence in society the very mention of the term \u201cgangs\u201d strikes fear in the hearts of most. In addition, the Legislature has singled out gang-related crimes, for enhanced punishment. For these reasons, in our view, the erroneous introduction of gang evidence, should be assessed under a less anemic test for fundamental fairness than the one used by the dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\"> In view of our conclusion that this evidence- violated federal due process protections and constituted error under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, we need not assess whether it also constitutes reversible error under <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra </em>46 Cal.2d.818, 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>PERLUSS, P. J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AkR\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Adan Albarran was convicted after a jury trial of one count of attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a)), one count of shooting at an inhabited dwelling (Pen. Code, \u00a7 246) and three counts of attempted kidnapping for caqacking (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 209.5, subd. (a)). The jury also found true firearm use allegations as to several counts (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)) and, with respect to all counts, a special allegation the crimes had been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang and with the specific intent to promote or assist in criminal conduct by gang members (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(A)). The trial court granted Albarran\u2019s motion for a new trial with respect to the gang allegations, concluding the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury\u2019s true findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the court denied Albarran\u2019s motion for a new trial with respect to the underlying offenses, holding the admission of the gang evidence, \u201cwhich the court would not describe as being overwhelming,\u201d was not so prejudicial as to deprive Albarran of a fair trial in light of the independent evidence of his guilt, including witness identifications and the incriminating statements attributed to Albarran himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">1. <em>The Pretrial Ruling on the Admissibility of the Gang Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Although Albarran asserts the trial court abused its discretion in ruling at the pretrial Evidence Code section 402 (section 402) hearing that the People had established a sufficient foundation for the admission of the gang evidence, he does not press that claim on appeal. To the contrary, in his opening brief Albarran advises us we need not address the issue: \u201cThis Court, however, need not determine whether the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d Instead, he advances only a single ground for reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of his new trial motion: \u201cThe extreme and highly inflammatory gang evidence that was admitted to prove the subsequently dismissed gang allegation unfairly prejudiced the defendant\u2019s trial on the underlying charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">It seems the majority has accepted this invitation, at least as I understand its opinion, and does not hold the trial court erred in its mling at the section 402 hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Before trial Albarran moved to exclude all gang evidence, arguing, although there was (undisputed) evidence Albarran was a member of the 13 Kings gang, there was no evidence the crimes charged were gang related. In particular, Albarran asserted there would be no evidence at trial the perpetrators called out a gang name or made gang signs during the shooting or its aftermath. The court ordered a section 402 hearing based on Albarran\u2019s motion and argument. At that hearing Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Robert Gillis, a gang expert who had worked for more than three years in the Palmdale area where the crime occurred, testified 13 Kings (also known as Palmas) is the most active gang in the area and the gang frequently engages in the crimes of carjacking and drive-np shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Deputy Gillis expressed his opini\u00f3n Albarran is an active member of 13 Kings. According to Gillis, he has had many direct contacts with Albarran, who admitted to him he was a gang member in one of their face-to-face conversations; Albarran\u2019s gang moniker is \u201cFlaco\u201d; he has a \u201c13\u201d tattooed on one shoulder and \u00e1 \u201cK\u201d tattooed on the other shoulder; and Albarran\u2019s residence was known to be a 13 Kings gathering place. Gillis also testified in his opinion the March 14, 2004 shooting \u201cwas specifically intended to promote, further or assist a criminal street gang.\u201d Gillis noted the person whose house was the target of the gunfire was a member of the Pierce Boys gang (although he conceded he was not aware of any specific rivalry between that gang and 13 Kings) and explained it was an issue of respect: \u201cYou\u2019ll get rival gang members that go to the same party\u2014and it\u2019s a respect issue, where if they show their muscle; who they are, what they do, maybe not even necessarily say, \u2018we\u2019re 13K,\u2019 but people on the street will know that they\u2019re 13K or Palmas, which is what they were often claiming then. They don\u2019t necessarily need to claim it for people to know who they are.\u201d Finally, Gillis testified (albeit without any factual foundation) the second shooter with Albarran was also a member of 13 Kings and, in his experience, when gang members carry out a shooting, they typically do so with- other gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Following Deputy Gillis\u2019s testimony Albarran asked the court to dismiss the gang enhancement allegations, and to exclude the gang evidence. The court denied the motion, recognizing that gang evidence necessarily creates some risk of undue prejudice, but concluding in this instance, \u201cbased on the testimony of Deputy Gillis that there is a sufficient foundation that has been presented that does intertwine, not only the charges but also the gang allegation. All of this comes together in terms of reasoning or the intent or the motive behind the shooting. . . . The court does not believe that the gang evidence as a whole\u2014that the probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Based on this record, we could not hold the trial court exercised its discretion to allow the gang evidence at trial, including evidence that may not have been directly relevant to Albarran\u2019s motive or intent but was highly probative on the gang enhancement allegations, in \u201c \u2018 \u201can arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 437-438 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 28 P.3d 78]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 193, 196 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710] [\u201cwe have without question permitted police to provide expert testimony regarding gangs\u201d].) The trial court properly balanced the probative value of that evidence with respect to both the underlying offenses and the gang' enhancement allegations against the potential for prejudice and determined the gang expert testimony should be permitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">2. <em>The Majority\u2019s Misperception of the Trial Court\u2019s Ruling Denying a New Trial on the Underlying Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">If the gang evidence was not improperly admitted at trial, at least when viewed from the trial court\u2019s <em>ex ante </em>perspective, on what ground does the majority hold the court erred in denying Albarran\u2019s new trial motion? The majority concludes the trial court failed to give sufficient scrutiny to the gang evidence and, in particular, its potential for prejudice and, by improperly concluding much of that evidence was admissible on the underlying charges without regard to the gang enhancements, rendered Albarran\u2019s trial \u201cso arbitrary and fundamentally unfair\u201d that it violated due process. To reach this result, the majority proceeds in three steps, each of which is problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">First, it engages in a lengthy analysis demonstrating that much of the gang evidence relating to the various criminal activities of the 13 Kings, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>without doubt had a high potential for prejudice, would not have been admissible over an Evidence Code section 352 objection if there had been no gang enhancement allegations in the information and the only basis for admitting the evidence were to prove Albarran\u2019s motive or intent in connection with the attempted murder and other substantive crimes charged. I do not disagree with the analysis itself, but believe it is essentially irrelevant to the issue before us because there were, in fact, special gang enhancement allegations tried to the jury. As discussed, the trial court did not err in ruling <em>before </em>trial that the gang evidence proffered by the People was admissible under those circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, as indicated below, I believe the proper analysis focuses not on comparing the potential for undue prejudice from the admission of the gang evidence to its probative value with respect to the underlying charges, but rather on evaluating whether that evidence, even if properly admitted at trial, was nonetheless so prejudicial when viewed in light of the entire record that Albarran\u2019s trial was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Second, although qualifying its conclusion by twice noting the trial court \u201cdid not expressly so state\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 226), the majority insists the court necessarily, albeit \u201cimpliedly,\u201d found the gang evidence relevant to the issues of motive and intent before concluding, based on what it describes as a \u201cquasi-Evidence-Code-section-352/prejudice analysis\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 228), that the new trial motion should be denied because the gang evidence was not unduly prejudicial: \u201c[T]he language the court used in expressing its ruling implies it engaged in, as suggested by the prosecutor, a type of Evidence Code section 352 balancing of prejudice versus probative values and such an analysis presupposed the relevance of the gang evidence to the underlying charges. Consequently, we have no doubt the court continued to hold the view the gang evidence was relevant to the motive and/or intent and that such an opinion played a significant role (even though the court did not so expressly state in its ruling) in the court\u2019s decision to deny the new trial motion as to the underlying charge.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 226-227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">My disagreement with this second step rests on the fact the trial court did not engage in the analysis or make the ruling the majority attributes to it. To be sure, in connection with the pretrial motion to exclude all gang-related evidence, the trial court stated the gang enhancement allegations and underlying charges \u201cintertwine,\u201d and then found, \u201cAll of this comes together in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of reasoning or the intent or the motive behind the shooting.\u201d But even if this is properly construed as a pretrial ruling that all of the gang evidence was relevant to the issues of motive and intent without regard to the presence of the gang allegations (which I do not believe it is), the trial court made no such statement, let alone a ruling, in denying the new trial motion. To the contrary, in a colloquy with defense counsel during argument on the new trial motion, the court observed that \u201csome of the gang evidence [could] have come in even without the 186.22 allegation,\u201d never suggesting that all or even most of the evidence would have been admissible in the absence of the gang enhancement allegations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That issue of limited admissibility, however, did not constitute any part of the trial court\u2019s rationale for denying the new trial motion on the underlying charges. Rather, the court concluded the introduction of the gang evidence \u201cwould not have affected the verdict one way or the other\u201d in light of the independent strength of the identifications of Albarran and his own statement implicating himself in the crimes and, therefore, Albarran was not denied a fair trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Finally, based on its apparent misunderstanding of the trial court\u2019s ruling and relying on two decisions from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the majority holds, \u201c \u2018The dispositive issue is . . . whether the trial court committed an error which rendered the trial \u201cso \u2018arbitrary and fundamentally unfair\u2019 that it violated federal due process.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 229-230.) Applying that standard, the majority then decides, \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the new trial motion in which it broadly concluded the gang evidence was admissible to prove motive and intent for the underlying charges was arbitrary and fundamentally unfair.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 230.) Because the premise for this conclusion is fundamentally flawed, I cannot accept the conclusion itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>3. <em>Albarran\u2019s Trial Was Not Fundamentally Unfair</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">If the ruling identified by the majority as \u201carbitrary and fundamentally unfair\u201d was never made, is there any other basis for reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Albarran\u2019s motion for a new trial? Although there appear to be no published cases directly considering the issue before us\u2014how to evaluate the prejudicial impact of gang evidence properly admitted at trial only because special gang allegations were also included in the information when the evidence thereafter presented at trial is legally insufficient to support a true finding as to those allegations<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014a helpful analogy can be found in the law governing joinder and severance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">An appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s denial of a, pretrial severance motion based on the facts known and the showing made at the time of the motion itself. <em>(People v. Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 171 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480]; <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 576, 588 [253 Cal.Rptr. 710, 764 P.2d 1087].) However, even if the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to sever based upon the showing made at the time of the motion, \u201cthere remains the question whether, despite the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, a gross unfairness has occurred from the joinder such as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial or due process of law.\u201d (Johnson, at p. 590; accord, <em>People v. Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 940 [251 Cal.Rptr. 467, 760 P.2d 996].) In considering that question, the reviewing court examines the impact at trial of the joinder by looking at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>evidence actually introduced at trial\u2014the independent evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, as well as the spillover effect of the evidence from the joined charge. <em>(People v. Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 313 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669]; <em>Bean, </em>at p. .940.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Applying that analytic structure to the case at bar, the question is whether admission of the gang evidence, even though the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that evidence admissible at the time of the section 402 hearing, \u201cactually resulted in \u2018gross unfairness\u2019 amounting to a denial of due process.\u201d If it did, the trial court erred in denying Albarran\u2019s new trial motion. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Drake </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 92, 97-98 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 790] [trial court\u2019s constitutional duty to ensure defendants be accorded due process of law provides it with authority to grant new trial when defendant \u201cdid not receive a fair trial,\u201d even though cause of unfairness is not expressly recognized as ground for granting new trial under Pen. Code, \u00a7 1181]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 582 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].) The standard, then, is whether the gang evidence presented was so inflammatory when viewed in light of the record as a whole that it denied Albarran a fair trial: \u201cThe admission of relevant evidence will not offend due process unless the evidence is so prejudicial as to render the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 913 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182]; see <em>People v. Partida </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 439 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 122 P.3d 765] [\u201c[T]he admission of evidence, even if erroneous under state law, results in a due process violation only if it makes the trial <em>fundamentally unfair.'\u2019\u2019\u2019]', </em>see generally <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 219, 228-229 [86 L.Ed. 166, 62 S.Ct. 280] [\u201cWe do not sit to review state court action on questions of the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s action in the admission of evidence. We cannot hold, as petitioner urges, that the introduction and identification of the snakes so infused the trial with unfairness as to deny due process of law. The fact that evidence admitted as relevant by a court is shocking to the sensibilities of those in the courtroom cannot, for that reason alone, render its reception a violation of due process.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Although there is no single test for such \u201cfundamental unfairness,\u201d in a variety of contexts the United States and California Supreme Courts have stated, beyond a violation of the specific guarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, only acts that \u201cundermine)] confidence in the outcome of the trial\u201d rise to the level of due process violations. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bagley </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 667, 678 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 105 S.Ct. 3375]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 474 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442] [\u201c[n]ot every discovery violation is a due process violation\u2014only those that undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d]; <em>Kyles v.

United States </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 750, 764 [90 L.Ed. 1557, 66 S.Ct. 1239] [\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand . . .\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 438, 449 [88 L.Ed.2d 814, 106 S.Ct. 725] [\u201can error involving misjoinder \u2018affects substantial rights\u2019 and requires reversal only if. the misjoinder results in actual prejudice because it \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u2019 \u201d].) Utilizing that standard, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion Albarran\u2019s trial on the underlying charges was \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Notwithstanding the potentially prejudicial nature of the gang evidence introduced at trial, the evidence ,supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, which included three positive eyewitness identifications and Albarran\u2019s own highly damaging admission of involvement in the shooting, in my view, is compelling. Michael Bacelis, the owner of the home at which the first shots were fired, ran to the front of his house after hearing gunfire and saw two Latino males holding guns (one a shotgun, the second a handgun) several houses away. (Bacelis\u2019s house and garage sustained shotgun and handgun damage from the assault.) The two young men, both with shaved heads, continued to shoot toward Bacelis\u2019s home. Once the men stopped firing and began to run away, Bacelis gave chase in his sport utility vehicle (SUV). After turning a comer, Bacelis saw the young men, still holding their guns, jump into a car at the end of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The car, which was facing Bacelis, initially appeared to be backing up. After it came to a stop, the two men got in. The car then proceeded forward, turning left in front of Bacelis. Believing the car was a getaway vehicle for the shooters, Bacelis crashed his SUV into it. Two young men jumped out and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Bacelis could not identify the two shooters. However,, the three young women who were in the car into which Bacelis crashed\u2014Lizette Arvizu, the driver of the car; her cousin, Andrea Arvizu, a neighbor of Bacelis; and their friend Monique Gonzalez\u2014each separately identified Albarran as one of the two men who had entered the car that evening. Each of the young women also stated Albarran carried a small handgun. Given Bacelis\u2019s testimony that he saw the two shooters climb into Arvizu\u2019s car, those identifications of Albarran are devastating, notwithstanding some inconsistencies between the young women\u2019s trial testimony and information they provided the police that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Moreover, when Albarran was taken into custody on April 30, 2004, six weeks after the incident, he clearly admitted his involvement in the shooting and acknowledged entering Arvizu\u2019s car, thus confirming the young women\u2019s identification of him. According to Deputy Gillis, who arrested Albarran, Albarran told him, \u201cMan, this is messed up. We jumped into that bitch\u2019s car when we got in that shooting and she drove us out of the area.\u201d (Both at trial and on appeal counsel for Albarran have attempted to make much of the fact Lizette Arvizu did not, in fact, drive Albarran or his confederate out of the area because Bacelis crashed his SUV into her car. Whatever value that point may have had before a jury, it does not undermine Gillis\u2019s credibility in reporting what Albarran said at the time of his arrest, nor does it weaken the significance of Albarran\u2019s admission.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Albarran did not testify, but presented an alibi defense through several witnesses (his mother, an uncle, a cousin and a family friend). In finding Albarran guilty, the jury plainly credited the identification testimony of the three young women and disbelieved Albarran\u2019s alibi witnesses, although there was no suggestion any of them was a gang member.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Finally, although the evidence of criminal activity by the 13 Kings unrelated to the shooting and attempted kidnapping for caijacking on March 14, 2004, summarized at great length by the majority, certainly had a potential to prejudice the jury against Albarran, the court properly instructed the jury on several occasions they were not permitted to consider the gang evidence to prove Albarran \u201cis a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes.\u201d \u201c[E]vidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing criminal street gang activity and criminal acts by gang members, other than the crimes that are charged in this case for which the defendant is on trial. This evidence, if believed, may not be considered by you to prove that the defendant is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes. It may be considered by you only for the limited purpose of determining, if it tends to show, that the crimes charged in this case were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct for gang members. . . . You are not permitted to consider such evidence for any other purpose.\u201d It is, of course, presumed the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction. <em>(People v. Yeoman </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 139 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166] [\u201cwe and others have described the presumption that jurors understand and follow instructions as \u2018[t]he crucial assumption underlying our constitutional system of trial by jury.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d]; <em>People v.

To do so, the People had to present evidence at trial that each of the offenses was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further or assist in criminal conduct by gang members. To establish 13 Kings is a \u201ccriminal street gang,\u201d the People had to prove, among other things, it has as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of the crimes enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e), and has engaged in a \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d by committing two or more \u201c \u2018predicate offenses.\u2019 \u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subds. (e), <em>(f); People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 617 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713].) Accordingly, evidence of Albarran\u2019s membership in 13 Kings, as well as evidence 13 Kings had committed various violent crimes and the gang expert\u2019s opinion that shootings and other acts of intimidation were committed by gang members to promote themselves, were all relevant to proving the elements of the gang enhancements. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1047-1048 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 94 P.3d 1080] [\u201cto prove the elements of the criminal street gang enhancement, the prosecution may, as in this case, present expert testimony on criminal street gangs\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\"> At trial the People presented no evidence to support Deputy Gillis\u2019s assertion the second shooter was a member of 13 Kings. That failure was a primary factor in the trial court\u2019s posttrial conclusion the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s true findings on the gang enhancement allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"> The majority\u2019s assertion that much of the gang evidence \u201chad no legitimate purpose in this trial\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 230), if intended to suggest it was not properly admitted at the trial that actually took place, in my view, is simply incorrect because that evidence was necessary if the People were to prove the gang enhancement allegations. (See fn. 2, above.) If it is intended as an evaluation of a hypothetical trial in which there were no gang allegations, it seems to me to be beside the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> Albarran\u2019s appellate counsel confirms this interpretation of the trial court\u2019s comments during the hearing on the new trial motion: \u201cThe trial court itself implicitly acknowledged that not all of the gang evidence would have [been] admissible at a trial on the underlying charges. It is true that the court did express its view that <em>perhaps some </em>of the evidence would have been admissible absent the gang allegation, to prove motive or intent.\u201d (Fns. &amp; record citation omitted, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> The trial court fully explained the basis for its decision, obviating any need to reconstruct by implication the court\u2019s rationale for denying the motion: \u201cThe court did consider the arguments raised that the sheer introduction of the gang evidence in and of itself, in essence, poisoned the well and was too prejudicial and inflammatory. In its review of the evidence, the court considered the independent strength of the evidence, including the identifications in this case [and the] statements attributed to the defendant, in determining whether or not the gang evidence that did come in, which the court would not describe as being overwhelming, but whether or not that gang evidence in and of itself, if it did come in, would affect the jury\u2019s verdict as to the remaining charges. The court\u2019s opinion is that it would not have affected the verdict one way or the other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Putting it somewhat differently, in my view the question is not \u201cwhether the <em>erroneous admission </em>of gang evidence was so serious as to violate Albarran\u2019s federal constitutional rights to due process,\u201d as the majority phrases the issue on appeal (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 230, fn. 14, original italics), but whether, notwithstanding the proper admission of the gang evidence at the time, viewed in retrospect that evidence was so inflammatory it made Albarran\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair\u2014that is, its admission at trial undermines our confidence in the integrity of the verdict. To be sure, both forms of the question require us ultimately to decide if Albarran received a fair trial. But the question as posed by the majority focuses primarily on the nature of the gang evidence itself (both its probative value and its prejudicial impact), which is understandable since the majority assumes such an analysis formed the basis for the trial court\u2019s denial of the new trial motion. I believe, in contrast, we should examine the independent evidence of Albarran\u2019s guilt, as well as the potential prejudice from the gang evidence, and determine, viewing the record as a whole, whether we remain confident the jury reached the correct result for the proper reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> In <em>People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at page 1050, the Supreme Court analyzed the scope of the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny bifurcation of the trial of a gang enhancement from trial of the charged offense when some of the evidence to prove the gang enhancement would be inadmissible at a trial of the substantive crime itself\u2014\u201cfor example, if some of it might be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 as unduly prejudicial when no gang enhancement is charged.\u201d In this somewhat related context, the Supreme Court found reference to the well-developed law of severance useful, even if \u201c[t]he analogy ... is not perfect.\u201d <em>(Hernandez, </em>at p. 1050.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
