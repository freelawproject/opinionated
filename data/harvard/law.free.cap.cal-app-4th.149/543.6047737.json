The superior court ordered Petitioners to comply with legislative subpoenas issued by the City of Cloverdale (City) for the production of business records necessary for auditing their compliance with the City\u2019s transient occupancy tax (TOT). We shall deny the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In 1969, the City of Cloverdale passed ordinance No. 257 (the Ordinance) and enacted its TOT on rooms occupied in hotels, inns, motels and other lodgings for a period of less than 30 consecutive calendar days. Transients pay a tax of 10 percent of the rent charged by the operator (proprietor) of the facility. The Ordinance requires operators to collect the tax and provide returns to the City\u2019s tax administrator showing total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. The Ordinance requires operators to keep and preserve for a period of three years all records necessary to determine the TOT the operator should have collected and paid to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">During December 2005, the City attempted to conduct an audit to gauge Petitioners\u2019 compliance with the requirements of the TOT. Petitioners informed the City it would not disclose its books and records. On February 22, 2006, in response to Petitioners\u2019 refusal to comply with the audit, the city council adopted resolution No. 21-2006, authorizing the mayor to issue legislative subpoenas requiring Petitioners to produce books and records pertinent to collection of the TOT. The subpoenas were served on Petitioners on March 1, 2006. The subpoenas ordered Petitioners to appear with their records at the city council meeting on March 8, 2006. Petitioners informed the city attorney by letter of March 7, 2006, they would not be appearing before the city council and would not produce the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">On March 27, 2006, the City filed a mayor\u2019s report to the judge of the superior court pursuant to Government Code section 37106 relating essentially the matters described above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 20, 2006, the City filed an ex parte application for issuance of attachments regarding legislative subpoena together with an application and order for appearance and examination. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>trial court ordered Petitioners to appear on June 2, 2006, to answer concerning the legislative subpoenas issued by the City. On May 22, 2006, Petitioners filed a response to order to show cause regarding the City\u2019s request for enforcement: of the legislative subpoenas. In their response, Petitioners mounted various constitutional challenges to the TOT. On May 25, 2006, the City filed \u00e1 reply to the response to order to show cause. The trial court held a hearing on the matter on June 21, 2006. On June 23, 2006, the trial court issued an order enforcing legislative subpoenas requiring Petitioners to comply with the City\u2019s audit request for financial records to determine compliance with the City\u2019s TOT. On June 29, 2006, the City filed a notice of entry of order enforcing legislative subpoenas. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal against the trial court\u2019s order on July 13, 2006. On August 16, 2006, the City filed in this court a motion to dismiss the appeal and Petitioners filed an opposition on August 30, 2006. On September 7, 2006, in the interests of judicial economy and expediency, we construed Petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal as a petition for extraordinary writ and set a briefing schedule. Petitioners filed their writ petition and memorandum of points and authorities in support on October 20, 2006. The City filed a return and opposition on November 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u25a0 Petitioners contend the City\u2019s TOT is unconstitutionally void in violation of the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Specifically, Petitioners take issue with the Ordinance\u2019s definition of \u201chotel\u201d because it includes the terms \u201cdwelling\u201d and \u201clodging,\u201d terms which \u201cby definition imply permanent residency\u201d according to Petitioners. Petitioners assert these definitions render the Ordinance \u201chopelessly circular\u201d and mean that the TOT is due \u201ceven in some genuine permanent residency situations.\u201d Thus, according to Petitioners, the TOT is constitutionally infirm like those in <em>City of San Bernardino Hotel/Motel Assn. v. City of San Bernardino </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 237 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 97] <em>(City of San Bernardino) </em>and <em>Britt </em>v. <em>City of Pomona </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 265 [272 Cal.Rptr. 724] <em>(City of Pomona).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In assessing Petitioners\u2019 facial attack on the Validity of the Ordinance, we consider \u201c \u2018only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.\u2019 [Citation.] A vagueness challenge will be rejected if the challenged ordinance \u2018(1) gives fair notice of the practice to be avoided, and (2) provides reasonably adequate standards to guide enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of San Bernardino, supra, 59 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 245.) Moreover, \u201ca statute or ordinance will be upheld against a vagueness challenge \u2018 \u2018 \u201c \u2018if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>language [citations] [and w]e are bound to give the ordinance before us \u2018a liberal, practical common-sense construction ... in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of its words.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Patel v. City of Gilroy </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 483, 489 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 354] <em>(Gilroy).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Viewed against these standards, Petitioners\u2019 contentions are untenable. The ordinances at issue in <em>City of Pomona </em>and <em>City of San Bernardino </em>were replete with inconsistent and contradictory terms that are simply not present in the City\u2019s Ordinance. In <em>City of Pomona, </em>the TOT at issue, although \u201cdirected at transients, in actuality includes persons living in \u2018hotels\u2019 who . . . are not in fact transients.\u201d <em>(City of Pomona, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 278-279.) Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted \u201cthe text of the ordinance appears to address both transients and persons in residence\u201d which was further complicated by \u201cthe fact that the definition of \u2018transient\u2019 is of no guidance ... a \u2018transient\u2019 is one who occupies a \u2018hotel,\u2019 while a \u2018hotel\u2019 is a structure which is occupied or intended to be occupied by \u2018transients.\u2019 The definitions are circular.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 279.) Also, as recognized in <em>City of Vacaville </em>v. <em>Pitamber </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 739 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 396] <em>(City of Vacaville), </em>the problem with the TOT in <em>City of San Bernardino </em>\u201cwas that the definitional sections of the ordinance were so confusing that they failed to give adequate notice of what conduct was required. For example, the ordinance defined \u2018hotel\u2019 as a structure designed for occupancy on a transient basis for 30 days or less, but also defined \u2018transient\u2019 as a person exercising occupancy for 90 days or less.\u201d <em>(City of Vacaville, </em>at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Ordinance here contains no such infirmities. \u201cHotel\u201d is defined as \u201cany structure . . . which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile-home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.\u201d \u201c \u2018Transient\u2019 means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of less than thirty consecutive calendar days, counting portions of calendar days as full days, any such person so occupying a space in a hotel shall be deemed a transient until the period has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We fail to see how, as Petitioners assert, these terms render the Ordinance \u201chopelessly circular\u201d or mean the TOT would be due \u201ceven in some genuine permanent residency situations\u201d because the definition of \u201chotel\u201d includes the terms \u201cdwelling\u201d and \u201clodging.\u201d Indeed, the Ordinance does not attempt to impose the TOT on the basis of either the type or location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of the property. (Cf. <em>City of Pomona, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 279-280 [vagueness problem compounded by the fact ordinance did not contain definition of \u201ctransient lodging accommodations\u201d and City had removed \u201cthe prior 60-day and 30-day definitions of what constitutes a transient\u201d].) Rather, the Ordinance imposes the tax on <em>persons </em>defined as \u201ctransient,\u201d and clearly identifies such persons as anyone occupying a \u201chotel\u201d for a period of less than 30 consecutive calendar days. And as respondents point out, Courts of Appeal have rejected vagueness. challenges to TOT ordinances containing substantially the same language as the Ordinance. (Gilroy; <em>supra, </em>97. Cal.App.4th at pp. 490-491 [although \u201cdefinitions of \u2018hotel\u2019 and \u2018occupancy\u2019 refer to \u2018dwelling\u2019 as well as \u2018lodging or sleeping\u2019 purposes\u201d there is no vagueness problem because \u201cthe tax applies solely to those who occupy a hotel \u2018for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar, days or less[,]\u2019 . . . [and] the hotel guest is invariably deemed to be a transient until the first 30 days have,passed, even if he or she appears to be \u2018dwelling\u2019 in the hotel for that period\u201d]; <em>City of Vacaville, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.4th at p. 745 [no vagueness problem because \u201cthis ordinance, like the one in <em>Gilroy, </em>clearly states that a guest is a transient until the first 30 days have past if he or she has no written agreement\u201d].) In sum, we conclude the definitions in the Ordinance are not vague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Petitioners contend the TOT violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. Principles of equal protection require \u201cthat persons who are similarly situated receive like treatment under the law and that statutes may single out a class for distinctive treatment only if that classification bears a rational relationship to the purposes of the statute. Thus, if a law provides that one subclass receives different treatment from another class, it is not enough that persons within that subclass be treated the same. Rather, there must be some rationality in the separation of the classes.\u201d <em>(City of Pomona, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 274.) Moreover, \u201c[i]n examining the propriety of a tax, the \u2018rational basis\u2019 test is applied. Under that test, courts will look for a rational basis for the class of persons selected to pay the tax. Additionally, the classification must bear a reasonable relation to a legitimate governmental purpose. Arbitrary and capricious classifications are not permitted. [Citation.] The persons who are to pay the tax must be a \u2018reasonably justifiable subclassification\u2019 of persons; otherwise, \u2018the operation of the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>must be such as to place liability therefor equally on all members of the class.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Petitioners contend the Ordinance improperly classifies for taxation \u201cpersons who cannot afford month-to[-]month housing and can only afford residing at a motel on a day[-]to[-]day basis.\u201d Petitioners misinterpret the Ordinance. The Ordinance does not impose the TOT on the basis of the type of property occupied by a person or on the basis of the arrangement under which a person occupies the property. Under the plain language of the Ordinance, a person residing at a hotel on a day-to-day basis for a period of 30 days or more <em>will not pay </em>the tax. Rather, the tax applies equally to all \u201ctransients,\u201d i.e., those occupying a room in any \u201chotel\u201d for a period of less than 30 calendar days. The City\u2019s classification provides a rational distinction between transient and nontransient residents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">However, Petitioners contend this classification, even if rational, bears no reasonable relation to achieving a legitimate governmental goal. This contention was laid to rest long ago in <em>Gowens </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 79 [13 Cal.Rptr. 820], There, the Court of Appeal considered whether Bakersfield\u2019s TOT \u201cestablishes a proper classification or demarcation between \u2018transients\u2019 and permanent lodgers, which former term is defined to be lodgers occupying motels, hotels, etc., for less than 30 days. Permanent lodgers are those occupying such motels, hotels, etc., for a greater period and they are exempt from such taxation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 83.) The court recognized a legitimate legislative purpose in the classification, namely \u201c \u2018to impose a tax on charges made for lodgings of the short period or stop-over type traditionally provided by inns or hotels, as distinguished from lodgings for longer periods, which assume the character of residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 84.) The court concluded \u201cthis is a proper constitutional classification or demarcation for taxing purposes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 83.) In sum, Petitioners\u2019 equal protection argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Petitioners contend the Ordinance \u201cis void by way of preemption of state law\u201d because the City\u2019s definition of \u201ctransient\u201d contradicts the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>definition set forth in Revenue and Taxation Code section 7280, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This contention is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The California Constitution permits a county or city to \u201c \u2018 \u201cmake and enforce within its limits all local; police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u201d [][] \u201cIf otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law, it is preempted by such law and is void.\u201d [Citations.] [f] \u201cA conflict exists if the local legislation \u2018 \u201cduplicates, contradicts, or enters an area fully occupied by general law, either expressly or by legislative implication.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citations.] [][] Local legislation is \u201cduplicative\u201d of general law when it is coextensive therewith. [Citation.] [][] Similarly, local legislation is \u201ccontradictory\u201d to general law when it is inimical thereto. [Citation.] HO Finally, local legislation enters an area that is \u201cfully occupied\u201d by general law when the Legislature has expressly manifested its intent to \u201cfully occupy\u201d the area [citation], or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent: \u201c(1) the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become' exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the\u201d locality [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>{City of San Bernardino, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Here, the City\u2019s TOT ordinance poses no conflict with state law. The Ordinance neither duplicates, contradicts, nor enters an area fully occupi\u00e9d by state law. In fact, far from manifesting an intent to fully occupy the field, the Legislature instead ceded to cities and counties the ability to levy taxes on the occupancy of rooms in hotels and other lodgings \u201cunless the occupancy is for a period of more than 30 days.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 7280, subd. (a).) In other words, the Legislature intended to limit cities and counties from levying such tax on occupancies of more than 30 days. Nothing in the Ordinance contradicts or is inimical to that legislative intent because the TOT applies to persons who occupy hotel rooms for less than 30 consecutive calendar days. Accordingly, the City\u2019s ordinance is not preempted by state, law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The petition for extraordinary relief is denied.

Code, \u00a7 7280, subd. (a).) Although the statute does not allow the City to tax occupancies longer than 30 days, it does not follow that the Ordinance is rendered vague because it chose to impose the tax on occupancies of \u201cless than thirty consecutive calendar days.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>City of Pomona, </em>is misplaced. There, the Court of Appeal held there was no rational basis for the \u201csubclassification of persons selected by the City to pay the [TOT], i.e., persons who live in \u2018transient-type\u2019 accommodations\u201d <em>(City of Pomona, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 277) because payment of the TOT depended on \u201cthe type of building the person lives in, the arrangement such person has with the owner for payment of the rent and the location of the \u2018hotel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 274.)
