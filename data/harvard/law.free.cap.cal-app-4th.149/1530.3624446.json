The parties settled before trial, with an agreement that the action would be \u201cdeemed dismissed\u201d upon defendants\u2019 compliance with the City\u2019s demands, and that the City could thereafter seek its attorney fees. The trial court awarded the City its fees based on two provisions of the MSMC. On appeal, defendants challenge the validity of these provisions. Defendants further contend that the City should not have received any award because they were prevented from complying with the City\u2019s demands, the City used the lawsuit to harass them and selectively enforce its ordinances, and the amount of the award was excessive. We agree with defendants that the MSMC provisions on which the City relied were not a proper basis for attorney fees. Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">The dispute between the City and defendants arose from Darla Padgett\u2019s plans to improve defendants\u2019 property with new structures and remodeling of an existing structure. In March 1999 she obtained a site development permit (SDP), which included a landscaping plan. The following October she obtained a building permit covering construction, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical improvements. The building permit was to expire, however, if the work was abandoned for more than 180 days, or if defendants failed to arrange for a final inspection of the work within 180 days of completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>During construction defendants removed a eucalyptus tree, contrary to the landscape plan. The City then imposed an additional \u201cmitigation\u201d condition on the SDP: Defendants were required to plant six evergreen trees along the property line. They did not plant those trees at that time, however. According to Darla Padgett, defendants could not plant the trees because of pending utility easements and because the driveway had not been completed. She further stated that she could not complete the requirements of the building permit because of an existing injunction related to litigation initiated by her neighbors. As for the fence, Padgett expressed willingness to lower it \u201cif the City could assure [her] that it would enforce the fence law equally.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The City filed a suit in abatement in February 2003, alleging building code violations, violations of the MSMC, and public nuisance. In its first amended complaint in March 2004, the City specifically alleged that defendants\u2019 removal of the eucalyptus tree and their failure to plant the \u201cMitigation Trees\u201d violated the SDP. The City further alleged that defendants had failed to schedule their final inspection as required by the applicable building code, resulting in expiration of their building permit. Finally, the City alleged that defendants had constructed and maintained a fence that exceeded the maximum height allowance under the MSMC. In addition to requesting an injunction and abatement, the City sought costs of suit, including \u201cthe attorney\u2019s fees and costs authorized pursuant to section 6.17.170 of the MSMC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The parties settled the case on January 12, 2005, six days before the scheduled trial. The remedial terms of the settlement called for lowering of the fence to six feet, the planting of six trees, and an independent final inspection by January 18,\" 2005. If the final inspection produced \u201ca sign-off, everything\u2019s approved,\u201d then the matter would be \u201cdeemed dismissed on that date, [January 18].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties further agreed that the City had the right to file a request for costs, including attorney fees, but that defendants were entitled to oppose both entitlement to and amount of those fees. The City was claiming attorney fees of about $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">On February 14, 2005, a \u201cNotice of Dismissal\u201d was filed, stating that the action was \u201cdeemed dismissed on February 11, 2005.\u201d The City filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>memorandum of costs on February 24 and a motion for costs and attorney fees on March 2, 2005. According to the City, attorney fees were recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(B), (C), because they were authorized under the MSMC, by sections 6.17.170 and 5.05.010. Defendants moved to strike or tax costs. The City eventually submitted a revised fee claim of $158,646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">On October 7, 2005, after receiving extensive written and oral argument from both parties, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion and granted the City\u2019s, awarding it attorney fees of $153,842. The court entered judgment on both motions on October 24, and on November 14, 2005, the City voluntarily dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">On appeal, defendants challenge both the City\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees and the amount awarded. They acknowledge the general rule that attorney fees are permitted in a civil action when authorized by statute, contract, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A municipal ordinance is a law within the meaning of this provision. <em>(City of Santa Paula v. Narula </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 485, 492-493 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 75]; see also <em>Segundo </em>v. <em>Rancho Mirage City </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 873 F.2d 1277, 1278-1279.) Defendants contend, however, that MSMC section 6.17.170 conflicts with or is preempted by Government Code section 38773.5, subdivision (b) (section 38773.5(b)), which defines the procedures a city may establish for abating nuisances. They further argue that fees were not authorized under MSMC section 5.05.010 because that ordinance did not become effective until six days after the case was \u201cdeemed dismissed.\u201d Finally, defendants contend that the amount of the fee award was excessive in view of the City\u2019s litigation conduct and the result achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">As defendants observe, the first two issues are matters for this court\u2019s independent review, as they involve questions of law. (Cf. <em>Wakefield v. Bohlin </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 963 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 400]; <em>MHC Financing Limited Partnership Two </em>v. <em>City of Santee </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1397 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 622].) The third issue concerning the amount of the fee award addresses a discretionary ruling which may not be overturned unless it is clearly wrong. <em>(Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights v. Garamendi </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1394 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 368]; <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>McClellan </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1107 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">1. <em>MSMC Section 6.17.170</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">MSMC section 6.17.170 describes the penalties to which a Monte Sereno property owner may be subjected for maintaining a nuisance in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>City. In addition to providing for imposition of a fine and imprisonment, the ordinance states: \u201c[S]hould the City commence a civil or criminal proceeding to abate a public nuisance, the costs of abatement which may be recorded shall include all legal costs including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the City in commencing and pursuing civil or criminal remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Defendants contend that this provision is invalid because it conflicts with section 38773.5(b), which requires an ordinance allowing attorney fees to permit their recovery by the <em>\u201cprevailing </em>party, rather than limiting recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees to the city if it prevails.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court agreed with the City that section 38773.5(b) was intended to apply specifically to \u201crecovery of fees as a special assessment in connection with summary abatement administrative proceedings.\u201d In those procedures, the City and the court reasoned, reciprocity provides an essential procedural safeguard, whereas judicial proceedings already afford the property owner procedural and substantive protections. The court also agreed with the City that permitting a city alone to recover its fees furthered the public policy to encourage the pursuit of abatement actions by reducing the costs of such actions. (Cf; <em>City of Santa Paula </em>v. <em>Narula, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">We disagree with the City and trial court\u2019s construction of section 38773.5(b) limiting its application. It is true that Government Code section 38773 permits summary abatement of a nuisance at a property owner\u2019s expense. That statute also allows a city to make the expense of abatement a lien against the property as well as a personal obligation of the property owner, \u201cin accordance with Section 38773.1 or 38773.5.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 38773.) But there is no indication in section 38773.5 that it is, in effect, a subdivision of section 38773. Subdivision (a) of section 38773.5 allows abatement procedures as an alternative to the procedure established in Government Code section 38773.1, which permits liens on property as a means of collecting nuisance abatement costs. (\u00a7 38773.5, subd. (a).) Section 38773.5(b) then provides for attorney fees as follows: \u201cA city may, by ordinance, provide for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees in any action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding to abate a nuisance. If the ordinance provides for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, it shall provide for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by the prevailing party, rather than limiting recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees to the city if it prevails. The ordinance may limit recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by the prevailing party to those individual actions or proceedings in which the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its \"own attorneys\u2019 fees. In no action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">In the plain language of its terms, the attorney fees provision applies to <em>any action </em>to abate a nuisance, not just a summary administrative or special proceeding. The statute does not impose reciprocity of fees on a city\u2019s ordinance as does Civil Code section 1717, but instead simply requires that the ordinance provide for recovery by the prevailing party and forbids the unilateral recovery by the city. The City\u2019s ordinance in this case therefore violates Government Code section 38773.5, and its application cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">2. <em>MSMC Section 5.05.010</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">As an alternative basis for its decision, the court applied MSMC section 5.05.010, which provided for attorney fees to the \u201cprevailing party in any judicial action and/or administrative proceeding to abate a nuisance.\u201d By its terms, the ordinance took effect 30 days after its passage, February 17, 2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the \u201cdeemed dismissed\u201d date of February 11, 2005, the court ruled that MSMC section 5.05.010 could be applied here because the City had not yet \u201crequested entry of dismissal or execution of a judgment of dismissal. Thus, the action is still pending in this Court.\u201d The court further determined that retroactive application of MSMC section 5.05.010 was permissible because it was a procedural enactment which did not create a new cause of action or deprive defendants of a defense. The court expressly found that \u201cit was the reasonable legislative intent of the City to have the new ordinance applied to this and future actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">We take no issue with the court\u2019s factual conclusion that the City intended to apply the new law to this case so that it could recover its attorney fees. That intent is immaterial, however, if imposition of the fees was unauthorized. The key question is whether the court\u2019s ruling amounts to a retroactive application of the ordinance and, if so, whether that application was legally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">Our Supreme Court has described a retroactive law as \u201c \u2018 \u201cone [that] affects rights, obligations, acts, transactions and conditions which are performed or exist prior to the adoption of the statute.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u2018 \u201c[E]very statute, which takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Landgraf v. USI Film Products </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 244, 269 [128 L.Ed.2d 229, 114 S.Ct. 1483].) Phrased another way, a statute that operates to \u2018increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct\u2019 is retroactive. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280; <em>Evangelatos </em>[v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1206 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585]].)\u201d <em>(Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 839 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 40, 50 P.3d 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, a legislative enactment is presumed to operate prospectively and not retroactively unless a different intention is clearly expressed or implied from the legislative history or the context of the enactment. <em>(Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 1207-1210; <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 388, 393 [182 P.2d 159]; <em>Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 230 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P.3d 207].) In this case there can be no question that prospective application of the ordinance was intended; its plain language specified that it was to take effect 30 days later. As the new law changed the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing a new liability for that conduct, we conclude that its application here would be retroactive, contrary to the express intent of the ordinance itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The City argues that MSMC section 5.05.010 may be applied retroactively because it is strictly a procedural law that neither creates a new cause of action nor deprives defendants of a defense. The Supreme Court\u2019s disapproval of the artificial distinction between purely procedural and purely substantive laws addresses that contention. \u201cIn truth, the distinction relates not so much to the form of the statute as to its effects. If substantial changes are made, even in a statute which might ordinarily be classified as procedural, the operation on existing rights would be retroactive because the legal effects of past events would be changed, and the statute will be construed to operate only in futuro unless the legislative intent to the contrary clearly appears.\u201d <em>(Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 394; see also <em>Western Security Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 232, 244, fn. 4 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 933 P.2d 507].) The key consideration is \u201c \u2018the effect of a law on a party\u2019s rights and liabilities, not whether a procedural or substantive label best applies. Does the law \u201cchange[] the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based upon such conduct[?]\u201d [Citation.] Does it. \u201csubstantially affect[] existing rights and obligations[?]\u201d [Citation.] If so, then application to a trial of preenactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>conduct is forbidden, absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application. If not, then application to a trial of preenactment conduct is permitted, because the application is prospective.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Thus, \u201c[t]he substantive-procedural distinction does not prevail in California because both \u2018procedural\u2019 and \u2018substantive\u2019 statutes are subject to the presumption against retroactive effect.\u201d <em>(Russell v. Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 810, 815 [230 Cal.Rptr. 102].) \u201cBoth types of statutes may affect past transactions and be governed by the presumption against retroactivity. The only exception which we can discern from the cases is a subcategory of procedural statutes which can have no effect on substantive rights or liabilities, but which affect only modes of procedure to be followed in future proceedings. As <em>Aetna </em>pointed out, such statutes are not governed by the retroactivity presumption, but not because they are \u2018procedural\u2019 but simply because they are not in fact retroactive. <em>([Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com., supra,] </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 394.) <em>Aetna </em>may thus be read as drawing the trae distinction not between \u2018substantive\u2019 or \u2018procedural\u2019 statutes, but between those affecting past transactions and those impacting only on future events.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Here, retroactive application of the ordinance to make attorney fees available would impose an \u201cadditional liability\u201d on defendants and substantially change the legal rights and obligations of the parties as circumscribed by their settlement agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 395.) The City nevertheless relies on <em>City of Sausalito v. County of Marin </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550 [90 Cal.Rptr. 843] and ARA <em>Living Centers - Pacific, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1556 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 224] in urging retroactive application of MSMC section 5.05.010. In ARA, <em>supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 1556, a statutory amendment was applied retroactively to provide for attorney fees in elder abuse cases. In <em>City of Sausalito, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 550, the appellate court noted that a statute that is procedural in effect (rather than form) may be applied to <em>\u201cpending and future </em>litigation even if the event underlying the cause of action therein occurred before the statute took effect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 557, italics added.) Neither case involved a dispute that had already been resolved by the time the law took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">The City maintains, however, that this action was still pending when MSMC section 5.05.010 became operative. The City points out that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>request for dismissal and the clerk\u2019s entry of dismissal were not filed until November 14, 2005, nearly nine months after the effective date of the ordinance. Consequently, it argues, the action was subject to the new provision on February 17, 2005. We might accept this position but for the agreement between the parties that the action was dismissed for purposes of any request for attorney fees. The settlement and ensuing \u201cNotice of Dismissal\u201d did not limit the effect of the dismissal to amounts and dates the fees were incurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants agreed that the City had the right to seek attorney fees, not that it was entitled to those fees under any existing law or any law then contemplated by the City Council. Defendants expressly reserved the right to dispute the City\u2019s claim, \u201cboth in terms of the City\u2019s entitlement to those costs as well as the amount of the costs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Without any evidence of limitations on the scope and effect of the stipulated dismissal, we conclude that the parties\u2019 settlement was based on their understanding of the state and local law (namely, MSMC \u00a7 6.17.170) as it existed at the time the action was deemed by them to be \u201cover.\u201d Their contractual expectations would be defeated by applying the new ordinance to the dispute already resolved by settlement. We cannot uphold the application of MSMC section 5.05.010 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">The ordinance in effect at the time the City incurred its attorney fees in the abatement action was invalid, as it impermissibly conflicted with Government Code section 38773.5. The ordinance the City subsequently enacted was also not a proper basis for its attorney fees, because the case had been deemed dismissed for purposes of that very recovery. Because attorney fees were unavailable to the City in this case, the award cannot stand. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to decide whether the factual history of the underlying lawsuit justifies the appropriateness of the award and the reasonableness of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">The judgment awarding attorney fees is reversed. Costs on appeal are awarded to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Rushing, P.
