J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-n\">This case arises from the City of Poway\u2019s (the City) two-step plan to divest itself of ownership of the Poway Royal Mobilehome Park (the Park). The City held one hearing in which it approved resolutions allowing it to issue tax-exempt bonds and loan the proceeds to the Poway Redevelopment Agency (Redevelopment Agency) for its purchase of the Park, and the Redevelopment Agency to later loan the proceeds and resell the Park to Wakeland Housing and Development Corporation (Wakeland) or its subsidiary, on the condition that it obtain a determination of tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If Wakeland or its subsidiary did not qualify, the Redevelopment Agency would retain ownership of and manage the Park so the tax-exempt status of the bonds would not be jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">Plaintiffs, Poway Royal Mobilehome Owners Association and 273 of its members (sometimes collectively the Owners Association), appeal a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendants, the City, the City Council of the City of Poway (City Council), City Manager James Bowersox, and the Redevelopment Agency (sometimes collectively the City). The Owners Association contends the court erred by finding it may not maintain promissory estoppel and related claims against the City arising from its alleged breach of oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>promises to provide the Owners Association with \u201ca real, true and non-illusory opportunity to purchase\u201d the Park at fair market value. Additionally, the Owners Association contends the court abused its discretion by denying it leave to file a third amended complaint to attach a resolution of the City Council in an effort to satisfy the requirement of a written contract. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">Additionally, the Owners Association challenges the judgment in the City\u2019s action to validate its two-step plan to divest itself of the Park and associated bond financing. The Owners Association contends the court ignored that during the City\u2019s public hearing under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147(f)), it failed to submit evidence that Wakeland or its subsidiary qualified for tax-exempt bond financing, or that the Park met the requirement, of being a \u201c \u2018qualified residential rental project,\u2019 \u201d meaning \u201c20 percent or more of the residential units ... are occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median gross income\u201d (20-50 rule). (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142(d)(1)(A).) We agree the TEFRA hearing was insufficient, and accordingly reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">The Park has 399 spaces and is situated on approximately 50 acres of land. In January 1991 the Redevelopment Agency purchased the Park, intending to stabilize rents and preserve affordable housing. In 1995 the Redevelopment Agency transferred ownership of the Park to the City. Also in 1995, the City issued bonds in the amount of $31,770,000, which paid off debt related to the Redevelopment Agency\u2019s purchase of the Park in 1991. City staff and contract employees managed the Park until 2004, when that responsibility was transferred to Wakeland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">In 1999 the City adopted a long-term goal for the divestiture of its mobilehome parks. The City orally advised tenants of the Park that when and if it decided to sell the Park it would give them an opportunity to purchase it. The Owners Association represented tenants in seeking private ownership, and the City knew 70 percent of the Park\u2019s tenants were willing, ready and able to purchase the Park at fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">In November 2004, however, the City announced its intent to sell the Park \u201cto a [26 United States Code section] 501(c)(3) nonprofit housing corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>using tax exempt bond financing,\u201d which would exclude the Owners Association and residents of the Park as purchasers since they cannot qualify as a nonprofit entity. Nonetheless, in February 2005 the Owners Association submitted a proposal to the City to purchase the Park. The following June the City rejected the proposal and agreed to sell the Park to the Redevelopment Agency, which would resell it to Wakeland, a nonprofit housing corporation, contingent on it qualifying for tax-exempt status under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">The City then filed a complaint for validation of its sale of the Park and associated tax-exempt bond financing. The complaint alleged the City would first sell the Park to the Redevelopment Agency for $35.6 million, its asserted fair market value, plus reserve deposits to ensure the Park\u2019s successful operation. To finance the purchase, the City agreed to issue bonds not to exceed $32 million and loan the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency, and to take an additional note from it for approximately $9.5 million. Wakeland would then purchase the Park from the Redevelopment Agency for $35.6 million, plus reserve deposits, and would assume the Redevelopment Agency\u2019s rights and obligations under the bond financing documents and $9.5 million loan agreement with the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">The Owners Association answered the complaint and contested the legality of the City\u2019s actions. Additionally, the Owners Association filed a first amended complaint against the City for promissory estoppel and declaratory relief. The parties stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">The first amended complaint alleged the City and Redevelopment Agency \u201corally and publicly, and in certain instances, in writing, expressed [an] intent\u201d to allow the Owners Association and tenants to purchase the Park \u201con terms that are non-illusory, true and real, that reasonably relate to the [P]ark\u2019s fair market value and are customary and usual for any sale to tenants/residents of a mobilehome park where the ownership will be converted to residential ownership.\u201d The City allegedly breached the promise by not offering the Park to the Owners Association and tenants on reasonable terms, but rather \u201cconcoct[ing] a sales price, terms and a financing scheme\u201d for the Park that eliminated Owners Association or tenants as purchasers. Specifically, the City required tax-exempt bond financing; provided nonprofit housing corporation bidders, including Wakeland, with financing information and Park financial information, but refused to provide the same information to the Owners Association; gave the Owners Association an unreasonably short period to submit a purchase proposal; set a closing date for the sale so soon it precluded the Owners Association from complying with the statutory process for converting the Park to resident ownership; and allowed nonprofit housing corporations to submit offers on the Park that did not require the payment of any cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>The first amended complaint also alleged that in reliance on the City\u2019s representations, tenants of the Park signed or renewed leases, financed mobilehome purchases, relinquished the opportunity to move to other mobile-home parks and anticipated earning equity on their mobilehome spaces. The complaint sought an order requiring the City to provide the Owners Association and tenants of the Park \u201cwith a price and terms for them to purchase the [P]ark that are true, real and non-illusory, is at the fair market value of the [P]ark and upon customary and usual, fair and reasonable terms for sale to tenants/residents.\u201d Alternatively, the complaint prayed for $21 million in economic damages and damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">The City demurred on the ground the promissory estoppel doctrine may not trump the requirement that public agency contracts must be adopted in accordance with statutory procedures that require, for instance, formal approval and a writing signed by the appropriate official. The court issued a tentative order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. After a hearing, however, the court granted the Owners Association leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">In December 2005 the Owners Association filed a second amended complaint, adding a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on leases between the City and Park tenants. The complaint alleged the leases incorporate by reference California\u2019s Mobile-home Residency Law (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798 et seq.), which requires an owner to give notice to tenants of the intent to sell .a mobilehome park (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.80), and the notice the City gave the tenants here was a \u201csham\u201d because it was not \u201cnotice of an intent to sell the park on true, real and non-illusory terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">The promissory estoppel cause of action remained essentially the same, but added that the City unfairly offered bond financing and subsidized the sale to Wakeland, and alleged the City \u201cengaged in a sham, non-arms length transaction with Wakeland, which transaction will have the inevitable result of substantially increasing the present rents at the [P]ark to service the excess non-recourse debt the City and the [Redevelopment] Agency are creating.\u201d Regarding the City\u2019s representations, the second amended complaint alleged the \u201cCity and Agency, through members of the City. Council, Bowersox, and employees of the Agency, including, but not limited to, David- Narevsky, orally, and publicly, and in certain circumstances, in writing\u201d expressed that intent. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">The City again demurred and the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court determined the second amended complaint did not allege unusual circumstances to justify a claim- for promissory estoppel against a public agency, and estoppel would thwart the protection of . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>statute of frauds and statutory procedures for public contracts. The court also found the complaint failed to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant as \u201csuch a cause of action may not extend beyond the terms of the contract in force between the parties,\u201d and in any event, the City complied with the notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">The Owners Association moved for reconsideration, arguing it could provide \u201cthe previously alleged writing\u201d to confirm the City\u2019s promise. The Owners Association offered the minutes from the City Council\u2019s July 20, 1999 regular meeting, in which the City Council approved a consent calendar that included item No. 16, the \u201cAdoption of Long-Term Goal for City and Redevelopment Agency Mobile Home Parks and Haley Ranch Estates\u201d (Long-Term Goal). The draft of the Long-Term Goal, prepared by the City\u2019s housing commission, notes the Redevelopment Agency and the City had worked together to own and operate mobilehome parks, including the Park, \u201cas a way of providing stable ownership and rents at these properties. The Housing Commission has requested and received approval from the City Council to develop a long term plan and goals for these properties to guide the City and [Redevelopment] Agency.\u201d The draft also stated the goal for transferring ownership of mobilehome parks was \u201c[t]o insure an ownership and rent structure which maintains and enhances the quality and service of these properties,\u201d and as a matter of policy the City \u201cshould design a strategy which would transfer ownership to an entity such as a non-profit corporation, resident ownership/cooperative or similar structure which will insure the ownership operates the properties consistent with this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">The Owners Association also offered the deposition testimony of the City\u2019s deputy director of redevelopment, Narevsky, who co-authored the Long-Term Goal draft. He testified the term \u201cnon-profit corporation\u201d as used in the policy section of the above draft meant a \u201ccharitable organization, nothing more than that.\u201d A proposed third amended complaint added the sentence, \u201cA true and correct copy of a City Council Resolution confirming and ratifying any verbal promises is attached as Exhibit 2.\u201d It did not include any reference to Narevsky\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">In a tentative ruling the court denied the motion, explaining the language of the Long-Term Goal draft did not require sale of the Park to the Owners Association, and it was not a binding document signed by the City. After a hearing, the court affirmed its ruling, and on April 13, 2006, it entered a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">As for the validation action, in October 2005 the parties had stipulated to the City\u2019s filing of a supplemental complaint to reflect changes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>agreement between the City and Wakeland for purchase of the Park. The purchaser would now be Poway, Royal Estates, EEC (PRE), a Wakeland entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">A hearing was held in February 2006, after which the court took the matter under submission. On March 1, it granted the City\u2019s request for validation and entered judgment. We discuss facts pertaining to the validation action below. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">\n<em>The Owners Association\u2019s Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">In reviewing the propriety of the sustaining of a demurrer, the \u201ccourt gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] . . . The judgment must be affirmed \u2018if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.] And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.\u201d <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].) \u201cWhile the decision to sustain or overrule a demurrer is a legal ruling subject to de novo review on appeal, the granting of leave to amend involves an exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>(Lazar v. Hertz Corp. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1501 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 368].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">\n<em>Promissory Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-14\">\u201cIn California, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, \u2018A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.\u2019 [Citations.] Promissory estoppel is \u2018a doctrine which employs equitable principles to satisfy the requirement that consideration must be given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kajima/Ray Wilson v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 305, 310 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 1 P.3d 63].) The elements of promissory estoppel are: (1) a clear promise, (2) reliance, (3) substantial detriment, and (4) damages \u201c \u2018measured by the extent of the obligation assumed and not performed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Toscano </em>v. <em>Greene Music </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 685, 692 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 732].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">It is well established that \u201can estoppel will not be applied against the government if to do so would effectively nullify \u2018a strong rule of policy, adopted for the benefit of the public ....\u2019\u201d <em>(City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 493 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423] <em>(Mansell); </em>see <em>City of South San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 923 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].) \u201c \u2018The courts of this state have been careful to apply the rules of estoppel against a public agency only in those special cases where the interests of justice clearly require it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mansell, supra, </em>at p. 495, fn. 30.) The \u201c \u2018facts upon which such an estoppel must rest go beyond the ordinary principles of estoppel and each case must be examined carefully and rigidly to be sure that a precedent is not established through which, by favoritism or otherwise, the public interest may be mulcted or public policy defeated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">We conclude the second amended complaint does not allege exceptional circumstances necessary to justify application of the promissory estoppel doctrine against the City, and leave to amend would not cure the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">The second amended complaint alleged the City breached a promise to the Owners Association and Park tenants by requiring tax-exempt bond financing for purchase of the Park. The Owners Association submits the City\u2019s financing mechanism excluded it from purchasing the Park because \u201ca residents\u2019 organization converting a park to private ownership cannot ever qualify as a charity, a prerequisite to obtaining the bond financing required by the City.\u201d The second amended complaint also alleged the City deprived the Owners Association of a true opportunity to purchase the Park because it set the selling price above the Park\u2019s fair market value. At the hearing on the demurrer on the first amended complaint, the Owners Association argued the City offered the property to Wakeland \u201cat a price that we believe we\u2019re going to show is almost $10 million more than the property is worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>The second amended complaint sought an order requiring the City to provide the Owners Association and Park residents \u201cwith a price and terms for them to purchase the [P]ark . . . that are true, real and non-illusory,\u201d meaning \u201cat the fair market value of the [P]ark and upon customary and usual, fair and reasonable terms for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">The Owners Association asserts that because it did not allege the City was required to actually sell it the Park, its claim is not for breach of contract and the trial court erred by relying on public contract law in sustaining the demurrer. We reject the assertion. The Owners Association\u2019s theory is that the City breached an agreement that purportedly ties its hands in several respects; it must conduct the sale of the Park in a certain manner, which excludes the acceptance of offers only from nonprofit housing corporations relying on tax-free bond financing; it must include the Owners Association in the bid process even if it determines the Owners Association\u2019s operation of the Park is infeasible and not in the best interest of the City, the Park or its tenants;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it is precluded from asking for or accepting more than the Owners Association considers fair market value for the property. For instance, the City would have to reject Wakeland\u2019s offer of $35.6 million, even though an independent appraiser valued the. property at that amount, as the Owners Association deems it substantially above fair market value. We agree with the trial court that the Owners Association\u2019s action is actually for breach of contract, and the City may not put itself in such a situation absent compliance with proper procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">It is undisputed that the City is a general law city. \u201c \u2018The powers of a general law city include \u201c \u2018only those powers expressly conferred upon it by the Legislature, together with such powers as are \u201cnecessarily incident to those expressly granted or essential to the declared object and purposes of the municipal corporation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Orange v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 45, 52 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 405] <em>(City of Orange).) A </em>\u201c \u2018general law city . . . must comply with state statutes that specify requirements for entering into contracts.

Mezzetta, Inc. v.

City of Hawthorne </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1231, 1236 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 99].) The only writing the Owners Association relies on, the minutes from the City Council\u2019s July 20, 1999 meeting, is not signed by the City\u2019s mayor and thus does not qualify as a contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the minutes do not show the City promised the Owners Association anything in particular. The stated goal in divesting City-owned mobilehome parks was merely to \u201cinsure an ownership and rent structure which maintains and enhances the quality and services of these properties,\u201d and the policy was to \u201cdesign a strategy which would transfer ownership to an entity such as a non-profit corporation, resident ownership/cooperative or similar structure.\u201d Neither the goal nor the policy binds the City to a particular procedure for selling the Park. Indeed, the policy anticipated the possible sale of the Park to a nonprofit corporation, which would include Wakeland. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Owners Association\u2019s motion for reconsideration and bid to file a third amended complaint to attach the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Beyond that, the Owners Association\u2019s claims are based on the allegation in the second amended complaint that beginning in 1991 and on \u201cmany\u201d occasions, unnamed members of the City Council, City Manager Bowersox, and employees of the Redevelopment Agency, including Narevsky, orally expressed an intent to \u201cafford the tenants/residents a real, true and non-illusory opportunity\u201d to purchase the Park. The complaint does not allege the specifics of the representations or where they took place. There is no suggestion the City ever approved such an oral agreement, or even that the issue was submitted to the City for formal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">The Owners Association cites no authority to support application of the promissory estoppel doctrine based on similar alleged oral agreements. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>relies on <em>City of Orange, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 45, in which the court concluded that read together the language of Government Code section 40602 and provisions of a municipal code not at issue here, \u201cdo not unambiguously require that every city contract, without exception, be in writing and signed by the mayor.\u201d <em>(City of Orange, </em>at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">In <em>City of Orange, </em>the court considered the general purpose of Government Code section 40602, which \u201cis to \u2018 \u201c \u2018ensure that expensive decisions are not hastily made\u2019 \u201d \u2019 and to create \u2018 \u201c \u2018a broad base of authority by requiring [contract] approval by a number of different individuals.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Orange, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 54-55.) The court held the <em>city </em>could enforce an oral option contract with the retirement association that required it to hold open its settlement offer in litigation between it and the city, as restrictions on a municipality\u2019s power to contract are designed to protect the public, not those who deal with the public. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">The court further explained the oral option contract imposed no financial burden on the city, the sole consideration was the city\u2019s agreement to stay litigation while considering the retirement association\u2019s settlement offer, and the \u201clitigation standstill would save the city money if the offer were accepted.\u201d <em>(City of Orange, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 54.) Under those circumstances, the purpose of Government Code section 40602\u2014to prevent hasty decisions on important public matters\u2014was served by honoring the oral option agreement because it gave the city adequate time to review the settlement offer and secure approval from city officials without fear the retirement association would withdraw the offer. <em>(City of Orange, </em>at p. 55.) \u201cOrange had much to gain and little, if anything, to lose from the oral option contract.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\"><em>City of Orange </em>is readily distinguishable on its facts. Here, in contrast to that case, private parties seek to enforce an alleged oral promise against a public entity, which is ordinarily not subject to promissory estoppel. Further, the City has little or nothing to gain and much to lose if the promissory estoppel doctrine is held to bind it to the alleged oral representations of its council members or employees. For instance, the City could not sell the Park to Wakeland, or anyone else for that matter, for the agreed price of $35.6 million, as that amount allegedly exceeds fair market value by some $10 million and thus deprives the Owners Association of a genuine opportunity to purchase the Park. Accordingly, the alleged oral agreement may place a financial burden on the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">It is true that Government Code section 40602, standing alone, does not <em>expressly </em>require that every contract of a municipality be in writing. However, a statute prescribing a city\u2019s method for contracting may <em>impliedly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>prohibit any other method of contracting. <em>(Nash v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1926) 78 Cal.App. 516, 522 [248 P. 689]; see also 10A McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed. 1999) \u00a7 29.112.) In our view, Government Code section 40602 impliedly requires a written contract here, because an oral contract would violate the statute\u2019s purpose of requiring a city\u2019s governing body to make considered decisions on important matters affecting the public fisc. \u201c \u2018 \u201cNo single individual has absolute authority to bind the municipality; many parts of the city government must work together.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Mezzetta, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1094.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The Owners Association\u2019s reliance on <em>Mansell, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 462, is likewise misplaced. <em>Mansell </em>involved long-standing and complicated boundary disputes that affected thousands of persons who lived in the Alamitos Bay area. Because a variety of factors \u201ccast a cloud on the title to this land to such an extent... the normal procedure of removing such a cloud, by an action to quiet title, [was] of no practical, value\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 467), the Legislature attempted to resolve the disputes by disclaiming state and other public interests in certain tidelands and submerged lands. The city manager and the city clerk, however, refused to perform their ministerial duties to carry out the legislation on the ground it violated constitutional and common law prohibitions against the alienation of state-owned tidelands and submerged lands. The city sought a writ of mandate compelling the officers to perform their duties, and the state was the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">Among other arguments, the city and state raised an equitable estoppel argument against <em>themselves. </em>They asserted that since \u201cthe subject lands were filled and improved with the knowledge and acquiescence of the state and city and that since annexation of the area in 1923 the city has exercised full municipal jurisdiction over it\u2014granting building permits, approving subdivision maps, constructing and maintaining streets and city services, [and] collecting taxes,\u201d it would result in manifest injustice if they claimed paramount title. <em>(Mansell, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 487.) The court noted the estoppel argument was not relevant to its decision <em>(ibid.), </em>but it nonetheless considered the issue and found the elements of estoppel present. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">The court explained \u201cthe activities, representations, and conduct of the state and its subtrustee the city . . . rise to the level of culpability necessary to support an equitable estoppel against them .... The stipulated facts clearly establish that from an early date the state and city have been aware of the serious and complex title problems in the Alamitos Bay area. More importantly, those public entities have been in a position to resolve such problems and to determine the true boundaries between public and private lands. This they have not done. Instead they have conducted themselves relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>settled and subdivided lands ... as if no title problems existed and have misled thousands of homeowners in the process.\u201d (Mansell, <em>supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">The <em>Mansell </em>court concluded application of the estoppel doctrine would not have a deleterious effect on the public policy of ensuring public ownership of tidelands, as development, in the Alamitos Bay area \u201chas resulted in an area providing an impressive array of public facilities for navigation and recreation.\u201d (Mansell, <em>supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 500.) The court cautioned that the estoppel issue arose in a \u201cpeculiar context\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p.. 499), \u201csimilarly compelling circumstances will not often, recur\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 500), and it intended to \u201ccreate an extremely narrow precedent for application in future cases.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">Here, in contrast, the City did not raise the estoppel doctrine against itself, and application of the doctrine would have deleterious effects. <em>Mansell </em>and <em>City of Orange </em>are unhelpful to the Owners Association as they do not address the scenario at issue here. \u201cA decision is authority only for the point actually passed on by the court and directly involved in the case. General expressions in opinions that go beyond the facts of the case will not necessarily control the outcome in a subsequent suit involving different facts.\u201d <em>(Gomes v.

The Legislature has declared \u201cthat the authority to issue revenue bonds to aid in the financing of home purchase is needed in the cities and the counties of the state and that it is in the public interest and serves a public purpose by providing financing for decent, safe, and sanitary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>housing that people in the lower end of the purchasing spectrum can afford and is a function pertaining to the government, and affairs of the cities and the counties of the state.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf.

(Torielli, <em>supra, </em>31 Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. at p. 152.) A bond is a \u201cprivate activity bond\u201d if, for instance, \u201cmore than 10 percent of the proceeds of the issue are to be used for any private business use.\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 141(b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">Under section 103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, the interest on a private activity bond is excluded from bondholders\u2019 gross income for tax purposes only if the bond is a \u201cqualified bond\u201d within the meaning of section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 141).

Health and Safety Code section 52100 states: \u201cThe Legislature hereby finds and declares that it would be beneficial to empower counties and cities to issue tax-exempt revenue bonds for the purpose of lending the proceeds to nonprofit organizations exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended . . . , for the housing purposes specified in Section 52101.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-12\">Health and Safety Code section 52101 allows a city to-issue bonds and loan the proceeds to a tax-exempt charitable corporation for a variety of purposes, including the acquisition of mobilehome parks \u201cthat are or will be nonprofit or cooperatively-owned.\u201d Issuance of the bonds must satisfy section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>Under section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code, a bond shall not be a \u201cqualified 501(c)(3) bond if any portion of the net proceeds of the issue are to be used directly or indirectly to provide residential rental property for family units.\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(d)(1).)

This requirement focuses \u201con the democratic nature of the approval-granting authority: it is either the electorate as a whole or persons chosen by the electorate\u201d who approve the bonds. <em>(Affordable Housing v.

At the hearing, the City \u00e1dopted resolutions approving its sale of the Park to the Redevelopment Agency (resolution No. 05-044), and its issuance of revenue bonds to finance the Redevelopment Agency\u2019s purchase and allow the City to retire and refinance debt associated with the Park (resolution No. 05-043). The Redevelopment Agency adopted resolutions approving its purchase of the Park and an operating agreement between it and Wakeland (resolution No. R-05-06), and requesting that the City issue the revenue bonds (resolution No. R-05-05).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">The Owners Association contends the judgment in the validation action was improper because the City presented no evidence at the TEFRA hearing that Wakeland or its subsidiary qualified as a tax-exempt charitable corporation under 26 United States Code section 501(c)(3), or that the Park satisfied the 20-50 rule pertaining to the provision of low-income housing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">The City concedes that at the time of the hearing, PRE\u2019s approval from the IRS was pending. The City asserts PRE\u2019s tax-exempt status was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>prerequisite of the hearing, because the sale of the Park was contingent on it receiving approval from the IRS, and if it did not get approval the Redevelopment Agency could not sell the Park to PRE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The City also asserts it was not required to present any evidence that 20 percent of the Park\u2019s spaces would be available for low-income housing because the mobilehome park sale and operating agreement (Agreement) between the Redevelopment Agency and PRE provides: \u201cPurchaser shall restrict occupancy of not fewer than twenty percent ... of the Mobilehome Spaces to Very Low Income Households . . . and not fewer than an additional forty percent ... of the Mobilehome Spaces to Lower Income Households. . . . The Purchaser shall annually submit to Agency a summary of the income, household size and rent payable by each of the residents of the Affordable Spaces who provide income certificates to Purchaser.\u201d The Agreement includes provisions on establishing maximum monthly rentals for low-income spaces based on 50 percent of the San Diego County median income for relevant family sizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Preliminarily, we note the City\u2019s bond resolution is misleading as to the authority for its issuance of tax-exempt bonds. The resolution\u2019s preamble states \u201cthe Agency intends to, but is not obligated to, sell the Park to [Wakeland], a non-profit corporation . . . , or an entity formed by Wakeland, provided that it will not sell the Park absent an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel that the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Bonds will not be adversely affected for federal income tax purposes as a consequence of such sale, and therefore <em>the Bonds are being issued as qualified 501(c)(3) bonds pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The resolution\u2019s preamble also states that \u201cpursuant to Section 147(f) of [26 United States] Code, the issuance of the Bonds is required to be approved, following a public [TEFRA] hearing, by an elected representative of the issuer of the Bonds and an elected representative of the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area in which the Park is located.\u201d As discussed, a TEFRA hearing is required when revenue bonds are issued to finance the project of a tax-exempt charitable corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Further, the section of the resolution entitled \u201cApproval of Issuance of Bonds\u201d states the issuance \u201cis hereby authorized and approved pursuant to <em>Chapter 8 </em>of Part 5 of Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code and Section 147(f) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. It is the purpose and intent of this City Council that this resolution constitute approval of the issuance of the Bonds by the applicable elected representative of the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area in which the Project is located, all in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>with Section 147(f) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.\u201d (Italics added.) Chapter 8 begins with Health and Safety Code section 52100 and pertains to loans to tax-exempt charitable organizations under 26 United States Code section 501(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Additionally, in its respondent\u2019s brief on appeal, the City states the bonds would be issued \u201cas \u2018qualified 501(c)(3) bonds\u2019 under the [Internal Revenue] Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Under the first step of the City\u2019s plan, however, it intended to issue the bonds and loan the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency, which is not a charitable corporation under 26 United States Code section 501(c)(3). We requested supplemental briefing from the parties on this and other issues, and the City <em>now </em>advises that the authority for its issuance of tax-exempt bonds arid loan of the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency for its purchase of the Park is <em>actually </em>Health and Safety Code section 52075, subdivision (a), discussed above. The City states that if PRE did not qualify for tax-exempt status, step two of its plan would not occur and the Redevelopment Agency would continue as the Park\u2019s owner and the bonds would remain tax exempt under 26 United States Code section 103(a). If PRE did qualify as tax exempt, borrow the bond proceeds and purchase the Park, the bonds would remain tax exempt, but under 26 United States Code 501(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">The City explains that to take advantage of favorable interest rates and retire existing debt on the Park, it sought to issue tax-exempt bonds before Wakeland or PRE obtained a determination letter from the IRS. For reasons not satisfactorily explained, the City did not refinance the debt itself. Rather, it decided to first loan the proceeds of the bond issuance to the Redevelopment Agency for its interim purchase of the Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">The City asserts: \u201cThe City and [Redevelopment] Agency proceeded in a conservative fashion so as to assure that the bonds would qualify a!s tax exempt bonds under two possible scenarios: If the City was not able to proceed with a qualified 501(c)(3) borrowing, which is the structure that requires the TEFRA hearing, the City would still move forward with a \u2018refunding\u2019 of the prior debt, all' of which will result in significant savings to the City. Consequently, if there is . . . any tax issue, such as not receiving the IRS determination letter, the sale to PRE would not move forward and the [Redevelopment] Agency would maintain ownership of the Park. Conversely, in the event that 501(c)(3) requirements were satisfied and the Park could be sold to PRE, the City and the [Redevelopment] Agency have <em>already </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number><em>complied with the requirements of TEFRA, </em>thus not delaying the issuance of the bonds and the resulting savings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">The City concedes the bond resolution does not state the specific authorization for step one of its plan, issuance of tax-exempt bonds and loan of the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency. It submits, however, that under Health and Safety Code section 52031 it was only required to generally cite part 5 of division 31 of that code, which also includes section 52075.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the resolution specifically cites <em>chapter 8 </em>of part 5, the City asserts its authority to cite only part 5 is not \u201cinvalidated by reference to a different chapter within the part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">The City also advises that \u201cTEFRA compliance, and the TEFRA reference in the [b]ond [Resolution, were included solely and exclusively to accommodate Step 2, the subsequent sale to the Park by the [Redevelopment] Agency, and were not intended to relate to Step 1, the sale of the Park to the [Redevelopment] Agency. The Resolution was drafted, and the related proceedings undertaken, to provide complete authority for both steps of the financing.\u201d Again, however, the City concedes the resolution does not set forth the specific authority for its issuance of tax-exempt bonds and loan of the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">Despite the City\u2019s attempts to defend the bond resolution, a reader can only conclude from its language that the City intended to do an unauthorized act: issue tax-exempt bonds under <em>chapter 8 </em>of part 5 of division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, which pertains to tax-exempt charitable corporations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3)), and loan the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency, which does not qualify as such an organization. Since the resolution referred specifically to <em>chapter 8 </em>of part 5 of division 31 of the Health and Safety Code and sections 147(f) and 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, we question why it did not set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>the authority for the first step of the City\u2019s plan, which members of the public could not reasonably be expected to know was unrelated to PRE\u2019s status as a tax-exempt entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">With the City\u2019s <em>actual </em>financing plan in mind, we must determine whether the hearing was a sufficient TEFRA hearing to satisfy the second step of the City\u2019s plan. The statute does not set forth any procedural requirements other than approval by voter referendum or the governmental unit following reasonable public notice. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147(f)(2)(B).) Further, there is a dearth of reported opinions citing the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">The Owners Association cites <em>Steele v. Industrial Development Bd. of Metro </em>(6th Cir. 2002) 301 F.3d 401 <em>(Steele), </em>for the proposition TEFRA \u201ccontemplates public approval by a governmental unit based upon evidence available at the public hearing that the IRS requirements have been satisfied.\u201d The issue in <em>Steele </em>was whether the development board should have issued tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of a private religious university. In reciting the background, the court noted without discussion that to be qualified as tax exempt, the bonds had to meet certain criteria, including that the university be \u201ca registered 501(c)(3) organization.\u201d <em>(Steele, supra, </em>at pp. 404-405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">In <em>Affordable Housing, supra, </em>433 F.3d at page 1193, the. court explained the \u201cfederal focus is on the democratic nature of the approval-granting authority: it is either the electorate as a whole or persons chosen by the electorate.\u201d The court elaborated that \u201cTEFRA mandates that the city council decide the matter [at issue] <em>after considering local residents\u2019 views, </em>and by clear implication requires the city council to consider city priorities and housing needs, the wisdom of preferential financing for the project, and <em>all manner of other relevant considerations to which elected representatives normally give weight in executing their office.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1195, italics added.) The court also explained that \u201cthe federal statute\u2019s explicit provisions for a voter referendum or approval by an elected representative indicate that Congress did not intend to make approval automatic or to exclude the play of <em>democratic process </em>in the local decision.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1194, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Ignoring <em>Affordable Housing, supra, </em>433 F.3d 1182, the City asserts \u201c[t]here is nothing in Internal Revenue Code section 147(f) which even raises the inference that a \u2018democratic process\u2019 is required or that evidence must be taken and findings have to be made with respect to the proposed 501(c)(3) corporation.\u201d We reject the notion a democratic process is not required, because that is the purpose of the hearing requirement. Further, while 26 United States Code section 147(f) does not explicitly state a corporation must have achieved tax-exempt status by the time of the TEFRA hearing, that requirement is implicit. Indeed, the purpose of a TEFRA hearing is for a local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>entity\u2019s public consideration of whether to issue private activity bonds to finance a project of a charitable corporation under 26 United States Code section 501(c)(3). Here, it appears that in a rush to take advantage of favorable interest rates, laudable in and of itself, the City put the cart before the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">We also conclude the hearing did not give the public an adequate opportunity to comment on the matter of low-income housing, the provision of which is the <em>purpose </em>of financing the private project with tax-exempt bonds. Again, a bond is not a \u201cqualified 501(c)(3) bond\u201d if any portion of the net proceeds of the issue are to be used for residential rental property (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(d)(1)), unless \u201c20 percent or more of the residential units in such project are occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median gross income.\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142(d)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">As explained in <em>Affordable Housing, supra, </em>433 F.3d 1182 under TEFRA approval of tax-exempt bonds is subject to community input, and in making its decision the City is required to consider such input. The City points to no evidence in the administrative record that it brought forth or discussed any information on the provision of low-income housing at the Park, a critical element in maintenance of the tax-free status of the bonds. We disagree that the Agreement between the Redevelopment Agency and PRE satisfied TEFRA because it includes provisions requiring PRE to comply with the 20-50 rule. We conclude that given the contingent nature of step two of the City\u2019s divestiture plan, the uncertain status of Wakeland or PRE at the time of the hearing, and the lack of any information on the low-income aspect of the project, the City\u2019s hearing was essentially tantamount to no TEFRA hearing at all.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The judgment on the Owners Association\u2019s action is affirmed.

In a March 2005 memorandum to the City, the Park\u2019s five-member \u201cSelection Panel\u201d explained it had reviewed submissions by and interviewed the Owners Association, Wakeland and two other entities, and found Wakeland and one of the other entities more qualified to purchase, own and operate the Park. The memorandum explained that in addition to not demonstrating an ability to finance purchase of the Park, the Owners Association \u201cdid not demonstrate that it has the capacity to asset manage a 399 space mobilehome community. Asset management responsibilities for such a large project are complex. These duties include developing budgets, making decisions on spending, identifying capital replacement priorities, maintaining and overseeing the rent structure .... overseeing the financial and accounting systems and preparation of financial reports including audits, and providing services to residents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1227-9\"> In its opening brief, the Owners Association refers to \u201ca 2003 City Council resolution adopted after several public hearings\u201d in which it promised \u201cthat if and when the City decided to sell the [P]ark, it would include the residents in the bidding and sale process. . . .\u201d The statement is not supported by any citation to the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1231-12\"> Given our holding, we are not required to consider the City\u2019s argument the alleged oral contract also violated the statute of frauds, or the apparent lack of any consideration to support the alleged oral contract.f</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1232-11\"> The Owners Association does not challenge the granting of the demurrer to the second amended complaint\u2019s third cause of action for declaratory relief.

We grant the Owners Association\u2019s motions to strike the portions of the City\u2019s supplemental briefs that refer to the letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1239-9\"> This statement muddies the waters, as it suggests the City did not intend to issue the bonds until PRE received tax-exempt status. The City has explained numerous times, however, that it intended to issue the bonds and loan the proceeds to the Redevelopment Agency notwithstanding PRE\u2019s status. It is unclear how holding a second hearing to comply with TEFRA after PRE received IRS approval would delay issuance of the bonds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1239-10\"> Health and Safety Code section 52031 provides: \u201cThe exercise of any or all powers granted by this part shall be authorized and the bonds shall be authorized to be issued under this part for the purposes set forth in this part, by resolution or ordinance of the governing body of the city or county which shall take effect immediately upon adoption. Any such resolution or ordinance shall set forth a finding and declaration (1) of the public purpose therefor and (2) that such resolution or ordinance is being adopted pursuant to the powers granted by this part. The finding and declaration shall be conclusive evidence of the existence and sufficiency of the public purpose and powers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1241-8\"> A public agency may issue \u201cindustrial development bonds\u201d (IDE\u2019s) but, as with private activity bonds, they do not qualify for tax-exempt status unless a public approval process was satisfied before their issuance. A temporary income tax regulation sets forth the requirements of the process for IDE\u2019s, and provides, \u201cPublic hearing means a forum providing a <em>reasonable opportunity for interested individuals to express their views, </em>both orally and in writing, on the proposed issue of bonds and the location and nature of a proposed facility to be financed.\u201d (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 5f.103-2(g)(2) (2007), italics added.) There is currently no regulation pertaining to the public hearing requirement for private activity bonds, but by analogy, the regulation for IDE\u2019s is instructive. With the contingent nature of PRE\u2019s purchase of the Park, and the lack of any information on the 20-50 rule, the public had no reasonable opportunity to express its views on significant matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1241-9\"> Given our conclusion that TEFRA was unsatisfied, we are not required to consider the Owners Association\u2019s contention that the City was not legally authorized to sell the Park to the Redevelopment Agency because there was no evidence the Park is within a redevelopment zone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
