Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and her admission of the truth of an allegation she personally inflicted great bodily injury on another person in the commission of that offense (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)). On appeal, Weaver contends the trial court erred by (1) denying her request for probation; (2) imposing the middle six-year term for her section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense; and (3) imposing a consecutive three-year enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). She also contends: (1) her conviction of only one offense precludes a court from considering it as two prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8) and the three strikes law (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)); and (2) the victim restitution fine imposed by the trial court must be offset by the amount paid by her insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">On August 19, 2004, Weaver graduated from San Diego State University. Celebrating her graduation with friends (including Jaylin Ruiz), Weaver consumed several shots of alcohol (Jagermeister).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">About 1:00 a.m. on August 20, Ed Thurston, driving his car eastbound on Highway 56 about two to four miles from its intersection with Interstate 5, saw a car approaching him from the opposite direction on the wrong side of the divided highway. The car did not have its headlights on and was traveling in the fast lane at a speed of over 70 miles per hour. After it passed him, Thurston saw that the car also did not have its rear taillights on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">Also about 1:00 a.m., Jose Garcia, driving his car eastbound on Highway 56 about one-half mile from its intersection with Interstate 5, saw a car approaching him from the opposite direction on the wrong side of the divided highway. The car had its headlights on and was traveling in the fast lane at a speed of 80 to 90 miles per hour. Garcia swerved to the right to avoid colliding with the car and then swerved left, lost control of his car, and drove into bushes and rocks in the highway\u2019s median. The other car did not stop or slow down and merged onto the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 heading south (i.e., the opposite direction of oncoming traffic).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Also about 1:00 a.m., Scott Tempus, driving his car eastbound on Highway 56 about one-quarter mile from its intersection with Interstate 5, saw a car approaching him from the opposite direction on the wrong side of the divided highway.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The car had its headlights on and was traveling in the slow lane. After Tempus swerved to avoid the car, the other car merged onto the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 heading south (i.e., the opposite direction of oncoming traffic).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Also about 1:00 a.m., Anatoly Sigalov (Sigalov) was driving his car northbound on Interstate 5 just south of the on-ramp or transition to eastbound Highway 56. His wife Mara was sitting in the front passenger seat. Sigalov was traveling about 65 miles per hour, with his car\u2019s headlights on, when he saw the reflection of his headlights on the front windshield of an oncoming car, which was only about a \u201cyard away.\u201d The other car did not have its headlights on. Weaver was the other car\u2019s driver. Without time for Sigalov to react, the two cars collided head-on.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Both cars sustained substantial damage. Mara died from blunt force trauma suffered in the collision. Sigalov suffered cracked ribs and a dislocated right hip, requiring surgery to repair his pelvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">While being transported in an ambulance, Weaver told an emergency medical technician that she had been drinking. He smelled alcohol on her breath. At 3:45 a.m,, blood was drawn from Weaver. Testing of that blood sample showed Weaver\u2019s blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.151 percent. Her blood sample also tested positive for the presence of cocaine, suggesting she had. consumed cocaine about two to three hours before the blood was drawn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">On December 10, an information was filed, charging Weaver with five counts: (1) gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)); (2) driving under the influence, causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>subd. (a)); (3) driving with a BAG of 0.08 percent or greater and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b)); (4) driving the wrong way on a divided highway and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 21651, subds. (b) &amp; (c)); and (5) hit-and-run driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002, subd. (a)). The information also alleged that: (1) in committing counts 1 through 3, Weaver caused bodily injury or death (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23558); (2) in committing count 1, she personally inflicted great bodily injury on Sigalov (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)); (3) in committing counts 2 through 4, she personally inflicted great bodily injury on Mara and Sigalov (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)); and (4) regarding counts 1 through 4, her offenses constituted serious felonies within the meaning of section 1192.7, subd. (c)(8) because she inflicted great bodily injury on Mara and Sigalov.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">On September 28, 2005, the date scheduled for trial, Weaver pleaded guilty to count 1 (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)) and admitted the truth of the allegations related to count 1, including that in committing the section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense she personally inflicted great bodily injury on Sigalov within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) and on Sigalov and Mara within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8). Pursuant to her plea agreement with the prosecution, the trial court dismissed the remaining charges and allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">On December 14, the trial court denied probation and sentenced Weaver to the middle term of six years for count 1 and a consecutive three-year term for the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement, for a total term of nine years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to section 654, the trial court stayed imposition of the one-year enhancement under Vehicle Code section 23558. The court also imposed a restitution fine of $229,479, \u201csubject to modification upward or downward on the application by counsel and a hearing can be held.\u201d It expressly retained jurisdiction to address the issue of restitution and to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">On February 6, 2006, Weaver filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">On March 20, Weaver filed a motion to recall her sentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (d), requesting that the trial court recall its sentence, impose the lower four-year term for count 1, and strike the enhancement for her infliction of great bodily injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Attached to her motion were declarations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>of her former boyfriend (Jacob Ramsey) and Danielle Steinke, who was at the party, explaining some of the events preceding the incident and why Weaver drove her car that night while intoxicated. Based on those declarations, her motion argued in part that she intended to stay overnight at her friend Ruiz\u2019s house and had not planned to drive her car that night, but did so only after her then boyfriend (Ramsey) called and asked her to come home to Spring Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">On March 21, the trial court denied Weaver\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">\n<em>Denial of Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">Weaver contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying her request that she be granted probation. She argues the trial court considered improper factors and did not consider relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">At Weaver\u2019s sentencing, the trial court received and considered the probation report, the prosecution\u2019s statement in aggravation, Weaver\u2019s statement in mitigation, and letters from, and testimonies of, family and friends of both Mara and Weaver.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The probation report recommended probation be denied and the court impose the middle term of six years for count 1 and a consecutive three-year term for the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement. The prosecution\u2019s statement in aggravation requested probation be denied and the court impose the upper term of 10 years for count 1 and a consecutive three-year term for the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement. Weaver\u2019s statement in mitigation requested probation be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial court found Weaver was genuinely remorseful and was not a chronic partygoer in college. It also noted the \u201cdreadful\u201d injuries suffered by Sigalov. The court stated that in sentencing Weaver, its job was to apply the law to this case while considering \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>framework of protecting society, meting out an appropriate punishment deterring others, hopefully preventing other crimes and achieving some degree of uniformity in sentencing.\u201d The court noted that California Rules of Court, rule 4.414<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> guided its consideration of whether to grant or deny probation. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">\u201cThere are factors that weigh on both sides [i.e., granting or denying probation]. Certainly in favor of grant of probation is this young woman\u2019s youth, her lack of significant record, just one speeding ticket and her absence of actual malice in this case[, h]er genuine remorse and her ability to comply with the conditions of probation if probation were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">\u201cOn the other side of the [equation] lies the horrific nature of this offense. The dreadful loss to this family, the fact that Ms. Weaver . .. did not stop her driving after the first near miss, the high blood alcohol, the presence of drugs. I find the drug was cocaine. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">\u201cMr. Sigalov, I think, unknowingly touched on another factor that I think was important and that is the vulnerability of him and his wife. They\u2019re driving on a highway in a lane that they\u2019re lawfully allowed to drive on at a speed they\u2019re lawfully allowed to drive. And one does not expect this to happen under those circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Considering those factors, the trial court denied probation as \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">\u201cAll defendants are eligible for probation, in the discretion of the sentencing court [citation], unless a statute provides otherwise.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aubrey </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 279, 282 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 378].) \u201cThe grant or denial of probation is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and the defendant bears a heavy burden when attempting to show an abuse of that discretion.

(Rule 4.408(a).) A trial court is generally required to state its reasons for denying probation and imposing a prison sentence, including any additional reasons considered pursuant to rule 4.408. (Rules 4.406(b)(2) &amp; 4.408(a).) Unless the record affirmatively shows otherwise, a trial court is deemed to have considered all relevant criteria in deciding whether to grant or deny probation or in making any other discretionary sentencing choice. (Rule 4.409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-16\">\u201cThe circumstances utilized by the trial court to support its sentencing choice need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence. [Citations.]\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Leung </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 482, 506 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 290].) Accordingly, in determining whether a trial court abused its discretion by denying probation, we consider, in part, whether there is sufficient, or substantial, evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that a particular factor was applicable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 506-507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Weaver argues the trial court considered improper factors in deciding whether to grant or deny probation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She asserts the trial court improperly considered \u201cvictim vulnerability.\u201d However, rule 4.414(a)(3) expressly lists \u201c[t]he vulnerability of the victim\u201d as a relevant fact relating to the crime that should be considered by a trial court in deciding whether to grant or deny probation. In this case, although the probation report did not list that factor, the prosecution\u2019s statement in aggravation <em>did </em>list the \u201cvulnerability of the victim\u201d as a reason supporting denial of probation, stating: \u201cBoth Anatoly and Mara Sigalov were vulnerable victims, in the sense that they never had a chance to defend themselves against the defendant. The [Sigalovs] were driving on \u00e1 highway in the darkness of the night. They were driving legally, and safely. They were driving the speed limit, with the headlights of their car on. The defendant was driving towards them at approximately 70 miles per hour, heading in the wrong direction, with her headlights off. The [Sigalovs] were completely vulnerable to the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d The trial court expressly relied on the vulnerability of the victims as a factor in deciding to deny probation, stating: \u201c[A]nother factor that I think was important ... is the vulnerability of [Sigalov] and his wife. They\u2019re driving on a highway in a lane that they\u2019re lawfully allowed to drive on at a speed they\u2019re lawfully allowed to drive. And one does not expect this to happen under those circumstances.\u201d Victim \u201c[vulnerability means defenseless, unguarded, unprotected, accessible, assailable, one who is susceptible to the defendant\u2019s criminal act.\u201d <em>(People v. Smith </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 433, 436 [156 Cal.Rptr. 502] [describing that term in the context of rule 4.421(a)(3)].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based on our review of the record, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Sigalov and Mara were vulnerable victims of Weaver\u2019s crime within the meaning of rule 4.414(a)(3). Weaver\u2019s car was traveling in the opposite direction of oncoming traffic on northbound Interstate 5 at a high rate of speed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Despite the late-night darkness, its headlights were off. In contrast, the Sigalovs\u2019 car was traveling in the proper direction at a normal rate , of speed and had its headlights on. Based on those circumstances, the trial court could reasonably conclude Sigalov and Mara were <em>vulnerable </em>within the meaning of rule 4.414(a)(3) because they had absolutely no advance warning or ability to avoid Weaver\u2019s oncoming car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>Although Weaver argues Sigalov and Mara were not \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable victims, that finding is not required under rule 4.414(a)(3) and, in any event, the record supports a finding they were, in fact, particularly vulnerable victims. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloom </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 310 [190 Cal.Rptr. 857] and <em>People v. Piceno </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1353 [241 Cal.Rptr. 391], Weaver asserts that because all victims of gross vehicular manslaughter are vulnerable, no victim of gross vehicular manslaughter can be \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable. However, in so arguing, Weaver relies solely on cases involving only rule 4.421(a)(3), which provides that one circumstance in aggravation for purposes of deciding whether to impose an upper, middle, or lower term is whether \u201c[t]he victim was <em>particularly </em>vulnerable.\u201d (Italics added.) That circumstance (and its \u201cparticularly\u201d requirement) is inapplicable here because rule 4.421 does not address circumstances to be considered in granting or denying probation. Furthermore, rule 4.414(a)(3) does <em>not </em>include the qualifying term \u201cparticularly\u201d in listing the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim as a circumstance to be considered in granting or denying probation. Therefore, we conclude that neither rule 4.421(a)(3)\u2019s requirement that a victim be \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable nor the interpretations of that term in <em>Bloom </em>and <em>Piceno </em>apply to the trial court\u2019s denial of probation in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To the extent the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNiece </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1048 [226 Cal.Rptr. 733], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>McFarland </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 798, 804-805 [254 Cal.Rptr. 331, 765 P.2d 493], concluded otherwise, we disagree with its reasoning and therefore decline to apply its</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>holding in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In any event, assuming arguendo that requirement applied, we nevertheless would conclude there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Sigalov and Mara, in the circumstances of this case, were, in fact, particularly vulnerable victims of Weaver\u2019s offense. There is no empirical evidence in the appellate record showing that the \u201cusual\u201d victim of gross vehicular manslaughter has absolutely no advance warning or ability to attempt to avoid the defendant\u2019s car. On the contrary, one can envision, many situations involving gross vehicular manslaughter (whether a \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a) offense or otherwise) in which the victim has at least some advance notice or warning of the imminent risk posed by the defendant\u2019s car, thereby allowing him or her at least some opportunity to attempt to avoid the collision. Those victims presumably should be considered less vulnerable than Sigalov and Mara in this case. Weaver\u2019s car was traveling in the opposite direction of oncoming traffic on northbound Interstate 5 at a high rate of speed. Despite the late-night darkness, its headlights were off. In contrast, the S\u00edgalo vs\u2019 car was traveling in the proper direction at a normal rate of speed and had its headlights on. Based on those circumstances, the trial court could have reasonably concluded Sigalov and Mara were <em>particularly </em>vulnerable because they, apparently unlike \u201cusual\u201d victims of gross vehicular manslaughter, had absolutely no advance warning or ability to attempt to avoid the oncoming car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Weaver also argues the trial court erred by improperly considering the \u201chorrific nature of this offense,\u201d which included the \u201cdreadful loss\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>victim\u2019s family, Weaver\u2019s continuation of driving after the \u201cnear miss\u201d prior to the collision, her high BAC, and the presence of cocaine in her system. However, rule 4.414(a)(1) expressly provides that a trial court should consider \u201c[t]he nature, seriousness, and circumstances of the crime as compared to other instances of the same crime.\u201d Also, rule 4.414 provides that the trial court should consider \u201c[w]hether the defendant inflicted physical or emotional injury\u201d (rule 4.414(a)(4)) and \u201c[t]he degree of monetary loss to the victim\u201d (rule 4.414(a)(5)). Therefore, the trial court properly considered the \u201chorrific nature,\u201d or the nature, seriousness, and circumstances, of Weaver\u2019s offense when compared to other section 191.5, subdivision (a) offenses, as well as the physical and emotional injuries and monetary loss Weaver inflicted on the victims of her offense. The trial court implicitly concluded, and we cannot presume otherwise, that \u201cother instances\u201d of section 191.5, subdivision (a) offenses do not involve the same egregious circumstances as in this case. (Rule 4.414(a)(1).) Furthermore, the trial court properly considered the \u201cdreadful loss\u201d to the victim\u2019s family because rule 4.414 does <em>not </em>require the physical and emotional injuries or economic losses of the victim and/or the victim\u2019s family be particularly great or unusual in comparison to other instances of section 191.5, subdivision (a) offenses. (Rule 4.414(a)(4), (5).) Rather, the physical and/or emotional injuries and the monetary losses inflicted on the victim and/or the victim\u2019s family should be considered by a trial court in <em>all </em>cases in deciding whether to grant or deny probation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Weaver also contends the trial court erred by not considering certain circumstances that would have supported a decision to grant probation. She argues the trial court should have considered the following circumstances: (1) her crime was unlikely to recur (rule 4.414(a)(7)); (2) it was unlikely that she would be a danger to others were she not imprisoned (rule 4.414(b)(8)); (3) the likely effect of imprisonment on her (rule 4.414(b)(5)); (4) the adverse collateral consequence on her life because of her conviction (rule 4.414(b)(6)); and (5) the physical and emotional injuries that she inflicted on herself (rule 4.408(a)). Although the trial court did not expressly state it considered some or all of those circumstances, we note the probation report listed three of them (namely, circumstances 2, 3, and 4, listed above).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Also, in Weaver\u2019s statement in mitigation, she listed and discussed circumstances 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>through 4, above, in support of her request for probation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the trial court expressly stated on the record that it received and considered both of those documents, we presume the court did, in fact, consider those circumstances even though it did not expressly restate, recite, or otherwise refer to each one. As we noted above, unless the record affirmatively shows otherwise, a trial court is. deemed to have considered all relevant criteria in deciding whether to grant or deny probation or in making any other discretionary sentencing choice. (Rule 4.409.) Regarding circumstance 5 suggested by Weaver, we also presume the trial court was aware of, and considered, the circumstances of Weaver\u2019s physical and emotional injuries in denying probation, despite the fact neither the court, nor any of the sentencing documents (including Weaver\u2019s own statement in mitigation), expressly referred to those injuries as a circumstance supporting a grant of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Finally, Weaver argues the trial court improperly considered her youth as a factor that would support a grant of probation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> She argues a defendant\u2019s youth is not listed as a factor in rule 4.414, but is listed as a factor in rule 4.413(c)(2)(C), which only applies in unusual cases when probation is presumptively disfavored by statute. However, as noted above, rule 4.408(a) allows a court to consider additional factors not listed in the sentencing rules, provided those additional factors are stated on the record and are reasonably related to the decision being made. Because Weaver\u2019s youth is reasonably related to the court\u2019s decision whether to grant or deny probation, we conclude the court properly considered her youth as factor that would support a grant of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Although we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in considering circumstances regarding the grant or denial of probation, we further note that Weaver has not made any attempt to carry her appellate burden to show the errors purportedly made by the court were prejudicial. Alternatively stated, assuming arguendo the trial court erred as Weaver asserts, she has not shown it is reasonably probable the court would have granted her probation had it not so erred. <em>(People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>Cal.4th 324, 492 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] [\u201cWhen a trial court has given both proper and improper reasons for <em>a </em>sentence choice, a reviewing court will set aside the sentence only if it is reasonably probable that the trial court would have chosen a lesser sentence had it known that some of its reasons were improper.

As we concluded in part I, <em>ante, </em>there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Sigalov and Mara, in the circumstances of this case, were in fact particularly vulnerable victims of Weaver\u2019s crime. There is no empirical evidence in the appellate record showing that the \u201cusual\u201d victim of gross vehicular manslaughter has absolutely no advance warning or ability to attempt to avoid the defendant\u2019s car. On the contrary, one can envision many situations involving gross vehicular manslaughter (whether a \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a) offense or otherwise) in which the victim has at least some advance notice or warning of the imminent risk posed by the defendant\u2019s car that allows him or her at least some opportunity to attempt to avoid the collision. Those victims presumably should be considered less vulnerable than Sigalov and Mara in this case. Weaver\u2019s car was traveling in the opposite direction of oncoming traffic on northbound Interstate 5 at a high rate of speed. Despite the late-night darkness, its headlights were off. In contrast, the Sigalovs\u2019 car was traveling in the proper direction at a normal rate of speed and had its headlights on. Based on those circumstances, the trial court could have reasonably concluded Sigalov and Mara were <em>particularly </em>vulnerable because they, apparently unlike \u201cusual\u201d victims of gross vehicular manslaughter, had absolutely no advance warning or ability to attempt to avoid the oncoming car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>To the extent Weaver argues the trial court could not consider whether the offense was \u201chorrific\u201d or argues there is insufficient evidence to support that finding, we note rule 4.421(a)(1) permits a trial court to consider as an aggravating circumstance whether the offense \u201cinvolved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness.\u201d The trial court\u2019s description of the offense as \u201chorrific\u201d may fall within that rule. In any event, rule 4.408(a) authorizes a trial court to consider \u201cadditional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\u201d The trial court could reasonably conclude the \u201chorrific\u201d nature of Weaver\u2019s offense was reasonably related to its sentencing choice. Therefore, it properly considered that factor as an aggravating circumstance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Furthermore, contrary to Weaver\u2019s assertion, there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that her offense was horrific. Weaver argues the evidence submitted in support of her motion to recall shows her conduct was not horrific and may have not constituted gross negligence. However, in sentencing Weaver, the trial court did not have that evidence before it and therefore we need not address that subsequently filed evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In any event, assuming arguendo the trial court had received evidence at the time of sentencing showing Weaver had not planned to drive that night while intoxicated and decided to do so only after she became intoxicated when her then boyfriend pleaded with her to come home, the trial court could nevertheless reasonably conclude Weaver\u2019s conduct in deciding to drive and her actions in driving while intoxicated were horrific.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Furthermore, contrary to Weaver\u2019s assertion, we conclude the trial court reasonably considered as aggravating circumstances her continuation of driving after the \u201cnear-miss\u201d prior to the collision, her high BAC, and the presence of cocaine in her system. There is substantial evidence to support those findings and rule 4.408(a) authorized the trial court to consider them in making its sentencing choice. Although Weaver argues those circumstances were not unlike circumstances. in other section 191.5, subdivision (a) offenses, there is no requirement under rule 4.408 or 4.421 (or otherwise) that those circumstances be particularly egregious in comparison with other like offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>We conclude the trial court properly considered the aggravating circumstances of Weaver\u2019s offense in imposing the middle six-year term.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Leung, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 508 [\u201cThe middle term need not be additionally justified.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">On January 22, 2007, after the parties\u2019 briefs were filed in this appeal, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._ [127 S.Ct. 856]. We requested the parties submit, and have received and considered, supplemental briefs on the effect, if any, of <em>Cunningham </em>on this case. We asked the parties to address the question whether <em>Cunningham </em>requires a resentencing hearing in this case because the trial court, in imposing the middle six-year term, considered aggravating and mitigating circumstances not found true by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">In <em>Cunningham, </em>the court noted California\u2019s determinate sentencing law (DSL) and relevant sentencing rules \u201cdirect the sentencing court to start with the middle term, and to move from that term only when the court itself finds and places on the record facts\u2014whether related to the offense or the offender\u2014beyond the elements of the charged offense.\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p. _ [127 S.Ct. at p. 862].) Furthermore, \u201can upper term sentence may be imposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating circumstance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._ [127 S.Ct. at p. 868].) <em>Cunningham </em>concluded: \u201cIn accord with <em>[Blakely v.

Accordingly, <em>Cunningham </em>held: \u201cBecause circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt [citation], the DSL violates Apprendi\u2019s <em>[Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348]] bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.__ [127 S.Ct. at p. 868].) In rejecting the California Supreme Court\u2019s contrary conclusion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Black, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 1238, <em>Cunningham </em>stated: \u201cBecause the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>at p.___ [127 S.Ct. at p. 859].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>Weaver argues: (1) the <em>\u201cBlakely </em>waiver\u201d in her change of plea form did not waive her right to proof of aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the trial court\u2019s imposition of the middle term in the circumstances of this case violated her Sixth Amendment rights. Assuming arguendo Weaver\u2019s change of plea form did not waive her right to proof of aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, we nevertheless conclude the trial court properly imposed the middle six-year term. As she concedes, under California\u2019s sentencing laws, the middle term is the statutory presumptive term and a trial court can impose that term without stating its reasons. (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Furthermore, rule 4.420(a) provides in part: \u201cThe middle term must be selected unless imposition of the upper or lower term is justified by circumstances in aggravation or mitigation.\u201d Because under section 1170, subdivision (b) and <em>Cunningham </em>the relevant statutory maximum sentence under California\u2019s DSL is the middle term, the Sixth Amendment is not implicated when a trial court imposes the middle term. As <em>Cunningham </em>noted, only a fact that increases a sentence beyond its prescribed statutory maximum (e.g., the middle term under California\u2019s DSL) requires its submission to a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>at p. ___ [127 S.Ct. at p. 868]; <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">The fact the trial court considered the circumstances involving the offender (i.e., her personal circumstances) \u201centirely mitigating,\u201d did <em>not </em>make the lower four-year term (rather than the middle six-year term) the presumptive or relevant statutory maximum for purposes of the Sixth Amendment as discussed in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Cunningham. </em>Although the trial court weighed those mitigating circumstances against the aggravating circumstances of the offense in choosing to impose the middle six-year term, the presumptive or relevant statutory maximum remained the middle term at all times. Under California\u2019s DSL and the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Cunningham, </em>there is no \u201cshifting\u201d relevant statutory maximum, as Weaver apparently asserts, where a trial court initially considers some mitigating circumstances (e.g., which, by themselves, might support imposition of a lower term), then considers other aggravating circumstances, and ultimately imposes the middle term after weighing all of the circumstances. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s imposition of the middle six-year term in the circumstances of this case did not violate or implicate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Although we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances in imposing the middle six-year term for Weaver\u2019s section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense, we further note she has not made any attempt to carry her appellate burden to show the errors purportedly made by the court were prejudicial. Alternatively stated, assuming arguendo the trial court erred as Weaver asserts, she has not shown it is reasonably probable the court would have imposed the lower four-year term had it not so erred. <em>(People v.

The trial court sentenced Weaver to the middle term of six years for her section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense and a consecutive three-year term for the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement, for a total term of nine years.

Code, \u00a7 23558).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rather, she asserts the second alternative test applies and thereby requires imposition of only the one-year enhancement under Vehicle Code section 23558 (and not the three-year enhancement under \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)). She argues that because a violation of Vehicle Code section 23558 (the special statute) will <em>commonly </em>result in a violation of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) (the general statute), the preemption doctrine applies and requires imposition of only the Vehicle Code section 23558 enhancement<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, our review of those statutes does not support, that assertion. Vehicle Code section 23558 applies to a defendant who \u201cproximately causes bodily injury or death to more than one victim in any one instance of driving in violation of [Vehicle Code] Section 23153 of this code or in violation of Section 191.5 of, or paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 192 of, the Penal Code.\u201d Accordingly, its provisions may apply to three separate offenses: (1) driving while intoxicated and proximately causing bodily injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153); (2) gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)); and (3) vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated but without gross negligence (\u00a7 192, subd. (c)(3)). Because Vehicle Code section 23558 can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>apply, when the defendant drives while intoxicated and only <em>proximately </em>causes <em>bodily </em>injury, we cannot conclude Vehicle Code section 23558 will <em>commonly </em>result in a violation of section 12022.7, subdivision (a), which statute requires <em>personal </em>infliction of <em>great bodily </em>injury. Furthermore, our independent review of the appellate record shows it does not contain any empirical evidence proving that driving while intoxicated and proximately causing bodily injury also commonly results in personal infliction of great bodily injury. Although Weaver argues a section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense commonly results in personal infliction of great bodily injury, that offense is only one of the three offenses listed in Vehicle Code section 23558. (Cf. <em>People v. Arndt, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 393 [\u201cThe conduct triggering the application of Vehicle Code section 23182 [predecessor to Vehicle Code section 23558] will not necessarily result in the application of section . . . 12022.7.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In any event, we conclude the legislative intent of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) shows its greater three-year enhancement was intended to apply despite the potential availability of lesser enhancements. \u201cA plain reading of . . . section 12022.7 indicates the Legislature intended it to be applied broadly.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sainz, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at p. 574 [concluding former Veh.

The purpose of Vehicle Code section 23558 \u201cis to increase the potential punishment available in certain cases where an alcohol- or drug-impaired individual operating a vehicle or watercraft causes an accident which results in multiple injuries, <em>not to limit the use of another otherwise applicable enhancement </em>[e.g., section 12022.7].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arndt, supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 394, italics added.) We cannot conclude the Legislature intended only a one-year enhancement be imposed under Vehicle Code section 23558 when a defendant commits a section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense and personally inflicts great bodily injury (which conduct would otherwise result in imposition of a three-year enhancement under \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)). (Cf. <em>People v. Corban </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1111, 1118-1119 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 184] [defendant did not show the Legislature intended \u00a7 12022.95, as the purported <em>special </em>statute, to apply instead of \u00a7 12022.7, subd.

Although she notes that in <em>People v. Verlinde </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1146 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 322] we concluded a section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement <em>could </em>be imposed for injuries to persons other than the deceased victim in a vehicular manslaughter, she attempts to distinguish that case by noting in <em>Verlinde </em>the defendant was convicted of both vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)) and driving under the influence and causing bodily injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subds. (a), (b)). (Verlinde, at p. 1154.) Because in <em>Verlinde </em>the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement could have been independently imposed based on the lesser Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a) or (b) offense, Weaver argues <em>Verlinde </em>is inapposite because it involved also a \u201cnon-victim-specific\u201d offense and therefore its reasoning cannot be applied to her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">In <em>Verlinde, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement could not apply because section 12022.7, subdivision (g) precludes application of section 12022.7\u2019s enhancement provisions to murder and manslaughter offenses. We stated: \u201cThe language of section 12022.7, subdivision (g) does not limit application of the statute to this vehicular manslaughter case where, in addition to the homicide victim, two other victims suffered great bodily injury. The statutory exemption for murder and manslaughter is intended to bar imposition of an enhancement for the injuries inflicted on the homicide victim, who obviously has suffered great bodily injury. Thus, the statutory exemption prevents prohibited dual punishment for the same crime. (See \u00a7 654.) \u2018When a defendant engages in violent conduct that injures several persons, he may be separately punished for injuring each of those persons, notwithstanding section 654. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Verlinde\u2019s argument is inconsistent with a fundamental objective of our penal justice system, namely \u2018that one\u2019s culpability and punishment should be commensurate with the gravity of both the criminal act undertaken and the resulting injuries\u2019 </em>[Citation.] Furthermore, a fundamental principle of statutory construction is that <em>the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Verlinde, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1168-1169, italics added.) Accordingly, we upheld the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>court\u2019s imposition of a three-year section 12022.7, subdivision (a) enhancement for the person(s) injured other than the deceased victim of the vehicular manslaughter. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Verlinde, supra, </em>at p. 1169.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALLV\">We are not persuaded by Weaver\u2019s attempt to avoid the application of <em>Verlinde </em>to her case based on the difference that the defendant in <em>Verlinde </em>was convicted of both a \u201cvictim-specific\u201d offense and a \u201cnon-victim-specific\u201d offense. There is no logical reason to preclude application of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) when a defendant personally inflicts great bodily injury on persons other than the victim of a \u201cvictim-specific\u201d offense, but to allow its application when those other persons were injured in the commission of a \u201cnon-victim-specific\u201d offense. For example, in <em>Arndt </em>the trial court imposed a separate section 12022.7 enhancement for each of the three persons on whom the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of one \u201cnon-victim-specific\u201d offense (i.e., Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)). <em>(People v. Arndt, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at pp. 391-392.) <em>Arndt </em>upheld imposition of the three separate section 12022.7 enhancements because the defendant \u201cinflicted great bodily injury on three separate persons.\u201d (76 Cal.App.4th at p. 399.) There is no discemable reason a defendant\u2019s punishment should be less when the persons on whom he or she personally inflicted injuries were injured in the commission of a \u201cvictim-specific\u201d offense, rather than a \u201cnon-victim-specific\u201d offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Weaver does not persuade us that section 12022.7, subdivision (a) is inapplicable in a case involving only a \u201cvictim-specific\u201d murder or manslaughter offense where a person other than the deceased victim sustains great bodily injury. First, and most importantly, we note the express language of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) does <em>not </em>limit its application to a specific <em>victim </em>of a felony offense. Rather, it applies to great bodily injuries sustained by \u201cany <em>person </em>other than an accomplice.\u201d (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a), italics added.) Second, its express language also applies when the defendant personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person <em>\u201cin the commission </em>of a felony.\u201d (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a), italics added.) That language is sufficiently broad to include persons other than the victim of a victim-specific felony offense who sustain great bodily injury during the defendant\u2019s commission of that offense. Had the Legislature intended to limit section 12022.7, subdivision (a)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>application to only the ostensible victim injured in the commission of a felony offense, it could have expressly so provided. (Cf. \u00a7 12022.8 [imposing enhanced punishment for infliction of great bodily injury \u201con any victim\u201d]; <em>People v. Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 881, fn. 5 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552] [enhancement statute that expressly applies to great bodily injury to a victim, rather than a person, does not apply \u201cto persons who, unfortunately, are incidentally caught up in the events constituting the crime . . . .\u201d], overruled on another ground as noted in <em>People v. Oates </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1048, 1068, fn. 8 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 325, 88 P.3d 56].) Furthermore, we note it is generally appropriate that a defendant be subject to greater punishment for committing an offense if his or her commission of that offense causes injuries to multiple persons. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 121, 128 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 463]; <em>People v. Pantoja </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1, 16 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 492].) It is consistent with our criminal justice system to impose greater punishment on Weaver for the great bodily injuries she personally inflicted on Sigalov during her commission of the section 191.5, subdivision (a) offense that caused Mara\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">In an analogous case, the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Oates, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 1048 rejected a similar contention made regarding the imposition of an enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), which contains language that parallels that of section 12022.7, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In <em>Oates, </em>the defendant discharged a gun into a group of five people, injuring one of the persons in that group. <em>(Oates, </em>at p. 1053.) The jury convicted the defendant of five offenses of attempted murder and found true, as to each offense, a section 12022.53 allegation relating to the injury sustained by the one person. <em>(Oates, </em>at p. 1053.) Therefore, as to four of the five \u201cvictim-specific\u201d offenses of attempted murder, a section 12022.53 enhancement was imposed for the injury sustained by a person other than the ostensible victim of that attempted murder.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Oates, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 1053-1054.) On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court should have imposed only one section 12022.53 enhancement (relating to the attempted murder offense involving the person actually injured). <em>(Oates, </em>at p. 1054.) <em>Oates </em>rejected that contention, stating: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>that the enhancement be imposed as to each conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Oates, supra, 32 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1056, first italics added.) <em>Oates </em>noted: \u201cHad the Legislature wanted to limit the number of subdivision (d) enhancements imposed to the number of injuries inflicted, or had it not wanted subdivision (d) to serve as the enhancement applicable to each qualifying conviction where there is only one qualifying injury, it could have said so.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>\u201cIn several respects, the language of section 12022.53 supports imposing multiple subdivision (d) enhancements under the circumstances here. First, by its terms, the subdivision (d) enhancement applies to \u2018any person\u2019 who, \u2018in the commission of\u2019 a specified felony, \u2018personally and intentionally discharges a firearm and proximately causes great bodily injury ... or death, <em>to any person other than an accomplice.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Based on the single injury to Barrera, the requirements of a subdivision (d) enhancement are met as to <em>each </em>of defendant\u2019s five attempted murder convictions, including those not involving the attempted murder of Barrera; ... in the commission of each [attempted murder] offense, defendant \u2018personally and intentionally discharge[d] a firearm and proximately cause[d] great bodily injury\u2019 to a person \u2018other than an accomplice.\u2019 (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-4\">\u201cNotably, the parties here agree that the phrase, \u2018any person other than an accomplice,\u2019 does not mean \u2018the victim\u2019 of the underlying crime. For example, defendant asserts in his brief that the elements of a subdivision (d) enhancement \u2018require the imposition of the enhancement even if the injured person is not a victim of crime, such as if he or she was injured by a stray bullet.\u2019 Thus, \u2018[i]f there is a qualifying substantive offense, if a firearm is intentionally discharged, and if anyone (but an accomplice), i.e.,' either the victim or a nearby \u201cnon-victim\u201d\u2014a person who is injured but is not the victim of an enumerated offense\u2014suffers great bodily injury, the enhancement attaches to the offense.\u2019 In other words, as defendant explains, \u2018the \u201cany person other than an accomplice\u201d language is sufficiently indisputable to ensure the imposition of the enhancement if a person other than the victim of the qualifying felony suffers a great bodily injury.\u2019 This reading of the statute is consistent with our recent statement that, as \u2018[a]pplied to a defendant/shooter, this enhancement is arguably unambiguous: a defendant who is convicted of a specified felony [,] and is found to have intentionally and personally discharged a firearm proximately causing great bodily injury or death when committing that felony, is subject to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] It is also consistent with the fact that the Legislature knows how to limit enhancements to harm done to a \u2018victim\u2019 when that is its intent. (See \u00a7 12022.8 [imposing enhanced punishment for \u2018inflict[ing] great bodily injury ... on any victim\u2019]; see also <em>People v.

(a).) According to defendant, \u2018[n]o reported case has held that more [section 12022.7] enhancements than the actual number of injuries may be found and imposed\u2019 or that such an enhancement may be found and \u2018imposed not only on [the conviction involving] the injured victim but also as to [the convictions involving] the uninjured victims as well.\u2019 Defendant argues we should similarly interpret subdivision (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-7\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. Notwithstanding his assertions, defendant concedes that \u2018[t]here is \u201cno intimation\u201d in section 12022.7\u2019 that \u2018 \u201conly one such enhancement could be employed in any given case\u201d \u2019 where only one person suffers injury. Moreover, defendant cites no case\u2014and we have found none\u2014supporting his construction of section 12022.7. On the other hand, as defendant notes, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Moringlane </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 811, 815-817 [179 Cal.Rptr. 726] <em>(Moringlane), </em>the trial court imposed three \u2018bodily injury\u2019 enhancements, presumably under section 12022.7, based on the defendant\u2019s infliction of a single injury on one of the three people he simultaneously assaulted. Although the appellate court later held that multiple enhancements were improper, it based its decision on section 654, not on the construction of section 12022.7. [Citation.] Moreover, given Moringlane's holding in 1982 that section 654 bars imposition of multiple enhancements, it is not surprising that no reported case has considered whether section 12022.7 itself authorizes multiple enhancements under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>the circumstances here. Finally, defendant cites\u2014and we find\u2014nothing in the legislative history of section 12022.7 to support his interpretation of that statute. Because nothing supports defendant\u2019s construction of section 12022.7, his argument based on that construction fails.\u201d <em>(People v. Oates, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 1060-1061, fns. omitted,)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Accordingly, the California Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s imposition of all five section 12022.53, subdivision (d) enhancements. <em>(People v.

She apparently is concerned that the true findings on the two section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8) allegations related to her one \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction would allow a court in the future to treat her as having two prior \u201cstrike\u201d convictions.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Weaver argues: \u201cThe allegations will be used to support separate strikes under Penal Code section 667, subds.

She states her insurance company paid the victim(s) of her offense $200,000, thereby requiring an equivalent reduction in the victim restitution fine of $229,269.97 imposed by the trial court pursuant to section 1202.4.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">However, the record on appeal does not show her insurance company paid $200,000 to the victim(s) of Weaver\u2019s offense. Weaver asserts: \u201cDefense counsel submitted in the statement of [mitigation] evidence showing that Ms. Weaver\u2019s insurance company paid the $200,000 policy limit to the Sigalovs.\u201d In support of that assertion, she cites page 149 of the clerk\u2019s transcript, which is a copy of a letter attached to her statement in mitigation. That letter, dated February 24, 2005, is from David A. Delbon, an attorney apparently representing Sigalov, to Brian McCarthy, Weaver\u2019s defense attorney. In that letter, Delbon states in part: \u201cFurther to my recent telephone message, plaintiff/claimant Anatoly Sigalov has agreed to accept CSAA\u2019s policy limit of $100,000 on the wrongful death claim, and a separate $100,000 on his own personal injury claim. We are in the process of exchanging closing papers which will include a Release of All Demands to be signed on both claims by Anatoly Sigalov. Once the documents are signed and the draft is forwarded to claimant, the civil matter will be resolved. We expect to close our file within the next four weeks.\u201d It is clear from the content of that letter that the pending settlement of Sigalov\u2019s claims had not yet been finalized in writing and Weaver\u2019s insurance company had not yet paid any money to Sigalov. Therefore, that letter does not support her assertion that her insurance company had, in fact, paid $200,000 to Sigalov as a victim of her offense. Absent proof that her insurance company paid that amount to Sigalov as a victim of her offense, there is no basis on which to offset or otherwise reduce the amount of the victim restitution fine imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">In any event, as the People note, in imposing the victim restitution fine at the sentencing hearing, the trial court expressly retained jurisdiction to modify the amount imposed on application of either party (i.e., Sigalov or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>Weaver). The court stated: \u201cThe court will set restitution at this time in the amount of $229,479 subject to modification upward or downward on the application by counsel and a hearing can be held.\u201d It later stated: \u201cThe superior court will continue to retain jurisdiction to amend the judgment and to address restitution.\u201d In subsequently denying Weaver\u2019s motion to recall her sentence, the trial court stated in part: \u201cOn the limited issue of reduction of restitution based on payments by the defendant\u2019s insurance company, counsel should meet and confer to determine if a stipulated adjustment to the restitution figure is appropriate or if the matter needs to be set for hearing on that issue alone.\u201d The appellate record does not contain any evidence showing either that the parties stipulated to modification of the victim restitution fine or that Weaver properly requested, and the trial court held, a hearing on modification of that fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Section 1202.4, subdivision (f) provides that a victim restitution fine may be established, or presumably modified, by the trial court after the sentencing hearing, stating in part: \u201cIf the amount of loss cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing, the restitution order shall include a provision that the amount shall be determined at the direction of the court.\u201d That is in effect what the trial court did in this case. Furthermore, section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(1) provides a defendant with a right to a hearing on the amount of a victim restitution fine, stating: \u201cThe defendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution. The court may modify the amount, on its own motion or on the motion of the district attorney, the victim or victims, or the defendant. If a motion is made for modification of a restitution order, the victim shall be notified of that motion at least 10 days prior to the proceeding held to decide the motion.\u201d The appellate record does not show that Weaver (or the prosecutor or Sigalov) requested a hearing to modify the amount of the victim restitution fine imposed by the trial court at Weaver\u2019s sentencing. Therefore, to the extent Weaver wishes the amount of that fine to be offset or reduced by all or part of any payment made by her insurance company to Sigalov, she must first follow the appropriate procedures set forth in section 1202.4 by requesting a modification hearing and obtaining an order of the trial court on that request. She may then seek relief in the appellate court for any purported error by the trial court. We conclude Weaver\u2019s contention is premature and we need not address its substance.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Nares, Acting P.

All victims of drunk drivers are \u2018vulnerable victims,\u2019 but it is precisely because they are <em>all </em>vulnerable that Carrie Lee cannot be considered to be vulnerable \u2018in a special or unusual degree, to an extent greater than in other cases.\u2019 [Citation.] While we can visualize extraordinary situations in which a drunk driving victim might be considered to be \u2018particularly vulnerable,\u2019 such a situation is not present here, and therefore the court erred in applying rule 421(a)(3) to this case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bloom, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d at p. 322.) Unlike our case, in <em>Bloom </em>the defendant was driving his car about 50 miles per hour while other cars were traveling about 35 miles per hour and his car was, immediately before the head-on accident, traveling in the proper lane of an (apparently) undivided street. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 314.) Furthermore, testimony showed the victim in <em>Bloom </em>had sufficient time to, and did, attempt to avoid the head-on collision, with her car leaving 20 feet of skid marks on the road. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Interpreting the term \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d for purposes of rule 4.421(a)(3), in <em>Piceno </em>we stated: \u201cNo one could possibly deny the [pedestrian] victim here was vulnerable. But, regrettably all victims of vehicular manslaughter\u2014be they pedestrians, fellow drivers or passengers\u2014were vulnerable. They unfortunately were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d <em>(People v. Piceno, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1358.) In our case, the trial court could reasonably conclude that Sigalov and Mara were not just \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d but rather were particularly vulnerable because of the late-night darkness and Weaver\u2019s failure to have her car\u2019s headlights on, thereby giving the Sigalovs absolutely no advance warning of, or ability to attempt to avoid, the collision. Therefore, <em>Bloom </em>and <em>Piceno </em>do not persuade us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1094-6\"> In what apparently is dicta because the court reversed the defendant\u2019s gross vehicular manslaughter conviction on which the challenged sentence was based, <em>McNiece </em>stated the trial court erred by denying probation based on the victim\u2019s vulnerability. <em>(People v. McNiece, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1053, 1058-1059.) In so doing, <em>McNiece </em>relied on <em>Bloom </em>and its requirement that a victim be \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable for that factor to be considered aggravating and supportive of sentencing a defendant to an upper term. <em>(McNiece, </em>at pp. 1058-1059.) However, rule 4.414(a)(3) does <em>not </em>include a requirement that a victim be \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable for that factor to be considered in granting or denying probation. Because we believe <em>McNiece </em>erred by relying on <em>Bloom </em>and rule 4.421(a)(3)\u2019s language for aggravating circumstances for imposing an upper term, rather than the express language of rule 4.414(a)(3) for circumstances to be considered in granting or denying probation, we disagree with its reasoning and conclusion and therefore decline to apply it to the circumstances in this case. In so doing, we note there is a substantial difference between merely selecting an upper, middle, or lower term (as in <em>Bloom) </em>and deciding to effectively excuse a defendant from serving any prison term by granting probation. Therefore, the omission in rule 4.414(a)(3) of any requirement that a victim be \u201cparticularly\u201d vulnerable effectively (and, in our opinion, appropriately) makes a victim\u2019s vulnerability more frequently applicable in a trial court\u2019s weighing whether to grant or deny probation than when a trial court, having denied probation, considers whether to impose a lower, middle, or upper term. Accordingly, the practical effect of that difference appears to be that a trial court, in any given case, may be somewhat more inclined to deny probation if it applies rule 4.414(a)(3) as we interpret it than if it applies the rule 4.421(a)(3) standard (per <em>Bloom </em>&amp; <em>McNiece) </em>in deciding whether to grant or deny probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1095-7\"> The probation report included as circumstances favoring a grant of probation: (1) \u201c[i]mprisonment would likely have a negative effect on the defendant in that she has never served any significant time in custody\u201d (rule 4.414(b)(5)); (2) \u201c[t]he felony conviction will have adverse collateral consequences on the defendant\u2019s life, specifically on her life[-]long career goals\u201d (rule 4.414(b)(6)); and (3) \u201c[i]t appears unlikely that the defendant will be a danger to others if not imprisoned\u201d (rule 4.414(b)(8)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1096-7\"> The prosecution\u2019s statement in aggravation also listed and discussed circumstances (1) through (4), above, albeit <em>not </em>in a manner favorable to Weaver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1096-8\"> The trial court stated in part: \u201cCertainly in favor of grant of probation is <em>this young -woman\u2019s youth, </em>her lack of significant record, just one speeding .ticket and her absence of actual malice in this case], h]er genuine remorse and her ability to comply with the conditions of probation if probation were granted.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1098-7\"> <em>Cunningham </em>stated in part: \u201cIn sum, California\u2019s DSL [determinate sentencing law], and the rules governing its application, direct the sentencing court to start with the middle term, and to move from that term only when the court itself finds and places on the record facts\u2014whether related to the offense or the offender\u2014beyond the elements of the charged offense.\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p. _ [127 S.Ct. at p. 862].)
