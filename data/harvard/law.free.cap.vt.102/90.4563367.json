Pelow fired the engine which Bundy operated. The essential findings in the two cases are identical, and so need not be restated here. The commissioner held in this case, as in the Bundy Case, that the death of the deceased resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. For the reasons stated in the Bundy Case this holding was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">\n<em>Order vacated, award set aside and claim dismissed with costs.
