Wolfe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 246, 725 N.E.2d 261, and <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27, 723 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<judges id=\"b820-8\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

I concur for the reasons set forth in my concurrence in <em>Stickney v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 504, 727 N.E.2d 1286.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b820-12\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aik-dedup-1\">dissenting. I do not agree with the majority\u2019s application of <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 246, 725 N.E.2d 261. In these cases, appellants asserted one proposition of law regarding the interpretation of R.C. 3937.18(A)(2), as amended by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20 (\u201cS.B. 20\u201d), effective October 20, 1994. The court of appeals determined that the policy in question was issued on June 5, 1995, and that S.B. 20, as amended, applies to this case. The court noted that the appellant did not challenge this finding. The parties did not appeal this finding; therefore, I believe they have waived the issue. I do not agree that this court has the authority to remand a case for application of <em>Wolfe </em>when the parties have not raised the issue. A remand for the court below to apply <em>Wolfe </em>gives the appellant a second bite at the apple in the event that the policy, according to Wolfe's interpretation, was issued prior to October 20, 1994, so that the law prior to S.B. 20 would apply. This was not the issue before us when we voted to allow jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>However, to the extent that the majority believes that <em>Wolfe </em>should apply, I respectfully dissent for the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinions in <em>Wolfe, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 252-255, 725 N.E.2d at 267-269.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">I also dissent to the majority\u2019s application of <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27, 723 N.E.2d 97. The majority, without comment, merely applies <em>Moore </em>and its analysis of R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) and uninsured motorist coverage to the proposition of law regarding R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) and underinsured motorist coverage. To the extent that the majority intends <em>Moore </em>to apply to underinsured, as well as to uninsured motorist coverage, I respectfully dissent for the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Moore, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 33, 723 N.E.2d at 103.</p>\n<judges id=\"b821-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
