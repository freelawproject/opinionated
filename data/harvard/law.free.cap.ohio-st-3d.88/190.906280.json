For the following reasons, we hold that QTS did comply with this specific safety regulation and that Garaux unilaterally violated the rule. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and grant the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">QTS contends that it complied with Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-03-08(G) because it provided Garaux and Reed \u201cproperly marked equipment more than suitable for the job,\u201d Pyron told Garaux on site to use the company\u2019s equipment and not his own, and Garaux ignored the instruction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">This case is an example of what has become known as \u201cunilateral negligence,\u201d a defense to VSSR liability that has been described as applying \u201conly where the claimant <em>deliberately </em>renders an otherwise complying device noncompliant [sic, nonconforming].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. R.E.H. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 352, 355, 681 N.E.2d 928, 931; <em>State ex rel. Martin Painting &amp; Coating Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 333, 339, 678 N.E.2d 206, 211; <em>State ex rel. Pressware Internatl., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 284, 288, 707 N.E.2d 935, 939; <em>State ex rel. Hirschvogel, Inc. v. Miller </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 215, 218, 714 N.E.2d 386, 388. Unilateral negligence derives from <em>State ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 524 N.E.2d 482, in which an employer was exonerated from VSSR liability because an employee had removed a part of a scaffold that had been required by a specific safety requirement. <em>Brown </em>held that (1) employers can be subject to VSSR penalties for \u201conly those acts within the employer\u2019s control,\u201d and (2) a specific safety requirement does not impose a duty of \u201cconstant surveillance\u201d just by requiring a securely and rigidly based scaffold. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 524 N.E.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">QTS relies principally on <em>Brown, </em>whereas the other parties rely mainly on <em>State ex rel. Cotterman v. St. Marys Foundry </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 42, 544 N.E.2d 887. In <em>Cotterman, </em>an employer was held liable for violating a regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>requiring sufficient chain-sling capacity for suspending overhead loads. There, a supervisory employee was killed because he selected chains too weak to suspend a huge core. Contrasting <em>Brown, </em>the <em>Cotterman </em>court held, in effect, that this specific safety requirement imposed an absolute duty of compliance notwithstanding the supervisory employee\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Brown </em>and <em>Cotterman </em>are regularly cited for establishing the boundaries of the unilateral negligence defense, <em>Pressware </em>at 288, 707 N.E.2d at 939; <em>Martin Painting </em>at 339, 678 N.E.2d at 211; <em>State ex rel. Northern Petrochemical Co., Nortech Div. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 453, 455, 575 N.E.2d 200, 201-202; however, the defense is not actually about an employee\u2019s <em>negligence. </em>The employer instead avoids VSSR liability when \u201c[the] employee unilaterally <em>violates </em>a safety requirement [emphasis added],\u201d <em>Cotterman </em>at 47, 544 N.E.2d at 892; <em>Pressware </em>at 288, 707 N.E.2d at 939, that is, when the <em>employee </em>removes or ignores equipment or instruction that complies with a specific safety requirement. <em>Brown </em>at 164, 524 N.E.2d at 485; <em>Northern Petrochemical. </em>On the other hand, an employee\u2019s negligence in failing to protect himself from injury due to an employer\u2019s VSSR will never bar recovery because specific safety requirements exist to promote a safe work environment <em>and </em>\u201cto protect employees against their own negligence and folly.\u201d <em>Cotterman </em>and <em>Pressware. </em>Thus, the critical issue in a VSSR claim is always whether the <em>employer </em>complied with the specific safety requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Here, it is undisputed that QTS properly labeled and made available synthetic web straps adequate to hoist Garaux, Reed, and the gin pole. This is all that Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-3-08(G) required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, QTS complied with this rule and did not commit a VSSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Moreover, while appellees offer <em>Cotterman </em>as authority for holding QTS responsible for this tragic accident, the absolute duty of compliance recognized in <em>Cotterman </em>is too strict and has not been enforced for this reason. For example, in <em>Northern Petrochemical Co., </em>we found no VSSR liability when an employee died after falling out of an unsecured lift cage. Since the operating employees had been trained and warned to check that the cage was securely attached to a forklift mechanism, and the accident resulted purely from employee carelessness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>in failing to adequately inspect, we did not penalize the employer for the employee\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Mayle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 74, 711 N.E.2d 687, we found no VSSR liability when an employee died after falling off an electrical tower. Again, the employer complied with the specific safety requirement by supplying safety belts for the employee\u2019s use; the employee just never wore them; Thus again, we refused to penalize the complying employer for the employee\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">QTS did everything that could reasonably be expected to comply with Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-3-08(G). Pyron provided sufficient equipment and directly ordered Garaux to use it. Pyron did not have to rig the gin pole himself or check Garaux\u2019s work to make sure that Garaux had followed his instructions. <em>Brown. </em>In view of this compliance, QTS\u2019s actions did not constitute a YSSR or cause Garaux\u2019s death and Reed\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The court of appeals\u2019 judgment, therefore, is reversed, and a writ of mandamus is granted to vacate the commission\u2019s VSSR award.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">\n<em>and unit granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-9\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b474-10\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.
