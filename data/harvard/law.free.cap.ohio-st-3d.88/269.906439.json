This case demonstrates the hazards that exist when an attorney enters into a business transaction with a client and the reasons for DR 5-104(A). Respondent believed he was doing a favor for a person who was a client and a friend and, probably as a result of their longstanding relationship, was too informal in negotiating and documenting the real estate transfer. Most important, in a situation where the client assumed that respondent was exercising professional judgment on his behalf, respondent failed to obtain his client\u2019s consent after full disclosure. When the attorney-client relationship deteriorated, the fruits of respondent\u2019s casual approach to the documentation of the sale and the Disciplinary Rule requirements were harvested. We find a clear violation of DR 5-104(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six months. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
