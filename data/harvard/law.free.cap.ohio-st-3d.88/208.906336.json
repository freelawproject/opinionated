Because we determine that the trial court complied with the applicable provisions of R.C. Chapter 2929 and that the judge\u2019s reference to the Bible did not impair the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>In Part I, below, we demonstrate that this trial judge\u2019s particular reference to the Bible did not offend the sentencing provisions of the Revised Code. Turning to the Bible during her deliberations merely assisted the judge in weighing a seriousness factor required for the court\u2019s consideration under R.C. 2929.12, and the Code does not prohibit the trial judge from describing the nature of her deliberations on the record. In Part II, we examine the guarantees of due process in the context of a sentencing proceeding, and conclude that the judge\u2019s acknowledged reference to the Bible did not violate Arnett\u2019s due process right to a fundamentally fair sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">I. R.C. Chapter 2929</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Arnett entered guilty pleas to ten counts of rape, a first-degree felony, and one count of pandering obscenity involving a minor, a fourth-degree felony. R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b); R.C. 2907.321(A)(5). A court imposing penalties for these felonies must comply with the procedures outlined in R.C. 2929.11 <em>et seq. </em>The court of appeals noted that these provisions limit a sentencing court\u2019s discretion, and determined that \u201cthe religious beliefs of the trial judge are not a statutory factor that may be considered\u201d during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">A. R.C. 2929.11</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">In general, the sentencing judge must adhere to the overriding purposes of felony sentencing described in R.C. 2929.11. This section provides that. a sentence shall punish the offender and protect the public from future offenses by the offender and others. R.C. 2929.11(A). It also provides that .a court \u201cshall not base the sentence upon the * * * religion <em>of the </em>offender.(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.11(C). Arnett misreads R.C. 2929.11(C) to be a general prohibition on the \u201cconsideration of religious beliefs or * * * dogma\u201d by a sentencing judge. This section, however, specifically prohibits a sentencing judge from discriminating against an offender on the basis of the <em>offender\u2019s </em>religion. R.C. 2929.11(C). It does not, therefore, support the court of appeals\u2019 decision to vacate Arnett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">B. The R.C. 2929.12 Seriousness and Recidivism Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">R.C. 2929.12(A) requires the sentencing judge to consider the applicable seriousness and recidivism factors outlined in R.C. 2929.12(B), (C), (D), and (E) as she' exercises her discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing outlined in R.C. 2929.11. A catchall provision in R.C. 2929.12(A) also permits the sentencing judge to consider \u201cany other factors that are relevant to achieving those purposes and principles of sentencing.\u201d R.C. 2929.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The parties here agree that the sentencing judge properly considered the R.C. 2929.12 seriousness and recidivism factors even though it would seem that the court need not consider those factors for the rape charges. Rape carries a mandatory prison term under R.C. 2929.13(F)(2) and the statutory mandate to assess the factors arises <em>\u201c[ujnless </em>a mandatory prison term is required by division (F) of section 2929.13 or section 2929.14.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.12(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the pandering charge merits the judge\u2019s consideration of the applicable seriousness and recidivism factors before imposing Arnett\u2019s sentence. R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(a); R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">With this background, we summarize the arguments of the parties before the court as follows: Arnett contends that the Code prohibits the trial judge\u2019s acknowledged consideration of the Bible, because \u201creligious consideration\u201d does not appear as one of the seriousness or recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12(B), (C), (D), or (E), and because, he submits, the R.C. 2929.12(A) catchall provision would not embrace such considerations. The state, on the other hand, argues that the Code does not prohibit the judge\u2019s acknowledged reference to the Bible during her deliberations. The state views the judge\u2019s reference to the particular biblical verse at issue as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the judge\u2019s consideration of the seriousness factor in R.C. 2929.12(B)(1), which concerns the <em>age </em>of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We agree with the state that the sentencing court\u2019s reference to the Book of Matthew acknowledged her consideration, during her deliberations, of the societal interest in protecting children. The General Assembly specifically recognized this societal interest in the form of a. seriousness factor for the sentencing court to consider under R.C. 2929.12(B)(1). This section requires a judge, when applicable, to consider how the victim\u2019s age relates to the seriousness of the offense. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201c(B) The sentencing court shall consider all of the following that apply regarding * * * the victim * * * as indicating that the offender\u2019s conduct is more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201c(1) The physical or mental injury suffered by the victim of the offense * * * was exacerbated because of the * * * age of the victim.\u201d R.C. 2929.12(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The General Assembly thus explicitly instructs sentencing courts to consider how the age of a victim relates to the relative seriousness of an offense when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>imposing a sentence in order to conform to the overriding purposes of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Here, the sentencing judge followed the General Assembly\u2019s mandate as expressed in R.C. 2929.12(B)(1). Arnett pleaded guilty to ten counts of engaging in various sex acts with a five-year-old girl on a continuing basis and to pandering obscenity involving a minor. The testimony at the sentencing hearing amply informed the judge that Arnett\u2019s principal victim suffered exacerbated harm due to her tender years. R.C. 2929.12(B)(1), then, required the sentencing court to consider whether the victim\u2019s age made Arnett\u2019s conduct more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Code does not specify that the sentencing judge must use specific language or make specific findings on the record in order to evince the requisite consideration of the applicable seriousness and recidivism factors. R.C. 2929.12. For this reason, the sentencing judge could have satisfied her duty under R.C. 2929.12 with nothing more than a rote recitation that she had considered the applicable age factor of R.C. 2929.12(B)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 326, 715 N.E.2d 131, 134. Arnett\u2019s sentencing judge, however, helpfully supplemented the record by specifically referring to the young age of the victim and by explaining how the victim\u2019s age had exacerbated her injuries. The judge noted that \u201ca child should not know\u201d the sexually graphic details that Arnett exposed her to, and told Arnett that he \u201crobbed that child of that whole sense of growing up and who she is.\u201d These remarks confirm that the sentencing court considered the statutory age factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The judge further supplemented the record with the religious remarks at issue in this case. She acknowledged that she had \u201cturned to one additional source\u201d to help her during her deliberations, and she quoted the biblical verse to which she referred. The verse describes the seriousness of offending a \u201clittle child\u201d or \u201cone of these little ones.\u201d Matthew 18:5, 6. The court explained how this biblical verse aided its \u201cstruggle\u201d regarding the proper sentence to impose. Due to the text of this verse, and the judge\u2019s stated reason for considering it, we conclude that her reference to the Bible assisted her in determining the <em>weight </em>that she would give to a statutory factor \u2014 the age of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">This court has held that the individual decisionmaker has the discretion to determine the weight to assign a particular statutory factor. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 193, 631 N.E.2d 124, 132, citing <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 376, 582 N.E.2d 972, 978. A discretionary decision necessitates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>exercise of personal judgement, and we have determined that when making such judgments, the sentencing court \u201cis not required to divorce itself from all personal experiences and make [its] decision in a vacuum.\u201d <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 529, 605 N.E.2d 70, 84, citing <em>Barclay v. Florida </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134. For this reason, we have previously permitted a judge in a death-penalty case to refer, during sentencing, to a personal friend of his who was murdered. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">This court has also recognized that there are limits to a court\u2019s discretion when the court refers to external sources while weighing a statutory factor. See <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 31, 716 N.E.2d 1126, 1143. In <em>Bays, </em>a court of appeals engaging in a review of a death sentence quoted at length from a two-year study of two hundred sixty-seven cocaine users. Based on the authors\u2019 hypothesis concerning addiction and recidivism, the court of appeals decided that the appellant\u2019s addiction was not a significant mitigating factor. <em>Id. </em>We determined that the court of appeals improperly relied on this hypothesis because the court based its factual conclusions \u201cupon what amounted to an expert opinion, which should have been subject to adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Gardner v. Florida </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 349, 360-362, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1205-1207, 51 L.Ed.2d 393, 403-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We distinguish the judge\u2019s reference to the Bible in this case from the error committed by the court of appeals in <em>Bays. </em>In <em>Bays, </em>the court used a highly specific scientific study as a \u201cbasis for drawing case-specific factual inferences about the relation between Bays\u2019s addiction and his behavior.\u201d <em>State v. Bays, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 31, 716 N.E.2d at 1143, fn. 5. Here, in contrast, the sentencing judge referred to a biblical verse containing the same general message explicitly recognized in R.C. 2929.12(B)(1) \u2014 that offenses against children are especially serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The judge\u2019s acknowledged reference to the Bible here constituted a permissible exercise of her discretion. The judge did not <em>add </em>an impermissible factor to her analysis; rather, she <em>acknowledged an influence </em>upon her consideration of an explicitly permitted factor. Much like the judge\u2019s background, education, and moral values, the judge\u2019s insight from the Bible guided the judge in weighing the statutorily permissible age factor during her deliberations and aided her in justifying, in her mind, the lawful sentence she imposed. See <em>State v. Fox; State v. Cook, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Because R.C. 2929.12(B) requires a sentencing judge to consider how a victim\u2019s age exacerbates the physical or mental injury suffered, it would be a significant and censorial step for this court to prohibit judges from accurately describing the nature of these considerations on the record. As the state\u2019s <em>amicus </em>notes, a <em>per se </em>rule prohibiting all references to religious texts by a sentencing judge would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>amount to this court\u2019s imposition of a particular and restrictive model of judicial decisionmaking. Such a model would prohibit references to religious convictions in the oral or written justifications of judicial decisions, even though such considerations may unavoidably surface during the judge\u2019s private deliberations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sentencing scheme enacted by the General Assembly does not adopt such a restrictive model for the sentencing judge. Indeed, as this court recently noted, some statutes <em>require </em>the sentencing judge to state both the findings <em>and the reasons </em>for those findings on the record. See <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 326, 715 N.E.2d 131, 134; see, also R.C. 2929.19(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Because we find that the judge\u2019s acknowledged consideration of the particular biblical verse in this case constituted a permissible exercise of her discretion to weigh the R.C. 2929.12(B)(1) factor, we need not determine whether this specific religious verse, or whether religious texts in general, may qualify as \u201cany other factor[s] that are relevant\u201d under R.C. 2929.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II. Due Process and the Sentencing Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">The court of appeals determined that \u201c[b]y factoring in religion\u201d during the sentencing proceeding, the sentencing court violated Arnett\u2019s due process rights. We agree with the court of appeals that consideration of religious beliefs or religious texts by a sentencing judge may violate an offender\u2019s due process rights when such considerations constitute the basis for the sentencing decision and thereby undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. Nevertheless, as we explain more fully below, the biblical reference here did not result in a violation of Arnett\u2019s right to a fundamentally fair sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">A. Due Process, Sentencing Proceedings, and Fundamental Fairness</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that even a sentence within the limits of a state\u2019s sentencing laws may violate due process if the sentencing proceedings are fundamentally unfair. <em>Townsend v. Burke </em>(1948), 334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 1255, 92 L.Ed. 1690, 1693; see, also, <em>Gardner v. Florida </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 51 L.Ed.2d 393, 402 (\u201c[t]he defendant has a legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>to the imposition of sentence even if he may have no right to object to a particular result of the sentencing process\u201d), citing <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 510, 521-523, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-1778, 20 L.Ed.2d 776, 784-786.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>Townsend, supra, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the habeas corpus petition of a prisoner who had pleaded guilty to robbery and burglary but alleged that the court deprived him of due process during his sentencing proceeding. The Pennsylvania sentencing judge, just before imposing sentence, addressed the offender and recounted a list of prior offenses, remarking: \u201c1937, receiving stolen goods, a saxophone. What did you want with a saxophone? Didn\u2019t hope to play in the prison band then, did you?\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>334 U.S. at 740, 68 S.Ct. at 1255, 92 L.Ed. at 1693. The Supreme Court determined that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s facetiousness casts a somewhat somber reflection on the fairness of the proceeding when we learn from the record that actually the charge of receiving the stolen saxophone had been dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record also revealed other blatant inaccuracies in the judge\u2019s concluding comments. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that the petitioner\u2019s sentence was \u201cinconsistent with due process,\u201d because it lacked an essential requirement of \u201cfair play,\u201d since the court sentenced the petitioner \u201con the basis of assumptions concerning his criminal record which were materially untrue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>334 U.S. at 741, 68 S.Ct. at 1255, 92 L.Ed. at 1693.</p>\n<p id=\"AD-\">The <em>Townsend </em>court carefully narrowed the scope of the fairness standard that it applied, saying, \u201c[I]t is not the duration or severity of this sentence that renders it constitutionally invalid; it is the careless or designed pronouncement of sentence on a foundation so extensively and materially false, which the prisoner had no opportunity to correct * * *, that renders the proceedings lacking in due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Since <em>Townsend, </em>several federal circuit courts have recognized that reviewing courts may vacate sentences as violative of due process when the sentencing judge\u2019s comments reveal that the court imposed or enhanced the offender\u2019s sentence because of improper considerations such as the offender\u2019s race or national origin, <em>United States v. Borrero-Isaza </em>(C.A.9, 1989), 887 F.2d 1349, false or unreliable information, <em>United States v. Safirstein </em>(C.A.9, 1987), 827 F.2d 1380, or parochialism, <em>United States v. Diamond </em>(C.A.4, 1977), 561 F.2d 557, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">B. Fundamental Fairness and Religious Comments: <em>United States v. Bakker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In the principal case discussed by the parties here, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied the rules described above in .the specific context. of religious comments by a sentencing judge. <em>United States v. Bakker </em>(C.A.4, 1991), 925 F.2d 728, 740, citing <em>Gardner, Borrero-Isaza, </em>and <em>Safirstein, supra. </em>The <em>Bakker </em>court recognized that even though a sentencing judge represents \u201cthe embodiment of public condemnation and social outrage\u201d and a judge \u201ccan lecture a defendant as a lesson to that defendant and as a deterrent to others,\u201d fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tal notions of due process act as a constraint on the trial court\u2019s discretion in the sentencing proceeding. <em>Bakker, </em>925 F.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In <em>Bakker, </em>which concerned the sentencing of a well-known televangelist after convictions for mail and wire fraud, the district judge made the following statement on the record about the offender: \u201cHe had no thought whatever about his victims and those of us that do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps from money-grubbing preachers or priests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence, holding that courts \u201ccannot sanction sentencing procedures that create the perception of the bench as a pulpit from which judges announce their personal sense of religiosity and simultaneously punish defendants for offending it. * * * Regrettably, we are left with the apprehension that the imposition of a lengthy prison term here may have reflected the fact that the court\u2019s own sense of religious propriety had somehow been betrayed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>925 F.2d at 740-741.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The <em>Bakker </em>court emphasized that it vacated the sentence only because the district judge\u2019s <em>\u201cpersonal religious principles </em>\u201d were <em>\u201cthe basis </em>\u201d of the sentencing decision. (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>925 F.2d at 741. By contrast, here the judge\u2019s disclosed religious principle mirrored a sentencing factor in the Ohio Revised Code. Moreover, the biblical passage could not be said to be the primary premise for the judge\u2019s sentencing decision, as she considered various statutorily sanctioned bases. <em>Bakker, </em>therefore, does not support the court of appeals\u2019 decision to vacate Arnett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">1. The Limits of <em>Bakker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The <em>Bakker </em>court underscored its \u201cgenuine reluctance\u201d to vacate the sentence and repeatedly stressed the limits of its decision. <em>Id., </em>925 F.2d at 741. The court noted, \u201cOur Constitution, of course, does not require a person to surrender his or her religious beliefs upon the assumption of judicial office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. The court also recognized that judges occasionally misspeak, and that \u201cevery ill-advised word will not be the basis for reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741. The <em>Bakker </em>court vacated the sentence only because the judge\u2019s \u201cintemperate\u201d comments revealed that an <em>\u201cexplicit intrusion of personal religious principles </em>\u201d was <em>\u201cthe basis </em>\u201d of the sentencing decision. (Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Recognizing the limits stressed by the <em>Bakker </em>court, federal courts interpreting <em>Bakker </em>have refused to vacate sentences unless the trial judge\u2019s religious remarks create an appearance of sentencing based on improperly considered, highly personal beliefs. In a recent example, the Fourth Circuit affirmed a sentence even though the sentencing court commented on the fact that the defendant considered using his church to pass classified documents to a South Korean military attach\u00e9, and declared this behavior to be \u201chorrible hypocrisy.\u201d <em>United States v. Kim </em>(Jan. 14, 1999), C.A.4 No. 97-4606, unreported, 1999 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>12924, disposition reported at 172 F.3d 45. Though Kim argued that <em>Bakker </em>prohibited the judge\u2019s remarks, the Fourth Circuit found no constitutional violation in the judge\u2019s comment, which the judge made after deciding not to depart from the federal guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Likewise, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a sentence that an offender challenged on due process grounds when the sentencing judge spoke of \u201cpersonal considerations that [the offender] brings to me.\u201d <em>United States v. Autullo </em>(July 12, 1995), C.A.7 No. 95-1020, unreported, 1995 WL 417577, disposition reported at 62 F.3d 1419. Though the offender in <em>Autullo </em>attempted to analogize the judge\u2019s comments to those disallowed in <em>Bakker, </em>based on the judge\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpersonal considerations,\u201d the <em>Autullo </em>court determined that the sentencing judge\u2019s comments \u201cdid not demonstrate personal animus but were an expression of outrage at the great harm and tragic results that Autullo\u2019s crimes had on the youth of the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In a case where the judge\u2019s specific comments were more similar to those presently before us, a Rhode Island district court denied a habeas corpus petition when the sentencing judge referred to a biblical verse by stating that \u201cno man should take more than he is willing to give.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Vose </em>(D.R.I. 1995), 879 F.Supp. 179. The <em>Gordon </em>court determined that the sentencing judge expressed no personal religious bias of the type <em>Bakker </em>prohibited, but that the judge simply stated a generally accepted proposition that if one commits a serious crime, he or she must expect to receive a severe punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Several state supreme courts, though they cite <em>Bakker </em>with approval, have declined to vacate sentences where the judge\u2019s religious comments merely acknowledge generally accepted principles, as opposed to highly personal religious beliefs that become the basis for the sentence imposed. See, <em>e.g., Poe v. State </em>(1996), 341 Md. 523, 533, 671 A.2d 501, 505 (upholding sentence when sentencing judge said, \u201cI still believe in good old-fashioned law and order, the Bible, and a lot of things that people say I shouldn\u2019t believe anymore\u201d prior to sentencing); <em>Gordon v. State </em>(R.I. 1994), 639 A.2d 56, 56-57 (upholding sentence when sentencing judge referred to Bible by saying that \u201cno man takes more than he\u2019s willing to give\u201d); <em>People v. Halm </em>(1993), 81 N.Y.2d 819, 595 N.Y.S.2d 380, 611 N.E.2d 281 (upholding sentence for sodomy when sentencing judge referred to \u201cBiblical times\u201d and expressed his opinion about the seriousness of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Taken together, these federal and state decisions support our conclusion that <em>Bakker </em>in no way supports a <em>per se </em>rule prohibiting all religious references by a sentencing judge. Rather, <em>Bakker </em>represents the exceptional case where a judge\u2019s religious comments implicate the fundamental fairness of a sentencing proceeding by revealing that the judge\u2019s personal religious views were the primary basis for the sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>2. Applying <em>Bakker </em>to the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We agree with the state that <em>Bakker </em>is distinguishable from the present case. The sentencing judge\u2019s comments in <em>Bakker </em>revealed that he had been personally offended, as a religious person, by the offender\u2019s frauds. When he said \u201cthose of us who do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps from money-grubbing preachers or priests,\u201d the sentencing judge in effect inserted himself as a party to the case \u2014 aligning himself with the plaintiffs whom the televangelist defrauded. As the court in <em>Gordon v. Vose </em>noted, the sentencing judge in <em>Bakker </em>was \u201cexpressing a <em>personal </em>religious preference and then sentencing petitioner for violating it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 879 F.Supp. at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Here, on the other hand, Arnett\u2019s sentencing judge cited a religious text merely to acknowledge one of several reasons \u2014 \u201cone additional source\u201d \u2014 for assigning significant weight to a legitimate statutory sentencing factor. The particular passage she cited mirrored the Revised Code\u2019s seriousness factor regarding the victim\u2019s young age. R.C. 2929.12(B)(1). Much like the comments allowed in <em>United States v. Autullo, </em>and <em>Gordon v. Vose, supra, </em>the text of the biblical verse that the judge cited here reflects the general proposition that offenses against young victims are especially serious \u2014 a principle that the General Assembly explicitly recognized in R.C. 2929.12(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Arnett contends that the sentencing judge in this case \u201cconsidered the heinousness of the crime as expressed in her own religious teachings as the <em>most essential factor </em>in determining the length of the sentence to be served.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We disagree. If the sentencing judge had so relied on the biblical passage she referred to, which, when taken literally, recommends death by drowning for those who injure children, the judge presumably would have imposed a sentence much closer to the statutory maximum than the sentence she actually imposed. See R.C. 2929.14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The court of appeals determined that a constitutional violation occurred here under <em>Bakker </em>because, in its view, the Book of Matthew functioned as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d for a sentencing judge torn between a more lenient or a more harsh sentence. <em>State v. Arnett </em>(Feb. 5, 1999), Hamilton App. Nos. C-980172 and C-980173, unreported, at 5, 1999 WL 65632. Though a fair reading of the record supports the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that the judge\u2019s reference to the Book of Matthew assisted her in finally resolving her deliberative struggle, <em>Bakker </em>merely prohibits a judge\u2019s personal religious principles from being <em>\u201cthe basis </em>of a sentencing decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Bakker, </em>925 F.2d at 741. Here, the record discloses many factors that cumulatively formed the basis of the court\u2019s sentence, including the testimony and letters provided to the court on behalf of Arnett and the victim, the psychologist\u2019s testimony regarding the harm suffered by the victim, and the nature of the multiple offenses. The Bible was but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>factor, among many, that supported this judge\u2019s legally unremarkable decision to assign significant weight to the seriousness of Arnett\u2019s offenses against young victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that when a sentencing judge acknowledges that he or she has consulted a religious text during his or her deliberations and quotes a portion of that text on the record in the sentencing proceeding, such conduct is not per <em>se </em>impermissible and does not violate the offender\u2019s right to due process, when the judge adheres to the sentencing procedures outlined in the Revised Code and when the judge\u2019s religious references do not impair the fundamental fairness of the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Like the court in <em>Bakker, </em>we emphasize the limits of our holding today. We agree with the <em>Bakker </em>court\u2019s recognition of the fundamental constraints of due process in a sentencing proceeding. We also agree that a sentencing judge\u2019s religious comments may violate an offender\u2019s due process rights when they reveal an \u201cexplicit intrusion of personal religious principles as the basis of a sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Bakker, supra, </em>925 F.2d at 741. We determine, however, that no such constitutional violation occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We note that comments by a sentencing judge may implicate this state\u2019s ethical rules concerning impartiality and bias. One such rule provides that \u201c[a] judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, <em>by words or conduct </em>manifest bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon * * * <em>religion </em>* * * .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Canon 3(B)(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. We highlight this rule as a cautionary reminder; we do not imply that an ethical violation occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The Eighth District Court of Appeals referred to these ethical considerations when it determined that another sentencing judge\u2019s comments, though they did not affect the outcome of the case, went \u201cwell beyond the permissible limits of rhetorical hyperbole.\u201d <em>State v. Conner </em>(June 27, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 65385, unreported, at 11, 1996 WL 355287. In its analysis of these comments, the <em>Conner </em>court included a quotation from Benjamin N. Cardozo, which \u2014 though not a part of our holding \u2014 bears repeating here, lest our decision today be misread as a license for sentencing judges to preach from the bench:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">\u201c \u2018The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or goodness. * * * He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to \u201cthe primordial necessity of order in the social life.\u201d Wide enough in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>conscience is the field of discretion that remains.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id., </em>quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1991), at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\">. See <em>State v. Licardi </em>(Feb. 4, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 72171, unreported, 1999 WL 61003; <em>State v. Coyle </em>(Oct. 13, 1997), Clermont App. No. CA97-02-014, unreported, 1997 WL 632836. Under the reasoning in <em>Licardi </em>and <em>Coyle, </em>the sentencing judge in this case would not have been required to consider the R.C. 2929.12 seriousness and recidivism factors when imposing sentence for Arnett\u2019s ten rape convictions, which carry mandatory prison terms under R.C. 2929.13(F)(2). But, see, Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission, Quick Reference Guide (Oct. 1996), at 1; Griffin <em>&amp; </em>Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (1998) 286, Section T 1.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">. Just prior to adjudicating Arnett a sexual predator, the sentencing judge made one such rote recitation when she noted on the record that she was \u201cconsidering the age of the victim of the sexually oriented offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">. The brief of Mark Greenlee, <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of the state, discusses four possible models of judicial decisionmaking. The \u201cseparatist\u201d model would prohibit any reliance upon religious convictions both during a judge\u2019s internal deliberations and in the oral or written justifications for the judge\u2019s decisions. Under a \u201cpublicist\u201d model, which might exist in a society ruled exclusively by religious laws, a judge would always justify his or her decisions with religious considerations, even if the judge did <em>not </em>actually rely on such considerations <em>during his or </em>her deliberations. Under the \u201cprivatist\u201d model, a judge might include religious considerations during the deliberative stage, but could not make oral or written religious references in the justification stage. Finally, under the \u201cwholist\u201d model, a judge could rely on religious convictions, at least to some extent, in both the deliberation and justification stages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
