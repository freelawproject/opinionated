That exception, as set forth in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1), excludes from sales tax any transaction \u201cin which the purpose of the consumer is (1) [t]o resell the thing transferred or benefit of the service provided, by a person engaging in business, in the form in which the same is, or is to be, received by him.\u201d See Sub.H.B. No. 715, 145 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7387, in effect at that time. Thus, under the terms of that exception, BPI\u2019s purchase of employment service would be excluded from tax only if BPI\u2019s purpose, as consumer of the employment services, was to resell <em>the benefit </em>of the employment services to its customers <em>in the same form </em>as BPI received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">BPI argues that the terms of this exception are easily satisfied by the transaction at issue, contending that it resold to its customers the benefit of the employment services in the same form received. In so arguing, BPI describes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the benefit it received and sold as the completed wheel assemblies produced by the temporary workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The Tax Commissioner, however, reaches the opposite conclusion by characterizing the benefit of the service differently. Specifically, he describes the benefit received by BPI as a flexible, less costly, and more efficient work force. Construed in that manner, the benefit of the employment services was not sold in an unchanged form to BPI\u2019s customers. Rather, BPI received the benefit of those services and combined it with BPI materials and the labor of permanent employees under BPI direction and control to create the item sold. Therefore, according to the Tax Commissioner, the resale exception does not apply to BPI\u2019s purchase of employment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We are convinced that the Tax Commissioner has correctly identified the benefit of the employment services, and we therefore agree with his analysis. The benefit of the services of a temporary work force must include and focus upon its most obvious benefit \u2014 that provided by the labor itself. The actual benefit BPI realized from these employees was their contribution of temporary, flexible, and less costly labor to its work force. As explained by <em>amici curiae </em>for BPI: \u201cCompanies choose temporary labor because it affords them labor flexibility in periods of peak demand.\u201d Other reasons for temporary labor, as cited by the <em>amici, </em>include the desire to fill in for absent employees, to control headcount due to downsizing, to screen candidates for future employment, and to control benefit costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reasons such as these delineate the actual \u201cbenefit\u201d the employer receives from temporary employment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Using this characterization of the benefit of employment services, it follows that BPI did not resell that benefit to its customers in the same form. Rather, BPI added the benefit to its operations to create the ultimate product. BPI provided the temporary workers with materials and a workplace, and supervised and directed them in their job responsibilities. This, combined with permanent employee labor, resulted in the finished product. The benefit, therefore, was received by BPI and was not resold in the same form. Accordingly, the resale exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We disagree with BPI that our interpretation disregards clear legislative intent by focusing upon the \u201cservice\u201d and failing to -recognize the <em>\u201cbenefit </em>of the service.\u201d Our holding today does define the term \u201cbenefit\u201d differently than BPI advocates. But by so defining that term, we have not ignored its importance. In fact, we agree with BPI that the General Assembly included the term \u201cbenefit\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>distinguish between the service purchased and the benefit received. It sought to clarify that if a service such as landscaping is purchased, the taxpayer need not resell landscaping services to meet the exception, but need only resell the benefit of those services, <em>ie., </em>cared-for grounds. But that distinction does not necessitate that the \u201cbenefit\u201d of employment services be interpreted as the final product ultimately produced with temporary labor. Rather, our characterization of the actual benefit of employment services as the benefit inherent in the labor itself is fully consistent with the distinction created by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Nor does our holding today eliminate the resale exception\u2019s application to services. The exception remains applicable to all services where the necessary statutory conditions are met. Thus, where a taxpayer contracts with a company for a service and receives and resells the benefit of that service in the same form, the exception applies. Where, however, an employer contracts for temporary employees to come into its facility and provide labor under its direction and control, that \u201cbenefit\u201d (the labor) is not resold to its customer in the same form (labor). An important distinction exists between the two, rendering one eligible for the exception and eliminating the other from the exception\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We also emphasize that today\u2019s holding leaves undisturbed our prior decisions in <em>Hyatt Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 537, 634 N.E.2d 995, and <em>CCH Computax, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 86, 623 N.E.2d 1178. In <em>Hyatt, </em>the taxpayer purchased laundry services, received laundered linens as the benefit of those services, and resold them in that form to the customers. Likewise in <em>CCH, </em>the taxpayer purchased tax return preparation, received completed tax returns as the benefit, and resold the returns unchanged to its customers. The transactions in both of those cases fit precisely the terms of the exception and continue to do so after today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We conclude, therefore, that where a consumer contracts for temporary employees to add to its work force, the benefit of that service is the labor of the employees, not the product of their work. Because it is the consumer of the services, not its customer, that receives the benefit of the service, the benefit is not resold in the same form and the resale exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">We also reject BPI\u2019s argument that the purchase of temporary employment services is excepted from sales tax under R.C. 5739.01(E)(9). That section excludes from taxation those sales in which the purpose of the consumer is \u201c[t]o use the <em>thing transferred, </em>as described in section 5739.011 of the Revised Code, primarily in a manufacturing operation to produce tangible personal property for sale.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, in order for an employment service transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to be excepted'under this section, \u201cthing transferred\u201d would have to include employment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">To determine whether employment services constitute \u201cthings transferred,\u201d we will first consider the following definition of \u201cthing\u201d contained in R.C. 5739.01(E): \u201cAs used in division (E) of this section, \u2018thing\u2019 includes all transactions included in divisions (B)(3)(a), (b) and (e) of this section.\u201d Thus, the General Assembly specified that \u201cthing\u201d referred to only three service transactions of fifteen listed: repair services, installation services, and automatic data processing services. The General Assembly could have included employment service transactions in that definition, since employment services are one of the fifteen services contained in division (B)(3). Instead, it chose to include only those three specific service transactions. Accordingly, employment services are not \u201cthings\u201d and therefore cannot be considered \u201cthings transferred\u201d in the context of the manufacturing exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">This conclusion is supported by R.C. 5739.011, which provides guidance as to the full term \u201cthing transferred\u201d for purposes of the manufacturing exception. In division (B) of that section, the General Assembly created a list of items that are included as \u201cthings transferred.\u201d In division (C) it listed various items that are not \u201cthings transferred.\u201d Neither division (B) nor (C) discusses employment services. Rather, the only services included in the \u201cthings transferred\u201d list in division (B) are repair and installation services in (B)(ll), which is consistent with R.C. 5739.01(E)\u2019s definition of the services constituting \u201cthings.\u201d A plain reading of these two statutes, therefore, compels the conclusion that the exception does not apply to employment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In addition, we find BPI\u2019s interpretation of this statute unpersuasive. BPI contends that since R.C. 5739.011(C) contains those items that are not \u201cthings transferred\u201d and division (B) sets forth a list of items that are only <em>examples </em>of \u201cthings transferred,\u201d it was the General Assembly\u2019s intent to exclude from taxation all items and services not specifically set forth in division (C). We reject the notion, however, that any item not contained in division (C) must be considered excluded from sales tax under the manufacturing exclusion. If, as BPI insists, that was the General Assembly\u2019s intent, it could have stated as much. But there is no indication in that section that all manufacturing transactions other than those in division (C) are exempt from sales tax. Without some expression of this intent by the General Assembly, we cannot justify rewriting the language of R.C. 5739.011 to conform to BPI\u2019s proposed interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Because we see no support in the terms of the statute to include employment service transactions as \u201cthings transferred,\u201d we conclude that the manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>exception under R.C. 5739.01(E)(9) does not exclude the purchase of employment services from sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The decision of the BTA is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas and F.E.

Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, I believe that BPI\u2019s purchase of temporary employment services is excepted from the tax under the manufacturing exception set out in R.C. 5739.01(E)(9) and 5739.011.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">R.C. 5739.02 imposes a sales tax on transactions that fall within the statutory definition of a \u201cretail sale.\u201d But retail sales do not include a thing transferred primarily for a manufacturing operation. R.C. 5739.01(E)(9). In order to determine whether Bellemar\u2019s purchase of the temporary employment services to manufacture the wheel assemblies for retail sale is excepted from tax under the manufacturing exception, it must be determined whether temporary employment services is a \u201cthing transferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">R.C. 5739.01 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\"><em>(\u00cd </em>* * :{i</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">\u201c(9) To <em>use </em>the <em>thing transferred, </em>as described in section 5739.011 of the Revised Code, primarily in a manufacturing operation to produce tangible personal property for sale[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">\u201cAs used in division (E) of this section \u2018thing\u2019 <em>includes </em>all transactions included in divisions (B)(3)(a) [repair services], (b) [installation services], and (e) [automatic data processing services] of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">This court has defined the word \u201cincluding\u201d as indicating merely an illustrative list, not an exhaustive one. <em>In re Hartman </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 154, 156, 2 OBR 699, 700, 443 N.E.2d 516, 517-518. Therefore, when the General Assembly used the word \u201cincludes\u201d in R.C. 5739.01(E) to refer to services in R.C. 5739.01(B), its intent was to list some, but not all, of the services that are to be considered a \u201cthing.\u201d From an overall reading of the statute, I also believe that the General Assembly did not intend that temporary employment services used in the many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>processes be taxed. The services used to make the wheel assemblies in this case are merely a substitute for the work of regular employees. Therefore, I would find that temporary employment services should be included as \u201cthings\u201d referred to by R.C. 5739.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Bellemar used the temporary services to manufacture wheel assemblies that it sold to its customers. Consequently, pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(E)(9), Bellemar used the temporary employment services, the \u201cthing transferred,\u201d primarily in a manufacturing operation to produce tangible personal property for sale. Thus, I believe that Bellemar\u2019s purchase of the temporary employment services is excepted from sales tax under the manufacturing exception. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-5\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Apti\">dissenting. I concur in Justice Stratton\u2019s dissenting opinion regarding the applicability to Bellemar of the manufacturing exception set forth in R.C. 5739.01(E)(9) and 5739.011. I further dissent because I agree -with the Board of Tax Appeals that the resale exception contained in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) applies to the temporary employment services at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The resale tax exception excludes from sales tax or use tax any transaction \u201cin which the purpose of the consumer is (1) [t]o resell the thing transferred or benefit of the service provided, by a person engaging in business, in the form in which the same is, or is to be, received by him.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(E)(1). My disagreement with the majority is in regard to the characterization of the \u201cbenefit of the service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The only way to fairly characterize the benefit of service is to look to the finished product, <em>i.e., </em>what the service yields. The work of the temporary employees in this case yielded wheel assemblies fit for sale. The benefit alluded to by the majority, a \u201cflexible, less costly, and more efficient work force,\u201d is ephemeral at best. Bellemar is not hiring temporary employees to hang around and get paid less than full-time workers. They hire them to work. They do work. And the benefit of that work is a completed project, which is resold.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">This case is no different from <em>Hyatt Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 537, 634 N.E.2d 995. In <em>Hyatt, </em>at issue was the taxability of Hyatt\u2019s purchases of industrial cleaning services, through which its room and dining linens were cleaned. We held that Hyatt\u2019s purchase of those services fell under the resale exception, since Hyatt\u2019s guests \u201creceived the benefit of this service in being able to use clean linen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 634 N.E.2d at 998. We saw the benefit of the service in <em>Hyatt </em>to be simply clean linen \u2014 we did not look to any side benefit that might inure to Hyatt. We did not cite the economic benefit of outsourcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>laundry as opposed to having Hyatt employees do the work. The benefit of the service was the finished product \u2014 clean laundry. Likewise, the benefit in this case is completed wheel assemblies. Since Bellemar resells that benefit, the temporary employment services meet the sales tax exclusion in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1).</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-5\">Resnick and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
