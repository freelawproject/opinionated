Kreps claims that (1) the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>appeals should have entered a default judgment against appellees because they did not file an answer to the complaint, (2) he is entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Restivo and Judge Osowik to set aside orders and prevent further action because the claims between the parties exceeded the municipal court\u2019s monetary jurisdiction, (3) he is entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Restivo and Judge Osowik to set aside orders and prevent further action because of pending affidavits of disqualification, and (4) he is entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Christiansen because the case had already been dismissed. For the following reasons, we hold that Kreps\u2019s claims are meritless and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Kreps is not entitled to a default judgment against appellees because they are not in default. Under Loc.App.R. 6 of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth District, service of a complaint in an original action, other than habeas corpus, \u201cshall be made without reference to a time for response\u201d and the court of appeals, \u201cif it deems that an answer is necessary, will issue an alternative writ which will set forth the time for filing an answer or a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\u201d The court of appeals determined that no answer was necessary by <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Kreps\u2019s original action because there was \u201cno basis upon which Kreps is entitled to the issuance of any extraordinary writ.\u201d <em>Sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is appropriate if the complaint is frivolous or the claimant obviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>State ex rel. Bruggeman v. Ingraham </em>(1999), <em>87 </em>Ohio St.3d 230, 231, 718 N.E.2d 1285, 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In addition, Kreps is not entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Restivo and Judge Osowik to set aside orders and prevent further action based on Kreps\u2019s contention that the parties\u2019 claims exceeded the Toledo Municipal Court\u2019s statutory monetary jurisdiction. R.C. 1901.17. Neither mandamus nor prohibition will issue if the relator possesses an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Dannaher v. Crawford </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 391, 393, 678 N.E.2d 549, 551. Absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy at law by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Enyart v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 655, 656, 646 N.E.2d 1110, 1112. Kreps\u2019s allegation in his complaint that the municipal court lacked jurisdiction because the \u201cclaims existing between [the] parties exceeded over Fifty Million Dollars\u201d after he filed his common pleas court action erroneously consolidates the monetary claims in his wow-municipal court proceedings. The exhibits filed by Kreps with his complaint disclose no violation of the monetary-jurisdiction requirement of R.C. 1901.17 by the municipal court. Therefore, Kreps failed to allege a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, and he has or had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise his claim. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Grossman v. Mathless &amp; Mathless, C.P.A. </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 525, 528-529, 620 N.E.2d 160, 162-163 (appeal from municipal court judgment raising monetary-jurisdiction claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Further, Kreps is not entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Restivo and Judge Osowik to set aside orders and prevent further action because of Kreps\u2019s affidavits of disqualification. Under R.C. 2701.031(D)(1), \u201c[e]xcept as provided in divisions (D)(2) to (4) of this section, if the clerk of the municipal or county court in which a proceeding is pending accepts an affidavit of disqualification for filing under divisions (B) and (C) of-this section, the affidavit deprives the. judge of the municipal or county court against whom the affidavit was filed of any authority to preside in the proceeding until the judge who was notified pursuant to division (C)(1) of this section rules on the affidavit pursuant to division (E) of this section.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Stern v. Mascio </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 297, 299, 691 N.E.2d 253, 255 (writ of prohibition issued to prevent judge from proceeding on substantive matters like a contempt conviction and sentence after affidavit of disqualification had been filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The municipal court judges did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to enter their challenged orders of February 12, 1997, October 20, 1998, and May 4, 1999, under R.C. 2701.031(D)(1). Judge Restivo\u2019s February 12, 1997 entry did not rule on pending, substantive motions for relief from judgment and additional attorney fees; he only ordered Kreps to pay what he had been previously ordered to pay on the previously appealed judgment, <em>i.e., </em>he ruled on a ministerial matter. R.C. 2701.031(D)(1). And Judge Restivo\u2019s October 20, 1998 entry, which ruled on the pending, substantive motions, occurred <em>after </em>the presiding judge of the common pleas court denied Kreps\u2019s affidavits of disqualification against Judge Restivo. R.C. 2701.031(D)(1). Judge Osowik\u2019s May 4, 1999 order was also appropriate because the then-pending affidavit of disqualification was against Judge Restivo .rather than him, and it was a successive affidavit of disqualification filed by Kreps against Judge Restivo after Kreps\u2019s previous affidavits had been denied. R.C. 2701.031(D)(1) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Moreover, Kreps is not entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Christiansen. Because neither Judge Christiansen nor any other common pleas judge had unconditionally dismissed the entire case, he did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to proceed. <em>Page v. Riley </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 621, 623-624, 710 N.E.2d 690, 692-693. As the court of appeals noted in December 1997, although the court\u2019s August 26, 1997 entry referred to a dismissal, no entry expressly resolved the Pesinas\u2019 attorney\u2019s counterclaim for defamation. Kreps also has an adequate remedy by appeal to raise his claims of inadequate service as well as his erroneous claim that his federal case \u201cpreempted\u201d his common pleas court proceeding. See <em>State ex rel. Carter v. Schotten </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 89, 91, 637 N.E.2d 306, 309 (state common pleas courts have concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction over Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code federal civil rights claims); <em>State ex rel. Abner v. Elliott </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 11, 18, 706 N.E.2d 765, 770 <em>(res judicata </em>is not the basis for a writ of prohibition).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Finally, as the court of appeals correctly held, Kreps\u2019s claim for a writ of procedendo to compel Judge Skow to rule on his October 26, 1998 affidavit of disqualification against Judge Restivo was rendered moot by Judge Osowik\u2019s replacement of Judge Restivo in the municipal court proceeding. Neither procedendo nor mandamus will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 252, 253, 703 N.E.2d 304, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Based on the foregoing, all of Kreps\u2019s claims for extraordinary relief are meritless, and he has or had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise these claims. He failed to allege any special circumstances that would permit him to bypass his appellate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Wynn v. McCormick </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 420, 421, 696 N.E.2d 593. Dismissal was therefore warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In addition, for similar reasons, we impose sanctions pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5). Kreps\u2019s appeal is frivolous because it is not reasonably well grounded in fact or warranted by existing law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. See <em>State ex rel. Grendell v. Davidson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 629, 635-636, 716 N.E.2d 704, 710-711. Although in <em>Grendell, </em>we imposed sanctions upon a request, which is lacking here, S.Ct. Prac.R. XIV(5) expressly authorizes the court to impose these sanctions on our own initiative. It is evident here that this meritless appeal warrants the imposition of sanctions. Therefore, we impose sanctions against Kreps under S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5), and order appellees to submit a detailed bill and documentation of the expenses and attorney fees of their counsel that have been or will be paid by the city of Toledo, Lucas County, and/or appellees in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b598-10\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
