Therefore, we do not adopt the findings and conclusions of the board on those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Nor do we concur with the panel\u2019s and board\u2019s findings that respondent offered \u201cno data, or method to substantiate the truthfulness\u201d of his advertising claims. The record indicates that respondent was never asked about the specific claims which were part of the panel\u2019s and board\u2019s findings. We therefore reject the board\u2019s finding that respondent violated DR 2 \u2014 102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In the Maruschke matter, the panel and board should not have made findings and conclusions about respondent\u2019s failure to advise Maruschke about the potential conflict with Sajka. During the panel hearing counsel for relator requested that that count be dismissed, and no evidence at all was introduced on it. We further find that respondent\u2019s letter to Maruschke after she discharged him does not appear to have been written as a matter of continued employment, nor does the letter contain legal advice. Therefore, we also do not adopt the conclusions of the board that respondent violated DR 2-110(B)(4) and 7-104(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We do not find clear and convincing evidence that respondent\u2019s lawsuits against Jernigan or Ruppel prejudiced those clients and we therefore do not adopt the board\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to Jernigan and Ruppel violated DR 2-110(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The panel and board made findings with respect to fee agreements in the Shandor, Maruschke, and Jernigan matters. They concluded that because respondent\u2019s contingent-fee agreement with the Shandors provided for an hourly charge if he was discharged <em>\u201cwhether or not, </em>a <em>successful completion\u201d </em>occurred (emphasis <em>sic), </em>respondent violated DR 2-106(A). It also found that the execution of a similar fee agreement in the Jernigan matter violated DR 2-106(A). The board relied on our holding in <em>Reid, Johnson, Downes, Andrachik &amp; Webster v. Lansberry </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 570, 629 N.E.2d 431, that when an attorney employed pursuant to a contingent fee is discharged, the attorney\u2019s fee recovery is on the basis of quantum meruit and arises upon the successful occurrence of the contingency. The board said, \u201cIn the instant case, Respondent\u2019s fee agreement called for reimbursement <em>[sic </em>] of a sum certain, <em>whether or not successful completion\u201d </em>occurred (emphasis <em>sic).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">We agree with the conclusion of the panel and the board that the Shandor and Jernigan fee agreements violated DR 2-106(A). Both contingent-fee agreements provided for payment of an hourly rate if the respondent was discharged, and both were executed after our 1994 <em>Reid </em>decision, one in 1995 and the other in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>1996. However, we note that respondent claimed that he adopted the fee agreement as a result of reading treatises and attending seminars, that he did not enforce the liquidated damage provision unless there was some recovery by the client, and that he changed his contract as soon as he was informed that it violated the Disciplinary Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We note that respondent\u2019s fee agreement with Maruschke was executed in 1990, several years before our <em>Reid </em>decision and at a time when legal commentators may not have condemned such contracts. Since the relator presented no evidence that respondent\u2019s fee agreement with Maruschke was otherwise excessive or unreasonable, we do not find that it violated the Disciplinary Rules. Only one item of work appears on respondent\u2019s time sheets after the date he was discharged by Maruschke, and that was a letter to the insurance company asserting his lien. Respondent said that if he charged Maruschke for this letter, it was in error. We regard the matter as <em>de minimus </em>and find no clear and convincing violation of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Given the circumstances of this case, we adopt the findings and conclusions of the panel and board with respect only to respondent\u2019s contingent-fee contracts with the Shandors and Jernigan. Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six months with the entire six months stayed. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"afk-dedup-0\">F.E.
