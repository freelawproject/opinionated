Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">Appellant argues that Dr. Booth\u2019s assessment that Woodby had achieved maximum medical improvement was unconditional, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>thus, it should not have to pay temporary total disability compensation for the period from March 25, 1996 through May 23, 1996. For the following reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s contention and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 4123.56, payment of temporary total disability compensation shall not be made when, <em>inter alia, </em>the employee has reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement.\u201d However, in the past we have held that a treating physician\u2019s determination of maximum medical improvement that is contingent upon further evaluation or treatment does not necessarily indicate that the physician believes the employee has reached maximum medical improvement. See <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 640 N.E.2d 815; <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 577 N.E.2d 1095, the claimant\u2019s physician stated that although claimant appeared to have reached \u201cmaximum medical recovery,\u201d his opinion was dependent \u201cupon the results of the physical capacity evaluation,\u201d which may have indicated that the claimant might \u201cbenefit from a course of kinesiotherapy.\u201d We determined that although the doctor opined that the claimant appeared to have reached maximum medical recovery, the other language in his report \u201cappears to qualify Dr. Riethmiller\u2019s initial impression that maximum recovery may have been reached, and may be interpreted as proposing the opposite \u2014 that further improvement could not be ruled out.\u201d <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 67, 577 N.E.2d at 1098. Thus, we found that the commission\u2019s award of temporary total disability compensation was supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In the instant ease, although Dr. Booth stated that Woodby had reached maximum medical improvement and could \u201cpossibly be able to return to work in the very near future,\u201d he went on to state that \u201cI would like to have a functional compacity <em>[sic </em>] evaluation performed as soon as possible at Concord[e Therapy Group] prior to the patient returning to work.\u201d Based on this, the District Hearing Officer stated that the \u201cmaximum medical improvement found by Dr. Booth was conditional in that he had not seen the consultation report [of Dr. Dixon] and wanted a functional capacity evaluation done.\u201d Similar to the situation in <em>Jeep, </em>Dr. Booth\u2019s statement could have been properly interpreted by the Industrial Commission to indicate Dr. Booth\u2019s belief that a functional capacity evaluation would suggest whether further treatment may have been beneficial to Woodby.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Appellant argues that Dr. Booth\u2019s subsequent statement contained in his letter dated June 7, 1996, reaffirmed his opinion that Woodby had reached maximum medical improvement without qualification. However, that statement merely reiterates that Dr. Booth determined that Woodby had reached maximum medical improvement at that time. It does not clarify that his opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>maximum medical improvement was not contingent upon the completion of a functional capacity evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We find that the Industrial Commission\u2019s order supporting temporary total disability compensation is based on \u201csome evidence,\u201d as set forth in <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-7\">Douglas, Resnick, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ag7\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b306-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0M\">dissenting. Because Dr. Booth\u2019s opinion that Woodby had reached MMI was not conditional, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Unlike the physicians\u2019 reports in <em>Copeland, Jeep, </em>and <em>Eberhardt, </em>Dr. Booth\u2019s MMI finding in this case was not conditioned upon further evaluation and treatment; rather, his only condition \u2014 completion of a functional equivalency evaluation \u2014 related to Woodby\u2019s work limitations. Dr. Booth\u2019s notations reflect that he was already aware that Dr. Dixon reported no need for surgical intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Two separate bases exist for terminating TTD compensation: (1) a claimant\u2019s ability to return to the former position of employment or to other suitable employment, and (2) a claimant reaching a level of MMI. Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(B)(1). In <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E.2d 1125, 1127, this court held that \u201cin the consideration of the permanency of a disability, the commission need not determine whether the claimant could return to his former position of employment. The commission\u2019s designation of a disability as permanent relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment.\u201d Thus, Dr. Booth\u2019s conditioning Woodby\u2019s return to work on the functional capacity evaluation does not contradict his conclusion that Woodby had reached MMI. Given Dr. Booth\u2019s unequivocal opinion that claimant had reached MMI, the DHO\u2019s award of TTD for March 25, 1996 to May 23, 1996 is not supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d Accordingly, the Industrial Commission abused its discretion in awarding TTD compensation. I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-11\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
