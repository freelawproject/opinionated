Chapter 149, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. Subject to certain enumerated exceptions, a \u201cpublic record\u201d is defined by R.C. 149.43(A)(1) as \u201cany <em>record </em>that is kept by any public office, including, but not limited to, state, county, city, village, township, and school district units * * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 149.43(B) provides that \u201c[a]ll public records shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">There is no dispute that the requested information is under the custody and control of a public office. The City\u2019s Recreation and Parks Department clearly falls under the statutory definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d as set forth in R.C. 149.011(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in order to resolve the issue under consideration, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>must determine whether the information sought is a \u201crecord\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 149.011(G). If we conclude that the information is a \u201crecord,\u201d and the information does not fit within one of the exceptions in R.C. 149.43, then appellee would be entitled to the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The court of appeals held that the trial court erred when it concluded that the information sought by appellee did not constitute a \u201crecord\u201d pursuant to R.C. 149.011(G). R.C. 149.011 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\u201c(G) \u2018Records\u2019 includes any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, <em>which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The contention that the information requested in this matter does not fall under the statutory definition of \u201crecord\u201d in R.C. 149.011(G) is well taken. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the information requested by appellee is not a \u201crecord\u201d as that term is contemplated by Ohio\u2019s. Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Enright </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 610 N.E.2d 997, 999, we emphasized that \u201cnot all items in a personnel file may be considered public records. A \u2018public record\u2019 is \u2018any record that is kept by any public office * * *.\u2019 R.C. 149.43(A)(1). However, a \u2018record\u2019 is something that is \u2018created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office * * * which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u2019 R.C. 149.011(G). To the extent that any item contained in a personnel file is not a \u2018record,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>does not serve to document .the organization, etc., of the public office, it is not a public record and need not be disclosed. To the extent that an item is not a public record and is \u2018personal information,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 1347.01(E), a public office \u2018would be under an affirmative duty, pursuant to R.C. 1347.05(G), to prevent its disclosure.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) In this regard, R.C. 1347.05(G) provides that all government agencies that maintain personal information systems shall \u201c[t]ake reasonable precautions to protect personal information in the system from unauthorized modification, destruction, use, or disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The information sought by appellee was created by and is under the custody of a public office, the Department. However, the specific information requested consists of certain personal information regarding children who participate in the Department\u2019s photo identification program. Standing alone, that' information, <em>i.e., </em>names of children, home addresses, names of parents and guardians, and medical information, does nothing to document any aspect of the City\u2019s Recreation and Parks Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>United States Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Commt. for Freedom of the Press </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 749, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cas a categorical matter * * * a third party\u2019s request for law enforcement records or <em>information about a private citizen </em>can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen\u2019s privacy * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 780, 109 S.Ct. at 1485, 103 L.Ed.2d at 800. In addressing the statutory purpose of the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), Section 552(b)(7)(C), Title 5, U.S.Code, the federal counterpart to R.C. Chapter 149, the Supreme Court stated that the basic purpose of the FOIA is \u201c \u2018to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772, 109 S.Ct. at 1481, 103 L.Ed.2d at 795, quoting <em>Dept. of Air Force v. Rose </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 352, 372, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1604, 48 L.Ed.2d 11, 27. In that regard, the court reasoned that \u201c[official information that sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties falls squarely within that statutory purpose. That purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is. accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency\u2019s own conduct. In this case \u2014 and presumably in the typical case in which one private citizen is seeking information about another \u2014 the requester does not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency that has possession of the requested records. Indeed, response to this request would not shed any light on the conduct of any Government agency or official,\u201d <em>Reporters Commt. </em>at 773, 109 S.Ct. at 1481, 103 L.Ed.2d at 795-796. The Supreme Court thus concluded in <em>Reporters Commt. </em>that \u201cwhen the request seeks no \u2018official information\u2019 about a Government agency, but merely records what the Government happens to be storing, the invasion of privacy is \u2018unwarranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, 109 S.Ct. at 1485, 103 L.Ed.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 136 F.3d 1055, 1064-1065, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning to exempt from disclosure certain personal information contained in the personnel files of law enforcement officers. In <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 707 N.E.2d 931, 934, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>we relied on <em>Kallstrom </em>and exempted essentially identical information from disclosure. In <em>Kallstrom, </em>the federal court determined that disclosure of the information sought would do nothing to further the public\u2019s knowledge of the internal workings of governmental agencies. Thus, the <em>Kallstrom </em>court concluded that the release of the information to any member of the public did not serve the important public interest of ensuring government accountability. <em>Id. </em>at 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The rationale espoused in the above-referenced cases is equally applicable to the instant action. The existence of the Department\u2019s photo identification program has been well documented. It is no secret as to when the program was initiated, the purpose of the program, how the program operates, and the effect it has had in making the City\u2019s recreational facilities safer and more manageable. It is also no secret that the Department possesses certain personal information, voluntarily provided, of those children who use the City\u2019s swimming pools and recreational facilities. We fail to see how release of the requested information to appellee, or anyone else, would provide any further insight into the operation of the Department\u2019s photo identification program than that already available.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We recognize that \u201c[o]ne of the salutary purposes of the Public Records Law is to ensure accountability of government to those being governed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Strothers v. Wertheim (1997), 80 </em>Ohio St.3d 155, 158, 684 N.E.2d 1239, 1242. Inherent in Ohio\u2019s Public Records Law is the public\u2019s right to monitor the conduct of government. However, in the instant matter, disclosing the requested information would do nothing to further the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Moreover, the personal information requested is not contained in a <em>personnel </em>file. At issue here is information regarding children who use the City\u2019s swimming pools and recreational facilities. The subjects of appellee\u2019s public records request are not employees of the government entity having custody of the information. They are children \u2014 private citizens of a government, which has, as a matter of public policy, determined that it is necessary to compile private information on these citizens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It seems to us that there is a clear distinction between public employees and their public employment personnel files and files on private citizens created by government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To that extent the personal information requested by appellee is clearly outside the scope of R.C. 149.43 and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>subject to disclosure. See <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Wells </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 382, 385, 18 OBR 437, 439, 481 N.E.2d 632, 634-635.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Because the information sought herein is not a \u201crecord,\u201d as defined by R.C. 149.011(G), it follows that it cannot be a \u201cpublic record\u201d as that term is contemplated by R.C. 149.43(A)(1). We, therefore, find that personal information of private citizens, obtained by a \u201cpublic office,\u201d reduced to writing and placed in record form and used by the public office in implementing some lawful, regulatoTy policy is not a \u201cpublic record\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">However, even if we were to conclude that the requested information is a \u201crecord\u201d for purposes R.C. Chapter 149, appellee still would not be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Appellant contends that the information sought is exempt under R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(p), now (q). This section of the Public Records Act specifically excepts from disclosure any record \u201cthe release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d Specifically, appellant urges that the records in contention are protected by the fundamental right to privacy founded in the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. In <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 79, 526 N.E.2d 786, paragraph two of the syllabus, we held that \u201c[a] governmental body refusing to release records has the burden of proving that the records are excepted from disclosure by R.C. 149.43.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. James v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 168, 169, 637 N.E.2d 911, 912. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the information requested herein is a public record pursuant to R.C. 149.43(A)(1), we conclude that the Department has met its burden of proving that the information is exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox, supra, </em>we recognized a constitutional right of privacy in certain personal information contained in the personnel files of law enforcement officers. <em>Keller </em>involved a public records request whereby an Assistant Federal Public Defender sought access to all personnel and internal affairs records relating to a Miami County Sheriffs Detective. We noted in <em>Keller </em>that this information should be protected not only by the constitutional right of privacy, but, also, that there should be a \u201cgood sense\u201d rule when such information is sought. In reaching our conclusion, we reasoned that personnel files containing the names of police officers\u2019 children, spouses, parents, home addresses, telephone numbers, medical information, and similar information should not be available to anyone \u201cwho might use the information to achieve nefarious ends.\u201d <em>Id., </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 282, 707 N.E.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Our decision in <em>Keller </em>was based on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals case of <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus, supra. Kallstrom </em>involved a factual situation essentially identical to <em>Keller. </em>The federal court of appeals held in <em>Kallstrom </em>that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>officers\u2019 privacy interest in the personal information contained in their personnel records implicated a fundamental liberty interest in preserving their lives and the lives of their family members, as well as preserving their personal security and bodily integrity. <em>Id., </em>136 F.3d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The information sought in the case at bar is no different from that information prohibited from disclosure in <em>Keller </em>and <em>Kallstrom, supra. </em>The officers\u2019 personnel files in <em>Keller </em>and <em>Kallstrom </em>contained essentially the same type of information, <em>i.e., </em>home addresses, phone numbers, names of family members, and medical records, as that contained in the Department\u2019s database. As did the situations in <em>Keller </em>and <em>Kallstrom, </em>a release of the requested information by the Department in this matter places those who are the subject of the records request at risk of irreparable harm, albeit not necessarily by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Furthermore, any perceived threat that would likely follow the release of such information, no matter how attenuated, cannot be discounted. We live in a time that has commonly been referred to as The Information Age. Technological advances have made many aspects of our lives easier and more enjoyable but have also made it possible to generate and collect vast amounts of personal, identifying information through everyday transactions such as credit card purchases and cellular telephone use. The advent of the Internet and its proliferation of users has dramatically increased, almost beyond comprehension, our ability to collect, analyze, exchange, and transmit data, including personal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In that regard, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the information at issue herein might be posted on the Internet and transmitted to millions of people. Access to the Internet presents no difficulty. Anyone with a personal computer can transmit and receive information on line via the Internet. This court has long recognized that children possess certain fundamental rights, among which are the right \u201cto be free from physical, sexual and other abuses.\u201d <em>In re Schmidt </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 331, 335, 25 OBR 386, 390, 496 N.E.2d 952, 956. Because, unfortunately, we live in a society where children all too often fall victim to abuse, it is necessary to take precautions to prevent, or at least limit, any opportunities for victimization.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We do not suggest that appellee poses any threat to the safety of the children who are the subject of the records sought. There is nothing in the record before this court, or otherwise, that indicates that appellee intends any harm to these children. However, in <em>Kallstrom </em>the court noted that disclosure of personal information, even to a benevolent organization posing no apparent threat to the safety of the officers or their families, increases the risk that the information will fall into the wrong hands. <em>Id., </em>136 F.3d at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Moreover, this court in <em>Keller </em>and the federal court in <em>Kallstrom </em>were not unmindful that the release of such personal information could increase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>potential for harm to those least able to protect themselves. Those decisions sought not only to protect police officers but the officers\u2019 family members as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The case now before us is no different. Because of the inherent vulnerability of children, release of personal information of this nature creates an unacceptable risk that a child could be victimized. We cannot in good conscience take that chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We therefore hold that appellant is under no obligation, statutory or otherwise, to make available the information sought by appellee in this matter. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and deny appellee\u2019s requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">\n<em>and writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

Note that R.C. 1347.08(A) provides that \u201c[e]very state or local agency that maintains a personal information system, upon the request and the proper identification of any person <em>who is the subject of the personal information in the system, </em>shall:</p>\n<p id=\"AV1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201c(2) * * permit the person, the person\u2019s legal guardian, or an attorney who presents a signed written authorization made by the person, to inspect all personal information in the system of which the person is the subject.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">.

It is conceivable that a police agency, or any other public office agency, could create a \u201cprivate\u201d file on any citizen and that the file could contain fiction as well as fact, untruth as well as truth. Once the information in any such file is released as a \u201cpublic record,\u201d the argument would go, of course, that all the information must be fact and truthful because, after all, it comes directly from an \u201cofficial\u201d file. Once the information is disseminated and published, the damage is done.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b652-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai9m\">concurring. I fully agree with the majority opinion that the database at issue in this case is not a record, and that if it were a record it would not be public because of the children\u2019s right to privacy. <em>State ex rel.

Akron </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 640 N.E.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">It merits mention that according to McCleary, he originally sought access to the database in an attempt to recruit urban youngsters for the Boy Scouts. But, as, McCleary later said during oral argument, he became concerned that the parks department might be sharing its database with Columbus police to target unruly children. Whether that is a valid concern is undeveloped in the record, but I would caution that the children\u2019s privacy rights to the information they provided the parks department extends not just to private citizens but to other city agencies as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b652-13\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGL\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. The majority opinion. consists of two main -parts. First, the majority decides that the information sought by the relator does not meet the definition of \u201crecord\u201d in R.C. 149.011(G) and that for this reason it cannot be a \u201cpublic record\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(1). The majority\u2019s syllabus stems from this first step. Second, the majority decides that even if the requested information constitutes a \u201cpublic record,\u201d the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion is nonetheless exempt from disclosure under former R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(p), now (q). Though I agree that the decisional law of this court leads to the conclusion that the names, addresses, telephone numbers, family information, and medical records of the children enrolled in the city\u2019s database are exempt from disclosure in this case, I write to address concerns raised by both steps of the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The majority could have resolved this case solely on the basis of its second step, by applying the R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(q) exemption for records protected from public disclosure by state or federal law. Instead, the majority takes its first step, and creates new syllabus law that arguably restricts the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d in a manner that could undermine the disclosure-oriented purpose of the Public Records Act in future cases. See <em>State ex rel. The Miami Student v. Miami Univ. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 680 N.E.2d 956, 959 (\u201cinherent in R.C. 149.43 is the fundamental policy of promoting open government, not restricting it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">I do not find that the applicable precedent warrants this potentially restrictive step. Though the majority relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox </em>and the Sixth Circuit case <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus, </em>both of these cases were decided on the basis of the privacy exemption to the Public Records Act. Neither case went so far as to say that the requested information could never fit the definition of a \u201cpublic record.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 707 N.E.2d 931, 934; <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 136 F.3d 1055, 1059. <em>Kallstrom, </em>especially, calls into question the breadth of the majority\u2019s syllabus. There, the Sixth Circuit expressly found that \u201cthere may be situations in which the release of * * * personal information might further the public\u2019s understanding of the workings of its * * * agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065. The majority\u2019s syllabus contradicts this aspect of <em>Kallstrom </em>by declaring that \u201cpersonal information\u201d can never meet the definition of \u201cpublic record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">I also question the scope of the majority\u2019s second step, where the majority applies the exemption from R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(q). I have voiced a similar concern before. See <em>Keller, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 282-284, 707 N.E.2d at 934-935 (Cook, J., dissenting). In <em>Keller, </em>I concluded that the constitutional right to privacy did not necessarily exempt from disclosure the <em>entire contents of </em>the requested personnel files and investigative reports. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 707 N.E.2d at 935. Here again, I am unpersuaded that the entire contents of the city\u2019s electronic database necessarily comes within the applicable exemption. For example, the database likely includes a template upon which the appropriate data is entered. It would seem that the <em>questions asked </em>by the agency on such a template, unadorned by personal responses, would fit the definition of \u201crecord\u201d \u2014 but not the constitutional privacy exemption in R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(q) \u2014 and would, therefore, be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>disclosure. This court has previously held that exempt information can be redacted from nonexempt records so that the nonexempt portions remain subject to disclosure. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. WLWT-TV5 v. Leis </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 357, 673 N.E.2d 1365; <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 498, 589 N.E.2d 24, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Though I agree with the majority that the names, addresses, phone numbers, family information, and medical information of the children registered in the city\u2019s identification database are exempt from disclosure under this court\u2019s decisional law in <em>Keller v. Cox, </em>I do not join the syllabus, and I am not convinced that the entire contents of the city\u2019s electronic database are exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(q).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
