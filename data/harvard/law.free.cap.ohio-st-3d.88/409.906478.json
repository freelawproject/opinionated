Fultz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 631 N.E.2d 1057, based on the lack of reference to the Anderson vocational report in the commission\u2019s order. <em>Fultz, </em>however, does not apply. <em>Fultz </em>applies only where the disputed PTD order lists the evidence <em>considered </em>and omits a report from that list. In such a case, the evidence omitted is presumed to have been ignored. Where, as here, the commission lists only the evidence relied upon, omission does not raise the presumption that the evidence was overlooked. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>As we explained in <em>State ex rel. Buttolph v. Gen. Motors Corp., Terex Div. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 73, 77, 679 N.E.2d 702, 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u201cAlthough the commission is required to consider all evidence properly before it, it is not required to list each piece of evidence that it considered in its order. Under <em>[State ex rel.] Mitchell [v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 483-484, 6 OBR 531, 534, 453 N.E.2d 721, 724], * * * the commission is required to enumerate in its order <em>\u2018only </em>that evidence which has been <em>relied upon </em>to reach their conclusion * * (Emphasis added.) * * * There is no requirement that the commission list all evidence considered. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cNor does <em>Fultz </em>impose such a requirement. <em>Fultz </em>holds, in effect, merely that if the commission unnecessarily endeavors to enumerate the evidence considered, it must appear from its order that <em>all </em>evidence was given consideration. Thus, if the commission lists only the evidence <em>relied upon, </em>without any attempt to enumerate the evidence <em>considered Fultz </em>does not apply. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\u201cIn the case <em>sub judice, </em>the commission\u2019s June 24, 1993 order listed only the evidence relied upon. No effort was made to list the evidence considered. Thus, <em>Fultz </em>is inapplicable, and the claimant\u2019s argument must fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We reached the same conclusion in <em>State ex rel. Lovell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 250, 658 N.E.2d 284. There, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">\u201cThe present case and <em>Fultz </em>are distinguishable. Unlike <em>Fultz, </em>the present order did not unnecessarily enumerate the evidence considered. It listed only the evidence on which the order was based. Therefore, the presumption of regularity controls and consideration of claimant\u2019s deposition must be presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 658 N.E.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">In this case, the commission listed only the medical evidence on which it relied. <em>Fultz </em>does not, therefore, control.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Claimant also proposes that the commission\u2019s treatment of his age warrants a return of the cause for further consideration. The commission concedes that it mentioned claimant\u2019s age only in passing, but argues that the defect does not compel a return of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Claimant relies on <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 414, 662 N.E.2d 364, in which we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">\u201c[The commission has a] responsibility to affirmatively address the age factor. It is not enough for the commission just to acknowledge claimant\u2019s age. It must discuss age in conjunction with the other aspects of the claimant\u2019s individual profile that may lessen or magnify age\u2019s effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 662 N.E.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">Since that time, we have declared that the absence of an age discussion is not necessarily a fatal flaw, nor does it, in some cases, even compel a return of the cause. In <em>State ex rel. Blue v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 466, 683 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>N.E.2d 1131 \u2014 relied on by both the commission and the court of appeals \u2014 we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u201cAs another <em>Noll </em>flaw, claimant assails the commission\u2019s cursory mention of his age. While the commission did not \u2018discuss\u2019 this factor, that flaw, in this instance, should not be deemed fatal. Claimant was fifty-seven when permanent total disability compensation was denied. While not a vocational asset, claimant\u2019s age is also not an insurmountable barrier to re-employment. If claimant\u2019s other vocational factors were all negative, further consideration of his age would be appropriate, since age could be outcome-determinative \u2014 the last straw that could compel a different result. All of claimant\u2019s other vocational factors are, however, positive. A claimant may not be granted permanent total disability compensation due solely to his age. Therefore, even in the absence of detailed discussion on the effects of claimant\u2019s age, the commission\u2019s explanation satisfies <em>Noll.\u201d Id. </em>at 469-470, 683 N.E.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Claimant responds that <em>Blue </em>did not overrule <em>Moss </em>and did not, therefore, eliminate the commission\u2019s responsibility to affirmatively discuss age. This is true, but claimant misses the point. The question is not whether the commission has such a duty, but rather what happens when the commission falls short of this duty. <em>Blue </em>indicates that where the claimant\u2019s other vocational factors are favorable, a return of the cause is not a given.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In this case, claimant\u2019s other vocational factors are favorable. Like the claimant in <em>Blue, </em>our claimant is a high school graduate. Both claimants, moreover, received extensive additional schooling in highly demanding areas\u2014 Blue as a certified electrician and our claimant as a paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Therefore, consistent with <em>Blue, </em>we decline to return the cause for further consideration, and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b692-10\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A2W\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b692-11\">Resnick, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b692-12\">Alice Robie Resnick, J., dissenting.
