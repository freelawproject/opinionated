Ferreri </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 649, 710 N.E.2d 1107. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ferreri </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1245, 722 N.E.2d 88, we declined to rule on respondent\u2019s December 9, 1999 motion for reinstatement until the resolution of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Now, in this proceeding, we adopt the findings and conclusions of the board. However, respondent\u2019s conduct warrants a sanction more severe than the public reprimand. Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months and concurrently suspended, without pay, from his position as judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, for six months with the suspensions deemed to have commenced on December 9, 1999.
