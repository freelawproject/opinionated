The commission and Sheppard rely on the emphasis in the second paragraph to argue that LTV Steel has not rebutted the presumption of notice receipt arising under the \u201cmailbox rule.\u201d We agree with the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Employers and their representatives are entitled to receive notice from the commission under R.C. 4123.522, but that right is not self-executing. As the court of appeals found, the party alleging the failure to receive notice must first prove that (1) the failure of notice was due to circumstances beyond the party\u2019s or the party\u2019s representative\u2019s control, (2) the failure of notice was not due to the party\u2019s or the party\u2019s representative\u2019s fault or neglect, and (3) neither the party nor the party\u2019s representative had prior actual knowledge of the information contained in the notice. <em>Weiss v. Ferro Corp. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 178, 180, 542 N.E.2d 340, 342. Only if the commission makes these findings does the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>party become unconditionally entitled to what amounts to a <em>second </em>notice of a commission order. This second \u201creconstituted\u201d notice actually comes <em>from the commission </em>upon the determination that the moving party has rebutted the mailbox-rule presumption and that it is the one from which the new twenty-one-day appeal time is activated. Thus, when the moving party sustains its burden of proof, the effect is that the party is not \u201cdeemed\u201d to have received notice until the commission makes the determination that the party did not receive notice of the order initially and the party receives notice of this determination. <em>Id. </em>at 182-183, 542 N.E.2d at 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The next question is whether LTV Steel sustained its burden of proof. Admittedly, some evidence in this record suggests that Sheppard might have fabricated the stamped order that the commission cited as evidence of LTV Steel\u2019s actual knowledge prior to October 16, 1995. On the other hand, Sheppard explained that he had taken the order to his employer because LTV Steel had previously alleged a failure of notice, and the commission evidently believed his explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The commission is the exclusive evaluator of weight and credibility, and as long as some evidence supports the commission\u2019s decision, reviewing courts must defer to its judgment. <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 376, 658 N.E.2d 1055, 1058. Here, the commission credited Sheppard\u2019s evidence, which is all that is necessary to sustain its decision. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Accordingly, the court of appeals properly found no abuse of discretion and denied a writ of mandamus to vacate the commission\u2019s denial of R.C. 4123.522 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
