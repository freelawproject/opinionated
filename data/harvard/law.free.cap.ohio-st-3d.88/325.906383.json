Cicirella </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 544, 545, 715 N.E.2d 1131, 1132. Given respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive related to his neglect, relatively isolated nature of his neglect, eventual cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, and remorse, a less severe sanction is appropriate. See, <em>e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 316, 321-322, 720 N.E.2d 525, 529-530, fn. 1 and 2, and Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, Proposed Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings, Section 10, Guidelines for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Ohio Official Reports, Nov. 22, 1999 Advance Sheets xli, xliv-xlv, setting forth appropriate mitigating factors to consider in imposing sanctions.
