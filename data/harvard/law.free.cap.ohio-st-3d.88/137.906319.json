For the reasons that follow, we answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">As a threshold matter, it is clear that we must, as a matter of law, accept all of the allegations of appellants\u2019 complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 532 N.E.2d 753, 756. Further, in <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u201cIn order for a court to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Civ.R.12(B)(6)), it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">This case involves the annexation of land to a municipal corporation upon petition by a majority of the owners of real estate in the territory proposed for annexation. Ohio\u2019s statutory procedure for annexation is set forth in R.C. Chapter 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">R.C. 709.02 provides that owners of real estate adjacent to a municipal corporation may apply for such territory to be annexed by filing a petition with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the territory is located. Not less than sixty days after a petition for annexation is filed with the commissioners, the commissioners must hold a public hearing. R.C. 709.031 and 709.032.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the commissioners must approve or deny the petition based upon factors contained in R.C. 709.033.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the petition is approved, the commissioners must deliver the petition and a certified transcript of the proceedings to the auditor or clerk of the municipal corporation. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>709.033. Thereafter, the auditor or clerk is required to present the petition and the transcript to the legislative authority of the municipal corporation. R.C. 709.04. The legislative authority then accepts or rejects the application for annexation by resolution or ordinance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">R.C. 709.07(A) provides that a person may file a petition in the court of common pleas for an injunction preventing the auditor or clerk from presenting the annexation petition and other papers to the legislative authority. The trial court may issue an injunction if the petitioner sets forth facts sufficient to demonstrate that, among other things, an error existed in the proceedings before the commissioners or that their decision was unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The court of appeals did not address appellants\u2019 contentions that the emergency ordinances passed by city council on February 19, 1998 were contrary to law and therefore void. Instead, the court of appeals, relying on <em>Garverick v. Hoffman </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 74, 52 O.O.2d 371, 262 N.E.2d 695, and <em>State ex rel. Springfield Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Davis </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 108, 2 OBR 658, 443 N.E.2d 166, held that appellants\u2019 contentions were moot because they failed to seek an injunction prior to the passage of the emergency ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">However, we believe that, given the procedural posture of the case at bar, the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>Garverick </em>and <em>Davis </em>was misplaced. In both <em>Garverick </em>and <em>Davis, </em>this court noted that the parties challenging the legislation at issue accepting annexation failed to take advantage of available remedies to stay proceedings before the legislation was passed. Thus, because the parties in <em>Garverick </em>and <em>Davis </em>did not avail themselves of such remedies, any subsequent challenge seeking to enjoin the enacted legislation was moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">However, the situation in the case at bar is substantially different from what occurred in both <em>Garverick </em>and <em>Davis. </em>Unlike the parties in <em>Garverick </em>or <em>Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>here, appellants clearly did not have an opportunity to seek an injunction prior to the adoption of the ordinance accepting annexation. This is true because the act of accepting the annexation by emergency ordinance is the very action that appellants are challenging.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Appellants contend that R.C. 709.10 and Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution prohibit a municipality from accepting annexation applications through passage of emergency legislation. R.C. 709.10 sets forth the date that annexation takes effect after an ordinance accepting annexation is passed. Appellants contend that there is an irreconcilable conflict between R.C. 709.10 and language in R.C. 731.30 regarding the effective date of an emergency ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">R.C. 709.10 provides that \u201cannexation shall become effective thirty days after the passage of the resolution or ordinance * * * accepting annexation, provided that if the resolution or ordinance is subjected to a referendum, the annexation, if approved by the electors, shall become effective thirty days after such approval.\u201d R.C. 731.30 provides that \u201cemergency ordinances * * * shall go into immediate effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Appellants claim that, because R.C. 709.10 expressly provides for a thirty-day delay between the date that an annexation ordinance is passed and the date that the annexation goes into effect, municipalities are prohibited from approving annexation applications by emergency ordinances because such legislation takes effect immediately in accordance with R.C. 731.30. In this regard, appellants contend that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 709.10 prohibit municipalities from circumventing referendums by accepting annexation applications by emergency ordinances. In support of their position, appellants rely on <em>Tamele v. Brinkman </em>(1972), 30 Ohio Misc. 49, 59 O.O.2d 292, 284 N.E.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In <em>Tamele, </em>the court determined that a conflict existed between R.C. 709.10 and 731.30 with respect to the effective date of the ordinance. The court determined that the conflict was irreconcilable and that R.C. 709.10, as a special provision relating to annexation, prevailed over R.C. 731.30, a general provision relating to ordinances. Thus, the court in <em>Tamele </em>held that R.C. 709.10 creates an exception to R.C. 731.30 and prevents municipalities from accepting annexation petitions by means of emergency ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">However, we agree with appellee that the <em>Tamele </em>court erred in finding that R.C. 709.10 and 731.30 are irreconcilable. We note that R.C. 1.51 provides that, when possible, courts should construe conflicting provisions so that effect is given to both. We find that R.C. 709.10 and 731.30 can coexist, <em>ie., </em>an emergency ordinance accepting annexation becomes effective immediately in accordance with R.C. 731.30 but citizens living in the area annexed do not secure rights and privileges until thirty days thereafter in accordance with R.C. 709.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Appellants contend that giving effect to both statutes would lead to absurd results because the sole reason that the General Assembly included the language in R.C. 709.10 providing for a thirty-day delay in the effectiveness of annexations was to provide time for filing referendum petitions. Appellants, however, overlook the fact that R.C. 709.10 also provides for a thirty-day delay in the effectiveness of an annexation if the referendum is exercised and the ordinance is accepted. Specifically, R.C. 709.10 provides that \u201cif the resolution or ordinance is subjected to a referendum, the annexation, if approved by the electors, shall become effective thirty days after such approval.\u201d If the delay were intended simply to allow time for filing a referendum petition then there would be no need for a thirty-day delay once the voters approved the annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Therefore, we believe that the General Assembly had additional reasons for providing for a thirty-day delay in the effectiveness of annexations. We believe that the delay .set forth in R.C. 709.10 provides time for the finalization of the annexation, see R.C. 709.06,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also allows time for the municipality to arrange for extension of its services to the newly annexed area, <em>e.g., </em>garbage collection, police patrol, fire protection, water, and sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>If the General Assembly had intended, as appellants suggest, to prohibit municipalities from passing annexation applications by means of emergency ordinances, it would have stated so in the statutory procedures for annexation. However, no such language exists in R.C. 709.10, or anywhere in R.C. Chapter 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Appellants also contend that Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution supports their position. In this regard, appellants argue that R.C. 709.10 must be interpreted as an exception to R.C. 731.30 to preserve the right of referendum. Again, we disagree. Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThe initiative and referendum powers are hereby reserved to the people of each municipality on all questions which such municipalities may now or hereafter be authorized by law to control by legislative action; such powers shall be exercised in the manner now or hereafter provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Although Section If, Article II expressly provides residents of a municipality with the power to subject ordinances to referendum, the constitutional section also explicitly states that <em>\u201csuch powers shall be exercised in the manner now or hereafter provided by law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) To that end, R.C. 731.29 provides that \u201c[a]ny ordinance or other measure passed by the legislative authority of a municipal corporation shall be subject to the referendum except as provided by section 731.30 of the Revised Code.\u201d Further, R.C. 731.30 states that \u201cemergency ordinances or measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety in such municipal corporation, <em>shall go into immediate effect.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Clearly, R.C. 731.29 and 731.30, which preclude referendum of properly adopted emergency legislation, do not contravene the rights afforded to citizens under Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the enactment of emergency legislation by a municipality accepting an application for annexation of real estate is not prohibited by R.C. 709.10 or Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Moreover, in accordance with R.C. 731.29 and 731.30, emergency legislation adopted by a municipality is not subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion and dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint. Therefore, albeit for different reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

In <em>Garverick </em>this court stated that \u201cevery wrong decision, even by an administrative body, is not void as being beyond the so-called jurisdiction of the tribunal, even though voidable by proper judicial process. Logic compels the conclusion that this is true where a specifically prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>course of immediate judicial review or judicial examination is provided within the same act, for the relief of those persons claimed to be aggrieved by illegal or improper action of an administrative tribunal, especially where such persons fail to take advantage of the specific judicial review or examination so provided. [Citation omitted.] That is the situation which prevailed in this case, and was the basis for the conclusion by the Court of Appeals that the case is moot.

First, under Civ.R. 62(B), a stay was available upon request from the court of common pleas which would have prevented this cause from becoming moot. Second, a <em>timely </em>stay under the provisions of App.R. 7 could have been sought from the court of appeals. Neither course, however, was pursued despite the abundance of precedent which compels us to agree with the court of appeals that this action was rendered moot on June 28, 1982, the date city council adopted Ordinance No. 415-1982, accepting the annexation.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that property may be annexed through \u201cemergency\u201d legislation not subject to a referendum. I believe that allowing such a process deprives Ohio citizens of their right to a referendum provided under Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">This case presents a clear example of how such an interpretation can lead to an abuse of this important right. In this case, the Board of Commissioners of Madison County had approved two petitions annexing land to the city of London and the London City Counsel passed two ordinances accepting the annexations. Referendum petitions were timely filed. The city of London then repealed the two annexation ordinances, and passed them again as \u201cemergency legislation,\u201d thereby circumventing the referendum attempt. It is difficult for me to imagine a more deliberate attempt.to thwart a constitutional right. I fear that the majority\u2019s approval of this procedure will provide a road map to each municipality in the future to avoid referendums when they have been filed, as we set forth no guidelines or exceptions for allowing such circumvention but rather grant wholesale approval to the emergency process.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">I believe that R.C. 709.10, as a special provision relating to annexation, clearly controls over R.C. 731.30, a general provision relating to ordinances. See <em>Tamele v. Brinkman </em>(1972), 30 Ohio Misc. 49, 53, 59 O.O.2d 292, 294, 284 N.E.2d 210, 213. Therefore, I believe that R.C. 709.10 allows voters time to vote on a referendum even in the face of emergency legislation to annex property. <em>Navarre v. Massillon </em>(Aug. 4, 1997), Stark App. No. 96-CA-0426, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">R.C. 731.30 allows emergency measures \u201cnecessary for the immediate preservation of the <em>public peace, health, or safety </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Appellee, the city of London, presented no evidence as to why an emergency ordinance was necessary, nor can I envision any scenario where it would be. The process of land development and transfer are slow and deliberate events, sometimes taking years. What scenario could possibly be such a dire emergency that it cannot wait an additional thirty days?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">R.C. 709.10 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u201cThe annexation shall become effective thirty days after the passage of the resolution or ordinance by the legislative authority of the municipal corporation accepting annexation, provided that if the resolution or ordinance is subjected to a referendum, the annexation, if approved by the electors, shall become effective thirty days after such approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>There is nothing in this statute that speaks to emergency legislation. To allow R.C. 731.30 to trump R.C. 709.10 violates Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cThe initiative and referendum powers are hereby reserved to the people of each municipality on all questions which such municipalities may now or hereafter be authorized by law to control by legislative action; such powers shall be exercised in the manner now or hereafter provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">I do not believe that the General Assembly can use the phrase \u201cprovided by law\u201d to circumvent or abrogate the constitutional right to referendum afforded in Section If, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Nor do I believe that the General Assembly intended R.C. 731.30 to be used to do so. The right of referendum \u201creserved to the people of each municipality\u201d is mere illusion if every time a referendum petition challenging an annexation is filed, a municipality can repeal the annexation legislation and pass identical \u201cemergency\u201d legislation, free from the reach of the referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">As the court in <em>Navarre </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u201c[0]ne of the most inviolate rules of any court is to construe statutes in such a manner as to avoid foreclosing the rights of voters to make their will known to their legislators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The majority forecloses that right by its judgment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
