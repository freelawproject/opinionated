Herron claims it is the workers\u2019 compensation test set forth in R.C. 4123.01(C), so that immunity attaches when the coemployee could have obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits if he had been injured. Donnelly claims that the appropriate test is whether, apart from the workers\u2019 compensation statute, the coemployee\u2019s acts would have rendered the employer vicariously liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Professor Larson summarizes the law in this area as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">\u201cIt must be observed that the immunity attaches to the coemployee only when the coemployee is acting in the course of employment. This is consistent with the justification for the immunity just described, since the coemployee\u2019s employment status does not increase the risk of his causing nonindustrial injuries to his or her fellow-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">\u201cThe commonest question that arises in these cases is: which test of \u2018course of employment\u2019 applies? Is it the workers\u2019 compensation test, or the vicarious liability test? The answer may be dictated by the wording of the immunity clause itself. In California, for example, under the statutory phrase \u2018acting within the scope of his employment,\u2019 suit is barred against the coemployee only if at the time of the injury he or she was actively engaged in some service for the employer. Accordingly, it can readily happen in California \u2014 indeed has happened \u2014 that in a marginal course of employment situation an employee will be held to have been sufficiently within the course of employment to receive workers\u2019 compensation, but not sufficiently actively engaged in service for his or her employer to enjoy the immunity from suit conferred by the California Labor Code. Parking lot accidents are a familiar example of this marginal category, and in one such case, an employee who was struck by a coemployee\u2019s automobile after work on the employer\u2019s parking lot was held not barred from suing the coemployee, although the coemployee had actually been awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits as for an injury in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">\u201cSouth Carolina, Nevada and Texas also have adopted the common-law test of scope of employment, as when in parking lot cases they have ruled that a tort action against the tortfeasor employee was not barred because under the circumstances the employer could not have been held liable in tort for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">\u201cThe more satisfactory test, unless expressly ruled out by statute, is that adopted by Illinois, New Jersey, Kentucky, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Florida, which simply use the regular workers\u2019 compensation course of employment standard for this purpose. After all, there are troubles and complications enough administering one course of employment test under the act, without adding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>second. By adopting the compensation test, a court has at hand a ready-made body of cases with which to dispose of most borderline situations. There is something mildly pathetic about the statement of a lower New York court, confronted with a run-of-the-mill going-and-coming-on-the-premises case, when it felt it could not say \u2018that merely being on company premises but still in their automobiles, they had resumed their employment. At what precise point ... short of \u201cpunching in\u201d may be difficult of definition or determination.\u2019 The determination would not be in the least difficult if the court merely followed the well-established going-and-coming rule.\u201d (Footnotes omitted and ellipsis <em>sic.) </em>6 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1999) 111-12 to 111.14, Section 111.03[3]. See, also, Annotation, Right to Maintain Direct Action Against Fellow Employee for Injury or Death Covered by Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1968), 21 A.L.R.3d 845, 1968 WL 15836.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In <em>Caygill v. Jablonski </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 807, 818, 605 N.E.2d 1352, 1359, the authority upon which Donnelly primarily relies, the court of appeals held-that a coemployee is not immune from tort liability under R.C. 4123.741, where, at the time of injury, the coemployee was engaged in horseplay disconnected from his employment. However, in determining whether the tortfeasor-coemployee\u2019s actions were employment-related, the court relied on \u201ccases dealing with * * * the rule and rationale pertaining to whether the <em>injured employee </em>is entitled to [workers\u2019] compensation when engaged in horseplay.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>78 Ohio App.3d at 816, 605 N.E.2d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In fact, the <em>Caygill </em>court relied on <em>Puckett v. Miller </em>(App.1980), 19 O.O.3d 349, 350-351, for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[i]f the employee who commits the tort is in a position and engaged in an activity which, were he the injured party, would be \u201cin the course of his employment\u201d then he is an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in R.C. 4123.01 and is absolved of liability by R.C. 4123.741.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>78 Ohio App.3d at 817, 605 N.E.2d at 1358. In <em>Puckett, </em>the court held that a coemployee is immune from tort liability under R.C. 4123.741, where, at the time of injury, the coemployee was parking his car in the employer\u2019s parking lot before his own work shift began. Thus, although well reasoned, <em>Caygill </em>is not supportive of Donnelly\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Moreover, R.C. 4123.741 does not allow for the scope of employment test suggested by Donnelly. The definition of \u201cemployee\u201d set forth in R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(a), as \u201c[e]very person in the service of\u2019 a qualifying employer, is equally applicable to both employees who form the subject of R.C. 4123.741. Thus, nothing more is required of the employee seeking immunity to be \u201cin the service of\u2019 the employer than is required of the injured employee in obtaining compensation coverage. In addition, any employee who seeks workers\u2019 compensation benefits must be in the service of a qualifying employer, and if we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>that a coemployee is not in the service of a qualifying employer while driving in the employer\u2019s parking lot on his way to and from work, we would put in serious jeopardy the rights of an entire class of injured claimants who seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In <em>Marlow v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 18, 39 O.O.2d 11, 225 N.E.2d 241, syllabus, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u201cAn employee who,, on his way from the fixed situs of his duties after the close of his work day, is injured in a collision of his automobile and that of a fellow employee occurring in a parking lot located adjacent to such situs of duty and owned, maintained and controlled by his employer for the exclusive use of its employees, receives such injury \u2018in the course of, and arising out of his employment, within the meaning of that phrase in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Section 4123.01(C), Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The application of this principle has even more force in the present case because the Avis parking lot was the situs of Herron\u2019s employment. Thus, Herron was acting in the course of, and arising out of, his employment with Saggio when he negligently injured Donnelly, and is entitled to immunity under R.C. 4123.741.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 4123.741 extends immunity to a coemployee only when the actionable conduct occurs \u201cin the course of, and arising out of,\u201d the coemployee\u2019s employment, within the meaning of that phrase in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-11\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b709-12\">Douglas and Pfeifer, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-14\">. The court of appeals also found that \u201c[s]ince Herron has committed no legally cognizable tort against [Donnelly\u2019s] spouse, Mrs. Donnelly has no derivative claim to loss of consortium.\u201d This finding has not been challenged and, therefore, stands. Cf. <em>Maynard v. Henderson </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 403, 3 OBR 469, 445 N.E.2d 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b709-13\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACW6\">concurring. I concur in the well-reasoned opinion and in the judgment of the majority. I write separately only to make the point that in this case, or as soon as is practicable hereafter, we should revisit our decision in <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Webb </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 61, 562 N.E.2d 132. While not <em>directly </em>pertinent to the facts and decision in the case now before us, the facts and outcome do, ultimately, raise the <em>Webb </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In the case at bar, Herron, as so well explained by Justice Resnick, is immune from suit by Donnelly because, and only because, of R.C. 4123.741. On this basis (R.C. 4123.741) and on the authority of <em>Webb, </em>Herron\u2019s liability carrier can deny coverage for Donnelly\u2019s injury, notwithstanding Herron\u2019s negligence in operating his vehicle and injuring Donnelly. To me then, that makes Herron an uninsured motorist and Donnelly, if he has uninsured motorist coverage in his own automobile liability policy, should be able to access his own uninsured motorist coverage to compensate for his injuries caused by the uninsured driver, Herron. I rely, in support of this proposition, on former R.C. 3937.18(D), which provides that \u201c[f]or the purpose of this section, [R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) and (2) ] a motor vehicle is uninsured if the <em>liability insurer </em>denies coverage * * (Emphasis added.) Further, R.C. 3937.18(F) provides that \u201c[t]he coverages required by this section [R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) and (2) ] shall not be made subject to an exclusion of reduction in amount because of any workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable as a result of the same injury or death.\u201d See, also, <em>Webb </em>at 73, 562 N.E.2d at 142-143 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Thus, in the case now before us, I would go further and make it clear that our holding should not be, considering <em>Webb, </em>construed to be a bar to Donnelly\u2019s recovering under his own uninsured motorist policy (if he has such coverage) for the injuries he received due to the negligence of the tortfeasor, Herron.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
