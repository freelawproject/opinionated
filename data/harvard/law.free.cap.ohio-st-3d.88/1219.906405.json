Cunningham from further proceedings regarding the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Affiant contends that Judge Cunningham should be disqualified because she has an admitted friendship with affiant\u2019s expert witness and because she engaged in an <em>ex parte </em>communication with the witness during pretrial proceedings. Affiant contends that the friendship between the judge and his expert conveys the appearance of improper influence. Having reviewed affiant\u2019s allegations, I cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s continued participation under these circumstances creates an appearance of impropriety. When the relationship was disclosed, counsel for the defendant, the party most likely to be adversely affected by the alleged friendship, did not object to Judge Cunningham\u2019s continued participation. I cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s continued participation will create a bias, prejudice, or an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">With regard to the alleged <em>ex parte </em>communication, affiant contends that the parties were not made aware of the judge\u2019s intent to contact affiant\u2019s witness. This contention is countered by Judge Cunningham and counsel for the defendant, both of whom indicate that the matter was discussed in chambers on November 15, 1999, and that neither party objected to the contact. In any event, affiant merely alleges that Judge Cunningham <em>\u201capparently </em>made substantive statements concerning the case [emphasis added].\u201d Judge Cunningham specifically avers that she did not discuss the substance or merits of the case and that the purpose of the call was to ensure that, in the future, full disclosure of their friendship should be made to parties and their counsel. The letter from affiant\u2019s witness to affiant and his attorney does not establish the existence of a substantive conversation. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>Cunningham engaged in a substantive <em>ex parte </em>communication that mandates her disqualification from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In a supplemental affidavit filed on December 10, 1999, affiant further alleges that Judge Cunningham should be disqualified because she made \u201crepeated requests\u201d of affiant\u2019s counsel to provide an affidavit in support of Judge Cunningham\u2019s recollection of events that occurred in chambers on November 15. While it certainly would be inappropriate and grounds for disqualification for a judge to make repeated requests of and exert pressure on counsel to submit an affidavit that is contrary either to counsel\u2019s recollection or to the client\u2019s interests, the record before me does not support such a finding in this instance. The affidavit that affiant\u2019s counsel did submit on December 1, 1999, references only a single request for an affidavit that was made during the November 23, 1999 telephone conference with both attorneys. This statement is consistent with Judge Cunningham\u2019s affidavit, which also references only one request at the conclusion of that conference call.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Cunningham.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
