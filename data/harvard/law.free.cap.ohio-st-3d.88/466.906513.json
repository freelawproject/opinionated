If the claim is subsequently denied, in whole or in part, payments shall be charged to the surplus fund created under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, and if the employer is a state risk such amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience and if the employer is a self-insurer such amount shall be paid to the self-insurer from the surplus fund.\u201d 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3353.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Former R.C. 4123.519(G) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">\u201cAn appeal from a decision of the commission or any action filed in a case in which an award of compensation has been made shall not stay the payment of compensation under the award or payment of compensation for subsequent periods of total disability during the pendency of the appeal. In the event payments are made to a claimant which should not have been made under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>decision of the appellate court, the amount thereof shall be charged to the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. In the event the employer is a state risk, the amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience. In the event the employer is a self-insurer, the amount shall be paid to the self-insurer from the surplus fund. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cIf a mandamus or other court action results in a final determination that the compensation or benefits in an allowed claim should not have been paid, the amount paid shall not be used in merit rating a state risk employer. If the employer is a self-insuring employer, the employer is entitled to reimbursement of the amount paid from the surplus fund created pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.\u201d 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3355-3356.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">As relevant here, these provisions embrace a core level requirement that payments of compensation or benefits, to be recoupable, emanate from an award made pursuant to an administrative order. Nothing in either former R.C. 4123.515 or 4123.519 authorizes reimbursement for compensation that a self-insured employer paid of its own volition.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In this case, none of the compensation for which appellant seeks reimbursement was paid pursuant to an order of the bureau or commission. Appellant could have unilaterally terminated the TTD compensation it was paying to claimant on November 19, 1986, the date that Dr. Rand reported claimant\u2019s condition to be \u201cprobably permanent.\u201d \u201cNothing in former R.C. 4123.56 requires a self-insured employer to seek a hearing before terminating the temporary total disability compensation of a claimant <em>whose own doctor </em>does not believe that the claimant is temporarily and totally disabled.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 66, 577 N.E.2d 1095, 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Appellant argues, however, that it did not unilaterally terminate claimant\u2019s TTD based on Dr. Rand\u2019s report because commission policy at that time required self-insurers to continue paying TTD compensation until the commission held a hearing and ordered termination. Appellant asserts that this policy was in effect on November 19, 1986, and remained in effect until it was invalidated in 1991 by our decision in <em>Jeep Corp. </em>Appellant then argues that our decisions in <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 404, 534 N.E.2d 46, reconsidered and modified (1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 106, 541 N.E.2d 64, and <em>State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 104, 541 N.E.2d 74, recognized, or at least did not rule out, Surplus Fund reimbursement for payments made pursuant to a void commission policy rather than pursuant to an overturned administrative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">We reject these arguments for the following reasons. First, appellant decided not to unilaterally terminate claimant\u2019s TTD compensation based on Dr. Rand\u2019s statement of permanency sometime between November 19, 1986, the date of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Rand\u2019s report, and the time appellant scheduled claimant to be examined by Dr. Fox on April 7, 1987. However, the commission policy statement that appellant claims to have relied upon in making this decision is dated January 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Second, the January 1, 1989 policy statement does not prohibit a self-insured employer from unilaterally terminating a claimant\u2019s TTD compensation upon the attending physician\u2019s declaration of permanency. In fact, there is nothing in that policy statement that purports to address the issue of whether, and under what circumstances, a self-insured employer is required to seek a termination hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Third, our decision in <em>Jeep Corp. </em>does not support appellant\u2019s claim that there was a commission policy in effect from November 19, 1986 through September 6, 1991, requiring a self-insured employer to seek a hearing before terminating the TTD compensation of a claimant whose own physician has declared claimant\u2019s condition permanent. Although we certainly rejected the commission\u2019s claim that a pre-termination hearing is required under these circumstances, <em>id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 66, 577 N.E.2d at 1097, there is nothing in <em>Jeep Corp. </em>that even remotely suggests that the commission\u2019s claim in that case was related to an ongoing five-year policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Last, our decisions in <em>Eaton </em>and <em>Peabody </em>do not support the use of the statutory Surplus Fund to reimburse a self-insured employer for amounts paid pursuant to reliance upon purported commission policy. In both cases, the continued payments of TTD compensation for which we granted reimbursement were administratively <em>ordered </em>despite a finding of permanency. Prior to <em>Eaton </em>and <em>Peabody, </em>we stated that \u201c[a] proper reading [of former R.C. 4123.515] indicates that funds are not recoupable until paid pursuant to a regional board order.\u201d <em>State ex rel. DeLong v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 345, 348, 533 N.E.2d 729, 731. Subsequent to <em>Eaton </em>and <em>Peabody, </em>we again stated that \u201c[former R.C. 4123.515 provided that self-insured employers receive reimbursement from the Surplus Fund for compensation <em>paid on order </em>of a regional board of review \u2018[i]f the claim is subsequently denied, in whole or in part.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Roadway Express v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 510, 514, 696 N.E.2d 1064, 1068. Thus, <em>Eaton </em>and <em>Peabody </em>do not represent a departure from our consistent interpretation of former R.C. 4123.515 as requiring reimbursable payments to emanate from an administrative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Appellant also argues that its 1993 mandamus action resulted in a final determination that TTD compensation should not have been paid after November 19, 1986, and, therefore, it is entitled to Surplus Fund reimbursement under the second paragraph of former R.C. 4123.519(G). However, appellant\u2019s 1993 mandamus action did not result in a final determination, as it was dismissed pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Moreover, even if that dismissal could somehow be construed to have resulted in a final determination, it did not overturn any prior award of compensation. As we indicated above, none of the compensation for which appellant seeks reimbursement was paid on order of the bureau or commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is that appellees are equitably estopped from denying appellant\u2019s claim for reimbursement because they prohibited appellant from unilaterally terminating claimant\u2019s TTD compensation upon the attending physician\u2019s declaration of permanency, and then took over four years to hold a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We agree with appellant that the commission\u2019s delay of almost four and one-half years in scheduling a hearing on appellant\u2019s May 5, 1987 motion to terminate is entirely inexcusable and unacceptable. This delay penalizes a self-insured employer for continuing payments of TTD compensation. We wish that there were some way to grant appellant\u2019s request for Surplus Fund reimbursement, but in view of the statutes there is not. Appellant could have unilaterally terminated claimant\u2019s TTD compensation at any time after November 19, 1986, the date that claimant\u2019s attending physician declared claimant\u2019s condition \u201cprobably permanent.\u201d The January 1, 1989 policy on which appellant purportedly relied did not prohibit unilateral termination or require appellant to seek the hearing that was interminably delayed. Under these circumstances, the element of reasonable reliance necessary to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel is lacking. See <em>Ohio State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Frantz </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 143, 145, 555 N.E.2d 630, 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">In accordance with all of the foregoing, appellant is not entitled to a writ ordering appellees to grant Surplus Fund reimbursement, and the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-9\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AYsf\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b751-10\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. The January 1, 1989 policy statement cited by appellant provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">\u201cIf the decision of a district hearing officer is to terminate temporary total disability compensation on claims with injuries prior to August 22, 1986, or dates of disability in occupational disease claims prior to August 22, 1986, the appropriate date of termination is the date of hearing, except in those cases where a claimant has actually returned to work or where fraud is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">\u201cThe termination of temporary total disability will not be retroactively applied or prospectively applied by hearing officers. The fact that the BWC or the self-insured employer has previously extended temporary total disability beyond the date of hearing is not relevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"anx-dedup-0\">dissenting. I believe that our interpretation not only unjustly deprives Complete Auto Transit, Inc. of reimbursement from the state\u2019s Surplus Fund for compensation made by appellant to claimant Arthur Proffitt from November 19, 1986 through September 6, 1991, but it also sends a wrong message to employers. Instead of encouraging them to continue payments to an injured worker until a court order finds such payments no longer necessary, our decision almost directs them to unilaterally stop payment when the attending physician declares permanency or else lose all rights to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Appellant was not responsible for the inexcusable four-and-one-half-year delay by the commission to hold a hearing. It should not now be punished for treating its own employee fairly while waiting out government bureaucracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
