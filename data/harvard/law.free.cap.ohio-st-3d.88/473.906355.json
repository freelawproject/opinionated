Consequently, so it argues, the evidence does not support the BTA\u2019s decision, rendering the decision unreasonable and unlawful. The commissioner, in answer, argues that Campbell did not present competent and probative evidence to rebut the presumption of validity that his determination of value possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">Under R.C. 5711.09, the commissioner is to administer the personal property tax laws, adopting and promulgating necessary rules \u201cso that all taxable property shall be listed and assessed for taxation.\u201d Under R.C. 5711.21(A), the commissioner is to follow rules and evidence \u201cas will enable the [commissioner] to arrive at such true value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Nearly sixty years ago, we approved of the commissioner\u2019s method to determine the true value of personal property, the 302 Computation. In <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Evatt </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 71, 81, 83, 28 O.O. 21, 25, 26, 54 N.E.2d 132, 137, 138, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cSo far as the record in this case discloses, we see no reason for criticism of the application of the so-called \u2018302 Computation\u2019 especially as the evidence shows and as appellant admits, it is applied generally to all taxpayers in similar situations. Of course, situations may arise where such computation would not be proper. * * * Percentage depreciation is used almost universally in industry and in accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">\u201cThe \u2018302 Computation\u2019 as we understand the record and argument in this case is a rule adopted by [the] former Tax Commission and carried over under the provisions of Section 1464-4, General Code. While it has not been duly promulgated and filed, we are of the opinion that the use of such rule in the instant cases is within the powers delegated to the Department of Taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We summarized the reasoning and evidentiary process for valuing personal property under the 302 Computation in <em>Snider v. Limbach </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 200, 201-202, 542 N.E.2d 647, 649:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201cMoreover, it is impractical for the commissioner to personally value all personal property in Ohio; thus, she may resort to a predetermined formula to ascertain value. <em>W.L. Harper Co. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 300, 53 O.O. 178, 118 N.E.2d 643. However, the formula must be adjusted when special or unusual circumstances or conditions of use exist or when evidence shows that rigid application would be inappropriate. <em>Monsanto Co. v. Lindley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 59, 62, 10 O.O.3d 113, 114, 381 N.E.2d 939, 941. The burden to show that the commissioner\u2019s formula does not ascertain true value is met only if the appellant \u2018 * * * introduces competent evidence of probative value of the personal property\u2019s true value in money.\u2019 <em>Alcoa v. Kosydar </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 477, 481, 8 O.O.3d 459, 462, 377 N.E.2d 785, 788.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Thus, the commissioner may apply the 302 Computation to value personal property in Ohio. The burden is on taxpayers to show that they may deviate from the computation because special or unusual circumstances or conditions of use exist or because evidence shows that its rigid application would be inappropriate. The BTA errs if it reverses the commissioner\u2019s determination without receiving competent and probative evidence that the commissioner\u2019s determination of the property\u2019s true value is factually incorrect. <em>Hatchadorian v. Lindley </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 66, 21 OBR 365, 488 N.E.2d 145, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 402, 405, 674 N.E.2d 696, 699, we clarified our role in appeals from the BTA. We set forth when we affirm appeals from the BTA:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">\u201cConsequently, we affirm the BTA\u2019s basic factual findings if sufficient, probative evidence of record supports these findings. We also affirm the BTA\u2019s rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>on credibility of witnesses and weight attributed to evidence if the BTA has exercised sound discretion in rendering these rulings. Finally, we affirm the BTA\u2019s findings on ultimate facts, <em>i.e., </em>factual conclusions derived from given basic facts, <em>Ace Steel Baling, Inc. v. Porterfield </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 137, 142, 48 O.O.2d 169, 171-172, 249 N.E.2d 892, 895-896, if the evidence the BTA relies on meets these above conditions, and our analysis of the evidence and reading of the statutes and case law confirm its conclusion. After meeting all these prerequisites, the BTA\u2019s decision would, thus, be reasonable and lawful, pursuant to R.C. 5717.04.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In this case, Campbell asserts that the BTA misunderstood and misapplied its evidence. We disagree. The BTA pointed out in clear terms the problems it had with Campbell\u2019s evidence. As for the obsolescence study, the BTA observed that the 302 Computation considers obsolescence but that Connolly\u2019s report did not establish special or unusual circumstances to alter the commissioner\u2019s application of the 302 Computation. The BTA declined to give Connolly\u2019s report any weight or Connolly any credibility. The BTA pointed out faults in his report and questioned Connolly\u2019s judgment in ignoring these faults and in stating they had a minimal impact on his calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">As to the lifing study, the BTA found that the study failed to establish the accurate useful lives of the equipment. The BTA did not accept the Iowa curves. We read the record and found no description of how the curves were developed or why Connolly used the curves he did. Connolly could not explain the formula or the nature of its calculation. \u201cThat\u2019s up to my computer programmer. We gave him the information, he developed it.\u201d The BTA also found the disposal study to be too narrow in the data it studied. The BTA did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Connolly\u2019s testimony credibility or his reports any weight. Moreover, Campbell did not present sufficient, competent, and probative evidence to overcome the presumption of correctness that the commissioner\u2019s determination of value possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">As to the cross-appeal, the commissioner argues that the BTA selected the average salvage value as the floor value of the equipment, thus undervaluing the property. Campbell replies that Connolly\u2019s study showed that \u201c5.31% of the original cost of the property could be recovered on disposition.\u201d We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The 302 Computation describes the floor value as the minimum acceptable value. Beneath the \u201cTables for Determining True Value,\u201d which sets forth the depreciation allowances, the commissioner has written:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">\u201cThe lowest percentage in each class determines the minimum acceptable value so long as property is held for use in business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>This language compares with the definition of \u201cresidual value\u201d found in Siegel <em>&amp; </em>Shim, Dictionary of Accounting Terms (1987) 362:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201c3. Value of a depreciable asset after all allowable depreciation has been taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The same dictionary, at 375, defines \u201csalvage value\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\u201c[E]xpected price for a fixed asset no longer needed in business operations; also called SCRAP VALUE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The floor value, \u201cthe minimum acceptable value so long as property is held for use in business,\u201d equals the residual value of the assets, not their salvage value. Connolly, to determine his proposed floor value of 5.31 percent, divided the proceeds from sales of assets disposed of in 1992 by a \u201ccurrent cost new\u201d amount for these assets. He derived this current cost new by applying an \u201cindex factor\u201d to the amount capitalized for these sold assets. Connolly called the proceeds from sales of disposed assets their \u201crecovery amount.\u201d The BTA, after reviewing this study, concluded that, \u201cMr. Connolly\u2019s studies support that the personal property has little salvage value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">This recovery amount sounds very much like the salvage value, the \u201cexpected price for a fixed asset no longer needed in business operations,\u201d not the residual value described by the commissioner in the 302 Computation. Consequently, Connolly determined the salvage value of Campbell\u2019s equipment; he did not determine its floor value. Thus, the evidence the BTA relied on was not probative of the finding it was to make. The BTA erred in this reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Accordingly, as to the appeal, we hold that the BTA\u2019s decision is reasonable and lawful and affirm it. As to the cross-appeal, we hold that the BTA\u2019s decision is unreasonable and reverse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">\n<em>Decision affirmed in part</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7dV\">\n<em>and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b759-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
