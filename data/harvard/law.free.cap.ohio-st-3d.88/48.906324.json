I agree with the majority that suspension is the appropriate sanction here, but I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to stay respondent\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Respondent accepted the $4,000 balance of his fee for an appeal to this court over a month after the deadline for Sanders\u2019s appeal had passed. Respondent told his client that there were substantial grounds for a delayed appeal, then failed to file a motion for delayed appeal and notice of appeal. Indeed, respondent failed to take any action after receiving the funds, and failed to return the fee until Carpenter filed a grievance with relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">When respondent neglected an entrusted legal matter in violation of DR 6-101(A)(3), respondent violated the duty of diligence that he owed to his client. His was a knowing violation. \u201cSuspension is generally appropriate when * * * a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Standard 4.42(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Suspension is also an appropriate sanction for .respondent\u2019s violations of DR 1-102(A)(6), 7-101(A)(1), and 7-101(A)(2), which constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>knowing violations of respondent\u2019s duties of candor and diligence. See <em>id., </em>Standards 4.62 and 4.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In my view, the mitigating factors mentioned in the panel and board reports are insufficient to warrant staying respondent\u2019s suspension. \u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record\u201d is a mitigating factor under the board\u2019s recently proposed guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But remorse for misdeeds, a commitment to practice law properly, and the absence of a disciplinary record are qualities that we <em>expect </em>of every attorney who takes the oath to practice law in this state. See Gov.Bar R. I(8)(A). Thus, in the absence of more compelling mitigating factors, I would not stay the entirety of respondent\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-14\">.
