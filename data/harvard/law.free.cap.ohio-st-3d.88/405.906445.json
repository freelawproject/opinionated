That report arose from Dr. Coulter\u2019s review of the medical evidence in file, not from personal examination of the claimant, and has prompted three challenges. Upon review, we find claimant\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Claimant initially asserts that Dr. Coulter failed to consider her allowed psychological/psychiatric condition, disqualifying his report from consideration. Dr. Coulter\u2019s report, however, lists the psychiatric ailment among the enumerated allowed conditions. Equally important, Dr. Coulter\u2019s review of Dr. Howard\u2019s psychological report further demonstrates Coulter\u2019s awareness of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Claimant also challenges Dr. Coulter\u2019s failure to consider the reports of Drs. Moomaw, Earl Greer, Steven E. Zartman, and Peponis. While indeed true, the commission\u2019s failure to consider these reports, in this instance, is not fatal. Peponis\u2019s report is simply an MRI reading that confirms the existence of claimant\u2019s allowed degenerative disc condition. It does not comment on the potential improvement in that condition or its effect on claimant\u2019s ability to work. As to the remaining three reports, none of them advances claimant\u2019s cause, which undermines claimant\u2019s assertion of harm. Of the three doctors, only Greer commented on claimant\u2019s ability to return to her former position of employment, and Greer found that claimant\u2019s psychological condition was not work-prohibitive. This does not advance claimant\u2019s TTC request, nor do the reports of Moomaw or Zartman, which avoid the question entirely. We find, therefore, that these omissions do not affect the probative quality of Dr. Coulter\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Claimant argues last that it was impermissible for Dr. Coulter to conclude that based on claimant\u2019s past treatment, there was no potential for future improvement. This contention fails as well. Dr. Coulter concedes that <em>if </em>claimant were to undergo surgery, then improvement might occur. However, based on the fact that claimant, by that time, had had sixteen years to seek surgery but did not do so, Dr. Coulter excluded it as a realistic possibility and assessed MMI. Thus, the commission\u2019s reliance on Dr. Coulter\u2019s report was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
