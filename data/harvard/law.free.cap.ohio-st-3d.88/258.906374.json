In evaluating Durkin\u2019s election contest, we are guided by several, well-established precepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Initially, \u201ccourts should be very reluctant to interfere with elections, except to enforce rights or mandatory or ministerial duties as required by law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Taft v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 480, 481, 692 N.E.2d 560, 562; <em>MacDonald v. Bernard </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 85, 86, 1 OBR 122, 123, 438 N.E.2d 410, 411-412.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">Additionally, every reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of upholding the validity of an election and against ruling it void. <em>Copeland v. Tracy </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 648, 655, 676 N.E.2d 1214, 1218; <em>Beck v. Cincinnati </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 473, 475, 55 O.O. 373, 374, 124 N.E.2d 120, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">Moreover, an election result will not be disturbed unless the evidence establishes that the result was contrary to the will of the electorate. <em>Portis v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 590, 592, 621 N.E.2d 1202, 1203; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Mehling v. Moorehead </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 395, 408, 11 O.O. 55, 60, 14 N.E.2d 15, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In sum, \u201c[t]he message of the established law of Ohio is clear: o\u00fcr citizens must be confident that <em>their vote, </em>cast for a candidate or an issue, <em>will not be disturbed except under extreme circumstances that clearly affect the integrity of the </em>election.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Atty. Gen. of Ohio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 103, 105, 569 N.E.2d 447, 450; <em>State ex rel. Billis v. Summers </em>(1992), 76 Ohio App.3d 848, 850, 603 N.E.2d 410, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">More specifically, in order to prevail in his contest of the May 4, 1999 primary election, Durkin had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that one or more election irregularities occurred and that the irregularity or irregularities affected enough votes to change or make uncertain the result of the primary election. <em>In re Election Contest of Democratic Primary Held May 4, 1999, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 119, 717 N.E.2d at 702, citing <em>In re Election of Nov. 6, 1990, </em>58 Ohio St.3d 103, 569 N.E.2d 447, at syllabus. \u201cClear and convincing evidence\u201d is \u201c \u2018[tjhat measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in criminal cases, and which -will provide in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Massengale </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 121, 122, 568 N.E.2d 1222, 1223, quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">With the foregoing standards in mind, we next consider Durkin\u2019s claimed election irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Unpled Irregularities</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">On appeal, Durkin contends that an election irregularity occurred when the board failed to meet and act by majority vote on Sammarone\u2019s withdrawal, instead permitting its employees, <em>e.g., </em>then Deputy Director Sciortino, to make decisions regarding the withdrawal. Durkin further claims that the board\u2019s failure to consult the Secretary of State concerning Sammarone\u2019s withdrawal constituted a separate election irregularity. In his amended election-contest petition, however, Durkin never alleged these election irregularities. Instead, Durkin alleged that the board\u2019s failure to remove Sammarone\u2019s name from the May 4 ballot pursuant to R.C. 3501.30(E) and Secretary of State Advisory No. 96-02 and the board\u2019s additional failure to adequately notify voters of the withdrawal were the sole election irregularities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Insofar as Durkin\u2019s amended petition did not set forth the election irregularities that he now claims on appeal, it did not comport with the requirements of R.C. 3515.09, which requires election-contest petitions to \u201cset forth the grounds for such [election] contest.\u201d The procedures prescribed for election contests are specific and exclusive, and must be strictly construed. <em>In re Contested Election of November 2, 1995 </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 411, 414, 650 N.E.2d 859, 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Durkin nevertheless relies on R.C. 3515.11 to assert that \u201cit is judicially feasible to conform the pleadings to evidence\u201d of additional election irregularities elicited during trial. R.C. 3515.11 provides that \u201c[t]he proceedings at the trial of the contest of an election shall be similar to those in judicial proceedings, in so far as practicable, and shall be under the control and direction of the court * * * with power to order or permit amendments to the petition or proceedings as to form or substance.\u201d Civ.R. 15(B), which is generally applicable to civil judicial proceedings, governs amendments of pleadings to conform to the evidence tried by the parties, and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\"><em>\u201cWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. </em>Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment. Failure to amend as provided herein does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. <em>If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended </em>and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We need not consider the merits of these additional claims. Durkin never sought to amend his petition to include these claims, Brown-Clark did not expressly or impliedly consent to trial of these claims, and the trial court never considered whether these claims constituted election irregularities. See <em>State ex rel. Taxpayers Coalition v. Lakewood </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 385, 391, 715 N.E.2d 179, 184; <em>State ex rel. BSW Dev. Group v. Dayton </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 338, 344, 699 N.E.2d 1271, 1276-1277. And despite Durkin\u2019s claims to the contrary, at the time he filed his amended petition he could have obtained the meeting minutes of the board that he eventually introduced as evidence at trial, which would have disclosed his claimed irregularities. Nor would any purported lack of access to supporting evidence until trial have precluded him from requesting the trial court to .amend his petition to include these claims. In fact, when Brown-Clark objected to Durkin\u2019s attempts to litigate these unpled issues, Durkin failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>request leave from the trial court to amend his petition to include these additional claimed irregularities. Therefore, the common pleas court did not err by failing to determine these unpled claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Failure to Remove Withdrawn Candidate\u2019s Name from Ballot</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Durkin\u2019s remaining claim, which he properly raised in his amended election-contest petition, is that the board\u2019s failure to remove Sammarone\u2019s name from the ballot constituted an election irregularity because it contravened R.C. 3513.30(E) and Secretary of State Advisory No. 96-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">After Sammarone withdrew from the primary election in accordance with R.C. 3513.30(B) and (D),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board\u2019s duty was that set forth in R.C. 3513.30(E), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>\u201cWhen a person withdraws </em>under division (B) or (D) of this section, <em>the board of elections shall remove the name of the withdrawn candidate from the ballots to the extent practicable in the time remaining before the election and according to the directions of the secretary of state. </em>If the name is not removed from all ballots before the day of the election,'the votes for the withdrawn candidate are void and shall not be counted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">When construing a statute, our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>Yonkings v. Wilkinson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 225, 227, 714 N.E.2d 394, 396. In determining the legislative intent, we first review the statutory language and the purpose to be accomplished. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217, 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Under the plain language of the statute, R.C. 3513.30(E) expressly limits the board\u2019s duty to remove the name of a withdrawn candidate from ballots \u201cto the extent practicable in the time remaining before the election.\u201d Whether it is practicable to remove a withdrawn candidate\u2019s name from ballots in the time remaining before the election is an issue vested within the discretion of boards of elections. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emp. v. Girard Civ. Serv. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Comm. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 295, 297, 74 O.O.2d 463, 464-465, 345 N.E.2d 58, 60, where we held that comparable language in R.C. 124.31 requiring promotions in the classified service to be based upon merit, \u201cto be ascertained as far as practicable by promotional examinations,\u201d vested the question of whether promotional examinations were practicable initially in the civil service commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This interpretation furthers the purpose of R.C. 3513.30(E), which the then Secretary of State\u2019s Chief Elections Counsel, who helped draft the provision, testified was to confer broad discretion on boards of elections to handle ballot-removal issues in candidate-withdrawal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The evidence establishes that the board did not abuse its discretion under R.C. 3513.30(E) by determining that it was not practicable to remove Sammarone\u2019s name from the ballots. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision. <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Chippewa Twp. Trustees </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 728, 730, 654 N.E.2d 1254, 1256. At the time that Sammarone withdrew from the primary election, there was insufficient time to reprint the ballots to remove his name. In addition, because Mahoning County uses optical-scan ballot-counting machines, neither placing stickers on nor marking over his name on the ballots was feasible. Given these circumstances, the board\u2019s decision was neither unreasonable, arbitrary, nor unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Secretary of State Advisory No. 96-02 does not require a contrary result. The advisory states that \u201c[i]f a certified candidate withdraws in writing prior to thirty-five (35) days before a primary or general election * * *, a board of elections must reprint all ballots without the name of the withdrawn candidate, or otherwise remove the name of the withdrawn candidate from existing ballots by use of stickers or another method adopted by the board.\u201d But the opinion was drafted as an <em>advisory </em>rather than as a <em>directive. </em>In addition, as specified by the official under whose direction the advisory was issued, despite the use of language normally considered mandatory, the advisory merely provided guidance and was not mandatory. Finally, a contrary conclusion would nullify the \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d clause in R.C. 3513.30(E). See <em>State ex rel. Sinay v. Sodders </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 224, 232, 685 N.E.2d 754, 760 (\u201c \u201cWe must construe statutes to avoid unreasonable or absurd results.\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Election of Member of Rock Hill Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 601, 609-610, 669 N.E.2d 1116, 1123 (board of elections could not rely on Secretary of State advisory that erroneously interpreted election statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Moreover, after the board determined that it was impracticable to remove Sammarone\u2019s name from the ballots given the proximity of the election, it diligently proceeded to notify electors that Sammarone had withdrawn as a candidate and that votes for him would not be counted. Notices were placed in each absentee-ballot envelope and individual voting booth, a local newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>reported the withdrawal, and poll workers were instructed to verbally inform voters of the withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Based on the foregoing, the board did not abuse its broad discretion in not removing Sammarone\u2019s name from the ballots, and it did not violate R.C. 3513.30(E). Durkin failed to establish by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that one or more election irregularities occurred. Therefore, we need not determine the second prong of the election-contest test, <em>i.e., </em>whether the claimed irregularity or irregularities affected enough votes to change or make uncertain the result of the primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We note, however, that to the extent Durkin and <em>amici curiae </em>claim entitlement to a new election, that relief is not available in an election contest. <em>Hitt v. Tressler </em>(1983), 7 Ohio St.3d 11, 12, 7 OBR 404, 405, 455 N.E.2d 667, 667-668, quoting <em>Hitt v. Tressler </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 174, 178, 4 OBR 453, 457, 447 N.E.2d 1299, 1304, fn. 10 (\u201c[A] court is without jurisdiction to order an election in [an election-contest] case in the absence of legislative authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Because Durkin did not establish any election irregularity by the board\u2019s actions on the Sammarone withdrawal, the common pleas court properly denied the writ. This is not a case in which \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d manifestly affected the \u201cintegrity of the election.\u201d <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 105, 569 N.E.2d at 450. Instead, the board acted diligently and properly exercised its statutory discretion by keeping Sammarone\u2019s name on the ballot and notifying the electors of his withdrawal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of common pleas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b547-11\">Douglas, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\">. Durkin does not claim on appeal that the board committed an election irregularity by not adequately notifying voters of Sammarone\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\">. R.C. 3513.30 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\u201c(B) Any person filing a declaration of candidacy may withdraw as such candidate at any time prior to the primary election, or, if the primary election is a presidential primary election, at any time prior to the fiftieth day before the presidential primary election. The withdrawal shall be effected and the statement of withdrawal shall be filed in accordance with the procedures prescribed in division (D) of this section for the withdrawal of persons nominated in a primary election or by nominating petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">\u201c(D) * * * Such withdrawal may be effected by the filing of a written statement by such candidate announcing the candidate\u2019s withdrawal and requesting that the candidate\u2019s name not be printed on the ballots. * * * If such candidate\u2019s declaration of candidacy * * * was filed with a board of elections, the candidate\u2019s statement shall be addressed to, and filed with such board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">. Given this disposition, we also need not consider the merits of Brown-Clark\u2019s alternate assertion that Durkin\u2019s claims are barred by estoppel, a ground not relied upon by the trial court in denying the contest. See <em>In re Contested Election of Nov. 2, 1993, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 414, 650 N.E.2d at 862.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
