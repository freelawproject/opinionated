In accordance with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-24\">(1) If a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee. The court shall assess and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee of 20 percent of the greater of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-25\">(A) the average monthly deposits to the prisoner\u2019s account; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-26\">(B) the average monthly balance in the prisoner\u2019s account for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-27\">(2) After payment of the initial partial filing fee,the prisoner shall be required to make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding month\u2019s income credited to the prisoner\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b). A prisoner who seeks to proceed IFP on appeal must obtain leave to so proceed despite proceeding IFP in the district court. <em>Jackson v. Stinnett, </em>102 F.3d 132, 136 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">We hold that the financial screening and assessment procedures of the PLRA regarding appellate filing fees are to be conducted by the district courts. When a district court grants a prisoner leave to proceed IFP on appeal, the district court must assess the initial partial filing fee and order payment of the remainder of the filing fee as directed by the PLRA. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the district court so that the district court may rule on the IFP motion and, if granted, order the payment of the appellate filing fee pursuant to \u00a7 1915(b). After this determination is made, the district court shall return the case to this court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
