We find the Commission\u2019s order unlawful because based on an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 1(6) of the Act and order it set aside and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The New Haven, faced with loss of traffic to highway carriage and TOFC (trailer on flatcar carriage) which latter it was not in a favorable position to handle extensively because of equipment and clearance difficulties, and plagued with a large tonnage of empty box cars moving West, devised a schedule of reduced boxcar rates on freight in straight or mixed carloads from points in New England territory to Chicago and East :St. Louis, Illinois, Gibson and Hammond, Indiana, and St. Louis, Missouri, and filed appropriate tariffs containing these rates. Competing railroads followed suit. Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association, Inc. filed protests and petitions for suspension of the New Haven schedules. Later, 10 of its member carriers joined in the protests. The Commission suspended the schedules and instituted investigations. Subsequently, on petition of the New Haven and certain intervening shippers the suspension was vacated and the rates became effective July 16, 1959, the investigation, however, proceeding to its conclusion December 28, 1961 in the order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The Commission\u2019s principal argument in support of its order is the asserted violation of \u00a7 1(6) of the Act and its claimed destructive effect on the general rate structure. Under \u00a7 1(6), it is \u201cthe duty of all common carriers * * * to establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable classifications of property for transportation, with reference to which rates, tariffs, regulations, or practices are or may be made or proscribed * * * and every unjust and unreasonable classification, regulation, and practice is prohibited and declared to be unlawful.\u201d Under this provision all carriers subject to the Act publish classifications, in groupings, of all commodities subject to transportation, and tariffs, that is rates per hundred pounds, at which articles in each classification grouping will be carried between any two points. These are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the class rates. The characteristics of the commodities considered in fixing classification ratings are generally:</p>\n<p id=\"Axd\">1. Shipping weight per cubic foot.</p>\n<p id=\"APM\">2. Liability to damage.</p>\n<p id=\"Anb\">3. Liability to damage other commodities with which it is transported.</p>\n<p id=\"ARdn\">4. Perishability.</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">5. Liability to spontaneous combustion or explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"AMxb\">6. Susceptibility to theft.</p>\n<p id=\"AiM\">7. Value per pound in comparison with other articles.</p>\n<p id=\"A1V\">8. Ease or difficulty in loading or unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"AxZ\">9. Stowability.</p>\n<p id=\"A0A\">10. Excessive weight.</p>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">11. Excessive length.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9Y\">12. Care or attention necessary in loading and transporting.</p>\n<p id=\"A33\">13. Trade conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"AVk\">14. Value of service.</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">15. Competition with other commodities transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The most important are density of the item (light, bulky goods are charged more per 100 pounds as it takes more cars to carry a given tonnage), perishability, difficulty in handling, and value of service. Under the latter, commodities of higher value, whose transportation characteristics were otherwise no different from those of lower value have historically been charged higher rates. The semimonopoly position of the railroads allowed them to do this well into this century. By exacting a premium charge from high-priced commodities, the railroads were enabled to carry low-priced goods at rates not much above the out-of-pocket costs of carriage. Many times, these low rates were necessary as the lower-priced goods could not compete in the market to which they were brought unless the transportation costs were low. Otherwise, they would not move at all, and the traffic was desirable for the railroad as it did contribute something towards overhead. Common carrier and private trucks have today skimmed off most of the high-rated traffic, leaving the railroads with the unprofitable freight and resulting deficits.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">A second type of rate is the commodity rate. This is often described as a \u201cconcession to a particular situation\u201d (Commission Brief, p. 14) or in some other terms implying that it is an extraordinary deviation from the normal pattern of class rates.- It is a particular price quoted for freight of a particular kind from one place to another. It is lower than the class rates, and set to meet competition (either rail or by other carrier) that would otherwise take away the traffic. It is not a recent innovation, but seems historically to have always been part of the rate structure. See ICC 17th Ann.Rep. pp. 115-16 (1903). Thus, its status as exceptional is questionable. Further, commodity rates appear to have largely superseded, the class rates. Only about 1 (one) percent of all railroad carload tonnage in the East moves on class rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">All-commodity rates (sometimes called all-freight rates) are a natural outgrowth of the rate structure. Since cost of handling is greater, rates on less-than-carload-lots (LCL) are higher per hundred pounds than rates on carload lots. This appears to be true of both class and commodity rates. Shippers thus tried to tender carload lots for shipment. The problem arose when a shipment of mixed articles was tendered. Unless the articles were of the same class, the shipper was at first charged the LCL rate on each item, thus paying high charges for what was actually more like carload service. To remedy this, the mixing rule (Rule 10) was instituted, allowing shipment of a mixed carload at the carload rate and minimum weight of the highest class of article. This concession permitted the growth of the freight forwarders. They operated by collecting LCL shipments and shipping them at the carload rate, making a profit out of the difference between the carload rate they were charged and the LCL rate which was approximately their charge to the original shipper. With the</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>growth of motor carriers, the railroads began to lose this freight to them \u2014 both the LCL shipments and the freight forwarder shipments moved increasingly by truck. The railroads countered with rates for truck bodies, containers (holding any goods), and rates for all-commodities, regardless of their class. The Commission found little difficulty approving this kind of all-commodity rates, especially since they were generally either subject to a mixing rule (e. g., no more than 60% by weight of a shipment may be of one commodity) or were higher than the carload class rates that would otherwise have applied. All-Commodity Rates Between California and Oregon, Washington, 293 ICC 327 (1954); All Freight, Straight Carloads, To and From the South, 258 ICC 579 (1944); All Freight from Butte, Mont., to Spokane, Wash., 257 ICC 291 (1942); All-Freight Rates to Points in Southern Territory, 253 ICC 623 (1942); All Freight to Pacific Coast, 248 ICC 73 (1941), aff\u2019d sub nom. Pacific Inland Tariff Bureau v. United States, 50 F.Supp. 376 (W.D. Wash.1943) ; All Freight from Chicago and St. Louis to Santa Rosa, N. Mex., 243 ICC 517 (1941); All Freight Between Harlem River, N. Y. and Boston, 234 ICC 673 (1939); All Freight Between St. Louis and Kansas City, 234 ICC 589 (1939); All Freight from Chicago and St. Louis to Birmingham, 226 ICC 455 (1938); Commodities Between Chicago, Ill. and Twin Cities, 226 ICC 356 (1938). All-commodity rates on straight shipments (no mixing rule) thus almost never supplanted the classifications or the commodity rates on carloads then in force, except for the LCL freight, and the railroads themselves at that time had no intention of generally superseding the existing rates. See All Freight, Straight Carloads, To and From the South, 258 ICC 579 (1944). The all-commodity rate was thought of as meeting this particular problem only.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The present rate is an advance only in that it is lower than the existing class and commodity rates, and is intended to apply to the exclusion of those rates on the commodities that it covers. But it is not what the layman would call \u201call-commodity\u201d either. It excludes anything that cannot be carried in a boxcar \u2014 this is obviously a substantial number of things; it is graduated according to minimum weight per ear, denser items thus paying less per hundred pounds as has always been true; it excludes perishables, easily damaged goods, explosives, and other such goods whose cost of handling might be extreme; it applies only to freight westward; and there are-other exclusions on basis of cost of shipment and handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The just and reasonable classification requirement of \u00a7 1(6) was adopted in 1910 to give the Commission power to. control classification, there being some doubt as to the existence of the power,, and its purpose was to protect shippers, by controlling the maximum charges for transportation of commodities. This, purpose is fulfilled by the maintenance-in being of class rates even though competitive conditions lead to the furnishing-of service through variously constructed! rates at lower charges. The practice of the Commission over the past 21 years, as-, pointed out by Commissioner Webb in his dissent in the instant case, was consistent with this interpretation, permitting competitively compelled departures from the classification in e. g. All Freight to Pacific Coast, 248 ICC 73,. aff. Pacific Inland Tariff Bureau v. United States, 50 F.Supp. 376 (W.D.Wash.1943), and cases cited, supra, We can see no difference in principle between those-cases and the one before us and no sound! reason for so interpreting \u00a7 1(6) as to-prohibit such competitively compelled departures from classifications, within the-established maxima, absent some other-violation of the Act than the mere departure from the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The Commission fears that approval of these rates would be legislation on its. part, apparently because it would be. the final blow to classification as a control over minimum rates and a further-weakening of its role as a \u201cgiant handicapper.\u201d Having permitted over a long: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>period, exceptional rates which actually move the vast preponderance of this traffic at rates below the class rates, it would seem that it has already effectually legislated or interpreted the modification of what it now claims was the original meaning and purpose of \u00a7 1(6). It is strange to find it boggling at this final step of so little effect on traffic actually moving under class rates. In any ease, we do not agree that these rates are or ever were a violation of the language or intent of section 1(6). Commodity rates are sufficiently policed under sections 1(5); 2; 3(1); and 15a(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record discloses no violation of these sections. It would appear that the Commission here invokes \u00a7 1(6) as a means of preserving a basis for the \u201cvalue of service\u201d concept in ratemaking referred to above, in a desire to hold fast to a past which has already slipped away beyond our reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">This \u201cvalue of service\u201d principle was useful in the early years of the Interstate Commerce Act in requiring the more prosperous East to assist in the development of railroads and commercial and agricultural enterprises in the undeveloped West at a time when the existing railroads were powerful monopolies. In his opinion in New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co. v. United States, 199 F.Supp. 635, 643 (D.C.1961), vacated I. C. C. v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 372 U.S. 744, 83 S.Ct. 1038, 10 L.Ed.2d 108, Judge Hincks described the value of service concept as among the \u201cofficial discriminations, hallowed and encrusted by time and inertia, (which) now pervade the rate structure.\u201d The continuing application of the principle is, however, contrary to the letter and spirit of the National Transportation Policy amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, passed in 1940, 49 U.S.C. note preceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00a7 1, which, as its legislative history makes clear, was intended to permit the railroads, no longer effective monopolies, to respond to competition by asserting whatever inherent advantages of cost and service they possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The Commission also concludes that the rates at issue constitute a destructive competitive practice under \u00a7 15 a(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. This term was meant to be applied only in the context of competition between different modes of transportation and not for the purpose of supporting the classification provisions of the Act. This phrase, in its proper area of application, was dealt with by this court in New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co. v. United States, supra, [see also Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 203 F.Supp. 629, 634 (E.D.Mo.1962)], as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201c * * * the differential prohibition was intended to be qualified only when factors other than the normal incidents of fair competition intervened, such as a practice which would destroy a competing mode of transportation by setting rates so low as to be hurtful to the proponent as well as his competitor or so low as to deprive the competitor of the \u2018inherent advantage\u2019 of being the low-cost carrier. The \u2018inherent advantage\u2019 factor and the \u2018destructive competitive practice\u2019 factor were the only two policy factors mentioned in the committee reports. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> The finding that the rates will be destructive of competition rests on a basis not entirely clear to us. It would appear rather that they would enable the railroads \u201cto respond to competition by asserting whatever inherent advantages of cost and service they possessed.\u201d The rates are admittedly compensatory, exceeding the out-of-pocket costs and in most instances making a substantial contribution to overhead. There is no finding based on evidence that the rates would destroy or impair the inherent advantages of other modes of transportation. The finding of destructive competition is not adequately supported on the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The issues of this case should never have been framed under \u00a7 1 (6) nor should the meaning of The National Transportation Policy, as referred to in \u00a7 15a(3), have been distorted to supplement it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The order under review is annulled and set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-16\">. \u201c\u00a7 1336.
