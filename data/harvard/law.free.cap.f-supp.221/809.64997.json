(hereinafter referred to as \u201cYoungblood\u201d) is a common carrier by motor vehicle of property in interstate commerce pursuant to duly issued certificates of operating authority. Common Carrier Conference\u2014 Irregular \"Route, Inc., is a non-profit organization of which Youngblood is a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Involved in this proceeding are three separate and distinct grants of authority held by Youngblood which allow it to operate over irregular routes between the following points respectively:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">I. Between points in Georgia on and north of a line beginning at the Alabama-Georgia state line and extending along Georgia Highway 20 to U. S. Highway 41, thence along U. S. Highway 41 to Atlanta, Georgia, thence along U. S. Highway 29 to Athens, Georgia, and thence along U. S. Highway 78 to the Georgia-South Carolina state line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNorth Georgia\u201d), <em>on the one hand; </em>and, on the other, points in Buncombe, Graham, Haywood, and Henderson Counties in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">II. Between points in North Caroline on and west of U. S. Highway 1, <em>on the one hand,-, </em>and, on the other, <em>all </em>points in South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">III. Between Tryon, North Carolina, and points in North Carolina within ten miles of Tryon (which includes part of Hender<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>son County), <em>on the one </em>hand; and, on the other, points in North Carolina on and west of U. S. Highway 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">By \u201ctacking\u201d (combining) these separate grants of authority, Youngblood is permitted to perform the following services: (1) by \u201ctacking\u201d authorities numbered I and II at a point in Henderson County, North Carolina, Youngblood can operate (through a commonly contiguous \u201cgateway\u201d point) between North Georgia, on the one hand; and, on the other, all points in South Carolina; (2) by \u201ctacking\u201d the authorities numbered I and III at a point in Henderson County within ten miles of Tryon, North Carolina, Youngblood can operate between North Georgia, on the one hand; and, on the other, points in North Carolina on and west of U. S. Highway 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Under the above grants of authority, Youngblood cannot provide direct line service between North Georgia, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in North Carolina on and west of U. S. Highway 1 and points in South Carolina, but must follow a circuitous route through a \u201cgateway\u201d in Henderson County, North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">By application filed July 20, 1960, with the Interstate Commerce Commission, Youngblood sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing direct line operations between North Georgia, on the one hand, and, on the other, fifteen specified counties in northwestern South Carolina.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of Young-blood\u2019s application was two-fold:. (1) elimination of the Henderson County \u201cgateway\u201d requirement relative to service between North Georgia and the designated fifteen counties in South Carolina; and, (2) elimination of the observation of a \u201cgateway\u201d at a point in Henderson County within ten miles of Tryon, North Carolina, in operations between North Georgia and that part of North Carolina on and west of U. S. Highway 1, this latter gateway elimination to be achieved by tacking the authority that would be derived from (1). Were Youngblood\u2019s application granted, the following mileage savings, among others, would result:</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">BETWEEN AND MILEAGE SAVINGS</p>\n<p id=\"ADe\">Greer, S. C.

Five competing motor carriers protested the application and appeared before the Board at its hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Young-blood\u2019s only witness at the hearing was its President and General Manager, Mr. J. C. Youngblood.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">An exhaustive statement of facts is included in the Joint Board\u2019s Report. The Commission adopted the same facts as its own. Since Youngblood makes no contention that the facts are otherwise, this court likewise adopts them as the evidence upon which this case must turn. The scope of judicial review of an Interstate Commerce Commission order includes consideration of whether the ultimate conclusions of the Commission are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, are free from errors of law, and are not so arbitrary or capricious as to-constitute an abuse of discretion. Administrative Procedure Act, Section 10 (e) (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009(e) ); Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1950); State of North Carolina v. United States, D.C., 210 F.Supp. 675 (1962). If the court is affirmatively satisfied that the Commission\u2019s order does not depart from these standards, then the court must sustain the order, notwithstanding that we might have adopted a different point of view upon the same facts and law. United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Youngblood seeks, by this application, a grant of territorial authority covering a part of Georgia and a part of South Carolina that will enable it to directly traverse that territory and will, at the same time, permit it to utilize that part of South Carolina involved (fifteen northwestern counties) as a gateway between North Georgia and authorized points in North Carolina, eliminating the Henderson County, North Carolina, gateway.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Exhibits tendered by Youngblood at the Joint Board hearing indicate that it conducted the following operating activity between North Georgia and South Carolina <em>via </em>the gateway in North Carolina during the period from January 1, 1958, through June 30,1960:</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">TOTAL WEIGHT OF FREIGHT MOVED TOTAL NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS MOVED</p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">South Carolina to Georgia 8,750,244 lbs. 18,814</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">Georgia to South Carolina 4,844,253 lbs. 4,883</p>\n<p id=\"b884-23\">During the same period of time, Youngblood handled freight traffic between North Georgia and North Carolina as is indicated by the following chart. (Note: \u201cS\u201d refers to points in the four North Carolina counties of Buncombe, Graham, Haywood, and Henderson, the North Carolina points authorized in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>grant of authority numbered I; \u201cNS\u201d refers to other points in North Carolina covered by other certificates of authority.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">North Carolina <em>to </em>Georgia Total Total Number Weight Shipments</p>\n<p id=\"AyM\">\u201cNS\u201d 42,180,290 17,064</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">\u201cS\u201d 13,774,030 7,707</p>\n<p id=\"Ar2c\">Georgia <em>to </em>North Carolina</p>\n<p id=\"A0f\">\u201cNS\u201d 42,855,247 19,445</p>\n<p id=\"ARK\">\u201cS\u201d 19,932,253 7,713</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Relative to shipments between North Georgia and South Carolina through the gateway, shipments were transported from or to all of the fifteen northwestern South Carolina counties involved in Youngblood\u2019s application. As to movements <em>from </em>the fifteen-county area to North Georgia, the largest volume was shipped from Greer and substantial volumes were shipped from such points as Carlisle, Catawba, Clinton, Flint Hill, Gaffney, Grace, Greenville, Landrum, Laurens, Lyman, Mohawk, Pickens, Rock Hill, Spartanburg, Startex, Taylors, Union, Whitney, and Winnsboro. Traffic <em>from </em>North Georgia to South Carolina points originated in Atlanta, Chamblee, Dahlonega, Decatur, East Point, Gaines-ville, and Rabun Gap with the greatest volume moving from Atlanta, Chamblee, and East Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Movements <em>from </em>North Carolina \u201cNS\u201d involved 73 points of origin, with the greatest volume moving from Charlotte, High Point, Pisgah Forest, and Spindale and substantial volume moving from Gastonia, Hickory, Marion, Old Fort, and Statesville. From North Carolina \u201cS\u201d to North Georgia, shipments originated at 20 points, with the greatest volume moving from Asheville, Biltmore, Canton, Fletcher, Hendersonville, and Robbins-ville. Movements <em>from </em>North Georgia <em>to all </em>North Carolina points (\u201cNS\u201d and \u201cS\u201d) originated in Atlanta, Chamblee, Dahlonega, Decatur, East Point, Rabun Gap, Scottsdale, and Gainesville. Note that with the exception of Scottsdale the North Georgia origin points of shipments to North Carolina are the same as those of shipments to the fifteen-county South Carolina area.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">Protesting carriers operate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">(1) New Dixie Lines, Inc.: As pertinent to Youngblood\u2019s application, New Dixie has authority to transport general commodities over irregular routes between Atlanta, Georgia, and points within fifteen miles thereof, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in North and South Carolina. It moves an average of two truckloads a day in each direction between the Atlanta area and Greenville and Spartanburg, South Carolina. It has extensive service in the South Carolina areas of Greenville, Anderson, and Laurens, and toward Columbia operating peddle runs out of Greenville. It has experienced no competition from Young-blood in service between Atlanta and the northwestern sector of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">(2) Overnite Transportation Company : Relative to this proceeding, Overnite has authority to transport general commodities between High Point, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, serving all intermediate points, over regular routes from High Point to Charlotte, North Carolina, thence over these regular routes to Atlanta: (a) from Charlotte over U. S. Highway 29 to Greenville, South Carolina, thence over U. S. Highway 123 to Cordelia, Georgia, thence over U. S. Highway 23 to Atlanta; (b) from Charlotte to Greenville, South Carolina, thence over U. S. Highway 29 to Athens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Georgia, thence to Atlanta; (c) from Charlotte to Columbia, South Carolina, thence to Augusta, Georgia, thence to Atlanta. Additionally, it operates over irregular routes between points on the regular routes running between High Point and Atlanta, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in South Carolina and in North Carolina on and west of U. S. Highway 301. It has similar authority in eastern North Carolina, parts of Georgia and all of South Carolina. Hence, to the extent that Overnite does not serve Georgia and South Carolina under its regular route authority, it does so under irregular route authority or by utilizing gateways in certain of its contigous grants of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Overnite. is opposing Youngblood\u2019s application insofar as it affects traffic between Georgia and South Carolina; it does not consider Youngblood currently competitive to a very great extent. The basis for Ovemite\u2019s opposition to Young-blood\u2019s application for authority to operate directly between North Georgia and the fifteen-county South Carolina area is clearly illustrated by a comparison of their respective mileages between designated South Carolina and Georgia points under their existing respective authorities, with Youngblood moving through its gateway in North Carolina. The following chart is representative of some of the mileage differences. \u201c0\u201d represents Overnite; \u201cY\u201d represents Youngblood.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">HIGHWAY MILES BETWEEN</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">SOUTH CAROLINA And GEORGIA</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Athens Atlanta Gainesville</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">\u201cO\u201d \u00abY\u201d \u201cO\u201d \u00abY\u201d \u201cO\u201d &lt;&lt;Y\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">Gaffney 143 299 212 228 149 205</p>\n<p id=\"AreJ\">Greenville 93 175 162 204 99 181</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">Laurens 105 210 177 239 136 216</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">Pickens 82 198 151 227 88 204</p>\n<p id=\"ACN\">Rock Hill 178 249 250 318 199 255</p>\n<p id=\"AkM\">Spartanburg 123 179 192 \u2022 208 129 185</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">Union 151 207 210 236 157 213</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">(3) Akers Motor Lines, Inc.; Akers conducts operations in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, as well as in other states. Pertinent here, it moves between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Thomasville, Georgia, <em>via </em>Charlotte, North Carolina, and Spartanburg and Greenville, South Carolina, serving all intermediate points; between Charlotte, North Carolina, and Albany, Georgia, <em>(via </em>routes in South Carolina) serving all intermediate points between; between Whitmire, South Carolina, and Athens, Georgia, Seneca, South Carolina, and Monroe, Georgia, serving all intermediate points. Akers moves freight between numerous other points in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia within the territory covered by Young-blood\u2019s application. Indicative of Akers\u2019 activity in the area involved are these movements during the month of August, 1960; 2,40.6 shipments totalling 1,817,135 pounds from Atlanta, Georgia, to six points in North Carolina; 1,242 shipments totalling 1,503,888 pounds from Atlanta, Georgia, to three points in South Carolina; 587 shipments weighing a total of 648,087 pounds from Spartanburg, Greenville, and Rock Hill, South Carolina, to Atlanta and Athens, Georgia. Akers has not encountered any competition from Youngblood in the areas here under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">(4) Huckabee Transport Corporation; Huckabee, too, operates in the' three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. It has authority to move between points in Georgia, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in South Carolina; between Charlotte, North Carolina, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in that part of South Carolina within 150 miles of Charlotte and west of a line extending from the North Caroline-South Carolina border, and bounded by designated highways, to York, Chester, Columbia, and Ulmers, South Carolina. It considers Youngblood to be currently a competitor to a limited extent, and is apprehensive that if Youngblood\u2019s application is granted it will pose a serious competitive threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">(5) Southeastern Freight Lines: This carrier transports general commodities between points in South Carolina, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in Georgia. It maintains terminals at Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina, and at Atlanta, Georgia. It moves large-volume shipments on a direct service basis; it moves three to four truckloads a night from Atlanta to Greenville. Southeastern is of the opinion that if Youngblood\u2019s application is granted, Youngblood will be a serious threat and a new competition and will definitely affect service between the Atlanta and Greenville areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">ACTION OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">(A) The Joint Board: The Joint Board hearing was conducted October 24,1960, and its decision and recommended order handed down December 29,1960. The Board applied the following standards: \u201cIn order for applicant to obtain the requested authority to eliminate the North Carolina gateway or gateways and to provide alternate gateways or direct service, in the absence of testimony of public witnesses (Youngblood\u2019s only witness was its President \u2014 General Manager), it must show affirmatively (1) that it is actually transporting a substantial volume of traffic from and to the points involved by operating in good faith through the gateway point or points, and in so operating, is effectively and efficiently competing with existing carriers <em>and </em>(2) that the elimination of the gateway or gateways would not enable applicant to institute a new service or service so different from that presently provided as to improve materially its competitive position to the detriment of existing carriers. In the former instance, a grant of the authority sought is justified solely upon proof that the proposed operation would result in operating economics which, although primarily a benefit to the applicant, indirectly benefit the public through the medium of more efficient and economical service. In the latter instance, however, where the elimination of the gateway requirement would allow a new service, or would provide applicant with a substantial competitive advantage not previously enjoyed, it is incumbent upon applicant to prove public convenience and necessity the same as in any other application for new authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The Joint Board found that Young-blood met the first test in that it was actually transporting a substantial volume of traffic from and to the areas involved and was effectively and efficiently competing with other carriers in the area. As to the second test, however, the Joint Board concluded \u201cthat the elimination of the gateways in Henderson County, North Carolina, and a grant of the authority sought would enable applicant to institute a new service or a service so different from that presently provided as to improve materially applicant\u2019s competitive position to the detriment of existing carriers. Inasmuch as no shipper evidence was presented in support of the application, and the evidence of record, based solely on operating economy and efficiency, does not warrant a grant of authority, the application should be denied.\u201d The latter conclusion, that the effect of the authorities sought would enable applicant to institute a \u201cnew service\u201d was based upon the Board\u2019s finding that were the authority granted Young-blood would derive such a great savings in mileage and would acquire direct line service access to such a wide territory that its competitive situation relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>other carriers in the area would be drastically altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Upon Youngblood\u2019s taking exception to the recommended order, the matter was heard by Division I of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Two competing motor carriers, Akers and Overnite, replied to Youngblood\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">(B) Interstate Commerce Commission \u2014Division I: In its report and order, dated June 30,1961, the Commission cited the same two tests as comprising the controlling standards. The Commission, however, cited another criterion applicable to test No. 1 (i. e., whether applicant is transporting a substantial volume of traffic from and to the points involved and is effectively and efficiently competing with existing carriers). The Commission noted that as to this test, the entire Interstate Commerce Commission had pointed out in The Maryland Transportation Company Extension \u2014 Specified Commodities, 83 M.C.C. 451 (Sept. 19, 1960), \u201cthat in order to justify elimination of a gateway, an applicant must show that he is an effective competitor as to substantially <em>all </em>points in his pertinent authorized territory, and that it is not enough for an applicant that it has handled even a substantial volume of traffic if it has provided service only at selective points.\u201d It was observed by the Joint Board that Youngblood\u2019s freight movements from Georgia to points in North and South Carolina respectively were from but eight named points in Georgia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission noted that all but three of the Georgia points at which shipments originated were within the Atlanta commercial zone, and that these remaining three points were almost on a direct line between Atlanta, Georgia, and Henderson County, North Carolina, at which latter point Youngblood\u2019s gateway is located. Upon that basis, the Commission specifically found \u201cthat applicant has failed to show that it is competing effectively throughout the portion of Georgia which it is authorized to serve.\u201d Hence, the Commission applied not only the two general standards or tests that were applied by the .Joint Board, but it also interjected into the first test a more specific criterion that had been developed by the I.C.C.; and upon application of that specific criterion found that Young-blood failed to measure up to its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">As to the second test, the Commission agreed with the Joint Board that a grant of the authority sought by Youngblood's application would enable Youngblood to institute a wholly new service between many portions of Georgia and South Carolina, and found that Youngblood had failed to establish that the present and future public convenience and necessity required the proposed operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">After Division I of the Interstate Commerce Commission had denied Youngblood\u2019s application, it petitioned the full Interstate Commerce Commission for reconsideration. The petition was denied. Youngblood then instituted this action to be heard before a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">CONTENTIONS AND ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Youngblood contends that the Commission erred in (1) requiring a showing that Youngblood was competing effectively throughout the entire North Georgia territory which it was authorized to serve, and (2) looking only to an entire elimination of gateways rather than collaterally considering a partial elimination of gateways, the result of which, it is asserted, would not be an operational improvement of such a nature as to affect the competitive situation to the extent that Youngblood could be said to be instituting a \u201cnew service\u201d requiring a showing of public convenience and necessity other than increased economics. Youngblood styles this the \u201call or nothing at all standard\u201d and contends that it is improper in this instance. It is Young-blood\u2019s position that the standard so employed by the Commission effectively pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>eluded it from considering the feasibility or propriety of a partial grant of the authority sought, is novel to a gateway elimination application, and is arbitrary and carpricious. Youngblood states in its brief that it proposed, as an alternative to the grant of all the authority sought by the application, either a grant restricted against service between points in the adjacent South Carolina-Georgia counties or one limited to service to and from the four North Georgia points at which the Commission acknowledged that Youngblood handled substantial traffic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its brief, the United States of America notes that this proposal was not made until Youngblood petitioned the full Commission for reconsideration, which petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The gist of the Government\u2019s position is that all standards employed by the Commission were entirely proper and reasonable, and that the record discloses that were even a partial grant made of the authorities sought by Youngblood, the result would still be a \u201cnew service\u201d requiring a showing by shipper witnesses of public necessity and convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">DECISION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Youngblood\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a motor common carrier of general commodities requested an extension of its existing operating authority by eliminating certain gateway requirements. It is provided in 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307 that \u201ca certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor, authorizing the whole or any part of the operations covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed * * * and that the proposed service, to the extent to be authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise such application shall be denied * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">No question was raised in these proceedings as to Youngblood\u2019s fitness, willingness, or ability to perform the services sought in its application. The sole matter to be resolved by the Commission was whether the public convenience and necessity warranted the issuance of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Congress has never attempted to define \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d Its interpretation has been left to the administrative and judicial bodies. The Interstate Commerce Commission has long assumed it to be its duty to make findings of facts and apply thereto its judgment in determining public convenience and necessity within the framework of the Interstate Commerce Act. That assumption of duty and commensurate authority early received the sanction and approval of the federal courts. See: Interstate Commerce Commission v. Parker, 326 U.S. 60, 65 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed. 2051 (1945). The issue of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d is peculiarly within the Commission\u2019s discretionary exercise of its expert judgment in the field of transportation. United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U. S. 475, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. 971 (1942). No party in the instant proceeding controverts the Commission\u2019s duty and authority to establish standards and tests to facilitate its determination of the existence of public convenience and necessity or the lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Youngblood does seriously question, however, 'the propriety and validity of a criterion employed by the Commission supplementary to the tests utilized by the Joint Board: Is Youngblood effectively competing as to substantially <em>all </em>the points in its pertinent authorized territory? Division I then decided, contrary to the finding of the Joint Board, that Youngblood was <em>not </em>effectively competing with other carriers by moving a substantial volume of freight to and from the points involved by operating through its gateway, for the reason that it had failed to provide service throughout the North Georgia territory, but had served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>only eight communities, five of which constitute the Atlanta commercial zone<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the other three <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> being located on an almost direct line between Atlanta and Youngblood\u2019s North Carolina gateway.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Youngblood complains that the Commission\u2019s requirement that it show effective competition with other motor carriers in substantially <em>all </em>its authorized territory (particularly North Georgia) in order to meet the first test for the elimination of a gateway is novel to an application of this sort, is arbitrary and carpricious, and precludes the Commission from considering a partial elimination of gateways. We disagree with Youngblood\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The Interstate Commerce Commission, in the exercise of its administrative authority and discretionary judgment, not only can promulgate standards for determining public convenience and necessity, but is free to alter its policies and standards when the necessity, in its judgment, arises. See: Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1942). No problem with respect to due process arises, for Youngblood does not contend that it could have, offered evidence showing effective competition in <em>all </em>its authorized territory if it had but realized the necessity. See: E. Brooke Matlack, Inc. v. U. S., D.C., 119 F.Supp. 617 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The alleged \u201cnew\u201d requirement is not even new. On December 18, 1952, the Commission (Div. 5) decided Childress\u2014 Elimination of Sanford Gateway, 61 M.C. C. 421, and published the decision in an official publication. In that gateway elimination proceeding, the Commission had this to say in its decision and order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">Applicant\u2019s service to the smaller points in the Sanford area averaged one to two shipments a month and * * * consisted of truckloads of only a few diversified commodities. Considering <em>the relative infrequency of the service </em>and the small degree of diversification of the commodities handled by applicant to points in the Sanford area, we conclude that he has <em>not </em>been an effective competitor of existing direct-line carriers in the transportation of general commodities <em>to points in this area. </em>(Emphasis added by the court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Hence, as early as 1952 the criterion here complained of was inserted into the two more general tests by the Commission. It is clear from the above quotation that one of the matters considered by the Commission and upon which its ultimate determination of public convenience and necessity turned was whether Childress was effectively competing in the smaller points in one specific area of its territory as well as in the larger and more important points. As applied in Childress, the test is really more stringent than here; for, in Childress, <em>some </em>service was being rendered in the less significant points in the area, whereas it appears that Youngblood was rendering <em>no </em>service in its North Georgia territory except at selected points. This more specific element of the Commission\u2019s standards was reiterated, perhaps more clearly, in the full Commission\u2019s decision and order in The Maryland Transportation Company Extension \u2014 Specified Commodities, 83 M.C.C. 451 (Sept. 19, 1960). If the requirement was not so clearly and effectively stated in Childress as to be definite and certain, the Commission certainly made it clear in Maryland (which decision was handed down <em>after </em>Young-blood filed its application but <em>before </em>its hearing before the Joint Board) wherein it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-11\">(I)t is not enough to show that between selected points applicant has transported substantial traffic, or that throughout its territory applicant has transported commodities which are insufficient adequately to represent its pertinent commodity description. Rather, <em>it must be shown that the proposing carrier is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number><em>an effective competitor </em>as to substantially all of the commodities and <em>between substantially all of the points within the scope of its pertinent outstanding authority. </em>(Emphasis added by the court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Youngblood next objects that the actions by the Commission in this proceeding were arbitrary and capricious in that the standards upon which the ultimate findings and conclusions are based arbitrarily preclude partial elimination of gateways, discriminate against irregular-route carriers, prevent Youngblood from realizing economies and safety in its operations, and, in effect, are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Not until Youngblood petitioned the full Commission for reconsideration did it even propose that it be granted a partial elimination of gateways. It filed no exception to the Joint Board\u2019s report and recommended order claiming failure to consider a partial elimination, nor did it suggest to Division I of the Commission that it desired such consideration. According to the Government\u2019s representation to the court, it is the Commission\u2019s practice to refuse to reconsider matters to which there has been no objection made before the initial hearing officer. The adoption of such a practice or rule of procedure is within the power of the Commission, and we find it to be reasonable on its face. See: Administrative Procedure Act, particularly Section 8 (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1007). It conclusively appears, then, that the proposition of partial elimination of gateways was never properly or timely presented to the Commission and it did not, therefore, unreasonably fail to consider it. Even assuming, however, that such a request was before the Commission, there is ample evidence in the record before us to support a denial. Were even a partial elimination of the North Carolina gateway granted, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the result would be such a reduction of route circuity and mileage savings for Youngblood as to place it in the position of having achieved \u201cnew service\u201d capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">If given the authority sought by its application, Youngblood would be able to compete directly with New Dixie Lines, Inc., for the Atlanta to Green-ville and Spartanburg freight as well! as for other service in northwestern South Carolina; its competitive position with Ovemite Transportation Company with respect to North Georgia to South Carolina and the reverse would be altered by the elimination of their current mileage differences between points involved, which range from 16 to 153 miles; its competitive position with Akers Motor Lines, Inc., would be likewise changed; it could become additionally competitive with Huckabee Transport Corporation ; it would be a new competitive, threat to Southeastern Freight Lines with respect to traffic between Green-ville, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia. Its circuity of operations would be reduced by 15 to 71 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Finally, Youngblood asserts that the standard employed in arriving at a conclusion as to its application is discriminatory against irregular-route carriers for the reason that the same standard is not applied to applications from regular-route carriers. But the same general two-part test is utilized by the Commission in both instances. See, e. g.: Chicago Express, Inc., Extension \u2014 Tuscola,. Ill., 79 M.C.C. 384 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">That Division I of the Commission did; not reiterate the facts stated by the Joint. Board relative to the \u201cnew service\u201d test is of no consequence, for the Commission-expressly adopted the Board\u2019s statement and finding of the facts as its own and also adequately stated its conclusions as. to this point and its basis therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">We conclude, upon consideration, of the record as a whole, that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are supported: by substantial evidence; that its conclusions of law are free of error, and that the denial of Youngblood\u2019s application was. neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Counsel may submit an appropriate-judgment in accordance with this opin-ion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">.
