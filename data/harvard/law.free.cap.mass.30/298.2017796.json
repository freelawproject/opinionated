Afterwards a farm having been conveyed to the husband and wife \u201c in equal shares,\u201d they conveyed a moiety of it, together with three other parcels of land, one of which was owned by the husband and the two others, by the wife, to the tenant, in <em>trust </em>for the use and benefit of the wife and her children, the consideration, as expressed in the deed, being, that she had joined with her husband in selling and conveying certain lands devised to her by her father. The sale of the wife\u2019s land was a fair equivalent for one half of the farm conveyed to the tenant. It was held, that as against creditors of the husband, who was insolvent, the conveyance to the tenant was without consideration, for the husband had a legal estate in the moiety of the farm conveyed to the tenant and a freehold in the wife\u2019s land, and these were relinquished without an equivalent; and the wood and timber cut by the husband was deemed not to be a part of the consideration, not being stated to be so in the deed, and there being no evidence of any other consideration than the one therein expressed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b304-4\">Several creditors of the husband having levied on a moiety of the farm as estate held in common, they and the tenant made a partition; after which the demandant, another creditor of the husband, levied by metes and bounds on a part of the moiety assigned by the partition to the tenant. It was <em>held, </em>that the deed from the husband and wife being void for want of consideration as against creditors, the basis and object of the partition failed, so that the tenant took no title under it as against creditors, and that, consequently, he could not object to the form of the demandant\u2019s levy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Writ of entry.

The sale of these lots was a fair equivalent for one half of the Thomas farm then conveyed to Daniel and Irena. These two lots contained all the land which Irena had by devise from her father, excepting the ten acre lot and the two acre lot conveyed by the deed of April 5, 1827, to the tenant. The ten acre lot was worth then about $65. The value of the twelve acre lot, (the fee of which was in Daniel,) which was conveyed to the tenant by the deed of April 5, 1827, was about $66.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-9\">Between the 20th of May 1826 and the 5th of April 1827, Daniel cut wood and timber off the Thomas farm, to the value of $ 100, and he had given a lease for $ 125, paid by one of his creditors, to one Leonard, to cut other wood thereon.

This is a writ of entry, in which the demandant claims title under the levy of an execution in his favor against one Daniel Warren ; and the tenant also derives his title from the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Daniel Warren and Irena his wife. The deed from them to the tenant was prior to the demandant\u2019s levy, so that if it was a valid conveyance the tenant\u2019s title must prevail. The objection to this conveyance is, that it was made without an adequate consideration, and was void as against Warren\u2019s creditors. This objection, we think, is maintained by the facts agreed. The demanded premises are part and parcel of a farm called the \u201c Thomas farm,\u201d and this farm was in 1826 conveyed by Bradford Harlow and others to Daniel Warren and his wife \u201cin equal shares.\u201d By this deed, it being made during coverture, the demandant\u2019s counsel contend that the grantees became seised of an entire estate, and that on the death of either the whole would go to the survivor ; that during their joint lives the husband was not only entitled to the income and profits, but had also the right to cut down the wood and appropriate it to his own use, without being answerable for waste. On the other hand, the counsel for the tenant have argued, that by the conveyance to Warren and his wife the fee vested in them by moieties as tenants in common; that such was the manifest intention of the grant, because they were to hold in equal shares ; and that there is no technical rule of law to defeat this intention of the parties. In deciding this case, however, we have not found it necessary to consider and discuss these questions ; for admitting the legal effect of the grant in question to be as contended for by the counsel for the tenant, still Warren had a legal estate in the moiety conveyed to the tenant, and this was conveyed to him without consideration. The only consideration for this conveyance appears to have been the proceeds of the sale of the wife\u2019s lands devised to her by her father, which were appropriated to the payment of her husband\u2019s debts ; and it is agreed that these proceeds were a fair equivalent for a moiety of the Thomas farm. But Warren had a freehold estate in his wife\u2019s land, and this he has relinquished without an equivalent, thus materially impairing the remedy of his creditors to obtain satisfaction for their debts. The wood and timber he cut on his wife\u2019s land, and on the Thomas farm, constituted no part of the consideration for the conveyance to the tenant. The consideration appears on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the face of the deed, and there is no evidence of any othe. consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The next qmstion to he considered is, whether the tenant has any title under the division deed between him and the creditors of Warren, who had levied on his moiety of the Thomas farm; and we think he has not. Certainly he has no equitable title, and we think he has. no legal title. The basis and the object of that division or partition wholly fails. The tenant\u2019s title being void as against the demandant, he cannot set up a title obtained under color of right, to the prejudice of Warren\u2019s creditors. The creditors who were parties to this deed of division have taken their full shares in another part of the farm, and they had nothing more to release to the tenant. He is bound by that division, and is estopped to deny that the creditors have their full purparty in the lands now held by them in severalty. The tenant had no estate as against the demandant, upon which the creditors\u2019 release could operate, and his title, if he has any, by virtue of the deed of partition, is incidental and accessory to his title from Warren, and must fail with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">As to the deed from Stephen Harlow, that conveys no part of the demanded premises. His share by the division was assigned to him in another part of the farm, and the tenant is bound by that division. The tenant\u2019s title, therefore, wholly fails, and he cannot object to the form of the levy of the demandant\u2019s execution. It is good against every one except the other tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\n<em>Judgment for demandant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
