Trial before <em>Putnam </em>J., upon the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">It was proved, that on Saturday, July 18, 1829, in the forenoon, the wood, lumber and other personal property of Zenas Stoddard, wood-wharfinger, on the wharf in his occupation, were attached by the defendant Dutch, a deputy sheriff, on a writ of one Buffum against Stoddard, and that Dutch appointed one Nesmith to be the keeper of the property attached. Nesmith was directed by the officer to keep the attachment as private as he could, but he was- to remain near the property, so that if another officer should come to attach it, he might give him notice of the attachment already made. After 12 o\u2019clock on Saturday night, Nesmith shut the large gate of the wharf, and locked it and took the key, and shut the small gate, (which had no lock, but was blocked up with posts on each side,) and went home. Most.of the property was on the wharf, but there was some large timber outside the fence. Nesmith, without permission, suffered two or three sticks of timber to go to customers, to oblige them, thinking that if there should be any difficulty about these sticks he would pay for them himself. Nesmith went again to the wharf on Sunday, after dinner. At about half past 11 o\u2019clock on Sunday night, Devereux (one of the plaintiffs) and Stoddard came to the wharf, and Devereux told Nesmith that Stod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>dard had assigned all the property to the plaintiffs ; and he showed Nesmith the deed of assignment, (which was foundel on a valid consideration,) and requested him to keep the property for the plaintiffs, subject to the attachment of Buffum, which Devereux agreed to remove by satisfying Buffum\u2019s demand. About 15 minutes before 12 o\u2019clock, Stoddard delivered the property to Devereux, by putting a stick of the wood into his hands as for the whole, and Devereux then delivered it in the same way to Nesmith, to keep for the plaintiffs. Very soon afterwards Brown, a deputy sheriff, and one Rideout came to the wharf and informed Nesmith that the property would be attached immediately after 12, at the suit of Rideout; and Nesmith told them that it had been assigned to the plaintiffs, and that possession had been taken. Immediately after 12 o\u2019clock Stoddard again delivered the property to Devereux, and Devereux again delivered it to Nesmith, in the form above mentioned, to keep for the plaintiffs, subject to Buffum\u2019s attachment; and notifications of the assignment were immediately posted up. Dutch gave Nesmith no authority to deliv\u00e9r up the possession to any person. He authorized Nesmith to go home on Sunday and leave the property as it was left on that day. The wharf was left as s\u00e1fe as Stoddard used to leave it on Sundays. It was accessible directly from the water. Immediately after 12 o\u2019clock on Sunday night Dutch made an attachment of the property on two writs, one in favor of Rideout, the other in favor of one Webster, by entering the attachment on the writs, but without an actual taking of the property into possession anew. At that time he had received no information of the assignment to the plaintiffs. By consent of the parties the property was put into the hands of Pickering Dodge, to be sold and accounted for. Buffum\u2019s demand was paid out of the proceeds, and a balance remained, which was paid over to Dutch, and to recover which this action was brought. This balance was demanded of him by the plaintiffs before the commencement of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">The jury found that Nesmith and the plaintiffs, at the time of the delivery of the property, did not agree that the first attachment should then be dissolved and extinguished, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the personal promise of Devereux, but that they did agree that the plaintiffs should take the property subject to that attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-4\">Judgment was by consent entered up for the plaintiffs,subject to the opinion of the whole Court upon the facts in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A98\"><em>Choate </em>and Huntington, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV4\">The plaintiffs could not maintain this action, even if there had been no attachment subsequent to the assignment, for after the first attachment no interest assignable at law remained in the debt- or. That attachment vested in the officer not a special property merely, but the whole property, so that the debtor could make no delivery under the assignment. It was like a mortgage, rather than a lien. The debtor had a conditional right of re-acquisition, a chose in action against the officer, which was assignable in equity only, and the officer might set up the same defence against the assignee as against the debtor himself. The officer, and not the debtor, could have maintained an action of trespass against a wrongdoer, for an injury to the property. Bac. Abr. <em>Grant, D </em>; Shep.

An attachment confers and imposes on the officer various rights, duties and responsibilities. He is to account to the debtor for the surplus remaining in his hands after satisfying the attaching creditor\u2019s demand, and is not to be turned over to the debtor\u2019s appointee to make a settlement with him. He is not subject to a process of foreign attachment for property taken by him by virtue of his office. He has a right to hold attached property, not only for the benefit of the attaching creditor, but also that he may make new attachments of the same property for the benefit of other creditors. In the present case, if Dutch had not made the attachments in favor of Rideout and Webster, he would havt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>iendered himself liable for neglect of duty. Should effect be given to the assignment, he would be deprived of his right to make new attachments. <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>3 Mass. R. 295 ; <em>Chealy </em>v. Brewer, 7 Mass.

R. 251 ; <em>Vinton </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>13 Mass. R. 117. Here was a possession united to the title of Dutch, which gave him a preference over the plaintiffs. They took no possession, for the debtor had no possession, nor right of possession, and therefore could make no delivery; and Nesmith could not make nor assent to a delivery, because he was the special agent of Dutch to preserve the attachment, and any further act on his part would have exceeded his authority and would not have been binding on Dutch. He might have neglected to preserve the attachment and in that way have affected the rights of Dutch, but the case shows that he did preserve the attachment. <em>Lanfear </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>17 Mass.

Nesmith relinquished his possession of the property, by leaving the wharf insufficiently secured, and taking no measures to give notice of the attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">But supposing it to have been in force until Sunday night, it was then vacated, when Nesmith voluntarily permitted the debtor to make an actual delivery of the property to the assignees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">If however the attachment was not vacated, and possession could not be given by the debtor to the assignees, still the debtor had an assignable interest. The officer had but a hen, the general property remaining in the debtor. If the assignees could not obtain a right to the property itself, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>might acquire a right to the surplus of the proceeds ; to recover which is the object of this action. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>7 Mass.
