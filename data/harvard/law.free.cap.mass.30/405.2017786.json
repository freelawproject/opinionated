Merrill.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-6\">A testator devised certain personal property to his wife (which under the circumstances of his estate was a small provision for her) on condition that she should relinquish her dower and also should \u201c educate and bring up M. L. R. (a granddaughter of the testator and of a former wife,) until she should arrive at the age of eighteen years or be married.\u201d The granddaughter lost both parents before she was two \u2022 years of age, and she was thereupon taken into the family of the testator and educated and maintained by him like a daughter. The wife died a few days after the testator and during the minority of the granddaughter. The testator also devised real and personal property to the granddaughter sufficient to maintain her during her minority, and which might be applied to that purpose. It was held, that by the terms of the will, the obligation imposed on the testator's widow was one of parental persona! care towards the granddaughter,.which died with the widow, and was not a charge on the legacy to her in the hands of her administrator 5 and that all the circumstances of the case strengthened this construction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">This was a bill in equity instituted by the plaintiff by her guardian, to obtain from the estate of Mary Smith, under the administration of the defendant, a maintenance until she should arrive at the age of eighteen years, or be married.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">The bill sets forth the following facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">Josiah Smith, in September 1826, made bis last will, containing these provisions : \u2014 u I give to my wife Mary Smith twenty-five shares in the Newburyport Bank and half of all the money which I may have in my house at my decease, together with all my family stores at that time on hand.

She also inherited from her mother real estate appraised at 8 333, and yielding an income of about 8 10 Per annum. The testator took her into his family, on the death of her father, and she continued to live with him and was supported by him in the character of a daughter, until his decease ; and from that time until the death of his wife, she was supported by his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">After the death of the wife, the furniture mentioned in the will was sold, and the proceeds, being 8 684-41, are now held by the executor for the benefit of the plaintiff.

He was credited with 8 343-62, as the expense of educating and maintaining the plaintiff after the decease of Mary Smith. At the same time William Davis junior was appointed guardian in the place of Daniel Richards, and he immediately made a demand on the defendant for the above amount credited in the account of the former guardian, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>for the future education and maintenance of the plaintiff; with which demand the defendant refused to comply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-9\">\u25a0 The defendant demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-10\"><em>Moseley, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4d\">cited <em>Farwell </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYC\">drew up the opinion of the Court. The bill proceeds upon the ground, that the condition contained in the bequest to Mary Smith, that she should educate and bring up the plaintiff, was a provision for the plaintiff\u2019s subsistence in nature of a legacy ; that Mary Smith, by accepting the bequest, became bound by the condition ; and that the duty thereby created was not a personal obligation' which terminated with her life, but constituted a charge upon her estate, which has devolved as a debt upon her personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">There is no doubt that the direction to support and maintain a person by a testator, is construed to be a legacy, being a gift of general subsistence, which is capable of being rendered reasonably certain, and which may be supplied and afforded by any person having funds to do it with. It is in effect a pecuniary legacy, uncertain in amount, and rendered sufficiently certain by the circumstances. <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>4 Mass. R. 634 ; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Dodge, 2 </em>Pick. 619. Such a direction or bequest of support and subsistence, involves no personal trust or confidence, and may be executed by any one having the administration of the testator\u2019s estate, or taking the fund upon which it is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Were the direction in the will in favor of the plaintiff, of this character, we should have entertained no doubt of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. But we think the words in this will, to 11 educate and bring up the plaintiff,\u201d in the circumstances in which the parties were placed towards each other, were a personal confidence, that the obligation which they imposed upon the testator\u2019s widow, the defendant\u2019s intestate, was of parental personal care towards the plaintiff, which died with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>her. The plaintiff was an orphan, having lost both parents in infancy ; she had been taken by her grandfather into his family, and we think the intent was, that so long as his widow lived, she should stand, as he had done, towards the plaintiff, <em>in loco parentis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">But if the words were more doubtful, and we were to look into the circumstances of the estate and all the other parts of the will, we think the inquiry would lead to the same result.\" Considering the smallness of the provision made for the widow, under all the circumstances of the estate, it is not to be presumed, unless words were used, clearly expressing that intent, that it was intended to make the support and subsistence of the plaintiff a charge upon that fund, after the decease of the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It has been strongly urged in behalf of the plaintiff, that all the other bequests in the will in favor of Mary L. Richards, the plaintiff, were so given that they were not to take effect in possession, till she should arrive at eighteen years of age or be married, and in the mean time, upon the defendant\u2019s construction, she would be left without means of subsistence ; which could not have been intended by her grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">If the will required this construction, there would be considerable force in the argument against such an intent. But we think such is not the true construction of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The testator gives the whole residue of his property, real and personal, to his four granddaughters, of whom Mary, the plaintiff, was one. In a subsequent clause, he gives to his executor the care and management of the real and personal estate before given to the four granddaughters, till they shall severally arrive at the age of eighteen years or be married, and they were not to come into possession till that period arrived. If this embraced all the property given to the plaintiff, it would afford a foundation for the argument. But we think that this direction applies only to the residuary real and personal property given to the four.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">But there are other bequests to the plaintiff. The testator gave his wife certain furniture for her life, and after her decease to the plaintiff. There seems to be nothing to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>vent this property, amounting to $ 639, from vesting in possession in the plaintiff, immediately on the death of the widow ; and from that period it might be applied to her support and maintenance. He also, by a separate clause, gives her five bank shares, and certain other personal property, and then adds this direction, \u201c the property herein given to my granddaughter Mary L. Richards, to be taken care of and managed for her benefit during her minority or until she shall be married, by my executor.\u201d There is nothing in the relative position of this clause in the will to render it probable, that it was intended to apply to the reversionary interest in the furniture given to the plaintiff. But if it did, it would not prevent the property from vesting in the plaintiff in possession, immediately after the death of the widow ; but only be adding the authority of a guardian to that of executor. Under this authority and consistently with the duty of taking care of and managing the same for the benefit of the plaintiff, it would be his duty to apply the income, and if need be, the principal of this property, to the necessary support, maintenance and education of the plaintiff during her minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The plaintiff therefore was not left, upon the death of the widow, without means of support; and there is therefore nothing in this argument to show that the testator must necessarily have intended by the words used, to throw the charge of the support and maintenance of the plaintiff upon the legacy given to his wife, after her decease, or to control what otherwise appears to have been the plain intent of the testator, to devolve upon his wife the personal and parental care of his orphan granddaughter, during her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
