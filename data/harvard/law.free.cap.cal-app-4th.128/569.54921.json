Guarantee Assn. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 307 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 845] <em>(Weitzman), </em>we held that a workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier does not have a \u201ccovered claim\u201d against the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) because, inter alia, it is an obligation to an insurer and because it is a claim for \u201ccontribution, indemnity, or subrogation.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) Unlike <em>Weitzman, </em>the claim in the instant matter is not characterized as \u201cjoint and several.\u201d It is agreed by the parties that the injuries for which compensation benefits were paid were separate and discrete. We conclude that this distinction is of no legal significance and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) erred when it directed CIGA to reimburse Argonaut Insurance Company (Argonaut), a solvent insurance carrier. Accordingly, the order of the WCAB is annulled. We remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The facts are undisputed. Rockney Hooten filed four claims for injuries sustained while working for a single employer. The first claim alleged a specific injury to Hooten\u2019s left shoulder on December 8, 1994. At that time, Hooten\u2019s employer was insured by Superior Pacific Casualty Company. The second claim alleged a specific injury to Hooten\u2019s neck and shoulders on August 27, 1997. At that time, the employer was insured by Argonaut. The third claim alleged a cumulative trauma injury to Hooten\u2019s neck, shoulders, back, and arms from approximately 1967 through 1997. Argonaut insured Hooten\u2019s employer for the period June 1997 through September 3, 1997. The fourth claim alleged a cumulative trauma injury to Hooten\u2019s neck, shoulders, back, and arms from September 8, 1998, through March 17, 1999. During this time, Hooten\u2019s employer was insured by Wausau Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">On June 14, 2000, Hooten entered into a compromise and release (C&amp;R) settling all four claims with all the insurers. The C&amp;R contains the following language: \u201cDefendant Argonaut reserves all rights of contribution and/or reimbursement against Superior Pacific. The amount payable by Argonaut herein is not an admission as to the extent of liability of Argonaut toward this settlement for benefits paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">On September 26, 2000, Superior Pacific was ordered liquidated and CIGA assumed liability for Superior\u2019s \u201ccovered claims\u201d pursuant to section 1063.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">On September 23, 2003, Argonaut filed a petition for reimbursement, seeking $92,903.97 from Superior Pacific/CIGA for indemnity and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>benefits paid to Hooten, based on a medical report apportioning 90 percent of Hooten\u2019s disability to the 1994 specific injury and 10 percent to the 1997 specific injury. Argonaut relied on the WCAB\u2019s in bank opinion in <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Casa Sandoval </em>(2003) 68 Cal.Comp.Cases 753 <em>(Gomez). </em>CIGA argued, inter alia, that it had no liability pursuant to section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) issued joint findings and order, granting Argonaut\u2019s petition for reimbursement. CIGA filed a petition for reconsideration and Argonaut filed an answer. In his report and recommendation to deny reconsideration, the WCJ relied on the <em>Gomez </em>opinion, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cAs the liability of Argonaut and CIGA is <em>not </em>joint and several in these successive injuries cases, pursuant to <em>Gomez </em>. . . , the reimbursement claim of Argonaut is considered a \u2018covered claim\u2019 because there is not \u2018other insurance\u2019 available for the specific portion of liability which may be attributable to the Superior/CIGA injury ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cCIGA\u2019s reliance on Ins. C. \u00a7 1063.1(c)(5) is not directly on point. That section, as well as the cases cited by CIGA in its Petition, appear to be predicated on a claim for \u2018contribution, indemnity and subrogation\u2019 by a solvent insurance carrier against CIGA in a single case, arising out of a single incident or occurrence. That is not the case presented here, nor was it the case in <em>Gomez. </em>This scenario involves separate injuries, with separate insurance carriers on the risk for each injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201cIns. C. \u00a7 1063.1 (c)(9)(ii) also would not appear to be applicable to the case herein. That section refers to \u2018any claim made by a <em>person </em>. . .\u2019 (italics added) and makes no reference to any type of entity oilier than a \u2018person.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The WCAB denied the petition, adopting the report on reconsideration as its own without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">CIGA petitioned this court for a writ of review on the ground that the reimbursement ordered by the WCAB is precluded by section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We originally denied the petition on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>August 17, 2004. The Supreme Court granted CIGA\u2019s ensuing petition for review and transferred the matter to us with directions to vacate our order and issue a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">For the reasons stated in our opinion in <em>Weitzman, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th 307, CIGAis not responsible for Argonaut\u2019s reimbursement claim because the claim is excluded by section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) states: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not' include any obligations to insurers, insurance pools, or underwriting associations, nor their claims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, equitable or otherwise, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) states: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include . . . any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name . . . and does not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Argonaut\u2019s claim is an \u201cobligation[] to [an] insurerf],\u201d Argonaut is not the \u201coriginal claimant under the insurance policy,\u201d and the two provisions expressly exclude \u201cclaims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, equitable or otherwise\u201d and \u201cone claiming by right of subrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We are not persuaded by Argonaut\u2019s contention that section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii) does not apply because there is no joint and several liability where there are separate, successive injuries covered by different insurers, and thus, its claim for reimbursement is not a claim for \u201ccontribution, indemnity, or subrogation.\u201d Neither of these provisions, nor any other provision of the statutes governing CIGA, contains any language indicating the Legislature intended to treat joint and several claims by insurers differently than other claims. To the contrary, subdivision (c)(5) excludes not only claims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation but also \u201cany obligations to insurers.\u201d (See <em>Burnsed v. State Bd. of Control </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 213, 217 [234 Cal.Rptr. 316] [\u201cFrom the earliest days of statehood the courts have interpreted \u2018any\u2019 to be broad, general, and all embracing\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">The WCJ\u2019s interpretation of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) as applying only to \u201ca single case, arising out of a single incident or occurrence\u201d is faulty for the same reason\u2014there is no language in the statute indicating the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>intended to narrow the scope of the exclusion in this manner. (See, e.g., <em>Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 370, 381 [267 Cal.Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976] [in construing statutory provisions, \u201ca court is not authorized to insert qualifying provisions not included and may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The WCAB\u2019s narrow construction of \u201cperson\u201d in subdivision (c)(9)(ii) as limited to human beings also is faulty. \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means any person, association, organization, partnership, business trust, limited liability company, or corporation.\u201d (\u00a7 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii) bars Argonaut\u2019s reimbursement claim. The WCAB\u2019s order is annulled. We remand with instructions to respondent WCAB to vacate its order and issue a new order denying Argonaut\u2019s reimbursement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Gilbert, P. J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The petition of respondent Argonaut Insurance Company for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 27, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> All statutory references are to the Insurance Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> CIGA also argued that the WCAB had no jurisdiction to issue an award against it because it was not properly joined as a party defendant and that the statute of limitations barred the claim. CIGA did not pursue these arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\"> CIGA\u2019s petition for review to this court included an argument that the WCAB lacked jurisdiction over disputes involving reimbursement claims against it by other insurers. This argument was not in CIGA\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court and we consider the issue abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
