We conclude the answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d The hospital\u2019s failure to begin the hearing on time, without more, does not render the administrative remedy of the peer review process inadequate or unavailable and does not constitute such a deprivation of \u201cfair procedure\u201d that the physician is entitled to escape peer review altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We also conclude that a physician facing peer review cannot avoid the process by claiming that the hearing officer and/or panel members appointed by the hospital are impermissibly biased. Because subdivision (c) of section 809.2 provides a method for raising the issue of bias in the administrative proceeding, the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine requires the physician to raise the issue of bias before the hearing officer. The physician cannot escape that requirement simply by claiming the hearing officer is biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Based on these conclusions, we will issue a peremptory writ of mandate granting the relief petitioners seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We begin with our cast of players. Petitioner Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (KFH) is a California not-for-profit public benefit corporation that owns Kaiser Foundation Hospital\u2014Sacramento/Roseville, a licensed general acute care hospital (the Hospital). Petitioner Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (KFHP) is a health care service plan that contracts with KFH to provide hospital services to KFHP\u2019s members. Petitioner Jack Rozance is the chief of staff of the professional staff at the Hospital. Petitioner Robert Azevedo is the chief of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Hospital. Petitioner The Permanente Medical Group (TPMG) is a professional corporation that contracts with KFHP to provide medical services to KFHP\u2019s members. Finally, real party in interest Debbie Dennis-Johnson is a licensed physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In November 2001, TPMG hired Dr. Dennis as an associate physician. At the same time, Dr. Dennis joined the professional staff of the Hospital and obtained provisional OB/GYN privileges there.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">On March 19, 2003, Dr. Azevedo informed Dr. Dennis that the Hospital was summarily suspending her gynecological surgery privileges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, TPMG terminated Dr. Dennis\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">By letter dated March 31, 2003, Dr. Rozance notified Dr. Dennis that she was entitled to request a hearing on the termination of her employment. Dr. Dennis requested that hearing on April 8, 2003. About a week later, Dr. Dennis received another letter from Dr. Rozance notifying her that she was entitled to request a hearing on the summary suspension of her surgical privileges. Dr. Dennis requested that hearing on April 29, and the Hospital received the request the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Under the Hospital\u2019s bylaws and TPMG\u2019s policy manual, Dr. Dennis was entitled to a single hearing addressing both the termination of her employment and the suspension of her surgical privileges, because both events arose from the same set of circumstances. The hearing was supposed to begin within 60 days after receipt of Dr. Dennis\u2019s requests for a hearing. Thus, at least with respect to the suspension of Dr. Dennis\u2019s surgical privileges, the hearing was supposed to begin by the end of June.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Under the Hospital\u2019s bylaws, the hearing was to be held before an ad hoc judicial review committee (JRC), appointed by the chief of staff (Dr. Rozance), the members of which were to serve \u201cas the initial finder of fact in this hearing and appeal process.\u201d The members of the JRC were to be other practitioners \u201cwho shall gain no direct financial benefit from the outcome, who have not acted as accusers, investigators, fact finders or initial decision makers in the same matter, and who have not previously taken an active part in the consideration of the matter contested.\u201d The bylaws also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>provided for appointment of an attorney as a hearing officer to preside over the hearing. TPMG\u2019s policy manual provided for similar requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">On May 6, 2003, the Hospital\u2019s attorney, Ross Campbell, wrote to Dr. Dennis\u2019s attorney, Stephen Schear, and named two attorneys who were under consideration for appointment as the hearing officer. Campbell stated he wanted to talk to Schear about the two candidates \u201cin the near future.\u201d Although the Hospital was entitled to set the hearing date unilaterally, it is Campbell\u2019s practice to set hearing dates for hospital peer review hearings by mutual agreement of counsel. Thus, Campbell also stated in his letter that he wanted to talk to Schear about \u201cpotential hearing dates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The following day, Schear responded regarding the hearing officer candidates, objecting to one of them, and indicated he would be out of the office until May 19. He offered no response regarding potential hearing dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">On May 13, 2003, a joint notice of charges issued, setting forth the reasons for the adverse actions taken against Dr. Dennis. The notice referred to various problems that allegedly occurred in eight of her cases, including, among other things, improper surgical technique, inadequate informed consent processing, and inadequate charting. The notice further stated that \u201c[sjelection of a hearing panel and hearing officer is proceeding as well as the determination of dates for the hearing, which will be coordinated with your attorney. Once these details have been finalized, you will be informed in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">On May 28, 2003, Schear wrote to Campbell, objecting to the Hospital\u2019s second hearing officer candidate on the ground there was \u201ca significant risk that [he] will favor Kaiser and/or TPMG at the hearing in order to continue receiving work from them.\u201d Schear \u201ccontinue[d] to insist that the hearing officer and the panelists be chosen by mutual agreement rather than by [Campbell] or [the Hospital], in order to ensure a fair and objective process.\u201d Schear further stated that Dr. Dennis did \u201cnot consent to and has not waived any of her procedural rights, including her right to compliance with policies, bylaws, and statutes requiring timely notice and hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On June 13, 2003, Campbell responded to Schear, noting that while he \u201cnaturally prefer[ed] to work with [Schear] so that both the hearing officer and panelists are acceptable as that will make the process run more efficiently,\u201d he would \u201cnot agree to a hearing officer and panelists] chosen by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u2018mutual agreement.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He further stated that Schear \u201cobviously ha[d] a right to voir dire any hearing officer or panel member and to disqualify any such individual for a valid reason as provided for in Section 809.2.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In closing his letter, Campbell suggested a telephone discussion, noting they had \u201ca number of things to discuss, the most important of which is identifying hearing dates that are workable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The attorneys apparently had that telephone discussion on June 19. Schear followed up that conversation with a letter the next day, in which he insisted it was \u201cplainly a violation of due process for [the Hospital] and TPMG to unilaterally appoint the hearing officer and panel members.\u201d Citing <em>Haas v. County of San Bernardino </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1017 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 45 P.3d 280], Schear asserted that the Hospital\u2019s bylaws and TPMG\u2019s policies \u201cviolate due process on their face,\u201d and he insisted that for this reason Dr. Dennis was \u201cnot required to submit to the hearing process because it is an inadequate remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">On June 27, 2003, Campbell responded to Schear, asserting <em>Haas </em>was inapplicable because, among other things, it \u201cdealt with due process concepts applicable to governmental agencies.\u201d Campbell asserted the Hospital\u2019s selection of the hearing officer and members of the JRC was consistent with state law, and any objections Dr. Dennis had could be addressed to the hearing officer pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 809.2. Campbell agreed with Schear\u2019s \u201capparent wish to proceed with the hearing as soon as reasonably possible\u201d and stated they would \u201ctry to have a panel selected and a hearing officer chosen by the time [Schear] retum[ed] from [his] early July vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Less than a week later, on July 2, 2003, Dr. Dennis filed a complaint in the superior court for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against KFH, KFHP, Dr. Rozance, and Dr. Azevedo (the Kaiser action) (case No. 03AS03739).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Dennis sought damages on a variety of tort theories (e.g., race and gender discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Housing Act), alleging, among other things, that Kaiser had retaliated against her for complaining of harassment by Dr. Azevedo. In her first of 20 \u201ccounts,\u201d Dr. Dennis sought a judicial declaration that she was \u201cnot required to exhaust [the Hospital\u2019s] hearing process,\u201d on the ground the process would deny her \u201ca fair hearing before a neutral and unbiased decision-maker\u201d and on the ground \u201cit was not made available to her within the time required by statute and due process.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">On July 24, 2003, Campbell wrote to Schear and notified him that a hearing officer and JRC had been selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On September 23, 2003, Campbell wrote to the hearing officer and requested a ruling that Dr. Dennis had waived her right to a hearing regarding the termination of her employment with TPMG because she had failed \u201cto move forward with the hearing regarding the termination action for the past six months.\u201d On October 13, the hearing officer wrote to Campbell and Schear, refusing a request from Schear that the hearing officer recuse himself from the matter and ruling that Dr. Dennis had not waived her right to a hearing on her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On December 8, 2003, Dr. Dennis filed a motion for summary adjudication in the Kaiser action on her cause of action for declaratory relief. She argued she was entitled to a judicial declaration that she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedy because: (1) she did not get a hearing within 60 days; (2) the Hospital\u2019s hearing process violates due process requirements of impartiality; and (3) she would be irreparably harmed if she were required to pursue the hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">On December 19, 2003, Dr. Dennis filed a complaint in the superior court against TPMG seeking reinstatement to her employment (the TPMG action) (case No. 03AS06960). Like her complaint in the Kaiser action, Dr. Dennis\u2019s complaint against TPMG included a cause of action for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that she was not required to proceed with the peer review hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">On January 30, 2004, Kaiser filed a cross-motion for summary adjudication in the Kaiser action on Dr. Dennis\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action, essentially seeking a declaration that Dr. Dennis was required to exhaust the peer review hearing process before resorting to the courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>soon followed by an identical motion in the TPMG action. The Kaiser action and the TPMG action were then consolidated for the purpose of law and motion, which ensured that all three summary adjudication motions would be heard together.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">A hearing on the summary adjudication motions was held on April 28, 2004, and the superior court took the matter under submission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On May 24, the superior court issued its ruling denying Kaiser\u2019s and TPMG\u2019s motions and granting Dr. Dennis\u2019s motion. That ruling was incorporated into formal orders entered in both actions on July 1, 2004. The court concluded that because a hearing \u201cwas not timely held,\u201d and Dr. Dennis did not consent to the delay, Dr. Dennis was not required to exhaust her administrative remedy before pursuing her superior court actions. According to the court, because \u201cno viable administrative remedy contemplated by Business and Professions Code section 809, et seq., was ever made available to [Dr. Dennis] on a timely basis,\u201d \u201cthere was no administrative remedy that she could be required to exhaust before resorting to the court.\u201d The court commented on Dr. Dennis\u2019s alternate argument that she should be excused from completing the peer review process because it \u201c \u2018does not square with the requirements of due process\u2019 however, the court concluded that a ruling on that argument was \u201cunnecessary to [its] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Kaiser and TPMG filed a joint petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition or other appropriate relief in this court, seeking to compel the superior court to set aside its orders on the summary adjudication motions and \u201crestraining the Respondent Court from exercising jurisdiction vested in the peer review panel and hearing officer.\u201d We issued an alternative writ and stayed all further proceedings in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\n<em>Statutory Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We begin with an overview of the peer review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u201cUnder state law, a licensed hospital facility must have \u2018a formally organized and self-governing medical staff responsible for \u201cthe adequacy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>quality of the medical care rendered to patients in the hospital.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] The medical staff acts primarily through a number of peer review committees, which, along with other responsibilities, assess the performance of physicians currently on staff .... [Citation.] If a peer review committee recommends that the privileges of the physician be restricted or revoked because of the manner in which he or she exercised those privileges, a series of procedural mechanisms kick into play\u2014all governed by state law. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u201cIn 1989, the state Legislature enacted California Business and Professions Code section 809 et seq. for the purpose of opting out of the federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101 et seq.), which was passed to encourage physicians to engage in effective peer review. California chose to design a peer review system of its own, and did so with the enactment of these sections. [Citation.] Section 809 provides generally that peer review, fairly conducted, is essential to preserving the highest standards of medical practice and that peer review which is not conducted fairly results in harm both to patients and healing arts practitioners by limiting access to care. [Citation.] The statute thus recognizes not only the balance between the rights of the physician to practice his or her profession and the duty of the hospital to ensure quality care, but also the importance of a fair procedure, free of arbitrary and discriminatory acts. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe statutory scheme delegates to the private sector the responsibility to provide fairly conducted peer review in accordance with due process,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] including notice, discovery and hearing rights, all specified in the statute. [Citations.] A hospital is required to establish high professional and ethical standards and to maintain those standards through careful selection and review of its staff. [Citation.] To comply with the statute\u2019s mandate, the hospital\u2019s medical staff must adopt bylaws that include formal procedures for \u2018 \u201cthe evaluation of staff applications and credentials, appointments, reappointments, assignment of clinical privileges, appeals mechanisms and such other subjects or conditions which the medical staff and governing body deem appropriate.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] It is these bylaws that govern the parties\u2019 administrative rights. [Citation.] Section 809, subdivision (a)(8) provides that medical staff bylaws in an acute care hospital setting shall include written provisions implementing sections 809 to 809.8.\u201d <em>(Unnamed Physician </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 607, 616-617, fh. omitted [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 309].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The peer review process provided for in section 809 et seq. applies to \u201ca final proposed action of a peer review body for which a report is required to be filed under Section 805,\u201d and a section 805 report must be filed when \u201c[a] licentiate\u2019s membership, staff privileges, or employment is terminated or revoked for a medical disciplinary cause or reason.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 809.1, subd. (a), 805, subd. (b)(2); see \u00a7\u00a7 809.2, 809.3, subd. (a), 809.4, subd. (a).) Thus, the peer review process applies to the termination of a physician\u2019s employment just as much as it does to the restriction or revocation of a physician\u2019s hospital privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>The 60-day Deadline</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Section 809.2 sets forth various requirements that apply when a physician requests a peer review hearing. With respect to the timing of the hearing, subdivision (h) of section 809.2 (hereafter section 809.2(h)) provides: \u201cA hearing under this section shall be commenced within 60 days after receipt of the request for hearing, and the peer review process shall be completed within a reasonable time, after a licentiate receives notice of a final proposed action or an immediate suspension or restriction of clinical privileges, unless the arbitrator or presiding officer issues a written decision finding that the licentiate failed to comply with [provisions governing disclosure obligations] in a timely manner, or consented to the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Consistent with section 809.2(h), the Hospital\u2019s bylaws provided as follows: \u201cAfter consultation with the members of the Judicial Review Committee and the practitioner, the Chief of Staff shall fix the place and time of the hearing, on a date within sixty (60) days of the Professional Staff\u2019s receipt of the practitioner\u2019s request for hearing.\u201d Similarly, TPMG\u2019s policy manual provided: \u201cIf the practitioner requests a hearing, it must be commenced within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">It is undisputed that on April 30, 2003, the Hospital received Dr. Dennis\u2019s request for a hearing regarding the suspension of her surgical privileges. Thus, pursuant to section 809.2(h) and the Hospital\u2019s bylaws (and absent a written finding by the hearing officer that Dr. Dennis had failed to comply with her disclosure obligations in a timely manner or consented to a delay), the hearing was required to begin by June 29. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Likewise, while the date TPMG received Dr. Dennis\u2019s request for a hearing regarding termination of her employment does not appear in the record, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>undisputed the hearing thereon did not begin in the time required by section 809.2(h). The issue here is the effect of the failure to begin the hearing by the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">In their petition, Kaiser and TPMG frame the issue before us as whether the 60-day deadline for commencing a peer review hearing under section 809.2(h) is \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201cdirectory.\u201d This formulation of the issue refers to a well-established body of case law addressing the consequence of a government agency\u2019s or officer\u2019s failure to act as required by law. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Morris v. County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606]: \u201c[T]he \u2018directory\u2019 or \u2018mandatory\u2019 designation . . . denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates. [Citations.] fiO Thus, for example, if a court determines that a city council\u2019s failure to comply with a particular procedural step in enacting an ordinance does not invalidate the resulting ordinance, which is the culmination of those steps, the procedural requirement is referred to as \u2018directory.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 908-909, fn. omitted.) \u201c[T]he \u2018directory-mandatory\u2019 distinction is concerned only with whether a particular remedy\u2014invalidation of the ultimate governmental action\u2014is appropriate when a procedural requirement is violated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 908, fn. 4, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Here, Dr. Dennis does not seek to invalidate a governmental action based on the failure of a government agency or officer to comply with a particular procedural requirement applicable to that agency or officer. Rather, she seeks to proceed with superior court actions for damages and other relief against Kaiser and TPMG\u2014private entities\u2014without first completing the peer review process. Thus, the primary question before us is this: If a peer review hearing is not \u201ccommenced within 60 days\u201d as required by section 809.2(h), and the presiding officer has not found in writing that the physician failed to comply with her disclosure obligations in a timely manner or consented to the delay, is the physician excused from completing the peer review process and allowed to proceed immediately with an action for damages and/or other relief in the superior court? To answer that question, we turn to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\n<em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that where a remedy before an administrative agency is provided by statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>regulation, or ordinance, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will act.\u201d (2 Cal.Jur.3d (1999) Administrative Law, \u00a7 668, pp. 95-96.) \u201cExhaustion of available administrative remedies is a condition precedent to obtaining judicial relief, even though the party has a cause of action which is properly triable in the courts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 98, fn. omitted.) \u201cWhere an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and the remedy exhausted before the courts will act; a court violating the rule acts in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Hollon v. Pierce </em>(1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 468, 475 [64 Cal.Rptr. 808].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In <em>Westlake Community Hosp. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 R2d 410], the California Supreme Court held the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies to hospital peer review proceedings. According to the court, \u201cbefore a doctor may initiate litigation challenging the propriety of a hospital\u2019s denial or withdrawal of privileges, he must exhaust the available internal remedies afforded by the hospital.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">As another California appellate court recently explained, \u201ca doctor who is challenging the propriety of a hospital\u2019s denial or withdrawal of staff privileges must pursue the internal remedies afforded by that hospital to a final decision on the merits before resorting to the courts for relief. [Citations.] This requirement both accords recognition to the expertise of the organization\u2019s quasi-judicial tribunal and promotes judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and providing a record that the court may review. [Citation.] \u2018The exhaustion doctrine \u201cis not a matter of judicial discretion, but is a fundamental rule of procedure\u201d [citation] under which \u201crelief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act\u201d [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Unnamed Physician v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 619-620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Dr. Dennis points to nothing in the statutes governing the peer review process that exempts a physician from exhausting that process simply because the hospital or employer fails to begin the hearing within 60 days of receiving the physician\u2019s request for a hearing. Had the Legislature intended such a result, it could have specifically provided for that result, as it has in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>contexts. For example, Government Code section 18671.1 specifies that the California State Personnel Board must render a decision following a hearing or investigation of a state employee\u2019s appeal from a departmental disciplinary action within six months from the date the petition is filed or 90 days from the time the matter is submitted following investigation or hearing, whichever is less. (See <em>California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1137-1138 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 693, 899 P.2d 79].) The statute further \u201cprovides that if the Board does not render a decision within the time limits, the employee will be deemed to have exhausted all available administrative remedies.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See <em>California Correctional Police Officers Assn., </em>at p. 1138.) No similar language appears anywhere in the peer review statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">With nothing in the applicable statutes to support her argument, Dr. Dennis relies on some of the traditional exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. \u201cA limited number of exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine have long been recognized in California. Generally, these exceptions apply when the subject matter of the controversy lies outside the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction, when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm, when the administrative remedy is inadequate or unavailable, and when the administrative remedy is futile as the aggrieved party can positively state what the administrative agency\u2019s decision in his particular case would be. The exhaustion doctrine also has not been applied where the agency indulges in unreasonable delay, or, at least in one instance, on grounds of general fairness and equity.\u201d (2 Cal.Jur.3d, <em>supra, </em>Administrative Law, \u00a7 692, p. 128, fhs. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Here, Dr. Dennis argues that \u201cthe administrative remedy offered by petitioners was unavailable and does not \u2018square with the requirements of due process\u2019 \u201d and that she \u201csuffered irreparable harm because of petitioners\u2019 failure to give her a timely hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>The \u201cDue Process\u201d Exception To Exhaustion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We begin with Dr. Dennis\u2019s argument based on \u201cdue process.\u201d Throughout this proceeding, Dr. Dennis has repeatedly asserted that she has been denied \u201cdue process.\u201d To the extent Dr. Dennis means to suggest she has a right to due process of law under the state and federal Constitutions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>respect to the peer review process, she is mistaken. As explained in <em>Goodstein v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1257 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 577], \u201c \u2018[s]ince the actions of a private institution are not necessarily those of the state, the controlling concept in such cases is fair procedure and not due process. Fair procedure rights apply when the organization involved is one affected with a public interest, such as a private hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1265, quoting <em>Applebaum v. Board of Directors </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 648, 657 [163 Cal.Rptr. 831].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Since Kaiser and TPMG are private institutions, whatever fair procedure rights Dr. Dennis has arise from section 809 et seq. and not from the due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent Dr. Dennis relies on cases involving the constitutional right to \u201cdue process,\u201d her reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In <em>Unnamed Physician v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at page 620, drawing upon a well-established body of case law involving administrative remedies provided by governmental agencies, the court stated that \u201c[a] remedy is not adequate if it does not square with the requirements of due process.\u201d Dr. Dennis relies on this statement in suggesting that the failure of the Hospital and TPMG to begin her hearing in the time allowed by section 809.2(h) made the administrative remedy \u201cinadequate.\u201d But because Dr. Dennis is entitled to \u201cfair procedure\u201d under the peer review statutes, and not to \u201cdue process\u201d under the state and federal Constitutions, the cases underlying the rule stated in <em>Unnamed Physician </em>do not apply to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In <em>Applebaum v. Board of Directors, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at page 657, the court observed that \u201c[t]he distinction between fair procedure and due process rights appears to be one of origin and not of the extent of protection afforded an individual; the essence of both rights is fairness.\u201d But this does not assist Dr. Dennis. Under the rule on which Dr. Dennis attempts to rely, \u201cAn administrative remedy is inadequate where the agency does not provide for a hearing and the taking of evidence or adequate protection of due process rights.\u201d (2 Cal.Jur.3d, <em>supra, </em>Administrative Law, \u00a7 700, p. 138.) For example, in <em>Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609], our Supreme Court held that an administrative remedy which provided \u201cmerely for the submission of a grievance form, without the taking of testimony, the submission of legal briefs, or resolution by an impartial finder of fact [wa]s manifestly inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to handle disputes of [a] crucial and complex nature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 342-343.) Thus, an administrative remedy may be deemed inadequate if it fails to provide basic due process protections. The failure to begin a hearing by a certain date cannot be equated with the denial of basic due process protections such as the right to adequate notice of charges and a reasonable opportunity to respond to those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In ruling that Dr. Dennis was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies, the superior court cited the following passage from <em>Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at page 478: \u201cWhen a hospital denies staff privileges to a doctor without affording him the basic procedural protection to which he is legally entitled, the hospital and parties acting in concert with the hospital can offer no convincing reason or justification why they should be insulated from an immediate tort suit for damages.\u201d In effect, the superior court treated the failure to begin Dr. Dennis\u2019s hearing within the 60-day statutory period as the denial of a \u201cbasic procedural protection to which [Dr. Dennis was] legally entitled\u201d within the meaning of <em>Westlake. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The flaw in this reasoning becomes apparent on a closer review of <em>Westlake. </em>In <em>Westlake, </em>one hospital (Los Robles) rejected the application of a physician (Dr. Kaiman) to join its staff, but it did not appear from the evidence Los Robles submitted in support of its summary judgment motion that an administrative remedy was actually available for Dr. Kaiman to challenge that decision, nor did it appear that Los Robles had ever informed Dr. Kaiman of the availability of such a remedy. <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 472-473, 477-478.) On these facts, the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cInasmuch as the present affidavits do not indicate that Los Robles ever informed Dr. Kaiman that she had any right to contest the denial of membership privileges within the hospital\u2019s own hierarchy, defendants cannot rely on plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to exhaust such remedies to bar her action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Los Robles then argued \u201cthat even if the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies does not bar plaintiff\u2019s tort action with respect to the events at Los Robles, the trial court should still have granted their motion for summary judgment as to Los Robles because plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy is to challenge the Los Robles exclusion by a writ of mandate, rather than in a tort action for damages.\u201d <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 478.) The Supreme Court disagreed, stating: \u201c[W]hen a hospital excludes or dismisses a doctor from staff privileges pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, the aggrieved doctor must initially succeed in a mandamus action before pursuing a tort remedy. Plaintiff\u2019s exclusion at Los Robles however, was not undertaken pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding; the hospital did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>not inform plaintiff of the reason for her exclusion nor did it notify her of a right to respond to the charges against her.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It was in this context that the Supreme Court referred to a hospital\u2019s failure to afford a physician \u201cthe basic procedural protection to which he is legally entitled.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We are not persuaded that the failure to commence a peer review hearing within the 60-day statutory period can be equated with failing to inform the physician of the reason for the adverse decision against her or failing to notify her of her right to respond to the charges against her. These latter failures deprive the physician of basic procedural protections that are fundamental to <em>any </em>fair administrative remedy, whether the remedy is governed by principles of \u201cfair procedure\u201d or \u201cdue process.\u201d (See <em>Applebaum </em>v. <em>Board of Directors, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at p. 657 [noting that \u201c[ajdequate notice of charges and a reasonable opportunity to respond are basic to both\u201d fair procedure and due process].) Although the failure to provide Dr. Dennis with a hearing certainly would have constituted a denial of a basic procedural protection justifying an immediate tort action under <em>Westlake, </em>it does not follow that the failure to commence the required hearing by the statutory deadline requires the same result. That is particularly true where, as here, the parties were still exchanging correspondence about the selection of a hearing officer and panel members when the statutory deadline passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In short, we conclude the failure to begin the hearing within the 60-day statutory period, without more, does not constitute a denial of \u201cfair procedure\u201d that would exempt Dr. Dennis from the requirement that she exhaust her administrative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>The Unavailability and Irreparable Harm Exceptions To Exhaustion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">We now turn to the other exceptions to the exhaustion requirement on which Dr. Dennis relies. On the issue of unavailability, Dr. Dennis contends that because the Hospital failed to start the hearing on time, no \u201cviable\u201d administrative remedy was made available to her. But Dr. Dennis fails to offer any persuasive basis for construing the 60-day statutory deadline as a bright line of viability\u2014that is, Dr. Dennis does not explain why a hearing that begins on the 60th day is \u201cviable\u201d but a hearing that begins on the 61st day is not. Thus, we reject the contention that the failure to begin the peer review hearing on time, by itself, makes the peer review process \u201cunavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>On the issue of irreparable harm, Dr. Dennis contends she should be excused from completing the peer review process because she has suffered irreparable harm from the Hospital\u2019s failure to give her a timely hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u201cAn exception to the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies may arise where one can show that irreparable injury will result if an administrative hearing is permitted to proceed and its orders are made effective without prior judicial interference.\u201d (2 Cal. Jur.3d, <em>supra, </em>Administrative Law, \u00a7 703, p. 143.) Stated another way, failure to exhaust may be excused \u201cwhen pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm.\u201d <em>(Ogo Associates v. City of Torrance </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 830, 834 [112 Cal.Rptr. 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Thus, to show irreparable harm justifying an exception from the exhaustion requirement, Dr. Dennis must show harm that will irreparably result if the administrative process, rather than the court action, is allowed to go forward. Dr. Dennis fails to explain how requiring her to proceed with a peer review hearing that was not commenced within the 60-day period provided by section 809.2(h), instead of allowing her to proceed with an immediate action in superior court, would cause her irreparable harm. The harm to which Dr. Dennis refers\u2014the alleged \u201cdevastation] \u201d of her career caused by the summary suspension of her gynecological surgical privileges and the termination of her employment\u2014has already occurred (if it has occurred at all). She fails to explain how .this harm will be irreparable if the administrative process is allowed to go forward, but will not be if she is allowed to go forward with her actions in superior court. Accordingly, the irreparable harm exception to the exhaustion requirement does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In summary, Dr. Dennis has failed to provide any persuasive authority to support her claim that the failure of the Hospital and TPMG to begin the peer review hearing on time excused her from completing the peer review process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This does not mean the 60-day deadline was meaningless; it simply means that Dr. Dennis\u2019s recourse is elsewhere than in an immediate superior court action for damages and other relief, such as reinstatement. Specifically, Dr. Dennis could have sought a writ of mandate from the superior court to compel the Hospital to begin the hearing. (Cf. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Bd. of Education </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>1321, 1332 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 872] [where statutory deadline is only directory, any delay beyond the deadline is remediable by petition for writ of ordinary mandamus to compel the decision maker to perform its duty].) She chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Dr. Dennis\u2019s Other Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Having concluded that Dr. Dennis was not entitled to avoid the peer review process merely because the Hospital and TPMG failed to begin the hearing by the statutory deadline, we are faced with how to proceed given that Dr. Dennis offered alternate bases in support of her motion for summary adjudication in the Kaiser action, in opposition to Kaiser\u2019s cross-motion in the Kaiser action, and in opposition to TPMG\u2019s summary adjudication motion in the TPMG action. Most prominently, Dr. Dennis sought summary adjudication in the Kaiser action on the alternate ground that the Hospital\u2019s hearing process violates due process requirements of impartiality. Citing <em>City of Santee v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 713 [279 Cal.Rptr. 22], Dr. Dennis contends \u201cthe correct remedy is for the matter to be remanded to the Superior Court for a formal ruling on Dr. Dennis\u2019 due process claim.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In <em>City of Santee, </em>the city granted a conditional permit to a landowner. <em>(City of Santee v. Superior Court, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at p. 716.) \u201cAlthough advised . . . this decision would become final unless appealed to the planning commission within 10 days, [the landowner] neither appealed this decision to exhaust its administrative remedies, nor sought a writ of mandate challenging either condition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 716-717.) The landowner later \u201csued the City, alleging fraud, breach of mandatory duty and civil conspiracy by City officials in the first cause of action and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\u2019 in the second cause of action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. <em>717, </em>719.) On a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe City asserted immunity with regard to the fraud action and res judicata as to the declaratory relief action contending the administrative writ of mandamus constituted [the landowner\u2019s] exclusive remedy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 717.) The trial court denied the city\u2019s motion on the ground that a mandamus action was not the landowner\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court declined to address the city\u2019s motion with respect to the cause of action for fraud \u201c \u2018because the court does not grant partial summary judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>On the city\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate, the Court of Appeal concluded the landowner\u2019s cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief was barred by its failure to seek review of the city\u2019s decision through administrative mandamus. <em>(City of Santee </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at p. 719.) The appellate court remanded the case to the superior court so that the superior court could rule on the merits of the city\u2019s contentions regarding the fraud cause of action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 719-720.) Such a ruling was necessary because if the city prevailed on its defense to the fraud cause of action also, then the city would be entitled to summary judgment in its favor on the entire action.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Unlike the appellate court in <em>City of Santee, </em>we are not faced with a motion for summary adjudication of a distinct cause of action upon which the superior court declined to rule and which, if successful, would result in a summary judgment. Instead, we are faced with an alternate argument offered to justify a ruling the superior court has already made. In essence, Dr. Dennis asks us to let the superior court determine in the first instance whether the alternate ground she advanced in support of her summary adjudication motion justifies that court\u2019s ruling that she does not have to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We conclude the proper course of action is to address Dr. Dennis\u2019s alternate argument ourselves. In a writ proceeding such as this, \u201c[w]e review de novo the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary adjudication and are not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons or rationales.\u201d <em>(Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917, 927 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 101].) The question before us on this writ petition is whether the superior court has a clear and present duty to deny Dr. Dennis\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and instead grant Kaiser\u2019s and TPMG\u2019s motions for summary adjudication, and whether Kaiser and TPMG have a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance of that duty. (See <em>Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Bay Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 319 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 628].) We cannot answer that question without evaluating the alternate argument on which Dr. Dennis relies to argue that the superior court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">VH</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\n<em>The Exhaustion Requirement and the Issue of Bias</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Dr. Dennis contends she was excused from completing the peer review process because \u201c[t]he administrative hearing procedures proposed by petitioners here violates [sic] prevailing standards of due process and fair procedures.\u201d More specifically, Dr. Dennis contends petitioners\u2019 unilateral selection of a hearing officer and the JRC violates due process. She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>contends she presented \u201ccompelling undisputed evidence that both the hearing officer and the peer-review panel members proposed by petitioners had substantial financial interests in the outcome of the administrative proceeding in violation of <em>Haas </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino, supra.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As we have explained, case law regarding the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine recognizes that where an administrative remedy denies certain basic procedural protections\u2014such as the right to adequate notice of the charges and a reasonable opportunity to respond to the charges\u2014a plaintiff may be excused from exhausting that remedy. Essentially, Dr. Dennis tries to bring herself within the scope of that rule by arguing that the peer review process offered by Kaiser and TPMG denies her the basic procedural protection of an impartial and unbiased decisionmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Kaiser and TPMG contend Dr. Dennis\u2019s claims of bias are \u201cpremature\u201d because \u201c[t]he Hospital Bylaws and the TPMG Policy Manual set forth procedures for conducting <em>voir dire </em>of the panel and the hearing officer, and provide for the hearing officer to rule on any challenges to their impartiality.\u201d According to Kaiser and TPMG, Dr. Dennis \u201chas yet to avail herself of those procedures, which she must exhaust before seeking relief in the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">There is no doubt that a physician facing a peer review proceeding is entitled to a \u201cfair\u201d proceeding. In enacting section 809 et seq., the Legislature made the following findings which make that point clear: \u201c(3) Peer review, fairly conducted, is essential to preserving the highest standards of medical practice\u201d; \u201c(4) Peer review which is not conducted fairly results in harm both to patients and healing arts practitioners by limiting access to care\u201d; \u201c(5) Peer review, fairly conducted, will aid the appropriate state licensing boards in their responsibility to regulate and discipline errant healing arts practitioners.\u201d (\u00a7 809, subd. (a)(3)-(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The question here, however, is whether a physician can avoid the peer review process and proceed with an immediate action in the superior court for damages and other relief based on the claim that the administrative process does not afford her an unbiased decision maker, when the process itself includes a method for challenging the decision maker which the physician has not exhausted. We conclude the answer to that question is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">We have already explained that a physician like Dr. Dennis is entitled to \u201cfair procedure\u201d as provided for in section 809 et seq. Those statutes endeavor to ensure a fair hearing process by providing two alternatives for the appointment of a decision maker. First, the peer review hearing may be conducted before \u201can arbitrator or arbitrators selected by a process mutually acceptable to the licentiate and the peer review body.\u201d (\u00a7 809.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>subd. (a).) Second, the hearing may be conducted before a peer review panel, with or without a hearing officer. (\u00a7 809.2, subds. (a), (b).) The decision of which alternative will be followed in any particular case is committed to the peer review body. (\u00a7 809.2, subd. (a).) Here, the Hospital\u2019s bylaws and TPMG\u2019s policy manual specify that only the second alternative will be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">To ensure a fair hearing when the peer review body chooses to proceed with a panel and a hearing officer, the statutes provide that the panel members must be \u201cunbiased individuals who shall gain no direct financial benefit from the outcome, [and] who have not acted as an accuser, investigator, factfinder, or initial decisionmaker in the same matter\u201d and the hearing officer must be someone who \u201cgain[s] no direct financial benefit from the outcome, [does] not act as a prosecuting officer or advocate, and [is] not . . . entitled to vote.\u201d (\u00a7 809.2, subds. (a), (b).) The statutes further provide a method for the physician to test the impartiality of the panel members and the hearing officer and to challenge them as necessary. Specifically, subdivision (c) of section 809.2 provides: \u201cThe licentiate shall have the right to a reasonable opportunity to voir dire the panel members and any hearing officer, and the right to challenge the impartiality of any member or hearing officer. Challenges to the impartiality of any member or hearing officer shall be ruled on by the presiding officer, who shall be the hearing officer if one has been selected.\u201d The Hospital\u2019s bylaws and TPMG\u2019s policy manual were consistent with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">From the foregoing review of the governing statutes, it is evident that the Legislature intended to permit the unilateral selection of panel members and a hearing officer by the peer review body. Nothing in <em>Haas v. County of San Bernardino, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 1017, prohibits this practice. In <em>Haas, </em>a case involving an administrative hearing on the revocation of a license by a county board of supervisors, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca temporary administrative hearing officer has a pecuniary interest requiring disqualification when the government unilaterally selects and pays the officer on an ad hoc basis and the officer\u2019s income from future adjudicative work depends entirely on the government\u2019s goodwill.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1021, 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Even assuming that <em>Haas, </em>which rested on constitutional due process principles because of the government action involved, applied here, to a case governed by statutory fair procedure principles, it does not support Dr. Dennis\u2019s attempt to avoid the peer review process altogether because the Hospital and TPMG unilaterally selected the hearing officer and IRC panel members. As the court explained in <em>Haas, </em>\u201cno generally applicable principle of constitutional law permits the affected person ... to select the adjudicator. . . . Neither payment nor selection [by the government agency], considered in isolation, is the problem.\u201d <em>(Haas </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>27 Cal.4th at p. 1031.) Rather, the problem in <em>Haas </em>was that the county unilaterally selected a hearing officer who had an impermissible pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case because of \u201cthe risk that [the] hearing officer [would] be rewarded with future remunerative employment for [a] decision[] favorable to the county.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1037.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Here, even if we assume for the sake of argument that Dr. Dennis has shown, by undisputed evidence, that the hearing officer and/or JRC panel members appointed by the Hospital and TPMG have disqualifying pecuniary interests similar to the hearing officer in <em>Haas, </em>the question before us is whether that showing allows Dr. Dennis to avoid the peer review process altogether and proceed with an action for damages and other relief in the superior court without first exhausting the method provided in the peer review statutes for raising the issue of bias in the administrative proceeding. Stated another way, is Dr. Dennis entitled to have the court decide in the first instance whether the hearing officer and/or JRC panel members are so biased against her that she cannot receive a fair hearing in front of them? Dr. Dennis offers us no authority that supports an affirmative answer to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Anton v. San Antonio Community Hosp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 802 [140 Cal.Rptr. 442, 567 P.2d 1162], a physician sought a writ of mandate to compel a private hospital to reappoint him to its medical staff. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 808.) On appeal from the superior court\u2019s denial of his writ petition, the physician contended he was not afforded the \u201c \u2018minimal requisites of fair procedure required by established common law principles\u2019 \u201d because, among other things, \u201cthree of the five members of the committee were prejudiced against him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 825-826.) The Supreme Court rejected this argument because the physician did not raise the issue of prejudice before the peer review committee or before the hospital\u2019s board of directors at the appellate review hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Anton </em>is consistent with the general requirement that a physician must exhaust administrative remedies before the courts will act. Here, Dr. Dennis has made no effort to exhaust her administrative remedy with respect to the claimed bias of the hearing officer and JRC panel members, nor has she shown that her failure to do so is excused by any of the limited exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. It would be impermissible bootstrapping for Dr. Dennis to claim she is excused from exhausting her administrative remedy on the bias issue because the hearing officer\u2019s and/or panel members\u2019 alleged bias would deny her the right to \u201cfair procedure\u201d to which she is entitled under the peer review statutes. Whether the hearing officer and/or panel members are biased is a question the peer review statutes commit to the hearing officer to decide in the first instance. Thus, this aspect of the peer review process is part of the \u201cfair procedure\u201d to which Dr. Dennis is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In summary, Dr. Dennis has failed to establish any basis for excusing her from the requirement that she must exhaust her administrative remedies in this matter, including that part of the administrative process that allows her to challenge the impartiality of the panel members and hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">VHI</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Unclean Hands</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As an affirmative defense to Kaiser and TPMG\u2019s writ petition, Dr. Dennis alleges they are not entitled to a writ of mandate that would have the effect of requiring her to exhaust her administrative remedies because they have \u201cunclean hands.\u201d According to Dr. Dennis, their hands are unclean \u201cbecause they have never offered her a timely administrative peer-review process that comports with her right to due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u201cIt has . . . been held that the writ [of mandate] should not issue in aid of one who does not come into court with clean hands [citation], or \u2018Where ... the conduct of the party applying for the writ has been such as to render it inequitable to grant him relief . . .\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(San Diego County Dept. of Pub. Welfare v. Superior Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 1, 9 [101 Cal.Rptr. 541, 496 P.2d 453].) As we see it, however, Dr. Dennis\u2019s assertion of unclean hands is merely an attempt to bring in through the back door arguments we have turned away at the front door. We have concluded that the failure of the Hospital and TPMG to begin the peer review hearing by the 60-day deadline did not excuse Dr. Dennis from completing the peer review process. We have also concluded that Dr. Dennis must present her claims of bias to the hearing officer in the first instance. In seeking a writ that would force Dr. Dennis to do what the law requires and exhaust her administrative remedies, Kaiser and TPMG have not come to court with unclean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>The Exhaustion Requirement Applies to All of Dr. Dennis\u2019s Causes of Action in the Kaiser Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Dr. Dennis contends the exhaustion requirement does not apply to all of the causes of action in her complaint in the Kaiser action. Specifically, she contends her \u201cthird and eleventh Counts for unfair competition, and her twelfth though sixteenth Counts for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, are plainly not covered by the exhaustion issue, since plaintiff could prevail on those counts even if the summary suspension was justified.\u201d Kaiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>disagrees, arguing that \u201c[e]ach of those counts relies on the allegedly wrongful nature of the summary restriction of [Dr. Dennis\u2019s] privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We first address Dr. Dennis\u2019s claims of unfair competition. In her third cause of action, Dr. Dennis alleges that KFH has a \u201cpolicy and practice of using the peer review process in bad faith to discipline physicians without good cause,\u201d and this constitutes \u201cunfair competition\u201d under section 17200 et seq. In her eleventh cause of action, Dr. Dennis alleges that KFH and KFHP have a \u201cpolicy and practice ... to retaliate against those who complain about [their] management,\u201d and this too constitutes \u201cunfair competition\u201d under section 17200 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Dr. Dennis contends there is \u201cno rationale or authority for requiring [her] to exhaust remedies before proceeding on the Unfair Competition Counts\u201d because the peer review panel has no \u201cspecial expertise\u201d applicable to those counts. However, the expertise of the peer review panel is only one of the justifications behind the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement. In <em>Westlake, </em>the Supreme Court identified several \u201cpolicy considerations which support the imposition of a general exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 476.) In addition to recognizing the \u201c \u2018expertise\u2019 of the organization\u2019s quasi-judicial tribunal,\u201d the \u201cexhaustion of remedies requirement serves the salutary function of eliminating or mitigating damages\u201d and \u201cpromote[s] judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence [in the administrative proceeding] and by providing a record which the court may review.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>Westlake </em>also includes a further discussion bearing on the issue before us. In addition to holding that the exhaustion requirement applies to hospital peer review proceedings, the court in <em>Westlake </em>held that \u201can individual who has been expelled or excluded from membership in an association after being afforded a quasi-judicial proceeding . . . must first succeed in setting aside the association\u2019s decision in a separate mandamus action\u201d before the individual can bring a tort action for damages. <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 482-483.) In explaining its decision, the court wrote: \u201cAs in a malicious prosecution action, plaintiff\u2019s position rests on a contention that defendants intentionally and maliciously misused a quasi-judicial procedure in order to injure her; such a claim is necessarily premised on an assertion that the hospital\u2019s decision to revoke plaintiff\u2019s privileges was itself erroneous and unjustified. Although a quasi-judicial decision reached by a tribunal of a private association may not be entitled to exactly the same measure of respect as a similar decision of a duly constituted public agency [citation], we believe that so long as such a quasi-judicial decision is not set aside through appropriate review procedures the decision has the effect of establishing the propriety of the hospital\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>action. [Citation.] Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiff must first succeed in overturning the quasi-judicial action before pursuing her tort claim against defendants, [f] In our view, the above requirement accords a proper respect to an association\u2019s quasi-judicial procedure, precluding an aggrieved party from circumventing the established avenue of mandamus review. In addition, this result will simplify court procedures by providing a uniform practice of judicial, rather than jury, review of quasi-judicial administrative decisions. [Citations.] [f] Finally, this procedure affords a justified measure of protection to the individuals who take on, often without remuneration, the difficult, time-consuming and socially important task of policing medical personnel. Because such individuals remain ultimately subject to suit, the procedure outlined above does not conflict with the legislative decision to afford only a conditional privilege to these decisionmakers [citation]; once a court determines in a mandamus proceeding that an association\u2019s quasi-judicial decision cannot stand, either because of a substantive or procedural defect, the prevailing party is entitled to initiate a tort action against the hospital and its board or committee members or staff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Here, in her third cause of action in the Kaiser action, Dr. Dennis essentially seeks to have a jury decide whether KFH \u201cuse[d] [its] peer review process in bad faith to discipline [her] without good cause,\u201d and in her eleventh cause of action seeks to have a jury decide whether KFH and KFHP \u201cretaliated] against [her for] complaining] of discrimination [and] harassment.\u201d Although Dr. Dennis also seeks to show that the actions of KFH and KFHP against her are consistent with a \u201cpolicy and practice\u201d more broadly applied, it remains true that the actions <em>toward her </em>in summarily suspending her gynecological surgery privileges are central to her unfair competition claims. At this point, however, Dr. Dennis has not exhausted the administrative process by which she is entitled to challenge whether the Hospital had a legitimate basis for suspending her privileges. Unless and until she succeeds in having the decision to suspend her privileges overturned, either through the peer review process or through an administrative mandamus proceeding following the peer review process, Dr. Dennis cannot be allowed to proceed with unfair competition claims that rest \u201con a contention that [KFH and KFHP] intentionally and maliciously misused a quasi-judicial procedure in order to injure her.\u201d <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We turn now to Dr. Dennis\u2019s claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Dr. Dennis contends she is not required to exhaust the peer review process before pursuing these claims because \u201c[petitioners\u2019 administrative body of physicians has no special expertise in fraud\u201d and her \u201cactions for fraud and negligent misrepresentation are not factually dependent on the summary suspension being wrongful.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In her twelfth through sixteenth causes of action, Dr. Dennis alleges that KFH and Dr. Rozance made various negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations to her before and after she was hired. Specifically, she contends KFH falsely told her before she was hired that she was being hired on the \u201c \u2018career track\u2019 \u201d and that she would have a permanent position as a Kaiser physician. She also contends KFH failed to inform her that \u201cher lack of experience in laparoscopy and pelviscopy could or would impair her ability to obtain full clinical privileges . . . and . . . her ability to continue to practice medicine at [the Hospital] and . . . lead to . . . the restriction or loss of her privileges to do gynecological surgery at [the Hospital] and ... to the loss of her employment with TPMG.\u201d She further contends Dr. Rozance falsely told her in February 2003 \u201cthat she would be given a fair opportunity to seek senior physician status and that there was a mutual desire to take constructive steps to address any perceived deficiencies.\u201d In each of the five causes of action, Dr. Dennis alleges that as a result of the negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions she \u201chas suffered lost earnings, damage to her reputation, a loss of earning capacity in the future, and emotional distress, humiliation and anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We conclude Dr. Dennis\u2019s pursuit of these causes of action is barred at this time for the same reason the pursuit of her unfair competition claims is barred. So long as the peer review process remains unexhausted, the Hospital\u2019s decision to summarily suspend her gynecological surgery privileges retains the imprimatur of propriety. In other words, in the eyes of the law, the Hospital had a valid reason for its action until Dr. Dennis proves otherwise through the peer review process or any administrative mandamus review that may follow. Dr. Dennis fails to explain how if she does not to establish that the suspension of her surgical privileges was wrongful through the avenues available to her, she can nonetheless prove that the negative consequences that allegedly flowed from the suspension of her privileges (i.e., lost earnings, damage to her reputation, etc.) resulted from wrongful conduct by Kaiser rather than from a proper and valid decision by the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In summary, we conclude the superior court should have denied Dr. Dennis\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on her cause of action for declaratory relief in the Kaiser action and instead should have granted Kaiser\u2019s cross-motion for summary adjudication, as well as TPMG\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the cause of action for declaratory relief in the TPMG action.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The petition is granted. Let a peremptory writ issue directing the respondent court to: (1) vacate its order in case No. 03AS03739 granting Dr. Dennis\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and denying Kaiser\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the count for declaratory relief; (2) vacate its order in case No. 03AS06960 denying TPMG\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the count for declaratory relief; (3) enter a new order in case No. 03AS03739 denying Dr. Dennis\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and granting Kaiser\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the count for declaratory relief; and (4) enter a new order in case No. 03AS06960 granting TPMG\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the count for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Petitioners shall be entitled to recover their costs in this proceeding.
