Snow filed a-petition for writ of mandate to require the California Department of Corrections (Department) to rescind a regulation prohibiting inmates from possessing sexually explicit materials, combined with a request for declaratory relief to declare the regulation violates the federal and California constitutions and Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (c). Snow appeals the order dismissing the petition and request for declaratory relief, contending (1) the regulation violates the First Amendment and (2) the regulation violates Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">On July 10, 2002, Department issued a policy prohibiting inmates from possessing or receiving materials showing the frontal nudity of either gender. Frontal nudity is defined as \u201cincluding either the exposed female breast(s) and/or genitalia of either gender.\u201d In issuing this policy, Department relied upon <em>Mauro </em>v. <em>Arpaio </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 188 F.3d 1054 <em>(Mauro) </em>(en banc), which upheld the constitutionality of a similar Arizona policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 18, 2002, officials at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility (Donovan), where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Snow was housed, issued a letter notifying inmates that the ban would go into effect on September 9, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In September 2002, Department issued a notice of adoption of emergency regulations (the Notice) to amend title 15 California Code of Regulations, section 3006<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by adding subdivision (c)(17), which bans possession of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201c(17) Sexually explicit images that depict frontal nudity in the form of personal photographs, drawings, magazines, or other pictorial format.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c(A) Sexually explicit material shall be defined as material that shows the frontal nudity of either gender, including the exposed female breast(s) and/or the genitalia of either gender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201c(B) The following sexually explicit material shall be allowed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201c1. Departmentally purchased or acquired educational, medical/scientific, or artistic materials, such as books or guides purchased by the department for including in institution libraries and/or educational areas; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201c2. Educational, medical/scientific, or artistic materials, including, but not limited to, anatomy medical reference books, general practitioner reference books and/or guides, National Geographic, or artistic reference material depicting historical, modem, and/or post modem era art, purchased or possessed by inmates and approved by the institution head or their designee on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">In the Notice, Department analyzes the amendment to section 3006 as follows: \u201cThis regulation will aid in the legitimate penological interests of maintaining the safety and security of the prisons, rehabilitating inmates, reducing sexual harassment of correctional officers and preventing a hostile work environment. Sexually explicit materials, within institutions, have contributed to an increase of verbal assaults and have led to intimidation of female correctional staff when attempting to perform cell searches. Inmates subject female correctional staff to a daily barrage of unwarranted sexual advances, thus causing an uncomfortable working environment and continued confrontation with inmates. [1] Additionally, unrestricted access to sexually explicit material could lead to bartering between inmates and anatomical comparisons could lead to fights between inmates thereby jeopardizing the safety of prison staff and other inmates.\u201d The amendment was adopted on March 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>On August 15, 2002, Snow filed a petition for writ of mandate to require Department to rescind the ban on possession of sexually explicit materials, combined with a request for declaratory relief to declare the ban violates the federal and California constitutions and Penal Code sections 2601, subdivision (c). On November 15, 2002, Snow filed an administrative appeal challenging the confiscation of his magazine pictures of nude women. Department denied the first level appeal on December 19, 2002, and the second level appeal on February 13, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Because Snow repeatedly failed to effect service of the petition, the court issued a series of orders to show cause as to why the case should not be dismissed. In response to the first of those orders, Snow filed a memorandum of points and authorities as to why the case should not be dismissed. Among the exhibits Snow attached to the memorandum are pictures of women with exposed breasts, including a picture Snow drew and the cover of an issue of New Yorker magazine showing cartoon drawings of Greek goddesses. Snow also attached an art photograph of a nude woman and an issue of a pornographic magazine entitled Online. On November 26, 2003, the court acknowledged Snow\u2019s untimely service on Department and rescheduled the hearing on the petition and request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On November 7, 2003, Snow filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the petition and request for declaratory relief. Department filed an opposition, arguing the amendment is constitutional because it serves a legitimate penological interest. In his reply, Snow included as an exhibit a Time magazine article containing a photograph of a painting of a nude woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">After a hearing, the court denied Snow\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and request for declaratory relief, concluding the regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest, in that: \u201c(1) there is a valid rational connection between restricting sexually explicit materials within prison and the interest in preserving [institutional] security and preventing sexual harassment; (2) Petitioner has alternative means of expression available to him; (3) allowing the sexually explicit material will have a negative impact on other inmates and correctional staff; and (4) the policy is not an exaggerated response to officialsf] concerns.\u201d The court denied Snow\u2019s request for declaratory relief because it \u201cis premised on the same arguments.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">I. <em>Constitutionality of Section 3006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We review de novo \u201ca constitutional challenge to the facial validity of a prison policy.\u201d <em>(In re Collins </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1181 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 108].) In order to withstand a constitutional challenge, including a First Amendment challenge, a prison regulation must be \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Turner v. Safley </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 78, 89 [96 L.Ed.2d 64, 107 S.Ct. 2254] <em>(Turner).) </em>The United States Supreme Court developed this standard by acknowledging \u201ctwo basic and potentially competing principles.\u201d <em>(Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p. 1058.) First, \u201cprison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Turner, </em>at p. 84.) Second, \u201c \u2018courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The Court developed a four-pronged test (the <em>Turner </em>test) to determine whether a prison regulation or policy is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests: \u201c(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the policy and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it; (2) whether there are alternative means of exercising the right; (3) whether the impact of accommodating the asserted constitutional right will have a significant negative impact on prison guards, other inmates and the allocation of prison resources generally; and (4) whether the policy is an \u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to the [prison\u2019s] concerns.\u201d <em>(Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at pp. 1058-1059, citing <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 U.S. at pp. 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">A. <em>First Prong of the Turner Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In order to determine whether there is a rational connection between a prison regulation and a governmental interest justifying the regulation, a court must find the following: (1) the governmental interest is legitimate; (2) the governmental interest is neutral; and (3) the logical connection between the regulation and the interest is close enough to be rational and not arbitrary. <em>(Turner, supra, </em>482 U.S. at pp. 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>We first determine whether Department\u2019s interests are legitimate. Here, the Notice defined those interests as \u201cmaintaining the safety and security of the prisons, rehabilitating inmates, reducing sexual harassment of correctional officers and preventing a hostile work environment.\u201d Many cases have found that prison safety and security are legitimate penological interests. (See, e.g., <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 91; <em>In re Collins, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1184-1185.) Rehabilitation and the prevention of sexual harassment are also legitimate penological interests. <em>{Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p.1059.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We next determine whether the regulation is neutral. In order to be neutral, \u201c \u2018the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Thornburgh </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 401, 415-416 [104 L.Ed.2d 459, 109 S.Ct. 1874] (Thornburgh), fn. omitted.) Prison regulations enacted to enhance prison security are neutral. <em>{Ibid.) </em>In the Notice, Department states it enacted the regulation because sexually explicit materials had contributed to sexual advances towards and the intimidation of female correctional staff, and such materials could lead to fights based upon anatomical comparisons. These reasons are unrelated to the suppression of expression and are related to the enhancement of prison security. <em>{Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p. 1059.) Accordingly, the regulation is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Finally, we must determine if there is a rational relationship between the regulation and the penological interest. \u201cTo show a rational relationship between a regulation and a legitimate penological interest, prison officials need not prove that the banned material actually caused problems in the past, or that the materials are \u2018likely\u2019 to cause problems in the future. [Citations.] Moreover, it \u2018does not matter whether we agree with\u2019 the defendants or whether the policy \u2018in fact advances\u2019 the jail\u2019s legitimate interests. [Citation.] The only question that we must answer is whether the defendants\u2019 judgment was \u2018rational,\u2019 that is, whether the defendants might reasonably have thought that the policy would advance its interests.\u201d <em>(Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p. 1060.) We agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis of the Arizona regulation upon which Department based this regulation: \u201cThe relationship between the . . . policy of prohibiting the possession of sexually explicit materials and the goals of preventing sexual harassment of the female officers, inmate rehabilitation and maintenance of . . . security is not so \u2018remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>We conclude there is a rational connection between the regulation and the governmental interest. Accordingly, the first prong of the <em>Turner </em>test is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Snow contends the first prong of the <em>Turner </em>test is not met because Department was required but failed to produce evidence of a rational connection between section 3006, subdivision (c)(17) and Department\u2019s interests. We disagree because Department must produce such evidence <em>only </em>in response to an inmate\u2019s evidence refuting the connection: \u201cWhen the inmate presents sufficient (pre or post) trial evidence that refutes a common-sense connection between a legitimate objective and a prison regulation,... the state must present enough counter-evidence to show that the connection is not so \u2018remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u2019 [Citations.] On the other hand, when the inmate does not present enough evidence to refute a common-sense connection between a prison regulation and the objective that government\u2019s counsel argues the policy was designed to further, <em>Mauro </em>applies and, presuming the governmental objective is legitimate and neutral [citation], <em>Turner\u2019s </em>first prong is satisfied.\u201d <em>(Frost v. Symington </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 197 F.3d 348, 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Here, Snow submitted evidence that prison authorities confiscated a book entitled Drawing, which contains nudity on certain pages, but did not submit copies of those pages. Although he also submitted a New Yorker magazine cover\u2014a cartoon containing pictures of Greek goddesses, each with one unclothed breast, a Time magazine article with one photograph of a work of art showing a nude woman, and an art photograph of a nude woman, he submitted no evidence that these were confiscated by Department. The evidence presented is insufficient to refute the common sense connection between sexually explicit images and the sexual harassment of female correctional officers and other security problems. Accordingly, Department was not required to present evidence to substantiate the connection between sexually explicit images and its legitimate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">B. <em>The Last Three Prongs of the Turner Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The second prong of the <em>Turner </em>test is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right. \u201cWhere \u2018other avenues\u2019 remain available for the exercise of the asserted right [citation], courts should be particularly conscious of the \u2018measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials ... in gauging the validity of the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 90.) In applying this factor, \u201cthe right in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively.\u201d <em>(Thornburgh, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 417.) We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the constitutional right infringed is the \u201c \u2018right to receive sexually explicit communications.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p. 1061.) Here, the regulation bans pictures of exposed breasts and genitalia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>but it does not ban sexually explicit writings or sexually provocative pictures of clothed persons. Further, the regulation does not ban sexually explicit pictures if they are contained in medical texts, art reference books, National Geographic, and books purchased for prison libraries and prison educational programs. (\u00a7 3006, subd. (c)(17)(B).) Accordingly, inmates have an alternative means of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The third prong asks whether the accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have a significant negative impact on prison guards, other inmates and the allocation of prison resources generally. We give \u201cconsiderable deference to the determination of prison administrators who, in the interest of security, regulate the relations between prisoners and the outside world.\u201d <em>(Thornburgh, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 408.) Here, Department found that inmates\u2019 possession of sexually explicit materials has had a negative impact on female correctional officers because it has led to verbal abuse and intimidation. Further, Department believes such possession could lead to fights between inmates, which would have a negative impact on inmates and correctional officers. Snow has presented no evidence or argument to refute Department\u2019s findings in this regard. Accordingly, the third prong is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The fourth prong asks whether the regulation is an exaggerated response to Department\u2019s concerns. \u201cThe absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation. [Citation.] By the same token, the existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable, but is an \u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to prison concerns. This is not a \u2018least restrictive alternative\u2019 test: prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant\u2019s constitutional complaint. [Citation.] But if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner\u2019s rights at <em>de minimis </em>cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.\u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>482 U.S. at pp. 90-91.) The inmate challenging the regulation has the burden to show there are obvious, easy alternatives to the regulation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91; <em>Mauro, supra, </em>188 F.3d at p. 1062.) Snow failed to show any alternatives to the regulation, so he has not met his burden. Accordingly, the regulation does not violate Snow\u2019s First Amendment rights because it meets the four-pronged <em>Turner </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">II. <em>Penal Code Section 2601</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In his request for declaratory relief, Snow contends section 3600 violates Penal Code section 2601 because it bans materials that are not obscene. We review de novo \u201cpurely legal issues such as statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>(Santa Margarita Area Residents Together v. San Luis Obispo County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 221, 228 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 740].) \u201c \u2018[W]hile the construction of a statute by officials charged with its administration ... is entitled to great weight, nevertheless, \u2018whatever the force of administrative construction . . . final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.\u2019 [Citation.] Administrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may, but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California Assn. of Psychology Providers v. Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 11 [270 Cal.Rptr. 796, 793 P.2d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (c)(1) provides in part that prisoners have the following right: \u201cTo purchase, receive, and read any and all newspapers, periodicals, and books accepted for distribution by the United States Post Office. Pursuant to this section, prison authorities may exclude any of the following matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201c(A) Obscene publications or writings, and mail containing information concerning where, how, or from whom this matter may be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c(B) Any matter of a character tending to incite murder, arson, riot, violent racism, or any other form of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We are not persuaded by Snow\u2019s reliance upon <em>In re Harrell </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 675 [87 Cal.Rptr. 504, 470 P.2d 640]. In <em>Harrell, </em>the court struck down a prison ban on publications advocating the use of narcotics, as part of a prison order banning \u201ccriminal techniques which tend to incite the commission of misdemeanors or felonies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 699, fn. 24, 703-704.) The court held that Penal Code section 2601 did not allow prison authorities to ban writings that were not \u201c \u2018conducive to rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Harrell, </em>at p. 703.) However, prison authorities could ban the same writings under Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (c)(1)(B) if they found such writings \u201cmight have a tendency to incite violent situations.\u201d <em>(Harrell, </em>at p. 704.) Here, among the reasons Department enacted the regulation are the prevention of the intimidation and sexual harassment of female correctional officers by inmates and the prevention of violence between inmates based on anatomical comparisons. These reasons fall squarely under the Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (c)(1)(B) exception. Accordingly, the regulation does not violate Penal Code section 2601.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The order dismissing the petition for writ of mandate and request for declaratory relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">McConnell, P.
