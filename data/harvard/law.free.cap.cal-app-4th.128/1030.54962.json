J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aza\">In a case challenging the legality of an initiative enacted by California voters, does an organization created to defend the initiative have a sufficiently direct and immediate interest in the litigation to require that it be permitted to intervene under Code of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a)? Here, one such organization, the Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund (Fund), argues the trial court erred in denying its motions to intervene in two cases, since consolidated, that challenge the applicability and constitutionality of Family Code sections defining marriage in California as between a man and a woman. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300, 301, 308.5.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Fund\u2019s motions for permissive intervention because the Fund has identified no direct or immediate effect that a judgment in the consolidated cases may have on it or its individual members. Although the Fund actively supports the Family Code statutes in question, its interest in upholding these laws is not sufficient to support intervention where there is no allegation the Fund or its members may suffer tangible harm from an adverse judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the order denying intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">On February 12, 2004, at the direction of its mayor and county clerk, the City and County of San Francisco (City) began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. (See <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1055, 1070-1071 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 95 P.3d 459].) The following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>day, two actions were filed in superior court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking an immediate stay and writ relief to halt the city\u2019s actions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1071 &amp; fn. 6.) On March 11, 2004, after original writ petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, that court stayed all proceedings in the two superior court actions, noting, however, that this order would not preclude the filing of a separate action raising a direct challenge to the constitutionality of California\u2019s marriage statutes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1073-1074.) Acting immediately on this suggestion, the City filed a complaint that same day challenging the validity of Family Code provisions limiting marriage in California to unions between a man and a woman. Specifically, the City sought declarations that: (1) sections 300 and 301 violate the California Constitution insofar as they prohibit licensure of same-sex marriages;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) section 308.5 either does not apply to in-state marriages or else is unconstitutional for the same reasons set forth for sections 300 and 301.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The next day, March 12, 2004, a similar action (denoted <em>Woo </em>v. Lockyer) was filed by several individual plaintiffs, who allege they are committed same-sex couples, and two advocacy groups, Our Family Coalition and Equality California.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The Fund promptly filed ex parte applications seeking leave to intervene in the two cases. After the trial court refused to grant ex parte relief, the Fund filed noticed motions to intervene. Noting that it \u201crepresents over 15,000 residents and taxpayers of California who supported and continue to support Proposition 22,\u201d the initiative now codified as section 308.5, the Fund asserted it had an interest in the outcome of the cases \u201cbecause of its interest in enforcing and defending Proposition 22 and California\u2019s marriage statutes.\u201d The Fund also cited the \u201cactive support of Proposition 22\u201d by its board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>members and individual contributors as evidence of its interest in the litigation. Three of these board members, Senator William J. (Pete) Knight, Natalie Williams and Dana Cody, submitted declarations in support of the Fund\u2019s intervention motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Senator Knight was the official proponent of Proposition 22. He declared he \u201ctook an active role in assuring successful passage\u201d of the initiative by working with others to create a registered ballot measure committee and by obtaining necessary signatures to submit the initiative to California voters. Now a board member and president of the Fund, Knight explained that the Fund was established approximately one year after the passage of Proposition 22 for the purpose of ensuring enforcement of the initiative, and he represented that more than 15,000 California residents had financially contributed to support this aim. Besides seeking to intervene in these actions, and others, the Fund had filed its own litigation challenging the City\u2019s licensure of same-sex marriage (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 2) and challenging Assembly Bill No. 205 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), by which the Legislature sought to extend many of the rights and benefits of marriage to registered domestic partners <em>(Knight v. Schwarzenegger </em>(Super. Ct. Sac. County, 2003, No. 03-AS05284)). Knight represented that \u201c[m]any of the Fund\u2019s supporters were involved in organizing voter support\u201d and many, like himself, had voted for Proposition 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Another board member, Natalie Williams, described the Fund\u2019s contributors and declared that the Fund represents her personal interests as a California elector, voter and taxpayer. Williams \u201cregularly spoke to individuals and organizations urging support for Proposition 22\u201d before it was enacted, and she participated in designing campaign strategies in support of the initiative. She also voted in favor of Proposition 22. In addition, Dana Cody, board member and secretary for the Fund, declared that she signed the petition to place Proposition 22 on the March 2000 ballot and participated in campaign meetings regarding the initiative. At the time, she also headed a separate public interest organization that supported passage of Proposition 22. Cody also voted in favor of Proposition 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On April 1, 2004, the superior court ordered the City\u2019s case consolidated with <em>Woo </em>v. <em>Lockyer, </em>and the plaintiffs later filed a joint opposition to the Fund\u2019s intervention motions. In support of their arguments, plaintiffs submitted California Supreme Court orders denying motions to intervene that several individuals (including Senator Knight) and a public interest group (Campaign for California Families) had filed in the original writ proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>before that court. (See <em>Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 1072-1073.) The trial court denied the Fund\u2019s motions to intervene after a hearing, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The Fund sought permissive intervention in the consolidated cases pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a). This statute states, in relevant part: \u201cUpon timely\u2019 application, any person, who has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, may intervene in the action or proceeding.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 387, subd. (a).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a), \u201cthe trial court has discretion to permit a nonparty to intervene where the following factors are met: (1) the proper procedures have been followed; (2) the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the action; (3) the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation; and (4) the reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Reliance Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 383, 386 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 807].) The permissive intervention statute balances the interests of others who will be affected by the judgment against the interests of the original parties in pursuing their litigation unburdened by others. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Good) </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 732, 736 [131 Cal.Rptr. 800, 552 P.2d 760].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Because the decision whether to allow intervention is best determined based on the particular facts in each case, it is generally left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(Northern Cal. Psychiatric Society v. City of Berkeley </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 90, 109 [223 Cal.Rptr. 609]; <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Gerlach </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 299, 302 [128 Cal.Rptr. 396].) We therefore review an order denying leave to intervene under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(Reliance Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 386.) Under this standard of review, a reviewing court should not disturb the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion unless it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 566 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].) \u201c \u2018[0]ne of the essential attributes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>abuse of discretion is that it must clearly appear to effect injustice. [Citations.] Discretion is abused whenever, in its exercise, the court exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered. The burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion, and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">To support permissive intervention, it is well settled that the proposed intervener\u2019s interest in the litigation must be direct rather than consequential, and it must be an interest that is capable of determination in the action. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Good), supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 736; <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gerlach, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d at pp. 302-303.) The requirement of a direct and immediate interest means that the interest must be of such a direct and immediate nature that the moving party \u201c \u2018will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Jersey Maid Milk Products Co. v. Brock </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 661, 663 [91 P.2d 599] <em>(Jersey Maid); Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Gerlach, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d at p. 303; <em>Socialist Workers Etc. Committee v. Brown </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 879, 891 [125 Cal.Rptr. 915] <em>(Socialist Workers).) </em>\u201cA person has a direct interest justifying intervention in litigation where the judgment in the action <em>of itself </em>adds to or detracts from his legal rights without reference to rights and duties not involved in the litigation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Continental Vinyl Products Corp. v. Mead Corp. </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 543, 549 [103 Cal.Rptr. 806], italics added <em>(Continental Vinyl).) </em>Conversely, \u201cAn interest is consequential and thus insufficient for intervention when the action in which intervention is sought does not directly affect it although the results of the action may indirectly benefit or harm its owner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Based on Senator Knight\u2019s role as the official proponent of Proposition 22, and based on the campaign efforts of Cody, Williams and others of its members,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Fund argues it has a unique and heightened interest in the outcome of this litigation sufficient to permit intervention. The Fund contends Knight and the campaign organizers it represents gained a direct interest in litigation challenging section 308.5 \u201cas a result of investing their personal reputation and considerable time and efforts\u201d toward passage of Proposition 22, since a judgment ruling the statute invalid \u201cwould effectively nullify their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>efforts and harm their reputation.\u201d The Fund also asserts that, independent of the interests of its members, it has a sufficient interest to permit intervention because a ruling declaring section 308.5 unconstitutional, or limiting its application, might damage the Fund\u2019s reputation and decrease the organization\u2019s ability to attract support and contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">As respondents point out, however, the Fund itself played no role in sponsoring Proposition 22 because the organization was not even created until one year <em>after </em>voters passed the initiative. In addition, despite the Fund\u2019s discussion of Senator Knight\u2019s activities and interests, this case does not present the question of whether an official proponent of an initiative (Elec. Code, \u00a7 342) has a sufficiently direct and immediate interest to permit intervention in litigation challenging the validity of the law enacted. Only the Fund\u2014and not Senator Knight or any other individual member\u2014sought to intervene in the consolidated cases. Moreover, to the extent the Fund seeks intervention as a representative of the interests of its members (see <em>Bustop v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 66, 70-71 [137 Cal.Rptr. 793]), it can no longer be said to represent Knight\u2019s interests in the litigation because Senator Knight is now deceased.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor does evidence in the record suggest any other member of the Fund was an official proponent of Proposition 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Assuming the Fund may seek to intervene as a representative of the interests of members who worked to put the initiative on the ballot, or who contributed time and money to the campaign effort, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Fund\u2019s intervention motions because these individuals do not themselves have a sufficiently direct and immediate interest to support intervention. (See <em>Bustop v. Superior Court, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 70-71 [organization was permitted to intervene as a representative because its members had a direct interest in litigation affecting reassignment of children to different district schools]; see also <em>Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1200-1202 [242 Cal.Rptr. 447] <em>(Simpson Redwood) </em>[in addition to conservation group\u2019s own interests, interests of members who used a threatened park for recreation supported the group\u2019s intervention].) The Fund does not identify any way in which the judgment in these consolidated cases will, <em>of itself, </em>directly benefit or harm its members. (See <em>Continental Vinyl, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 549.) Specifically, the Fund does not claim a ruling about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>the constitutionality of denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples will impair or invalidate the existing marriages of its members, or affect the rights of its members to marry persons of their choice in the future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor has the Fund identified any diminution in legal rights, property rights or freedoms that an unfavorable judgment might impose on the 15,000 financial contributors to the Fund who oppose same-sex marriage or on the 4.6 million Californians who voted in favor of Proposition 22, whom the Fund also purports to represent. Simply put, the Fund has not alleged its members will suffer any tangible harm absent intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">The Fund\u2019s primary argument is that it has an especially strong interest in defending the validity of California\u2019s marriage laws because its members were heavily involved in obtaining voter approval of Proposition 22 and because the Fund itself was created for the express purpose of defending and enforcing the definition of marriage set forth in this initiative. But while the members\u2019 campaign involvement and the Fund\u2019s charter may bear upon the strength of the asserted interest, they do nothing to change the fundamental <em>nature </em>of this interest, which is philosophical or political. There is no doubt the Fund\u2019s members strongly believe marriage in California should be permitted only between opposite-sex couples, and they believed in this principle strongly enough that they expended energy and resources to have it passed into law. However, because there is no evidence its members will be directly harmed by an unfavorable judgment, the Fund\u2019s interest in defending this principle is likewise indirect. California precedents make it clear such an abstract interest is not an appropriate basis for intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\u2022 In <em>Socialist Workers, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at pages 883-886, a nonprofit corporation named Common Cause sought to intervene in an action challenging the validity of Elections Code provisions requiring public disclosure of information regarding campaign contributors. Common Cause asserted it and its members had a direct interest in the public disclosure laws because the organization was created \u201cto work for the improvement of political and governmental institutions and processes\u201d at local, state and federal levels. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 886.) However, the court concluded this bare political interest in the laws was not sufficient to support intervention. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 891-892.) A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>judgment enjoining enforcement of the disclosure laws would not be binding upon Common Cause or its members, and \u201c \u2018they will be as free to pursue their business after the rendition of said judgment, as they were before.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 892, quoting <em>Jersey Maid, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at p. 664.) Likewise, a decision as to the constitutionality of the laws would have no direct effect on Common Cause members. <em>(Socialist Workers, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 892.) Finally, despite their organizational charter to improve government, the court concluded the petitioners stood in the same position as all Californians with respect to their interest in the validity of the disclosure laws, and this political interest was too \u201cindirect and inconsequential\u201d to support intervention. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Also relevant is a case the Fund relied on below, <em>People ex rel. Rominger v. County of Trinity </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 655 [195 Cal.Rptr. 186] <em>(Rominger). </em>In <em>Rominger, </em>the Sierra Club appealed an order denying it leave to intervene in an action concerning the validity of a county ordinance that prohibited the spraying of phenoxy herbicides. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 658-659.) The Sierra Club advanced two primary interests in support of intervention. First, in an argument closely resembling the Fund\u2019s here, the Sierra Club asserted it and its members had an interest in enforcement of the county\u2019s environmental laws stemming from the members\u2019 \u201cactive support\u201d of the ordinances at issue in the case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661.) Second, the Sierra Club asserted its members would be harmed by a judgment invalidating the law because they use forest lands that would otherwise be sprayed with the prohibited herbicides. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As to this second interest, the appellate court observed: \u201cIn alleging that its members would be harmed unless phenoxy herbicides were prohibited, the Sierra Club places its members among those whom the ordinance was specifically designed to protect, and alleges an injury which the ordinance was specifically designed to prevent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Although <em>Rominger </em>ultimately concluded this second interest\u2014i.e., potential harm to members who would be exposed to banned herbicides\u2014was sufficient to permit intervention, the court took specific pains to observe that Sierra Club members\u2019 political interest in upholding environmental laws was <em>not </em>an appropriate basis for intervention. <em>(Rominger, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at pp. 662-663.) The court stated: \u201c[W]e do not conclude, as the interveners apparently urge us to do, that the mere support of a statute by a person is sufficient to justify intervention by such person in an action challenging such statute. Nor do we conclude that a general political interest in upholding a statute is sufficient to intervene in a.challenge to it. We reiterate that one of the purposes of intervention is \u2018to protect the interests of those <em>who may be affected by the </em>judgment. . . .\u2019 <em>(County of San Bernardino v. Harsh California Corp. </em>[(1959)] 52 Cal.2d [341,] 346 [340 P.2d 617]; italics added.) In each of the cases herein cited, the intervener had more than a general interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>upholding the statute in question; rather the intervener had a specific interest that would be directly affected in a substantial way by the outcome of the litigation. <em>The fact the interveners and their members actively supported the ordinances in question and that they have a general interest in the enforcement of environmental laws alone will not support their </em>intervention.\u201d <em>(Rominger, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 662, italics added.) Thus, the court concluded the Sierra Club had alleged a sufficient interest to intervene <em>only </em>as a representative of its members who resided in and used the county\u2019s resources. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 662-663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">The Fund attempts to distinguish <em>Socialist Workers </em>and <em>Rominger </em>by arguing it does not appear the petitioners in these cases were \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in enacting the challenged laws. This is a distinction without a difference. The Sierra Club alleged in <em>Rominger </em>its members \u201cactively supported]\u201d the specific county ordinances at issue in the case. <em>(Rominger, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 661.) Although the opinion does not mention whether these individuals helped campaign to have the ordinances passed, we see no reason why the timing of their support matters. The Fund has identified no precedent holding that individuals who supported efforts to pass a law have a more significant interest, for intervention or standing purposes, than individuals who support enforcement of the law after it was enacted. Unless the law in question was specifically designed to protect these individuals, and unless they allege a potential injury from the judgment that the law was specifically enacted to prevent, intervention is inappropriate because the judgment will not directly affect either type of supporter. <em>(Rominger, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at pp. 661-663.) Here, because the Fund did not allege its members will suffer an injury that Proposition 22 was specifically designed to prevent, the trial court properly found the Fund did not have a sufficient interest in the litigation to permit intervention. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 662; <em>Socialist Workers, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at p. 892; see also <em>Jersey Maid, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at p. 664 [petitioners who do not directly gain or lose have only a consequential interest in litigation even where the judgment may set a precedent that could be used against them in a future action]; <em>Simpson Redwood, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1201 [noting a conservation league\u2019s mere \u201csupport\u201d for a party\u2019s asserted property claim was insufficient to support intervention].)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The Fund also discusses several cases in an effort to establish there is a \u201croutine practice\u201d in California and federal courts of allowing initiative proponents to intervene when the measures they helped enact are challenged. However, <em>none </em>of the California cases cited addresses whether intervention was proper. Some simply note that an initiative sponsor was permitted to intervene in earlier proceedings (e.g., <em>Amwest Surety Ins. Co. v. Wilson </em>(1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>11 Cal.4th 1243, 1250 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 12, 906 P.2d 1112]; <em>20th Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 216, 241 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 807, 878 P.2d 566]), while others refer to initiative sponsors as \u201cinterveners\u201d without mentioning whether an objection was ever made to their intervention (e.g., <em>Legislature v. Eu </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 500 [286 Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309]; <em>City of Westminister v. County of Orange </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 623, 626 [251 Cal.Rptr. 511]). Because these cases do not address the propriety of intervention, they do not constitute authority supporting the Fund\u2019s position. (See <em>Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 850 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 780] [\u201cDicta is not authority upon which we can rely\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Fund also relies on <em>Simpson Redwood, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 1192, a case from Division One of this district, for the proposition that it has a sufficient interest in the litigation for intervention purposes because a decision invalidating or narrowing section 308.5 may damage its reputation and impair its future ability to solicit financial contributions. <em>Simpson Redwood </em>is distinguishable because the proposed intervener had a clear interest in the piece of property that was the subject of the quiet title action. The conservation league that sought to intervene previously owned the land in question and had donated it to the state with a deed specifying the land was to be used solely \u201cfor state park purposes.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1197-1198.) The court found the league\u2019s interest in enforcing this restrictive covenant supported its intervention in litigation between the state and a lumber company that claimed ownership of a 160-acre strip of land in the park. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1199, 1201-1202.) In addition, as in <em>Rominger, </em>the league alleged its members frequently used the park for recreation, and their ability to use the disputed strip of land would be impaired by a judgment in favor of the lumber company. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1200-1201.) Although the court also noted that a loss of park property to private exploitation could impact the league\u2019s reputation and \u201cmight well translate into loss of future support and contributions\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1201), this was not the sole basis of the intervention ruling. In any event, we believe the potential for the Fund to suifer amorphous damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>to its organizational \u201creputation\u201d as a result of an unfavorable court decision is far too speculative a basis upon which to conclude the trial court was required to permit intervention. (See <em>Rominger, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at pp. 662-663; <em>Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Rosa </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 881 [150 Cal.Rptr. 606] [although intervener need not show it will inevitably be harmed by an adverse judgment, it must show there is a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d its interests will be so affected].) Any change in the Fund\u2019s reputation, or any drop in its fundraising revenues, would be merely a <em>consequence </em>of the judgment, and not a result of the legal operation of the judgment itself. (See <em>Jersey Maid, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The Fund also cites a handful of federal cases from California in which initiative sponsors and supporters were permitted to intervene.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Federal cases deciding whether intervention is appropriate under the more lenient test of rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.), which requires only that the applicant have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the litigation which a disposition \u201cmay as a practical matter impair or impede,\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> are of course not determinative of whether intervention is proper under the stricter test of Code of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a). (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 194, p. 251 [noting rule 24 \u201cgoes far beyond\u201d California law \u201cin allowing permissive intervention when there is merely a common question of law or fact\u201d].) Moreover, there is serious doubt whether the two federal decisions upon which the Fund relies remain good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In <em>Yniguez v. State of Arizona </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 939 F.2d 727, 731-733, a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded official sponsors of an English-only ballot initiative had a sufficient interest to intervene and pursue an appeal the parties had abandoned because an adverse decision on the law\u2019s constitutionality would \u201cessentially nullif[y] the considerable efforts\u201d of these sponsors in placing the initiative on the ballot and campaigning for its passage. On a writ of certiorari from the ultimate judgment in the case, however, the United States Supreme Court sharply criticized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>decision to allow the initiative sponsors to intervene and prosecute the appeal. <em>(Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 43, 65-66 [137 L.Ed.2d 170, 117 S.Ct. 1055].) Although in an analogous context, state legislators have been held to have standing to defend the constitutionality of a state law <em>if </em>state law authorizes such activity, the Supreme Court observed it was \u201caware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 65.) Nor had the Supreme Court itself \u201cever identified initiative proponents as Article-III-qualified defenders of the measures they advocated. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Thus, even though the court ultimately decided the appeal on a different procedural ground (mootness), the justices observed they had \u201cgrave doubts\u201d about whether the initiative sponsors satisfied article III standing requirements. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In the other federal case the Fund cites as persuasive authority, a district court relied on <em>Yniguez </em>in concluding official proponents of California\u2019s Proposition 140 had asserted a sufficient interest for intervention under rule 24(a). <em>(Bates v. Jones </em>(N.D.Cal 1995) 904 F.Supp. 1080, 1086.) However, in a later order in the same case, the district court observed that after it permitted intervention, the <em>Yniguez </em>decision was called into question by the Supreme Court. <em>(Bates v. Jones </em>(N.D.Cal 1997) 958 F.Supp. 1446, 1453, fn. 2.) The district court remarked, \u201cIt is thus doubtful that Interveners have standing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Given these subsequent histories, we find neither federal intervention decision upon which the Fund relies to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In short, the Fund has directed us to no authority holding that petitioners who supported and campaigned for a ballot initiative have such a direct and immediate interest in litigation challenging the initiative\u2019s validity that they must be permitted to intervene under Code of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a). Because the Fund failed to assert that it, or any of its members, would be directly affected by a judgment in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Fund\u2019s motions to intervene. Having decided the Fund lacked a sufficiently direct and immediate interest to permit intervention, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding whether intervention would improperly enlarge the issues in the litigation and whether the rights of the original parties outweigh the reasons for intervention. Finally, it is important to note that even though the Fund does not enjoy the status of a party in these consolidated cases, it may have the opportunity to present its views on the validity of California\u2019s marriage statutes through amicus curiae briefs. (See <em>Jersey </em>Maid, <em>supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at p. 665.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The order denying the Fund\u2019s motions to intervene in the consolidated cases is affirmed.

Because the City\u2019s respondent\u2019s brief noted that the Fund is currently participating as a party in one of the cases in the coordinated proceeding <em>(Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund v.

The term \u201cmembers\u201d in this opinion refers only to the supporters of Proposition 22 whom the Fund claims to represent; it is not meant as a term of art and reflects no decision as to the legal relationship between these individuals and the Fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\"> The parties inform us Senator Knight died on May 7, 2004, less than a month after the trial court denied the Fund\u2019s motions to intervene. Knight\u2019s purported interest in protecting the validity of the measure enacted as a fruit of his labors appears to have been an entirely personal one; in any event, no personal representative or successor in interest has appeared to seek intervention in his place. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.30 [surviving cause of action may be asserted by decedent\u2019s personal representative].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\"> Although the Fund\u2019s lawyer argued in the trial court that an unfavorable decision would \u201cwholly change [the] meaning\u201d of its contributors\u2019 marriage certificates and \u201ctake away the exclusivity of the institution\u201d of marriage, it has not repeated these arguments on appeal. In any event, such potential consequences would hardly be limited to the Fund\u2019s contributors, but would affect all preexisting California marriages. Because the Fund\u2019s members stand in the same position as a broad cross-section of the California public regarding such potential effects of a judgment on their opposite-sex marriages, their interests are not sufficiently unique or direct to support intervention. <em>(Socialist Workers, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at p. 892.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b830-5\"> In another California case (not cited by the Fund) the Supreme Court rejected an argument that Evidence Code section 669.5 should not apply to local ballot initiatives\u2014because local governments may not be motivated to defend them\u2014by noting that trial courts may allow initiative proponents to intervene in such cases and assist in the defense. <em>(Building Industry Assn. v. City of Camarillo </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 810, 822 [226 Cal.Rptr. 81, 718 P.2d 68].) Because the permissibility of intervention under specific facts was not before the court, the court\u2019s observation about intervention in cases involving burden-shifting under Evidence Code section 669.5 was dictum and not dispositive here. <em>(People v.
