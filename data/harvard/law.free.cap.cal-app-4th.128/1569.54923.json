The poster responded with a motion to strike the complaint under California\u2019s antiSLAPP statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once the poster\u2019s identity was revealed, respondents dismissed the California action and filed in New York. In the first appeal, we held that the dismissal did not strip the trial court of jurisdiction to rule on the motion and request for attorney fees. <em>(Ampex Corp. v. Cargle </em>(Apr. 30, 2003, A099344) [nonpub. opn.].) This time around we reverse the lower court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for attorney fees and conclude that he sustained his burdens under section 425.16. Therefore, appellant is the prevailing party, entitled to attorney fees. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">Appellant Scott Cargle is a former employee of iNEXTV, a wholly owned subsidiary of respondent Ampex Corporation (Ampex). Cargle was laid off in December 2000 for economic reasons, along with approximately 20 other iNEXTV employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-12\">Ampex is a publicly traded company with 59.9 million shares outstanding as of April 2002. Respondent Edward J. Bramson is the president and chairman of the board of directors of Ampex. We take judicial notice that Ampex maintains a Web site at www.ampex.com. Among other things, the company posts its Securities and Exchange Commission filings on this Web site. Press releases and letters from the chairman are also available through the Web site.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>In August 2001, Cargle, under the username \u201cexampex\u201d (Exampex), posted messages on the Internet message board for Ampex operated by Yahoo! We take judicial notice that Yahoo! offers financial message boards on the Internet for publicly traded companies where any user can post comments. (See <em>Dendrite Intern. </em>v. <em>Doe No. 3 </em>(2001) 342 N.J. Super. 134 [775 A.2d 756, 761-762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">Message No. 112255, posted by Exampex, read in part: \u201cWell, let me tell you something. I was an employee with INEXTV for a while. Guess what? They did market research AFTER we launched the websites, not before. They spent millions before they even looked for a market. Then the geniuses got about 10 people in a room and asked questions like, \u2018How would you like to see exciting videos on your computer that will help you make millions of dollars and become fabulously famous?\u2019 . . . H] I just wonder how the crooks fooled everyone for so long. The websites rarely worked. The content was so boring and stale that no one even noticed we existed. The production values sucked because the equipment was cheap (my son has better TV equipment at his high school) and the majority of the production staff were interns. ...[][] All in all, it was the most miserable, sleazy, cheap operation I have ever worked for. . . . The production department bought studio equipment that couldn\u2019t be used (because it was bought on the gray market somewhere and all the operating manuals were in FRENCH, for crying out loud! No one could read them!) During a shoot one day, the VP of Programming stole a Razor scooter from the company who was marketing the toy (he has triplets and tried to steal three\u2014how cheap is that?).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">The next day Exampex posted message No. 112281 under the header \u201call is true.\u201d It read in part: \u201cI can\u2019t prove I worked for them without posting a check stub and I\u2019m not that stupid, [f] I will tell you that Ed said people who smoke marijuana should be taken out and shot; and upon hearing a single mother had contracted AIDS, he said, \u2018Serves her right.\u2019 So not only is he incompetent, he\u2019s cruel.\u201d The final message, No. 112299, under \u201cRe: all is true,\u201d contained the following: \u201cI just thought after all this speculation about what happened, it might be interesting to hear from someone who saw. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>[][] It was total incompetence. It was a bunch of old guys sitting around trying to make money with a new media that they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Respondents Bramson and Ampex filed a libel suit against \u201cDoe 1 aka \u2018exampex\u2019 on Yahoo!\u201d in California. The gist of the complaint was that Exampex posted defamatory messages about Ampex on the Yahoo! message board for that company. Cargle filed a section 425.16<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> anti-SLAPP motion, coupled with a request for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Upon learning Gargle\u2019s identity in the proceedings, respondents dismissed their complaint. At the subsequent hearing on the motion to strike and for attorney fees, the court ruled that the voluntary dismissal aborted its jurisdiction to consider the motion. Thus the court made no determination as to whether Cargle was the prevailing party entitled to section 425.16 attorney fees. Cargle appealed the order and we reversed. On remand, the trial court denied Cargle\u2019s motion to strike and for attorney fees, determining that had the lawsuit not been dismissed, it would have denied the motion on the merits: \u201cEven assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Defendant\u2019s challenged statements were made \u2018in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest\u2019 within the scope and meaning of Section 425.16(e), Plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability they will prevail on their claims sufficient to defeat the motion to strike. . . . [f] Plaintiffs have established each element of libel per se. [f] Plaintiffs are not required to show actual damages as there is evidence from which constitutional malice may reasonably be inferred.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">A. <em>Introduction; Burdens of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">Section 425.16 applies to causes of action arising from an act \u201cin furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech\u201d under the federal or state Constitution \u201cin connection with a public issue.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b).) Such acts include \u201cany written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e)(3).) Claims based on these acts are subject to a special motion to strike unless the court determines that the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>established that there is a probability of prevailing on the merits. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(1).) We construe section 425.16 broadly in order to encourage participation in matters of public significance. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Section 425.16 thus invites a two-part analysis: First, did the challenged cause of action arise from protected activity within the meaning of the statute? The moving defendant bears this threshold burden. Second, if the defendant makes the threshold showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of facts which, if credited by the trier of fact, would sustain a favorable judgment. <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 999 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625].) In opposing an anti-SLAPP motion, the plaintiff cannot rely on allegations in the complaint, but must bring forth evidence that would be admissible at trial. <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 786].) We do not weigh credibility or evaluate the weight of the evidence. Rather, we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it has defeated plaintiff\u2019s submission as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">B. <em>Cargle Has Met His Burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">When Cargle decided in August 2001 to join the conversation about the fortunes of Ampex, he did so by posting messages on the Yahoo! message board for Ampex. The question here is whether such postings were made in a public forum, traditionally defined as \u201c \u2018a place that is open to the public where information is freely exchanged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1006.) The term \u201cpublic forum\u201d includes forms of public communication other than those occurring in a physical setting. Thus the electronic communication media may constitute public forums. Web sites that are accessible free of charge to any member of the public where members of the public may read the views and information posted, and post their own opinions, meet the definition of a public forum for purposes of section 425.16. <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson, supra, </em>at p. 1007.) Thus the Yahoo! message board maintained for Ampex was a public forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">But were Cargle\u2019s postings made in connection with a matter of public interest? Contrary to Ampex\u2019s assertions, they were. Courts have held that Internet postings about corporate activity constitute an issue of public importance upon considering the following pertinent factors: (1) whether the company is publicly traded; (2) the number of investors; and (3) whether the company has promoted itself by means of numerous press releases. (See <em>Global Telemedia Intern., Inc. v. Doe 1 </em>(C.D.Cal. 2001) 132 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1265; <em>ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1007-1008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>Ampex is a publicly traded company, with over 59 million shares outstanding at the relevant times. Ampex inserted itself into the public area via press releases issued by the company and made available on the Internet. A July 20, 2001 press release of Ampex announced it was discontinuing the operations of iNEXTV. By the time of Cargle\u2019s first posting, the Yahoo! board dedicated to Ampex had generated over 112,000 postings\u2014Exampex\u2019s message was No. 112255\u2014another indicia of public interest in the company. Cargle\u2019s speech addressed the management practices of iNEXTV and its chairman. Exampex\u2019s message itself indicates he was prompted by public speculation about iNEXTV: \u201cI just thought after all this speculation about what happened, it might be interesting to hear from someone who saw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">C. <em>Ampex Did Not Demonstrate a Probability of Prevailing on the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">\n<em>Limited Public Figure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Since public figures must prove by clear and convincing evidence that an allegedly defamatory statement was made with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth (New <em>York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 279-280 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710]), we must first discern whether respondents were public figures.  The characterization of \u201cpublic figure\u201d falls into two categories: the all-purpose public figure, and the limited purpose or \u201cvortex\u201d public figure. The all-purpose public figure is one who has achieved such pervasive fame or notoriety that he or she becomes a public figure for all purposes and contexts. The limited purpose public figure is an individual who voluntarily injects him or herself or is drawn into a specific public controversy, thereby becoming a public figure on a limited range of issues. <em>(Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 351 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997]; <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 244, 253 [208 Cal.Rptr. 137, 690 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\"><em>Copp </em>v. <em>Paxton </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 829, 845-846 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 831] sets forth the elements that must be present in order to characterize a plaintiff as a limited purpose public figure. First, there must be a public controversy, which means the issue was debated publicly and had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants. Second, the plaintiff must have undertaken some voluntary act through which he or she sought to influence resolution of the public issue. In this regard it is sufficient that the plaintiff attempts to thrust him or herself into the public eye. And finally, the alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff\u2019s participation in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">Respondents are adamant there is no public controversy, arguing that the Exampex postings spoke to the internal workings of Ampex, which were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>subject to controversy, whether public or private. We disagree. Respondents\u2019 depiction does not account for the public dimension of the exchanges. First, prior to Exampex\u2019s comments there were a number of postings on the Yahoo! message board criticizing the management of Ampex and Bramson. The Yahoo! message board itself is a public forum. Second, the content of Exampex\u2019s messages posted on the Internet over a three-day period indicates that each message responded to another poster\u2019s message, with over 40 postings occurring in between. Third, with 59,000 shares outstanding, the causes and consequences of discontinuing Ampex\u2019s multimillion-dollar venture into the Internet television business had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants. All this goes to underscore the public nature of the matter. Ampex\u2019s decision and action in discontinuing iNEXTV amounted to a public controversy that elicited concerns about the management of Ampex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Although respondents deny inserting themselves into the controversy, they did, by way of press releases and letters posted on their Web site. For example, Ampex\u2019s July 2001 press release announcing the discontinuance of iNEXTV attributed its decision to \u201cadverse capital market conditions.\u201d As well, Chairman Bramson\u2019s 2000 annual letter, also posted on the Ampex Web site, touted the significance of iNEXTV to Ampex\u2019s success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">Finally, Cargle\u2019s comments were germane to respondents\u2019 participation in the controversy. These comments were counter to respondents\u2019 version of events. They criticized management rather than ascribing iNEXTV\u2019s woes to market forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">D. <em>Malice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Cargle argues that his speech was nonactionable opinion, hyperbole and rhetoric rather than actionable false statements of fact, and we agree that some of the offending speech was just that. However, we are not convinced that all of his speech can be classified as opinion and thus we must determine whether respondents can demonstrate that some of the alleged defamatory speech was uttered with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">In the context of an anti-SLAPP suit, courts must consider the pertinent burden of proof in ascertaining whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing. <em>(Annette F. v. Sharon S. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1166 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 100].) Thus, limited purpose public figures such as respondents who sue for defamation must establish a probability that they can produce clear and convincing evidence that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1167; see <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number><em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 279-280; <em>Copp v. Paxton, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 846.) To meet the clear and convincing standard, the evidence must be such \u201c \u2018as to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Annette F. v. Sharon S., supra, </em>at p. 1167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">The reckless disregard test requires a high degree of awareness of the probable falsity of the defendant\u2019s statement. \u201c \u2018There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 256, quoting <em>St. Amant v. Thompson </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 727, 731 [20 L.Ed.2d 262, 88 S.Ct. 1323].) This is a subjective test, focused on the defendant\u2019s attitude toward the veracity of the published material, as opposed to his or her attitude toward the plaintiff. <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Actual malice may be proved by circumstantial or direct evidence. <em>(Annette F. v. Sharon S., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167.) However, we will not infer actual malice solely from evidence of ill will, personal spite or bad motive. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Respondents contend there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to infer malice. Specifically, they point out that the statements were posted after Cargle\u2019s employment with Ampex was terminated. Further, they posit that the tone and substance of the speech \u201care hallmarks of ill-will and vindictiveness\u201d and that certain statements indicate Cargle was \u201cangry, hostile and spiteful as to his former employer.\u201d Finally, they assert the speech was \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Respondents have not carried their burden. They rely on Cargle\u2019s status as a former employee which is not disputed. However, respondents offer nothing to counter Cargle\u2019s statement that he was laid off, with 20 others, for economic, not personal reasons. Where is the basis for inferring personal spite? Respondents also assert that Cargle described events and comments that never occurred. However, again, Cargle produced detailed declarations setting forth the basis for his statements and opinions. Respondents\u2019 declarations, simply summarizing certain comments and repeating that they were false, were insufficient to establish a prima facie showing of constitutional malice. In short, respondents have not produced any evidence or inferences from evidence concerning Cargle\u2019s attitude or a state of mind with respect to the veracity of the messages he posted on the Yahoo! message board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying Cargle\u2019s motion for section 425.16 attorney fees. Cargle was the prevailing defendant on his motion to strike and is therefore entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c). We remand solely for determination of reasonable fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Kay, P. J., and Sepulveda, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1195-13\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (\u00a7 425.16). SLAPP stands for strategic lawsuits against public participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1195-14\"> Ampex is adamant that this and other computer records which were attached to the declaration of Cargle\u2019s attorney are not available to him because such evidence was rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>inadmissible on hearsay and authentication grounds by the trial court in the original proceeding. Inexplicably, Cargle did not challenge this ruling in the first appeal, nor did he press the matter in the trial court following our reversal. The trial court\u2019s initial rulings were patently wrong. The various computer printouts from Ampex\u2019s Web site and the Yahoo! message board were offered to show that they existed in the public eye: They were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted and thus were not hearsay statements. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.) Moreover, the records were self-authenticating as computer printouts. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1552, subd. (a).) However, because Cargle has not properly preserved his challenge to the evidentiary ruling, we do not disturb it. Nevertheless, to the extent the relevant excluded records \u201care not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (h)), we take judicial notice of them <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 459, subd. (a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1197-11\"> This statute provides in part: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd.
