The issue we decide is whether the rule applies when one of the insurers becomes insolvent and the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) steps in.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">CIGA seeks review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), ordering it to reimburse a solvent insurer for a portion of temporary disability and medical benefits paid to an injured employee. We annul and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Timothy Weitzman sustained a specific low back injury on February 12, 1997, while employed by Capstar Hotels, insured by American Motorists Insurance Company (AMIC). On January 30, 1998, he resolved his workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>compensation claim by entering into a stipulation with Capstar/AMIC. The stipulation provided temporary disability, 14.75 percent permanent disability and payment of medical liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On September 26, 2001, Weitzman filed a petition to reopen the award, alleging that his disability had increased and that he was entitled to additional benefits. At the same time, Weitzman filed two new workers\u2019 compensation claims for low back injuries. He alleged a specific injury sustained on February 10, 1998, while employed by Cal Poly Foundation, which was insured by California Compensation Insurance (Cal Comp), and a cumulative trauma injury over the period September 7, 1999, to March 30, 2001, while employed by Cal Poly Foundation, then insured by Legion Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In 2000, Cal Comp became insolvent, and, on April 25, 2003, Legion became insolvent. CIGA assumed liability for both insurers\u2019 \u201ccovered claims\u201d pursuant to Insurance Code section 1063.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 1, 2003, AMIC filed a request for allowance of lien against CIGA in the amount of $133, 800 for medical expenses, temporary disability and permanent disability it had paid as a result of the two later injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The three cases were consolidated for hearing. On October 3, 2003, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) issued findings and award and order granting the petition to reopen, increasing Weitzman\u2019s permanent disability rating to 55 percent and awarding future medical treatment. The WCJ also issued joint findings and award and order for the two injuries Weitzman sustained while working for Cal Poly. The WCJ awarded permanent disability of 55 percent and future medical treatment for these injuries. The WCJ also ordered that AMIC administer Weitzman\u2019s future medical benefits. The order allowed the AMIC lien, in effect giving AMIC a right of reimbursement against CIGA for past and future medical care attributable to the injuries occurring during the periods of coverage by the insolvent insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">In his opinion on decision, the WCJ explained that he gave identical awards for all three injuries because the \u201cformer injury, in part, contributed to his subsequent need of medical treatment and temporary disability\u201d and \u201cthe subsequent injuries . . . contributed, in part, to applicant\u2019s need for medical treatment and temporary disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">CIGA\u2019s petition for reconsideration was denied by the WCAB, which adopted the WCJ\u2019s report on reconsideration as its own without further comment. The WCJ\u2019s report on reconsideration states in part: \u201cWith all due respect to petitioner, the undersigned does not believe this is a case under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Insurance Code Section 1063.1, that there is \u2018other insurance.\u2019 Applicant has sustained several industrial injuries. Each of which contributed to applicant\u2019s past need of medical care and will contribute to his future need of medical care. Petitioner has not contended that applicant is not in need of future medical care as a result of [his] injury. This is simply a case of administration of multiple awards and the allowance of care for treatment that was partially caused by defendant\u2019s injuries. It is not other insurance. Simply put, there is no other insurance for these injuries. [1] . . . [][] In the undersigned\u2019s opinion, petitioner is liable for that portion of the applicant\u2019s past medical care and future medical care that is appropriately allocated to its liabilities in the case.\u201d In other words, CIGA was liable to AMIC for the obligations of the defunct carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">CIGA petitioned this court for a writ of review on the ground that the reimbursement ordered by the WCAB is precluded by section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9). We originally denied the petition by a two-to-one vote on July 7, 2004. The Supreme Court granted CIGA\u2019s ensuing petition for review and transferred the matter to us with directions to vacate our order and issue a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, final responsibility for interpreting a statute rests with the court. <em>(Moulton </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 837, 842 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 175].) We apply the usual rules of statutory interpretation. The fundamental mle is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law. In doing so, we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual, ordinary import of the language. <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 350, 355 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 12].) It is a settled principle in California law that when statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">CIGA was created by the Legislature to establish a fund from which insureds could obtain financial and legal assistance if their insurers became insolvent. <em>(Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 784 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297].) CIGA \u201c \u2018was created to provide a limited form of protection for insureds and the public, not to provide a fund to protect insurance carriers.\u2019 . . . CIGA\u2019s role in guaranteeing workers\u2019 compensation claims is therefore limited: [f] \u2018 \u201cCIGA is not, and was not created to act as, an ordinary insurance company. ... It is a statutory entity that depends on the Guarantee Act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers, duties, and protections.\u201d . . . \u201cCIGA issues no policies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>collects no premiums, makes no profits, and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.\u201d. . . \u201cCIGA\u2019s duties are not co-extensive with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 104 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1438 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 53], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">CIGA\u2019s authority and liability are limited to paying \u201c \u2018covered claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Isaacson v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 786; <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 358, 363-364 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 127].) Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1) defines \u201c \u2018covered claims\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe obligations of an insolvent insurer,\u201d including the obligation \u201cto provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law of this state.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c)(l)(vi).) The statute enumerates in subdivision (c)(3) through (12) specific types of claims that are not \u201ccovered claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">CIGA argues that in section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(i) and (ii), the Legislature made clear that CIGA is not responsible for reimbursing solvent insurers where, as here, the solvent insurer paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to injuries sustained during periods of coverage by the insolvent insurers. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include any obligations to insurers, insurance pools, or underwriting associations, nor their claims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, equitable or otherwise, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include . . . any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name . . . and does not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Numerous cases hold that CIGA has no liability for claims made by other insurers in contexts other than those involving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In <em>California Union Ins. Co. v. Central National Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 729 [173 Cal.Rptr. 35], the court construed the provisions at issue here against insurance companies seeking recovery from CIGA for a portion of a legal malpractice judgment. In concluding that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the court stated: \u201cAppellants are insurers and the claims they seek are \u2018obligations to insurers.\u2019 (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(4) [now subd. (c)(5)].) Appellants are not \u2018the original claimant under the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>policy in his own name.\u2019 (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(7) [now subd. (c)(9)].) Appellants claim an equitable right of subrogation and the statute is clear that covered claims \u2018shall not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u2019 (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(7) [now subd. (c)(9)].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In <em>E.L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 366 [187 Cal.Rptr. 879], White and the city were unsuccessful codefendants in an action for wrongful death and a related personal injury action. White\u2019s insurer paid half the judgment and sued the city for indemnity. The city\u2019s insurer then became insolvent. CIGA sued White\u2019s insurer, seeking a declaration that it could not proceed with its indemnity action. The trial court agreed with CIGA. The appellate court affirmed. It concluded CIGA was forbidden by statute from standing in the shoes of the insolvent insurer because the claim was both by an insurer and a claim by right of subrogation. Accordingly, the insurer could not seek payment from CIGA. \u201cSuch is the clear and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 371; accord, <em>Collins-Pine Co. v. Tubbs Cordage Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 882 [271 Cal.Rptr. 20].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Central National Ins. Co. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 453 [211 Cal.Rptr. 435], the court rejected an insurer\u2019s claim against CIGA for an insolvent insurer\u2019s contribution to a legal malpractice judgment. The court said: \u201cThe statute excludes from \u2018covered claims\u2019 any obligations to insurers or any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation. (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(4), and \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(7)(b).) Applying both the case law and the plain meaning of the statutory language, Central National, a solvent insurance carrier, falls clearly in the excluded class and cannot directly nor indirectly through assignment or subrogation be found to be one with a covered claim payable by CIGA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 459; see also <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 306, 312 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 87] [\u201cEven if appellants come within the definition of a \u2018claimant\u2019 pursuant to section 1063.1, subdivision (g), they do not survive the legislative choice that they are not \u2018original claimants\u2019 pursuant to section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)\u201d]; and see <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 109, 120 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 466] [\u201cUnder the unambiguous language of the statutory scheme, an original claimant can be any person (other than the insurer) instituting a liability claim within the coverage of the policy, provided that he or she does so in his or her own name and not through assignment or by right of subrogation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 624 [278 Cal.Rptr. 23] <em>(Argonaut), </em>the court held that CIGA, involved because of the insolvency of a third party tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>not responsible for reimbursing a solvent workers\u2019 compensation carrier for benefits paid because section 1063.1 provides that claims by right of subrogation are not \u201ccovered claims.\u201d The court said: \u201cWe find the language of . . . subdivision (c)(4) excluding claims of insurers and that of subdivision [(c)](9) excluding claims by right of subrogation to be clear and unambiguous. We need not construe the statute; its meaning is clear\u2014a claim by an insurer or a claim by right of subrogation is not a \u2018covered claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Argonaut, </em>at p. 633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The <em>Argonaut </em>court explained: \u201cAs currently written, Insurance Code section 1063.1 does not permit CIGA to reimburse Argonaut for amounts Argonaut paid ... in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Subdivision (c)(4) [now subdivision (c)(5)] . . . excludes obligations to insurers from the category of \u2018covered claims.\u2019 Subdivision (c)(9)(ii) . . . excludes claims made by right of subrogation. Although denying subrogation to a workers\u2019 compensation carrier may result in an increased financial burden on the workers\u2019 compensation system, this result does not justify ignoring the clear language of the statute. Denying subrogation recovery from CIGA may result in some increased insurance costs, some of which would be borne by the insured public. Permitting subrogation recovery from CIGA would result in some increased insurance costs to the involuntary members of CIGA, which costs may also be passed on in part to the insured public. The Legislature has balanced these competing concerns for protecting the insured public in the creation and statutory duties of CIGA. We shall not take it upon ourselves to change the balance.\u201d <em>(Argonaut, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The two appellate cases holding CIGA liable for a claim made by an insurer are of little precedential value. The decision in <em>Phoenix Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1511 [235 Cal.Rptr. 185], led to a statutory amendment precluding such claim. In that case, Phoenix, a solvent insurer, was given a reimbursement right against CIGA based on the equitable principle of indemnification. At the time the case was decided, nothing in section 1063.1 excluded indemnification claims from the definition of a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d The following year, however, the Legislature amended section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4) (now subdivision (c)(5)), excluding from covered claims a claim by an insurer for \u201ccontribution, indemnity or subrogation, equitable or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>Burrow v. Pike </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 384 [235 Cal.Rptr. 408], the court held that no language in the statutes governing CIGA\u2019s liability precluded a workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s subrogation claim. The court held that the meaning evident on the face of the statute should not prevail because there was a fundamental policy difference between workers\u2019 compensation insurance and other types of insurance. In allowing the claim, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>concluded reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits differed from the traditional action for subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In declining to follow <em>Burrow, </em>the <em>Argonaut </em>court said: \u201cThe <em>Burrow </em>court goes beyond construing or interpreting the statute; it rewrites Insurance Code section 1063.1 based on its perception that the statute as written overlooks an important policy consideration. Crafting statutes to conform with policy considerations is a job for the Legislature, not the courts; our role is to interpret statutes, not to write them. [Citation.] [f] The <em>Burrow </em>court suggests that if the Legislature intends reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation to be excluded from the definition of covered claims, it can say so. By excluding claims from insurers and claims by right of subrogation the Legislature has done just that.\u201d <em>(Argonaut, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 633-634; and see <em>Roth v. L.A. Door Co. </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1249 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] [court follows <em>Argonaut </em>rather than <em>Burrow].) </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The plain language of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii) bars AMIC\u2019s reimbursement claim because the claim is an \u201cobligation[] to an insurer,\u201d AMIC is not the \u201coriginal claimant under the insurance policy,\u201d and the two subsections expressly exclude \u201cclaims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, equitable or otherwise\u201d and \u201cone claiming by right of subrogation.\u201d We have been presented with no persuasive authority and know of no reason for treating reimbursement claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits differently than claims made in other civil cases. Where, as here, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning must prevail. <em>(Honeywell v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 24, 34 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 179, 105 P.3d 544].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Moreover, as CIGA points out, section 1063.1 contains several specific references to workers\u2019 compensation insurance (\u00a7\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(l)(vi), (7), (8), 1063.15) demonstrating that, if the Legislature had wanted to make an exception for workers\u2019 compensation claims from the subdivision (c)(5) exclusion, it could and would have said so. (See <em>Argonaut, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 634 [\u201cIn our view, if the Legislature views workers\u2019 compensation as significantly different from other insurance so as to necessitate different treatment in recovering claims from CIGA, the Legislature can say so. Insurance Code section 1063.1 shows that the Legislature knew how to make an exception for workers\u2019 compensation benefits when it so intended.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\n<em>Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(i)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Although we believe our construction of subdivision (c)(5) and (9)(ii) resolves the issue, we interpret subdivision (c)(9)(i) of section 1063.1 as well. This provision is at issue in numerous other pending cases and is the subject of a recent en banc opinion by the WCAB, <em>Gomez v. Casa Sandoval </em>(2003) 68 Cal.Comp.Cases 753 <em>(Gomez), </em>with which we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(i) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include . . . any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">AMIC argues that there is no \u201cother insurance\u201d for the medical benefits paid because it was not on the risk for the two later injuries. In support of its argument, AMIC cites Labor Code sections 3208.2 and 5303 and the WCAB\u2019s en banc opinion in <em>Gomez, supra, </em>68 Cal.Comp.Cases 753. In <em>Gomez, </em>the WCAB held that in successive injury cases an apportionment of liability must be made by the WCAB, setting the specific percentage of liability of all carriers, which will also set CIGA\u2019s liability for any now-insolvent carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In <em>Gomez, </em>the WCAB relied on Labor Code sections 3208.2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 5303,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibiting merger of multiple injuries and requiring separate findings of fact and awards for each separate injury. The WCAB reasoned: \u201cThe requirement of separate findings of fact for each injury supports the conclusion that between or among successive injuries, there is no \u2018other insurance . . . available to the claimant or insured\u2019 under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). In successive injury cases, the liability is not joint and several among or between carriers, but rather, awards are made for the convenience of the applicant, with a single carrier to provide benefits subject to subsequent apportionment of liability, as required by Labor Code sections 3208.2 and 5303. The result is no different where CIGA has been joined on behalf of an insolvent carrier. [][] This approach is required because case law has established that section 3208.2 is concerned with the sharing of loss by employers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and not with the apportionment of benefits between the employer and the injured worker.\u201d <em>{Gomez, supra, </em>68 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 760.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">It is well established that contemporaneous construction of a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation, while not necessarily controlling, is of great weight, and courts will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized. <em>{Griffith v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1260, 1263-1264 [257 Cal.Rptr. 813]; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 638 [211 Cal.Rptr. 683].)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We conclude, however, that <em>Gomez </em>was incorrectly decided on this point. In <em>Buhlert Trucking </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1530 [247 Cal.Rptr. 190], the court held that Labor Code section 4600 imposed joint and several liability on an employer for the full award of costs of future medical treatment to an employee injured in the course of his employment where the need for such medical treatment is partially attributable to a previous industrial injury. \u201cThe duty imposed by section 4600 upon an employer is joint and several, subject only to the right of contribution as between employers. [Citations.] [|] . . . [T]here is nothing in section 4600 or . . . elsewhere in the \u2018complete\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation statutory system to preclude its application to medical treatment, whether present or future, arising from the combined effects of present and preexisting industrial injuries.\u201d <em>{Buhlert, </em>at pp. 1534-1535.) Thus, once it has been established that an industrial injury contributed to an employee\u2019s need for medical treatment, employer-provided medical treatment is mandated by Labor Code section 4600.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The <em>Buhlert </em>court\u2019s analysis was followed in <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295] <em>{Garcia). </em>In that case, Garcia sustained a cumulative injury. During the period of injury, his employer was insured by three successive workers\u2019 compensation insurers. Before trial on the claim, one of the insurers became insolvent. CIGA entered the litigation due to the insolvency and sought dismissal from the case on the ground that Garcia\u2019s claim did not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9), because \u201cother\u201d workers\u2019 compensation insurance was available through solvent insurers who were jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The Court of Appeal held that CIGA was not liable since all insurance carriers during the period of exposure were jointly and severally liable for benefits to an employee for cumulative trauma. The court concluded: \u201cIn sum, Garcia\u2019s employer and more than one solvent carrier were found liable for Garcia\u2019s single cumulative injury. Each such carrier was obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>discharge fully the employer\u2019s liability to Garcia for his entire disability during the cumulative injury period. Hence, the Board properly ordered a joint and several award against [the solvent insurers].\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The <em>Garcia </em>court rejected the insurers\u2019 argument that there was no \u201cother insurance\u201d available because each of the insurance policies provided coverage during different time periods that did not overlap with the period covered by the insolvent carrier. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cReasonably read, the statute indicates that a claim does not rise to the level of a \u2018covered claim\u2019 where other insurance providing the required coverage is available to either the claimant or the insured. Here, solvent insurers . . . provided coverage to Garcia\u2019s employer during the liability period for cumulative injury prescribed in Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (a). Garcia proved his cumulative injury against his employer, [and the solvent insurers]. Hence, even though Garcia\u2019s employer\u2019s three workers\u2019 compensation policies did not overlap chronologically, [the solvent insurers] were jointly and severally liable to Garcia for his entire disability during the statutory liability period. . . . Since such \u2018other insurance\u2019 provided by [the solvent insurers] was thus available to cover Garcia\u2019s benefit award, CIGA was statutorily prohibited from making any payment toward his award. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201cIn sum, the Legislature did not intend CIGA to defray or diminish the responsibility of other carriers. Instead, the Legislature intended CIGA to benefit claimants otherwise unable to obtain insurance in payment of their claims. Here, insurance other than insolvent [insurer\u2019s] policy was available to satisfy the employer\u2019s liability to Garcia, to wit, the policies of solvent carriers .... Garcia had the substantive right to collect his entire benefit award from [the solvent insurers] since each was jointly and severally liable. Since Garcia\u2019s benefits claim was fully protected by solvent insurers . . . , both Garcia and his employer had \u2018other insurance\u2019 available within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). . . .\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">\u201cWe note that if Garcia had elected to proceed only against [one of the solvent insurers] and succeeded in proving his cumulative injury, he would have received an award for all his benefits and [the solvent insurer] would have been obligated to pay the entire award. Although [the solvent insurer] would have had the right to institute supplemental proceedings against other carriers for contribution (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.5, subds. (c) &amp; (e)), such proceedings would not lie against CIGA due to Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4) [now subd. (c)(5)].\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 559, fn. 8; accord, <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">Because Labor Code section 4600 imposes joint and several liability on employers in successive injury cases, there is \u201cother insurance\u201d available within the meaning of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(i), notwithstanding Labor Code sections 3208.2 and 5303.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The WCAB erred in ordering CIGA to reimburse AMIC. Each of the three section 1063.1 exclusions discussed in this opinion is a separate and independent bar to AMIC\u2019s reimbursement claim for past and future medical benefits and temporary disability. The WCAB\u2019s order is annulled. We remand with instructions to respondent WCAB to vacate its order and issue a new order denying AMIC\u2019s lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Gilbert, P. J., and Coffee, L, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On April 21, 2005, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petition of respondent American Motorists Insurance Company for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 27, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\"> All statutory references are to the Insurance Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> We have not discussed any arguments made by AMIC because its brief contains no argument concerning subdivision (c)(5) or (9)(ii).
