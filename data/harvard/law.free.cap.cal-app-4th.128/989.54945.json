J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afa\">This case involves the interplay between Code of Civil Procedure section 340.9 (section 340.9), which revives certain time-barred claims against insurers for policy benefits for losses caused by the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake, and the responsibilities of the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), which is obligated under Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. to pay the \u201ccovered claims\u201d of insolvent insurers. Specifically, does an insured state a cause of action against CIGA for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. by alleging he or she has a Northridge earthquake claim against an insolvent insurer, revived by section 340.9, that has been denied by CIGA?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Based on the purpose of CIGA to protect the insured public from insolvent insurers by paying \u201ccovered claims,\u201d as defined by Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1) <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548, 557 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295]), and the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting section 340.9 to \u201c \u2018bring needed relief to the victims of the Northridge earthquake\u2019 \u201d by providing a one-year window for insureds with otherwise time-barred claims to file suit against their insurance company <em>(20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1247,1267 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 611]), the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d at least with respect to claims against insurers declared insolvent after the effective date of section 340.9. We, therefore, reverse the order of dismissal, finding the trial court erred by concluding CIGA could have no obligations with respect to an otherwise time-barred claim for policy benefits revived by section 340.9. Because the operative complaint in this case is wholly deficient in its allegations of revival of the insureds\u2019 claim under section 340.9 and of CIGA\u2019s actions, if any, on the claim, however, we remand with directions for the trial court to enter an order sustaining CIGA\u2019s demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">1. <em>The Original Complaint and CIGA\u2019s Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On December 31, 2001 Wolfram and Renata Berger and Jerry and Celia Kayle filed a complaint against their insurer, Reliance Insurance Company, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation based on Reliance\u2019s failure to pay policy benefits for damage to their properties caused by the Northridge earthquake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the complaint was filed on December 31, 2001, the last day of the revival period under section 340.9, it does not mention the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint alleges, \u201cPlaintiffs gave timely and adequate notice of claim.\u201d Apparently realizing Reliance was insolvent, on October 25, 2002 the Bergers and the Kayles amended their complaint, substituting CIGA for Doe 100, which included it in the allegations as to each cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">CIGA demurred to the complaint. The trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation on the ground those causes of action against CIGA were time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court granted the Bergers and the Kayles leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>amend to assert a cause of action against CIGA based on its statutory duties under Insurance Code section 1063 et seq., invoked as a result of Reliance\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">2. <em>The First Amended Complaint and CIGA\u2019s Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The Bergers, and the Kayles filed a first amended complaint on February 13, 2003,* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> disregarding the trial court\u2019s order sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer to the causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation in the original complaint and alleging those same causes of action against Reliance and CIGA, and adding a cause of action against CIGA for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The first amended complaint alleges Reliance is in liquidation; and \u201c[t]he State of Pennsylvania has issued an order requiring proof of claim on or before December 31, 2003. Plaintiffs have and/or will be submitting that claim and accordingly said claim has been timely submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">As to CIGA, the first amended complaint alleges, \u201cPlaintiffs are further informed and believe that CIGA will administrate the claim in accordance with California Insurance Code \u00a7 1063. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that CIGA will act in accordance with its standard practice\u2014refusing to adjust valid claims. Plaintiffs therefor[e] affirmatively allege that CIGA has already denied Plaintiffs\u2019 valid claim giving rise to a cause of action\u201d for breach of its statutory obligations. With respect to Insurance Code section 1063 et seq., the first amended complaint alleges, \u201cIn the alternative to the preceding causes of action asserted directly against NATIONAL AUTO <em>[sic], </em>Plaintiff[s] [are] now informed and believe[] and based thereon allege that CIGA is the entity now responsible for handling and/or adjustment of Plaintiffs\u2019] claim against NATIONAL AUTO <em>[sic]. </em>Plaintiff[s] [are] now informed and believe[] and based thereon allege that CIGA accepted responsibility to adjust the claim pursuant to Insurance Code \u00a7 1063.\u201d The first amended complaint continues, \u201cAs of the filing of this document, CIGA refuses to adjust the claim of Plaintiff. CIGA has done nothing relative to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>adjustment. By this complaint, Plaintiff once against urges CIGA to conduct itself in a manner consistent with the \u2018public trust\u2019 and in accordance with the law. In the event CIGA notifies Plaintiff of an intent to adjust (as opposed to completely ignoring the claim) Plaintiff would be inclined to dismiss the present action against CIGA without prejudice on the condition that CIGA stipulate that any necessary refiling will be deemed to relate back to the filing of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">CIGA filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, contending it was uncertain and, in any event, failed to state a cause of action for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. CIGA asserted the claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation should be stricken based on the trial court\u2019s prior order sustaining without leave to amend a demurrer to those causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">3. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling and Dismissal of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The trial court sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint, finding the Bergers and the Kayles had failed to state a cause of action against CIGA for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. because their claim for policy benefits was time-barred and section 340.9 did not revive claims against CIGA. The court granted the Bergers and the Kayles leave to amend to allege facts demonstrating their claims were timely under principles of equitable tolling. The court struck the remaining causes of action in the first amended complaint based on its ruling on CIGA\u2019s demurrer to the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The Bergers and the Kayles declined to amend the first amended complaint. On that basis CIGA filed a motion to dismiss, which was unopposed. The trial court dismissed the action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The Bergers and the Kayles contend the trial court erred by sustaining CIGA\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint because they have stated a cause of action against CIGA for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. They also contend the first amended complaint states a claim for unfair business practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer, we independently review the complaint to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory. <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].) We give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, \u201ctreat[ing] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,\u201d but do not \u201cassume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.

Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 970.) Leave to amend may be granted on appeal even in the absence of a request by the plaintiff to amend the complaint. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 971; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 472c, subd.

Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 364.) As relevant to this case, the statutory definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>\u201ccovered claims\u201d is \u201cthe obligations of an insolvent insurer . . . (i) imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer; (ii) which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer; (iii) which are presented as a claim to the liquidator in this state or to the association on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary liquidating proceedings; (iv) which were incurred prior to the date coverage under the policy terminated and prior to, on, or within 30 days after the date the liquidator was appointed; (v) for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Ins.

(c)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Because CIGA\u2019s obligations are not coextensive with the insolvent insurer, it is not responsible for the tortious conduct of the insolvent insurer. (Ins.

CIGA also has been held immune from tort liability for its own conduct in fulfilling its duties to pay \u201ccovered claims.\u201d <em>(Isaacson, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 783-789 [CIGA immune from liability for unfair practices under Ins.

Code, \u00a7 1063.12, subd. (a) [CIGA \u201cshall under no circumstances be liable for any sum in excess of the amount of covered claims of the insolvent insurer\u201d].) Nevertheless, \u201cif CIGA improperly denies coverage or refuses to defend an insured on a \u2018covered claim\u2019 arising under an insolvent insurer\u2019s policy, it breaches its statutory duties under the Guarantee Act.\u201d <em>(Isaacson, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 792.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">b. <em>Section 340.9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Although the limitations period in California for actions on contracts is four years (Code Civ.

The statute revives Northridge earthquake claims that otherwise would be time-barred in cases in which \u201can insured contacted an insurer or an insurer\u2019s representative prior to January 1, 2000, regarding potential Northridge earthquake damage\u201d and allows a cause of action based on the revived claim to be filed within one year of the effective date of the statute.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (\u00a7 340.9, subd. (a) [claim for damages arising out of the Northridge earthquake that is barred \u201csolely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of [January 1, 2001]\u201d]; see <em>Newell v. State Farm General Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1105 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 343] [Legislature expressly directed that section 340.9 \u201coperate to revive certain earthquake claims for a period of one year only\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The legislative history of the statute indicates the author introduced the bill because the one-year limitations period \u201c \u2018has unfairly barred victims [of the Northridge earthquake] from being compensated for their losses because many were tragically misled [by their insurers or representatives thereof] about the extent of damage suffered as a result of the earthquake.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hellinger </em>v. <em>Farmers Group, Inc. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1058 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 268].) According to the statute\u2019s proponents, \u201c \u2018[Thousands of people who suffered damage to their homes did not receive the benefit of their insurance contracts because of the insurance companies\u2019 conduct. . . . [A]mple evidence exists to show that insurers handling Northridge earthquake claims engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>of damage to their homes. Later, when it became clear that the problems were indeed significant, . . . the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become time-barred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Section 340.9 has been held to revive claims against insurers for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which are based on the contract of insurance, but not claims for fraud, which do not rest on the insurers\u2019 failure to perform under the insurance policy. <em>(20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1279-1281; <em>Hellinger v. Farmers Group, Inc., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1067-1068.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">c. <em>CIGA Is Responsible for at Least Some Claims Revived by Section 340.9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">CIGA contends it is not responsible for paying any otherwise time-barred claims against an insolvent insurer that are revived by section 340.9 because the statute applies only to insurers and CIGA is not an insurer. According to CIGA, unless an insured can demonstrate that his or her claim for policy benefits against an insolvent insurer is timely under the policy\u2019s one-year limitations period, CIGA has no statutory liability on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Although we agree section 340.9 does not directly apply to CIGA, we disagree that CIGA can rely on the contractual one-year limitations period in an insurance policy to deny any responsibility for a revived claim against an insurer declared insolvent after the statute\u2019s effective date.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 340.9 \u201coverrides\u201d the contractual language in a policy limiting the period in which an insured may file suit against its insurer. <em>(Bialo v. Western Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 68, 78-79 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 3] [statute \u201citself precludes contractual provisions from limiting its applicability\u201d]; see <em>20th Century Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1268-1274 [by reviving claims beyond the one-year limitations provision, section 340.9 does not impermissibly impair the contract of coverage or violate vested due process rights]; <em>Hellinger </em>v. <em>Farmers Group, Inc., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1061-1067 [same].) It creates a new limitations period for claims that fall within its terms by giving insureds one year from its effective date of January 1, 2001 to file an action against an insurer based on a revived claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number><em>(Rosenblum v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 847, 858 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 427] [section 340.9 \u201cdid nothing more than reopen the filing window, for a one year period, to those <em>otherwise viable </em>cases that had become time barred\u201d].) Thus, for a claim revived by section 340.9, the one-year limitations period in the policy has been effectively replaced, at least as to insurers who were not declared insolvent prior to January 1, 2001. CIGA, therefore, cannot refuse a claim revived by section 340.9 based on the superseded one-year limitations provision in the policy issued by those insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">This result comports with both the purpose of CIGA and the reason for the enactment of section 340.9. Although it is not an insurer, nor are its duties coextensive with those of an insurance company, CIGA was created to protect the insured public by paying \u201ccovered claims\u201d in the event of insurer insolvency. <em>(California Insurance Guarantee Assn. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 363-364; see also <em>Isaacson, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 784.) In enacting section 340.9, the Legislature determined a claim that otherwise would be barred solely because the applicable limitations period had expired will now be within the coverage of the insurance policy. A revived claim under section 340.9 against an insurer declared insolvent after the statute\u2019s effective date, therefore, is a covered claim \u201cimposed by law\u201d and \u201cwithin the coverage of an insurance policy.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">To support its contention that it should be able to rely on the one-year limitations period in the policy despite section 340.9, CIGA cites <em>Aloha Pacific, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 297 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 148] <em>(Aloha Pacific), </em>in which Division Four of this court held CIGA may contest whether a claim is covered by the insurance policy of an insolvent insurer, even though a third party claimant had previously obtained a judicial determination that the insurer \u201c \u2018ha[d] no present basis for denying coverage\u2019 and that its \u2018failure to reserve its right to contest coverage under the policy\u2019s exclusions of coverage for willful acts or trademark infringement waived its right to assert those exclusions as a basis for denying coverage in the federal action [against its insured for trademark infringement].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305.) When the third party attempted to collect on the claim from CIGA after the insurer became insolvent, CIGA declined, contending it could litigate whether the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy covered the claim despite the prior judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 306, 308.) Division Four agreed with CIGA, reasoning that, although the prior judgment had concluded the insurer did not have the right to deny coverage based on its limited reservation of rights, it did not determine whether the claim was \u201cwithin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>risks of loss protected against by the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 312-313.) In fact, notwithstanding the faulty reservation of rights, the claim was not covered by the policy and, therefore, did not come within the limited definition of \u201ccovered claims\u201d in Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1), by which CIGA\u2019s obligation to pay must be measured. <em>(Aloha Pacific, </em>at pp. 308-313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><em>Aloha Pacific </em>is distinguishable from the situation presented here, both as a factual matter and in terms of the policy considerations involved. In <em>Aloha Pacific </em>Division Four concluded CIGA was entitled to look to the policy itself to determine whether the claim was covered within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1), without regard to the insurer\u2019s failure to properly assert all policy-based grounds for denying or limiting coverage. In contrast, with section 340.9 the Legislature has overridden policy language to afford qualifying insureds an extended limitations period, in effect amending the policy to provide an additional benefit. Just as CIGA was entitled to look to the policy itself to determine its obligations in <em>Aloha Pacific, </em>in this case CIGA is required to look to the policy itself, as now revised by the Legislature, to determine whether a Northridge earthquake victim\u2019s property damage claim is covered under Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">CIGA also contends that, because it is not responsible for the wrongful acts of an insolvent insurer, it should not be obligated to pay claims revived by section 340.9, which was enacted because insurers in many cases had wrongfully denied policy benefits for earthquake damage. The Legislature in enacting section 340.9, however, was clear the purpose of the statute was to provide insureds with another chance to seek compensation for Northridge earthquake damage, not to punish insurers for any wrongful conduct. <em>(20th Century Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1268, fn. 21 [statute \u201cintended to \u2018provide these individuals who . . . were victimized twice, (once by the earthquake and a second time by their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>insurance companies) with a reasonable \u201csecond chance\u201d to seek redress for their damages.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d]; see also <em>21st Century Ins.

Superior Court </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1365, fn. 8 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 476] [purpose of section 340.9 is compensation, not to punish insurers; \u201cit is clear that the statute was tailored to restore to earthquake victims any lost civil causes of action, not to punish insurers\u201d].) Thus, CIGA\u2019s responsibility to administer claims revived by section 340.9 does not make it liable, directly or indirectly, for the wrongful acts of insurers and in no way undermines its statutory immunity from liability for the torts of the insolvent insurer. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.2, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">CIGA also maintains <em>Hydro-Mill Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton &amp; Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc. </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1167 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 582], a case in which Division One of our court found section 340.9 did not revive a claim against an insurance broker for malpractice, supports its argument it is not responsible for any revived claims. But our holding that CIGA must administer revived claims, at least as to insurers declared insolvent after the effective date of section 340.9, is not predicated on a finding that section 340.9 directly applies to CIGA, a conclusion that would conflict with Division One\u2019s analysis. Rather, it is premised on the fact that section 340.9 alters the one-year limitations provision in the insurance policy. CIGA, therefore, cannot rely on that superseded provision to maintain a claim is not covered within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1). In sum, although section 340.9 does not directly apply to CIGA, it plainly affects CIGA\u2019s responsibility to pay the \u201ccovered claims\u201d of insolvent insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">3. <em>Although the First Amended Complaint Is Factually Deficient, the Bergers and the Kayles Are Entitled to Leave to Amend to Assert a Cause of Action Pursuant to Insurance Code Section 1063 et Seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The trial court sustained CIGA\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint on the ground the Bergers and the Kayles could not rely on section 340.9 to demonstrate the timeliness of their claims for policy benefits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This was error. Nevertheless, as it stands the first amended complaint is wholly deficient in its allegations that the Bergers and the Kayles have a claim for benefits that has been revived by section 340.9 and that CIGA has not fulfilled its responsibilities under Insurance Code section 1063 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>With respect to section 340.9, the Bergers and the Kayles do not allege their claims satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements for revival. Although the Bergers and the Kayles state in their opening brief that they \u201ccontacted Reliance between January 17, 1994 and January 1, 2000\u201d and \u201ccontacted representatives of the insurer before January 1, 2000,\u201d no similar allegations appear in the first amended complaint. Instead, they simply allege, \u201cPlaintiffs gave timely and adequate notice of claim.\u201d This allegation states only a legal conclusion, rather than pleading facts, and, as such, is inadequate. <em>(Kenneth Mebane Ranches v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 276, 291 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 562] [\u201callegations constituting legal conclusions are not provisionally admitted for the purposes of a demurrer\u201d]; see Code Civ.

Nor does the first amended complaint make any allegations with respect to the administration of the claims by Reliance to demonstrate the claims asserted are covered by the insurance policies and to satisfy all the requirements of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The first amended complaint also fails to demonstrate the Bergers\u2019 and the Kayles\u2019 claims against CIGA are ripe. They do not specifically allege they filed claims in the insolvency proceedings against Reliance but merely state they \u201chave and/or will be submitting . . . claim[s] [in the insolvency proceedings] on or before December 31, 2003.\u201d In addition, they do not allege CIGA has denied their claims but merely assert that CIGA will refuse or has refused to act on them. The Bergers and the Kayles, therefore, cannot pursue their cause of action against CIGA for violation of Insurance Code section 1063 et seq. based on the first amended complaint. <em>(Breneric Associates v. City of Del Mar </em>(1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 188 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 324] [\u201cdemurrer may be sustained when the complaint shows on its face the claim is not ripe for adjudication\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Although generally a party who has declined to take advantage of leave to amend must stand on his or her pleading (see <em>Rader v.

Osman </em>(1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 465, 466-467 [164 P.2d 545]), that principle does not apply here. The trial court granted leave to amend on a limited ground, based on its erroneous ruling that CIGA could face no liability on a claim revived by section 340.9. The Bergers and the Kayles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>therefore, are entitled to leave to amend to file a second amended complaint to attempt to remedy the defects in the first amended complaint identified in this opinion by adequately pleading their claims for policy benefits are within the policy\u2019s coverage and revived by section 340.9 and CIGA has denied payment on the claims despite their compliance with the claims presentation requirements in the liquidation order against Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">4. <em>No Basis Exists for Assertion of a Cause of Action Under Business and Professions Code Section 17200</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In one short paragraph in their opening brief, the Bergers and Kayles contend in conclusory fashion that the first amended complaint states a cause of action for unfair business practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, they fail to make a coherent argument or cite any authority to support their contention, nor do they specify any facts they maintain would state a cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.

As to the causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>CIGA was not a proper defendant because it had no contractual relationship with the Bergers and the Kayles and, alternatively, section 340.9 did not apply to CIGA because it is not an insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\"> Although the first amended complaint is file-stamped \u201cFebruary 13, 2002,\u201d the record is clear, and the parties do not dispute, that it was filed on February 13, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\"> As in the original complaint, the first amended complaint does not include a cause of action for unfair business practices but alleges the Bergers and the Kayles are suing in their individual capacities and on behalf of the general public and prays for relief under Business and Professions Code section 17200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\"> The trial court initially entered a minute order on January 26, 2004 memorializing its dismissal of the action. Although not included in the limited appellants\u2019 appendix filed by the Bergers and the Kayles, according to the trial court\u2019s register of actions, CIGA filed a notice of entry of judgment on January 30, 2004, presumably in reference to the January 26, 2004 minute order. The Bergers and the Kayles filed a notice of appeal on March 30, 2004. Subsequently, on August 10,2004, the trial court entered a written order of dismissal. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581d [\u201cAll dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes\u201d].) We treat the notice of appeal filed by the Bergers and Kayles as premature and construe it as an appeal from the August 10, 2004 order of dismissal. (Cal.

Accordingly, any argument that the causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation are viable has been waived. <em>(Tiernan v.

We note, however, there is no contractual relationship between CIGA and the insureds of an insolvent insurer on which to base a claim for breach of contract or bad faith. <em>(Isaacson v.

In addition, CIGA is statutorily immune from liability for the torts of an insurance company and from tort liability for its own conduct in administering the claims of an insolvent insurer. (Ins.

But section 340.9 does more than simply limit an insurer\u2019s ability to rely on the one-year limitations period: It alters the terms of the policy to allow insureds an additional year from its effective date to bring suit against their insurer. <em>(Bialo </em>v. <em>Western Mutual Ins.
