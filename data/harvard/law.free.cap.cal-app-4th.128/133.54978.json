The County argues the FTSP, adopted by the County\u2019s board of supervisors in December 1991, embodies the applicable zoning and grading regulations, under which the agency properly insisted Hafen obtain a site plan/site development permit (SDP) before being issued a grading permit. The County further asserts that, contrary to the court\u2019s express finding, Hafen has no vested right that would exempt or excuse him from compliance with the FTSP\u2019s requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The County is correct. For reasons we now explain, we reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court with directions to deny the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The subject property consists of 9.277 acres of unimproved land located at the intersection of Hamilton Trail and Wunder Trail in the unincorporated area of Orange County known as South County. In 1989, then-owner Terry Parkin proposed the property be subdivided into four rural residential hillside estate parcels, each a minimum of two acres. Parkin began processing a tentative parcel map (TPM) with the County. Parkin\u2019s TPM 89-234 showed the four proposed parcels, as well as the parameters of rough contour grading, retaining walls, pad elevations, road and driveway locations, and earth grading quantities stated in cubic yards for each of the four parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">On August 22, 1990, the County notified Parkin it had \u201capproved [TPM 89-234] subject ... to the findings and conditions as stated in the attached final tentative parcel map report.\u201d The TPM report, in turn, noted the property was encompassed within \u201c[FTSP] Interim Guidelines,\u201d but the project as proposed was \u201cexempt from the interim guidelines of the [FTSP].\u201d The TPM report contained 37 conditions, most of them pertaining to requirements for issuance of grading permits. Among those are three of relevance here: condition No. 18, providing, \u201cPrior to the issuance of a grading permit,\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>there appears to be \u201csignificant deviation from the proposed grading illustrated on the approved [TPM]\u201d in certain respects, the plan will be subject to further review by the subdivision committee \u201cfor a finding of substantial conformance.\u201d If such a finding is not achieved, the developer, depending on the circumstances, will be required to process a revised tentative tract map, a new TPM, or an SDP application; condition No. 32, stating, \u201cPrior to the issuance of any grading and building permits for each individual parcel, in addition to the private travelway/retaining walls along the private travelway, the owner/subdivider shall submit a site development permit [SDP] in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-9-150 of the Orange County Zoning Code,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and a note to that effect shall be placed on the final parcel map\u201d; and condition No. 36, stating, \u201cPrior to the issuance of a grading or building permit on each parcel, the developer shall submit an application for [an SDP], in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Zoning Code Section 7-9-150, for review and approval by the Manager, Current Planning, in consultation with the Manager, Advance Planning. Further, a note to this effect shall be lettered on the final parcel map.\u201d1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Underscoring omitted.) The County\u2019s notification of approval of TPM 89-234 further advised Parkin, \u201cThe conditional approval of this tentative parcel map does not create the parcels shown on the map. State and County laws require that a parcel map prepared by a registered civil engineer authorized to practice surveying, or licensed land surveyor, and substantially in compliance with the map and conditions of approval shall be recorded prior to the expiration date. Failure to record a parcel map by the expiration date shall render this conditional approval null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In December 1991, 16 months after the County conditionally approved Parkin\u2019s TPM, the County Board of Supervisors adopted the FTSP, which by its own terms expressly rescinded the interim guidelines. Thus, the provision of the original TPM exempting Parkin from compliance with the FTSP interim guidelines became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\n<em>The FTSP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The FTSP area encompasses some 6,500 acres in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. The title page of the FTSP states: \u201cThe accompanying text and Land Use Districts map constitute the land use regulations under which development will be governed for the area hereinafter to be referred to as the Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan. The properties involved [including Parkin\u2019s] were placed in the \u2018Specific Plan\u2019 Zoning District by Ordinance Number 3851 adopted by the Orange County Board of Supervisors on December 10, 1991.\u201d The FTSP\u2019s stated purpose is \u201cto set forth goals, policies, land use district regulations, development guidelines, and implementation programs in order to preserve the area\u2019s rural character and to guide future development in the Foothill/Trabuco area.\u201d The FTSP further states, \u201cUnless otherwise provided for within this document, all future development in the Specific Plan Area must be found consistent with the Specific Plan Components, the Land Use District Regulations and the Development and Design Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The FTSP provides, \u201cThe [FTSP] Land Use Regulations are adopted per Orange County Zoning Code section 7-9-156 for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the existing and future residents of the Specific Plan Area, as well as the residents of Orange County overall. More specifically, these regulations are intended to provide the standards, criteria and procedures necessary to achieve the Goals and Objectives of the [FTSP] . . . .\u201d Zoning Code section 7-9-156.2, subdivision (c), in turn, provides in pertinent part, \u201cAdoption of a specific plan ordinance shall also include adoption of an appropriate zoning district map. The zoning district map shall not indicate zoning for the area within the specific plan but shall show the letter S within a circle. Thereafter, <em>all land use, development and improvements shall conform to the provisions of the adopted specific plan.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In addition, Zoning Code section 7-9-139, subdivision (a) mandates, <em>\u201cGrading and excavation regulations adopted in a planned community text or a specific plan shall supercede this section.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The information sheet received by applicants for entitlements within the FTSP provides: \u201cThe Specific Plan was adopted by the Orange County Board of Supervisors ... as the planning and zoning document for the Foothill/Trabuco area. The goal of the Plan is to preserve the rural character and unique natural resources of the area while allowing landowners a reasonable opportunity to develop their properties.\u201d The document emphasizes the FTSP\u2019s grading requirements, noting they \u201care designed to minimize landform alteration,\u201d and advising, <em>\u201cAll grading activities must first have an approved site development permit </em>even through [\u00bf/c] a grading permit may not be required.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Consistent with that advisement, the stated goals of the FTSP include, inter alia, \u201ca . . . To preserve the rural character of the area and provide a buffer between urban development and the Cleveland National Forest. HI] b ... To preserve significant landform, biological and scenic resources. [][] c ... To ensure at least some development potential on each individual property.\u201d Likewise, the FTSP contains detailed objectives, such as, \u201c[m]inimiz[ing] the intrusion of development and landform alterations within the viewsheds of LiveOak/Trabuco Canyon Road and Santiago Canyon Road without precluding development which blends into the natural terrain and does not require excessive landform alteration\u201d; \u201c[p]reserv[ing] significant landform features, including major ridgelines and rock outcroppings, while allowing] limited development on minor ridgelines provided the development blends into the natural terrain and does not require excessive landform alteration\u201d; and \u201c[p]reserv[ing] significant biological resources . . . .\u201d Further, the Development Potential section of the FTSP states that development on hillsides and minor ridgelines will be allowed \u201cprovided grading for the structures and building pads is limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The goals and objectives of the FTSP are implemented through substantive and procedural requirements and regulations, including the SDP process that must precede grading in the FTSP area. Of particular relevance here is the land use regulation the superior court erroneously allowed Hafen to bypass. It is set forth in part III, section C-6.1, and it provides, \u201cGrading shall be permitted within the Specific Plan Area <em>only upon approval of a site development permit </em>or use permit by the Planning Commission. <em>No grading permits shall be issued without the approval of a precise plan of development, i.e., site development permit or use </em>permit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As expressly authorized in Zoning Code section 7-9-150 (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>the FTSP sets forth requirements far more restrictive than the code itself for approval of an SDP prior to the issuance of a grading permit. For instance, submissions must include a preliminary grading plan delineating existing and proposed graded contour elevations, the location and elevation of all proposed building pads, access roads, and driveways, including percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>grades, a separate grading plan for the roads and driveways and another for the building pad, including depiction of cut and fill areas and total grading volumes, a slope analysis depicting separately those slopes of varying categories of degree, and other specific information.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, a supplement to the FTSP recites an impressive list of development and design guidelines, including highly specific ones for grading. The guidelines are intended, in part, \u201cto preclude conventional solutions to hillside development, including large-scale, mass grading and creation of large, flat residential building pads typical of flatland development.\u201d Moreover, although the development and design guidelines \u201care not regulatory,\u201d all development proposals, except for exclusions not applicable here, must be presented for \u201creviewQ by the Planning Commission for a determination of consistency with the Guidelines.\u201d Clearly, grading issues are at the very heart of the FTSP, its environmental and aesthetic concerns, its substantive and procedural regulations, and its design guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\n<em>Post-FTSP Events</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In June 1992, Parkin submitted a request to extend by three years the time within which to record TPM S9-234.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The County\u2019s subdivision committee approved the extension, but only after amending the final TPM report, stating it was subject to certain conditions. Condition No. 36 was revised, eliminating the language relating to Zoning Code section 7-9-150\u2019s requirement for an SDP, and replacing it with rules under the FTSP, as follows: \u201cPrior to the issuance of a grading or building permit on each parcel, the developer shall obtain an approved site plan in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan. Further, a note to this effect shall be lettered on the final parcel map.\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) The chief of the tentative map section certified that the extended TPM 89-234 was approved subject to the stated conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The TPM and report were respectively extended and amended in later years by operation of law and by action of the subdivision committee. On July 28, 1998, at Parkin\u2019s request, the TPM was extended for two additional years, until August 22, 2000. As in prior instances, the County\u2019s notification letter again advised Parkin the conditional approval \u201cdoes not create the parcels shown on the map. State and County laws require that a licensed land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>surveyor or a registered civil engineer authorized to practice land surveying prepare a parcel map which is substantially in compliance with the tentative parcel map and conditions of approval and record it prior to the expiration date.\u201d The final TPM report, as amended August 5, 1992, noted the applicable zoning for the proposed parcels was within the FTSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>Events Leading to Hafen\u2019s Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Hafen bought the property from Parkin in April 2000. On August 2, 2000, Hafen\u2019s civil engineer, George Polycrates, who had also served Parkin over the years, submitted an \u201cApplicant\u2019s Information Sheet for a Building/Grading Permit,\u201d stating Hafen sought a permit to do \u201crough grading (residential).\u201d On the County\u2019s \u201cGrading Permit Land Use Approval Worksheet,\u201d signed by Polycrates, was a typewritten description showing the application was for \u201cPRELIMINARY GRADING FOR PARCELS 1 THRU 4 AND ROAD.\u201d The form further specified as additional items for completion by the applicant: \u201c2. COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS OF RELATED PLANNING APPLICATION]: IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS OF THE FOOTHLL TRABUCO SPECIFIC PLAN, APPLICANT REQUIRED TO PROCESS SITE PLAN [SDP],\u201d and \u201c6. APPLICANT NEEDS TO SUBMIT SITE PLAN (P.A.) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS OF THE [FTSP], COMPLY WITH CONDITIONS OF SITE PLAN AND RECORD TPM 89-234.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Five days later, on August 7, 2000, Hafen applied for approval of an SDP under the FTSP, and submitted an \u201cEnvironmental Information\u201d document on which Polycrates acknowledged that the required governmental approvals for the proposed rough grading project were \u201cInitial study, Area plan, [and SDP].\u201d While Hafen continued with his efforts to obtain a grading permit, he also processed the final parcel map for the County\u2019s approval and recorded it on December 20, 2000. As required by the final TPM report, the final parcel map referred to conditions, including, \u201c4. For each parcel the developer shall obtain an approved site plan [SDP], in accordance with the requirements set forth in the [FTSP].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In July 2001, Polycrates wrote to Frank McGill of the County\u2019s Planning and Development Services Department, on the subject of the SDP, for the first time expressing his belief there was no need for a \u201cdiscretionary permit,\u201d i.e., an SDP, prior to rough grading, and requesting that the department \u201cclear our project so we can proceed and get the [grading] permit.\u201d Polycrates stated his position as follows: \u201cTPM 89-234 was originally approved on August 22, 1990 and the original conditions were revised and updated on August 5, 1992 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to conform to the [FTSP] which was adopted December 1991. The approval of our Tentative Map establishes that our design depicted on that map was approved and accepted by the Planning Department .... During the process of approval of the Tentative we went through the site reviews, the proposed design was analyzed by all the departments and all unanimously approved our design. We have not deviated substantially from the approved Tentative so we see no basis for denying us a permit to proceed with currently bonded construction plans.\u201d Polycrates was alluding to the approved TPM\u2019s Condition No. 18 (summarized at pp. 135-136, <em>ante), </em>contending by reverse implication that a grading permit will issue without an SDP if the proposed grading substantially conforms to the grading illustration on the tentative tract map.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Polycrates also contended rough grading of the property did not trigger the SDP requirement because finished grading might be required when the individual lots were developed. Since that grading might differ from the rough grading as illustrated in the preliminary drawing on the approved original TPM, Hafen would need an SDP under condition No. 18 only when the four parcels were individually prepared. He further argued that conditions Nos. 32 and 66 requiring an SDP, the former under Zoning Code section 7-9-150, the latter under the FTSP, referred to individual lots, not to the whole property, i.e., \u201cPrior to the issuance of any grading and building permits for <em>each individual </em>parcel\u201d (condition No. 32, italics added), and \u201cPrior to the issuance of a grading or building permit on <em>each </em>parcel.\u201d (Condition No. 36, italics added.) This language, applied literally, meant grading was allowed without the need for an SDP as long as the entire property was graded at one time. Finally, alluding to another FTSP regulation, Polycrates added, \u201cWe have four legal lots and no one has the power to tell us that these lots cannot be developed unless there are <em>extreme </em>public health and safety concerns .... We made an agreement with the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The line in the sand was drawn. Hafen stood firm, and so did the County, insisting Hafen needed to comply with the FTSP\u2019s overall requirement that <em>any </em>grading be preceded by an SDP. After extended haggling and an attempt at mediation, with no resolution in sight, Hafen turned to the court for intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>The Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In January 2003, Hafen filed his verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, in which he alleged, \u201cOn or about August 5, 1992, the original conditions of approval of TPM 89-234 were revised and updated to conform to the Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan that had been adopted in December 1991 and the time period during which the Map would remain valid was extended as conditioned.\u201d He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>alleged the County had a ministerial duty to issue a grading permit, and he convinced the court he was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">On April 27, 2004, judgment was entered granting a peremptory writ of mandate \u201ccommanding [the County] to set aside [its] decision to deny [Hafen] the rough grading permit and directing [the County] to issue the rough grading permit in accordance with [the] grading shown on the tentative map.\u201d In its minute order expressly serving as the statement of decision, the court found the County had failed to prove there was anything discretionary about grading permits following approval of a TPM, and the issuance of the permit was a purely ministerial act which the County was compelled to perform. As particularly germane to the discussion which follows and our disposition of the case, the court concluded, \u201cThe County cannot use the 1991 FTSP to impose new conditions on the project that had not been imposed on the tentative map if the project is in substantial compliance with the tentative map.\u201d The requirement that Hafen obtain an SDP before issuance of a rough grading permit was one such impermissible new condition. Citing <em>Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 518], the court found the County\u2019s initial approval of the TPM, prior to adoption of the FTSP, gave Hafen \u201ccertain vested rights as to the approval of the final map.\u201d It found no proof the FTSP constituted a zoning ordinance that would permit the County to impose conditions \u201cadded after the approval of the tentative map.\u201d That being the case, Hafen\u2019s right to grade the property without obtaining an SDP could not be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Although in more than 150 pages of briefing the parties present a dizzying array of arguments to justify reversal or affirmance of the judgment, as the respective case may be, the straightforward law applicable to the facts requires little discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We begin with the fundamental rule in California that even after a final subdivision map has been approved, zoning may be changed in a way that affects or restricts use of the property. In <em>Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 785 [132 Cal.Rptr. 386, 553 P.2d 546] <em>(Avco), </em>our Supreme Court was \u201cconfronted with the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a land developer who seeks to avoid compliance with a recently enacted law regulating its project, and the interest of the public in assuring development of the property in a manner consistent with the requirements of current law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 788.)  Citing the established principle that \u201ca builder must comply with the laws which are in effect at the time a building permit is issued, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>laws which were enacted after application for the permit\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 795), and noting it was \u201cbeyond question that a landowner has no vested right in existing or anticipated zoning\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 796), the <em>Avco </em>court concluded a public entity may enforce changes in zoning regulations notwithstanding prior subdivision approval unless the owner or developer (1) has obtained a building permit for an identifiable structure, and (2) has performed substantial work in reliance thereon. <em>(Ibid., passim.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Hafen does not claim to have done either, thus the exception does not apply. Under <em>Avco, </em>no vested rights stand in the way of the County\u2019s power to enforce changes in zoning regulations that occurred after the approval of TPM 89-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Does the FTSP encompass changes in zoning regulations applicable to Hafen\u2019s property, which is located within the FTSP specific plan area? Yes, and the court erred in finding the County had not proved the predicate. Zoning Code section 7-9-156.2, subdivision (c), provides in pertinent part: \u201cAdoption of a specific plan ordinance shall also include adoption of an appropriate zoning district map. The zoning district map shall not indicate zoning for the area within the specific plan but shall show the letter S within a circle. Thereafter, <em>all land use, development and improvements shall conform to the provisions of the adopted specific plan.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Even more notably, Zoning Code section 7-9-139, entitled \u201cGrading and Excavation,\u201d provides, in subdivision (a): \u201cGrading and excavation regulations <em>adopted in a . . . specific plan shall supercede this section.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The Zoning Code itself placed the FTSP at the top of the zoning pyramid.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Does the FTSP set forth superseding grading regulations? Yes. Part III, section C-6.1 provides: \u201cGrading: Grading shall be permitted within the Specific Plan Area <em>only upon approval of a site development permit </em>... by the Planning Commission. <em>No grading permits shall be issued without the approval of a precise plan of development, i.e., site development permit or use permit.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Do the conditions imposed by the subdivision committee requiring an SDP prior to obtaining a grading permit for each individual parcel displace, supplant, or otherwise invalidate the FTSP regulation making an SDP a condition for obtaining <em>any </em>grading permit? No. The conditions <em>may </em>impose additional obligations on Hafen (that question is not before us), but the Zoning Code holds the grading trump card, and Zoning Code section 7-9-139 has passed that card to the FTSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Additionally, as a zoning regulation, the FTSP, including part III, section C-6.1, constitutes an exception to section 65961 which, in a nutshell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>prohibits a local government, during the five-year period after a final parcel map is filed, from imposing a condition on the issuance of a permit that could have been imposed, but was not, as a condition to approval of the tentative map.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See \u00a7 65961, subd. (c) [the provisions of the statute do not prohibit a county from imposing conditions to \u201c[a]ssur[e] compliance with the applicable zoning ordinance\u201d].) The court erred in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Consequently, Hafen\u2019s property, located within the FTSP area, is not exempt from, but is subject to zoning changes occurring after the approval of TPM 89-234, specifically the requirement set forth in part III, section C-6.1, that Hafen obtain an SDP prior to obtaining a permit to rough grade the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Neither <em>City of West Hollywood </em>v. <em>Beverly Towers, Inc. </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1184 [278 Cal.Rptr. 375, 805 P.2d 329] <em>(City of West Hollywood) </em>nor <em>El Patio </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Control Bd. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 915 [168 Cal.Rptr. 276] <em>(El Patio), </em>cited by Hafen, changes the <em>Avco </em>rule that no vested rights inhere in a development unless a valid building permit is issued and reliance on the permit occurs. Both cases involve condominium conversions for which no further construction was contemplated. Indeed, the <em>El Patio </em>decision cautions, \u201cNothing herein should be construed as a determination that the approval of a tentative map would allow a property owner to proceed without obtaining other permits which the City might impose if it were not relying upon the Subdivision Map Act.\u201d <em>(El Patio v. Permanent Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d at p. 927.) And in <em>City of West Hollywood, </em>our Supreme Court notes, \u201cNor are we confronted by the same policy consideration that inspired the <em>Avco </em>decision. In that case we were concerned that to grant a developer a vested right to proceed on issuance of a subdivision map, or any other preliminary approval, would impair the government\u2019s right to control land use policy by impressing lots previously subdivided\u2014but on which no building had been constructed\u2014with an \u2018exemption of indeterminate duration from the requirements of any future zoning laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of West Hollywood, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 1192-1193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Hafen argues he will be required to undertake an SDP in due course, when each of the four parcels is individually graded. Whether the SDP approval as a condition to issuance of a rough grading permit will satisfy the conditions imposed by the subdivision committee for grading of each individual parcel is not before us. We decide only that the subdivision committee\u2019s conditions do not supplant the FTSP\u2019s overall requirement for an SDP, as set forth in part III, section C-6.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Hafen and the court both mistakenly relied on section 66474.1 and <em>Beck Development Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 1160, as precluding the County from enforcing the FTSP. Section 66474.1 forbids the local agency from denying \u201capproval of a final or parcel map if it has previously approved a tentative map for the proposed subdivision and if it finds that the final or parcel map is in substantial compliance with the previously approved tentative map.\u201d Likewise, <em>Beck </em>concerns a city\u2019s improper refusal to process a final map. No issue under the statute or the case is involved here: Hafen\u2019s final parcel map was not only approved, but also recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Citing condition No. 18 of the TPM, Hafen argues, and the trial court found, there was no basis for denying a grading permit since Hafen\u2019s proposed rough grading did not deviate substantially from the approved TPM. (See discussion of condition No. 18, pp. 135-136 and 144, fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>True, condition No. 18 allows the County to require a new map or SDP if the proposed grading deviates substantially from the grading illustrated on the approved TPM. But the condition does <em>not </em>eliminate the Zoning Code requirement set forth in part III, section C-6.1 of the FTSP, that an SDP be obtained before <em>any </em>grading permit is issued. And, as we have already noted, under the <em>Avco </em>rule, the Zoning Code sets the preemptive course.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Finally, Hafen argues he and the County had an agreement at the time the final parcel map was approved and recorded, obligating Hafen to construct certain road improvements and other improvements pursuant to the TPM, and the SDP requirement interferes with that contract. We find nothing in the agreement at odds with or preclusive of the County\u2019s enforcement of the SDP provision contained in the FTSP, and Hafen\u2019s six-sentence argument on the issue lacks both germane facts and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In light of our disposition, we need not discuss the other arguments raised by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded with directions to the superior court to deny Hafen\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate.
