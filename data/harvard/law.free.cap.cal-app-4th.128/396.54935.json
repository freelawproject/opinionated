He argues that the court\u2019s denial without jury findings of his motions to strike both his strike prior and his criminal street gang enhancement and the court\u2019s imposition without jury findings of an additional restitution fine and an additional parole revocation restitution fine violate <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] <em>(Blakely), </em>that the fines are constitutionally excessive, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object. We will reject each of his arguments and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">One evening at a bar, Urbano and James Bailey told Kevin Ramsey they were Fresno Bulldogs and lifted their shirts to show off gang tattoos on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>abdomens. Eric Green, sitting next to Ramsey at the bar, said jokingly, \u201c[A]re you running the kids off again[?]\u201d Urbano confronted Green \u201clike, you know, you want some.\u201d Green said, \u201c[L]eave me alone, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Urbano and Bailey barked at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Aware he was in a vulnerable part of the bar, Green stood up and started to walk away, but Urbano and Bailey attacked him. As soon as he hit the floor, Urbano kicked him in the head, time after time, with \u201ceverything he\u2019s got.\u201d For weeks, he suffered pain from the injuries Urbano inflicted. The attack happened so fast Green could not identify anyone. Ramsey identified Urbano as the perpetrator, however, as did bar security employee Charles Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">After bifurcation of allegations of a criminal threat strike prior, a criminal threat prison term prior, and a receiving stolen property prison term prior, a jury found Urbano guilty of assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury and found true both a criminal street gang allegation and a personal infliction of great bodily injury allegation. (\u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 245, subd. (a)(1), 422, 496, 667, subds. (b)-(i), 667.5, subd. (b), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 12022.7, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He admitted the strike prior allegation and both prison term prior allegations. (\u00a7\u00a7 422, 496, 667, subds. (b)-(i), 667.5, subd. (b), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) After denying Urbano\u2019s motions to strike his strike prior and his criminal street gang enhancement, the court imposed an aggregate 19-year sentence\u2014a double-the-middle-term six-year term on the assault, a 10-year term on the criminal street gang enhancement, and a three-year term on the great bodily injury enhancement\u2014and imposed an additional restitution fine and an additional parole revocation restitution fine of $3,800 each. (\u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C), 245, subd. (a)(1), 667, subds. (b)-(i), 667.5, subd. (c)(8), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45, 12022.7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">1. <em>Admissibility of Courtroom Comment and Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Urbano argues that the admission in evidence at trial of a comment and a gesture he made to his attorney in the jury box of his preliminary hearing courtroom when court was not in session violated the attorney-client privilege. The Attorney General argues the attorney-client privilege is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Before mating the ruling at issue here, the court ruled inadmissible on the ground of attorney-client privilege a comment Urbano made while talking with his attorney at counsel table while an eyewitness was testifying against him at his preliminary hearing. As the rationale of that ruling informs our analysis of the ruling at issue here, we begin by setting out the circumstances of the comment the court ruled inadmissible. At a colloquy among the court and counsel on pending motions in limine, the prosecutor represented that Urbano was at counsel table and Ramsey was on the stand testifying at Urbano\u2019s preliminary hearing when Urbano said something like \u201che couldn\u2019t see that, he was drunk.\u201d The court deferred to a pretrial Evidence Code section 402, subdivision (b) hearing (402(b) hearing) a ruling on the admissibility of his comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">At the 402(b) hearing, Jesse Ruelas, the prosecutor\u2019s investigating officer, testified that Urbano said from counsel table at his preliminary hearing something like \u201cthat dude don\u2019t remember shit, he was drunk,\u201d or \u201ccould not be telling the truth, because he was drunk at that time,\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t remember anything because he was drunk.\u201d Ruelas heard his comment from where he sat on the far side of counsel table for the prosecution from counsel table for the defense. Urbano spoke loudly enough that Ruelas thought Urbano was not trying to keep his comment secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The next witness at the 402(b) hearing was Urbano. He testified that during his preliminary hearing he and his attorney were talking quite a bit. After Ramsey testified he drank beer on the evening in question, Urbano made a comment that he considered part of his communication with his attorney: \u201cIt\u2019s like why do you guys even believe him if he is drunk?\u201d He admitted he had \u201cno idea\u201d how loudly he spoke: \u201cProbably just came out of the top of my mouth and you guys overheard it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">On the basis of Ruelas\u2019s and Urbano\u2019s testimonies at the 402(b) hearing, the court ruled his comment inadmissible as within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. The court stated, \u201c[I]t is inherently necessary if counsel are to communicate with their clients, and vice versa, during court proceedings that they be able to do so without fear that should they raise their voice[s] unnecessarily that those statements intended to be communications from counsel could be used against them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The incident at issue here, on the other hand, involved a comment and a gesture that Urbano made in the jury box of his preliminary hearing courtroom when court was not in session. After learning about the incident shortly before Green testified, the prosecutor made an offer of proof \u201cnot necessarily inconsistent\u201d with Ruelas\u2019s and Urbano\u2019s testimonies at the 402(b) hearing since Green was not in the courtroom during the preliminary hearing except for when he himself was testifying. The court promptly held a hearing at which Green was the sole witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">At the hearing, Green testified that after arriving at the courtroom for Urbano\u2019s preliminary hearing he sat down in the middle of the row of seats closest to the back of the courtroom. Ramsey was sitting in the same row of seats. Urbano was sitting in the jury box. The judge was not yet on the bench. Green saw the prosecutor hand to Urbano\u2019s attorney a photo lineup card that he took with him to show to Urbano in the jury box.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Urbano and his attorney conversed while sitting next to each other in the jury box, Green saw Urbano \u201cbecome very exorcised,\u201d point to the area of the audience where Ramsey was sitting, and say, \u201c[T]hat guy was drunk.\u201d At the time of Urbano\u2019s outburst, lawyers were engaged in conversation throughout the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Urbano argues the attorney-client privilege is applicable since his intent to communicate confidentially with his attorney controls. <em>In re Jordan </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 930 [103 Cal.Rptr. 849, 500 P.2d 873] (Jordan) and <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 227 [231 P.2d 26] <em>(City and County) </em>are representative of the cases on which he relies. In <em>Jordan, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated department of corrections rules permitting inspection of inmate attorney-client correspondence by applying the established \u201cgeneral principle that a prisoner has a right to consult with his [or her] attorney in absolute privacy.\u201d <em>(Jordan, supra, </em>at pp. 932-933, 941.) In <em>City and County, </em>the Supreme Court refused to compel a physician to testify to a medical examination he performed solely as an agent for communication between an attorney and his client. <em>(City and County, supra, </em>at pp. 230-231.) In those cases, the client had no option to avoid disclosure to a third person of the attorney-client communication at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The party claiming the attorney-client privilege has the burden of proof before the court as the trier of fact. <em>(San Diego Professional Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 194, 199 [23 Cal.Rptr. 384, 373 P.2d 448]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 310, subd. (a), 405, subd. (a).) Here, the court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Urbano had no need to speak in a voice \u201cloud enough for individuals in the audience to hear,\u201d as his attorney was sitting right next to him in the jury box, but nevertheless made his communication in a way that \u201cclearly disclose[d] it to third persons.\u201d On the basis of those circumstances, the court ruled Urbano\u2019s jury box comment and gesture admissible as outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Since the option to avoid disclosure to a third person of the attorney-client communication at issue <em>was </em>available to Urbano, <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Superior Court </em>are inapposite.  A case is not authority for a proposition the court did not consider. <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 118 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563].) Pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling, Green testified to the jury as a prosecution rebuttal witness on the issue of Urbano\u2019s identity as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On appeal, the scope of judicial review of a court\u2019s finding of the existence or nonexistence of the attorney-client privilege is limited. \u201c \u2018When the facts, or reasonable inferences from the facts, shown in support of or in opposition to the claim of privilege are in conflict, the determination of whether the evidence supports one conclusion or the other is for the trial court, and a reviewing court may not disturb such finding if there is any substantial evidence to support it [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gionis </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196,1208 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 456, 892 P.2d 1199].) Green\u2019s testimony to the jury constitutes the requisite substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Case law with origins as far back as the 19th century supports the court\u2019s ruling. In <em>Ruiz </em>v. <em>Dow </em>(1896) 113 Cal. 490 [45 P. 867], the Supreme Court held the attorney-client privilege inapplicable to a conversation a client and his attorney held in the presence of a third party. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 498.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Castiel </em>(1957) 153 Cal.App.2d 653 [315 P.2d 79], the Court of Appeal held the attorney-client privilege inapplicable to a conversation a court reporter openly present during a recess overheard between the accused and his attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 659; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rittenhouse </em>(1922) 56 Cal.App. 541, 546 [206 P. 86].)  Since Urbano, sitting next to his attorney in the jury box when court was not in session and lawyers were engaged in conversation throughout the courtroom, spoke to his attorney loudly enough that Green, openly present in the last row of seats in the courtroom, overheard his comment and saw his gesture, we likewise hold the attorney-client privilege inapplicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>2. <em>Enhancements and Fines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Urbano argues that the court\u2019s denial without jury findings of his motions to strike his strike prior and his criminal street gang enhancement and the court\u2019s imposition without jury findings of an additional restitution fine and an additional parole revocation restitution fine violate <em>Blakely, </em>that the fines are constitutionally excessive, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object. The Attorney General argues that Urbano forfeited his right to appellate review by failing to object and that in any event his claims have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Preliminarily, we address the Attorney General\u2019s forfeiture argument and Urbano\u2019s ineffective assistance argument. Assuming arguendo Urbano forfeited his right to appellate review by failing to object, nonetheless reviewing courts generally have discretion to consider on the merits issues a party has not preserved for review. (See <em>People v. Smith </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1207, 1215 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 80 P.3d 662].) Since the sentencing issues before us involve neither the admission nor the exclusion of evidence, we have, and we choose to exercise, that discretion. (See <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161-162 &amp; fn. 6 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429].) The Attorney General\u2019s forfeiture argument and Urbano\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument, then, are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On the merits, we turn to the court\u2019s denial without jury findings of Urbano\u2019s motions to strike his strike prior and his criminal street gang enhancement. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi), </em>the United States Supreme Court held; \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that <em>increases </em>the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490, italics added.) In <em>Blakely, </em>the high court applied <em>Apprendi </em>to reverse a state court\u2019s imposition of an \u201cexceptional\u201d sentence\u2014one that was \u201cmore than three years beyond what the law allowed for the crime\u201d to which the defendant had pled guilty\u2014solely on the basis of a <em>judicial </em>finding that he had acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty.\u201d <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>at pp. 298, 313 [159 L.Ed.2d at pp. 410, 420, 124 S.Ct. at pp. 2534, 2543].) Here, on the other hand, a jury found the criminal street gang allegation true, Urbano admitted the strike prior allegation, and through an exercise of judicial discretion the court simply chose not to <em>decrease </em>his sentence but instead to impose the presumptively \u201crational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and proper\u201d sentence that the jury\u2019s finding and Urbano\u2019s admission had already authorized. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmony </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 378 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 92 P.3d 369]; \u00a7 1385.) <em>Blakely </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Next, we turn to the court\u2019s imposition without jury findings of an additional restitution fine and an additional parole revocation restitution fine. The amount of the additional restitution fine, which is \u201cat the discretion of the court and commensurate with the seriousness of the offense,\u201d requires no statement of formal reasons on the record. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1156 [213 Cal.Rptr. 774].) The court need not make express findings \u201cas to the factors bearing on the amount of the fine\u201d and need not hold a \u201cseparate hearing for the fine.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (d).) Unless there are \u201c \u2018compelling and extraordinary reasons,\u2019 \u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201clack of assets\u201d and \u201climited employment potential\u201d are \u201cnot germane\u201d to his or her ability to pay the fine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGhee </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 710, 715 [243 Cal.Rptr. 46]; cf. \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c).) In the absence of a contrary showing, the court is entitled to presume the defendant will pay the restitution fine out of future earnings. <em>(People v. Frye </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1486-1487 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 52]; \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Urbano tacitly acknowledges those facets of the law by focusing on the requirement that the amount of the fine \u201cbe supported by the record.\u201d <em>{People v. Romero, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 1157.) Implicit in his argument, however, is the premise he has an entitlement to the minimum restitution fine authorized by statute in the absence of additional factual findings to the contrary. However, the holdings in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>do not apply when the exercise of judicial discretion stays within a sentencing range authorized by statute. <em>{United States v. Booker </em>(2005) 543 U.S. 220, 233 [160 L.Ed.2d 621, 643, 125 S.Ct. 738, 750], (maj. opn. of Stevens, J.); <em>id. </em>at pp. 277-278 [160 L.Ed.2d at pp. 671-672, 125 S.Ct. atpp. 775-776] (separate dis. opn. of Stevens, J.).) In <em>Apprendi, </em>after a thoughtful review of both common law and constitutional history, the high court noted that \u201cnothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion\u2014taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender\u2014in imposing a judgment <em>within the range </em>prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 481.) <em>Apprendi </em>distinguishes a \u201csentencing factor\u201d\u2014a \u201ccircumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific sentence <em>within the range </em>authorized by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense\u201d\u2014from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201csentence enhancement\u201d\u2014\u201cthe functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict\u201d constituting \u201can increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494, fn. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In <em>Blakely, </em>on the basis of facts not found by the jury, the court imposed a sentence shorter than the indeterminate maximum for the offense but longer than the specific range the statute set for the offense. <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. at pp. 303-305 [159 L.Ed.2d at pp. 413-414, 124 S.Ct. at pp. 2537-2538].) Here, on the other hand, just before setting $3,800 as the amount of Urbano\u2019s restitution fine, the court emphasized his crime was \u201cnot a bar fight\u201d but instead \u201ca willful act to inflict great bodily injury\u201d in \u201ca completely unprovoked attack\u201d on Green \u201cfor purposes of promoting the Fresno Bulldog[s] Gang.\u201d As the probation officer\u2019s report noted, Urbano has a 1999 criminal threat prior that is a strike prior. (\u00a7\u00a7 422, 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(l)(38).) The permissive formula in the additional restitution fine statute suggests a court \u201cmay\u201d impose a $3,800 fine on a defendant who, like Urbano, has a 19-year sentence on one felony count. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(2).) His $3,800 fine is within the range authorized by statute. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Blakely </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Finally, Urbano argues $3,800 constitutes a constitutionally excessive fine. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17.) Within the range authorized by statute, the court has wide discretion in determining the amount. (See <em>People v. Gangemi </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1790, 1798 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 462]; cf. \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) \u201cThe touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish. [Citations.] ... [A] punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bajakajian </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 321, 334 [141 L.Ed.2d 314, 118 S.Ct. 2028]; <em>City and County of San. Francisco v. Sainez </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1321-1322 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 418].) The record here of a completely unprovoked attack by a two-striker causing great bodily injury solely to promote a criminal street gang amply justifies the amount at issue'. Urbano fails to show a constitutionally excessive fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Vartabedian, Acting P.
