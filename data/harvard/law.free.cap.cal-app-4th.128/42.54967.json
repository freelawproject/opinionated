Jennings argues that the trial court erred in failing to apply the proceeds paid to his victim by his insurance carrier in a civil settlement against the amount of restitution ordered by the court in Jennings\u2019s criminal case. We conclude that the trial court should have offset Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation by his insurer\u2019s payments to the victim to the extent the payments were made to cover the costs of items included in the court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">A. <em>Factual </em>background'</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">On September 27, 2002, Jennings lost control of his vehicle while driving in the City of San Diego on Fairmont Avenue toward the entrance to westbound Interstate 8. The vehicle crashed into a concrete bridge railing on the right side of the road and overturned. Jennings\u2019s passenger, Aleah Hockridge, was ejected. Jennings\u2019s vehicle eventually landed on Hockridge, causing her to sustain major injuries including head trauma, a fractured leg and clavicle, and multiple lacerations. The results of a preliminary alcohol screening and blood test indicated that Jennings had been driving with a .16 blood-alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">B. <em>Procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">1. <em>Jennings\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">The San Diego County District Attorney filed an amended felony complaint charging Jennings with one count of driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)) and one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 or greater and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b)). The complaint further alleged that Jennings personally inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On January 23, 2003, Jennings pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury, and admitted the enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury. The remaining charge was dismissed and sentencing was left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. On April 17, 2003, the trial court sentenced Jennings to a term of five years\u2019 probation with conditions, including 120 days of work furlough. The court also ordered Jennings to pay the victim restitution in the amount of $108,678.77, pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">2. <em>The civil settlement with Hockridge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">On September 22, 2003, Hockridge signed a settlement agreement to accept $105,000.00 from the California State Automobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau (CSAA) in exchange for releasing Jennings and his mother, Janet Jennings, from further civil liability. Hockridge\u2019s attorney signed the settlement agreement on October 2, 2003, indicating that he had explained the release and its legal effect to Hockridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">According to the settlement agreement, in exchange for $105,000, Hockridge agreed to \u201cforever and fully release[], aquit[], and discharge[], Janet Jennings and Jason Jennings ... of and from all claims, demands, damages, . . . actions and causes of action of every kind and nature, known or unknown, existing, claimed to exist, or which can ever hereafter arise out of or result from or in connection with a certain accident, casualty, or event which occurred on or about September 27, 2002 . . . .\u201d The document also conditioned execution of the release on \u201can agreed allocation of the settlement amount of 15 percent to medical expenses and 85 percent to pain and suffering . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">3. <em>Jennings\u2019s requests to modify the restitution amount</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">In late 2003, Jennings moved the court to offset the $108,678.77 he had been ordered to pay as victim restitution by $105,000\u2014the amount his insurance company tendered to Hockridge as a result of the civil settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 9, 2003, the People opposed Jennings\u2019s request to offset the restitution order by $105,000. However, the People conceded that pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>People v. Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622] <em>(Bernal), </em>a brief analysis needed to be done characterizing the defendant\u2019s payments thus far as being credited toward civil or criminal losses. The People acknowledged that a \u201c \u2018trial court must offset against defendant\u2019s restitution obligation monies paid to the victim by the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier for losses subject to the restitution order\u2019 [citation],\u201d stating, \u201cit seems clear that a victim may not recover twice for the same identical loss.\u201d However, the People argued that only $15,750 of the $105,000 civil settlement amount should be credited against Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation because this was the portion of the settlement that was allocated to Hockridge\u2019s medical costs, as opposed to her pain and suffering.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The People also requested that the court modify the restitution order to reflect additional medical expenses Hockridge had incurred subsequent to the date of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The court held hearings on the matter on January 13 and 21, 2004. On January 21, the parties stipulated to an increase in the restitution obligation in recognition of Hockridge\u2019s additional medical expenses, and the court modified the restitution amount to $113,487.77. After hearing arguments from both parties regarding whether any offset was appropriate, the court concluded that Jennings was entitled to no offset under <em>Bernal </em>because, according to the court, Jennings was \u201cnot the insured.\u201d The court stated, \u201cit is his mother who is the insured, and based on that fact alone I distinguish <em>Bernal </em>and find that Mr. Jennings is entitled to no offset based on the insurance carrier refund to the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On February 6, 2004, Jennings filed a motion to modify the restitution order and reconsideration of the court\u2019s previous ruling. In support of the motion, Jennings provided a declaration from his mother in which she stated that (a) Jennings was an insured under the policy, (b) Jennings\u2019s name was on the declarations page of the insurance policy, (c) Jennings had used his earnings from summer jobs to help her pay for \u201cextra expenses,\u201d including the insurance premiums, and (d) the insurance company had indicated that it had no subrogation rights for claims paid on behalf of either Jennings or his mother. Jennings also submitted a CSAA document entitled \u201cAutomobile Policy Declarations\u201d that listed Janet and Jason as drivers on policy No. 2F-05-02-8. The People challenged the motion on both procedural and substantive grounds, arguing that Jennings had presented no new facts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>law, and disputing that Jennings had paid the insurance premiums. The People submitted a declaration from the victim\u2019s attorney in the civil case stating that information as to who had purchased the policy had not been raised during the settlement discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On March 5, 2004, the court held a hearing on Jennings\u2019s motion to modify and reconsider the previous ruling as to Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation. The trial court disagreed with Jennings\u2019s attorney that the additional evidence offered to the court was sufficient to allow the court to offset Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation by the amount paid to the victim in the civil settlement. The court ordered that its previous ruling regarding modification of the restitution order would stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">. Jennings appeals from the court\u2019s order denying his request to modify the restitution obligation pursuant to section 1237, subdivision (b), which allows challenges to \u201corder[s] made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">A. <em>Jennings is entitled to an offset for payments made by CSAA to Hockridge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Jennings argues that the trial court should have applied the $105,000 CSAA paid to settle Hockridge\u2019s civil claims against him and his mother toward the $113,487.77 in restitution he owes Hockridge under the court\u2019s restitution order. The trial court did not allow Jennings to offset the insurance company\u2019s payments against his restitution obligation because the court determined that the insured on the CSAA policy was Jennings\u2019s mother, and not Jennings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although a trial court\u2019s \u201callocation of restitutionary responsibility\u201d is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, an order resting upon a \u201c \u2018demonstrable error of law\u2019 \u201d constitutes an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Draut </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 577, 581 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 469], quoting <em>In re S.S. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 543, 550 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>In challenging the trial court\u2019s order, Jennings contends that the trial court should have applied the rule announced in <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pages 167-168, to his situation because his insurer paid his victim to settle claims against him and his mother. The <em>Bernal </em>court concluded that payments made to the victim by the defendant\u2019s insurance company to settle civil claims on behalf of the defendant satisfies section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(l)\u2019s mandate that the victim receive restitution payments \u201c \u2018directly from the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 168.) Thus, under <em>Bernal, </em>payments made to the victim by the defendant\u2019s insurer in settlement of the victim\u2019s civil claims against the defendant should offset the defendant\u2019s victim restitution obligation to the extent those payments indemnified the victim for losses covered by the restitution order. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Although the People initially conceded below that Jennings was an insured on the CSAA policy within the meaning of <em>Bernal, </em>on appeal the People contend that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jennings\u2019s request to offset the amount CSAA paid because \u201c[t]he court properly exercised its discretion in finding appellant was not the insured on the policy that paid the civil settlement.\u201d Thus, the People argue, this case is more closely aligned with the factual scenario of <em>People v. Hamilton </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 932, 941-942 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 190] <em>(Hamilton) </em>than that of <em>Bernal. </em>In <em>Hamilton, </em>the court concluded that a defendant could not apply payments made to the victim by his mother\u2019s insurance company to offset his victim restitution obligation. The <em>Hamilton </em>court distinguished <em>Bernal </em>on the basis that the insurance payments made to Hamilton\u2019s victim were made on behalf of Hamilton\u2019s mother, not Hamilton himself. <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at pp. 941-942.) We conclude that <em>Bernal, </em>rather than <em>Hamilton, </em>controls this case, and that the trial court erred as a matter of law in determining that Jennings was not an insured within the meaning of <em>Bernal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">1. <em>Bernal and Hamilton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In a factual situation similar to the one presented here, the defendant in <em>Bernal </em>was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)) and causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) pursuant to a plea agreement. <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 158.) Among the conditions of Bernal\u2019s probation was that he make restitution to his victim for her current and future medical bills. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The victim submitted a statement of loss to the probation officer setting forth approximately $10,000 in losses. Some time later, Bernal\u2019s insurance company tendered $15,000 to the victim to settle any claims she may have had against Bernal. When Bernal sought modification of the restitution order, the prosecutor argued that the $15,000 settlement amount was not enough to cover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>victim\u2019s current and past medical bills. The trial court concluded that Bernal had satisfied his restitution obligation because the victim had released her claims against him, and because his insurance company had paid her $15,000, which was more than the victim\u2019s claimed losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">On an appeal by the prosecution, the appellate court considered and decided two issues. First, it concluded that the victim\u2019s written release of all claims against the defendant did not prevent the trial court from ordering additional restitution in the criminal case. <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 164.) Second\u2014and more significant for purposes of this case-\u2014the court concluded that payments made by Bernal\u2019s insurance company to the victim for losses covered by the restitution order should offset his restitution obligation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Bernal </em>court noted that payments made by a defendant\u2019s insurer are fundamentally different from payments by independent and distinct third party sources because (1) payments made to the victim by the defendant\u2019s insurer are not fortuitous, but rather are bargained for since, unlike payments from third party sources, the defendant procured the insurance; (2) the defendant paid premiums to keep the policy in force; (3) the defendant has a contractual right to have the insurance company make payments to the victim on his behalf; and (4) the insurance company has no right of indemnity or subrogation against the defendant. <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th. at p. 168.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For these reasons, the <em>Bernal </em>court determined, the relationship between an insured and his insurer is such that payments made by a defendant\u2019s insurer are actually payments made to the victim directly from the defendant for purposes of section 1202.4. <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at page 943, the court distinguished the facts before it from those in <em>Bernal, </em>and determined that the defendant could not offset his restitution obligation by the settlement amount paid by his mother\u2019s insurer in settlement of the victim\u2019s claims against her. In <em>Hamilton, </em>the defendant, Hamilton, shot and seriously injured a man while the man was performing work for the defendant and the defendant\u2019s mother. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 935.) After the victim filed a civil lawsuit against Hamilton and his mother, \u201c[Hamilton\u2019s mother\u2019s] insurer paid [the victim] between $25,000 and $30,000 to settle the claim on her behalf and obtained [the victim\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>release of claims and dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit against Ms. Hamilton and Hamilton.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) The <em>Hamilton </em>court concluded that although the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s insurance company had tendered a settlement sum to the victim of his crime, Hamilton could not offset the settlement payments against his restitution obligation because the only relationship Hamilton had to the insurance company was the fact that it insured his mother. <em>(Hamilton, supra, 114 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 942, citing <em>People v. Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 246 [defendant to pay entire restitution amount to victims, despite fact that victims\u2019 insurers had already partially reimbursed victims for losses]; <em>People v. Hove, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 1272 [defendant required to pay full restitution despite fact that Medicare and MediCal had paid all of victim\u2019s medical expenses].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In distinguishing the facts before it from those in <em>Bernal, </em>the <em>Hamilton </em>court noted that \u201cthere is no evidence that the settlement paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer was made on Hamilton\u2019s behalf. The evidence is to the contrary.\u201d <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 943.) Specifically, unlike the defendant in <em>Bernal, </em>Hamilton had not procured or maintained the insurance, had no contractual right to require payments to be made on his behalf, and was potentially subject to an indemnity claim by the insurer. <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at pp. 941-942.) In contrast to <em>Bernal, </em>the <em>Hamilton </em>court noted that: \u201cThe settlement and release agreement signed by [the victim] expressly releases Ms. Hamilton; it does not mention Hamilton except in the caption in [the victim\u2019s] civil case against Hamilton and his mother. A letter from Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer dated March 27, 2002, transmitting to her a copy of the signed release, states: \u2018Pursuant to your request, enclosed are copies of the signed release, dismissal and settlement check we issued to resolve the claim made against you by [the victim].\u2019 Finally, a letter from Ms. Hamilton\u2019s attorney . . . states: T am happy to advise that the Offer to Compromise in the amount of $30,000 has been accepted which will release and dismiss you from this lawsuit. We were also able to extricate your son, Eric, with respect to the civil action, obtaining a Request for Dismissal with Prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Based on this information regarding the settlement between Hamilton\u2019s victim and Hamilton\u2019s mother, the <em>Hamilton </em>court determined that \u201cthe settlement paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer was made on <em>her </em>behalf,\u201d not on Hamilton\u2019s behalf. <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 943, italics added.) Thus, the victim\u2019s receipt of payments in <em>Hamilton </em>was \u201cdue to two fortuitous events: Ms. Hamilton\u2019s procuring insurance coverage and the insurance policy covering Hamilton\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 942.) The court stated, \u201cHamilton should not benefit from these circumstances. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because the settlement amount paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer was not made \u201cdirectly on behalf of Hamilton,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cit cannot be offset against Hamilton\u2019s victim restitution obligation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Thus, after <em>Bernal </em>and Hamilton, the question a court must answer when faced with a request to offset a criminal restitution obligation is whether the defendant seeking the offset for an insurance settlement payment is an insured on whose behalf the settlement payments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">2. <em>Jennings was an insured on whose behalf CSAA settled with Hockridge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In <em>Bernal, </em>the question whether the insurance company\u2019s payment was made on the defendant\u2019s behalf was not at issue. (See <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 155-168.) In this case, despite the fact that the parties did not raise Jennings\u2019s status as an insured under the CSAA policy, and that the issue was, in fact, conceded by the People in briefing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court raised the issue on its own and concluded that Jennings was not an insured. Based on this finding, the court determined that, like the defendant in <em>Hamilton, </em>Jennings was not entitled to receive credit for CSAA\u2019s settlement payment to Hockridge. However, there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Rather, the only evidence presented to the court established that, unlike in <em>Hamilton, </em>Jennings <em>was </em>an insured under the CSAA policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Specifically, Jennings submitted a document entitled \u201cAutomobile Policy Declarations\u201d issued by CSAA, which listed <em>both </em>Janet and Jason as drivers on policy No. 2F-05-02-8. No one disputed the authenticity of this document, which clearly reflects the fact that Jennings was an insured under the policy. Presumably, Jennings and his mother paid a higher premium for the policy covering both of them than Jennings\u2019s mother would have paid to insure only herself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, unlike the payments in <em>People </em>v. <em>Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at page 246, and <em>People v. Hove, supra, 16 </em>Cal.App.4th at page 1272, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>payment made to Hockridge by CSAA was a direct result of the fact that Jennings had procured automobile insurance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The dissent asserts that Jennings did not procure the insurance, arguing that because there is no evidence that he sought out or selected the insurance policy, \u201c[h]e did not get it or obtain it.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 62.) We see no basis to draw a distinction between persons who, for whatever reason, delegate to a spouse, family member, or other household member the decisionmaking power with regard to purchasing automobile insurance, and those who seek out and select the insurance themselves. The point is that the person is an insured driver. In our view, under <em>Bernal, </em>the term \u201cprocure\u201d means to get or to obtain. Under this definition, we conclude that Jennings did in fact procure insurance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Additionally, the settlement agreement here, unlike the release in <em>Hamilton, </em>establishes that the settlement- amount paid by CSAA was made \u201cdirectly\u201d on Jennings\u2019s behalf, as well as on his mother\u2019s behalf. The settlement agreement confirms that CSAA tendered $105,000 to Hockridge in exchange for her release of claims against both Jennings and his mother. The settlement document also states that its execution was conditioned on \u201crepresentations by Defendants that $105,000 represents the policy limits of all policies of insurance which are available to them to cover this occurrence . . . .\u201d Further, the agreement was entered into and signed by Hockridge, Jennings\u2019s mother, <em>and </em>Jennings himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Moreover, the fact that CSAA paid Hockridge $105,000 to settle her claims provides further support for the conclusion that CSAA made settlement payments on Jennings\u2019s behalf, and not just his mother\u2019s. Vehicle Code section 17151 limits the liability of a vehicle owner who is not at fault in an accident to no more than $15,000 for the injury of one person. (Veh. Code \u00a7 17151, subd. (a).)* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, Jennings\u2019s mother\u2019s maximum liability in the civil action was $15,000. On this record, we can therefore infer that any amount over $15,000 that CSAA paid to settle Hockridge\u2019s claims was made to settle claims against Jennings, and not his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The facts of this case are quite different from those in <em>Hamilton, </em>on which the People rely. In <em>Hamilton, </em>the insurance policy was not an automobile insurance policy. Although the <em>Hamilton </em>court never identified the type of policy Hamilton\u2019s mother maintained, from the facts we infer that Hamilton\u2019s mother was covered through either a general liability policy or a homeowner\u2019s policy. (See <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 935 [insurance at issue covered shooting that occurred while victim was doing work for insured].) Unlike the defendant in <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App. 4th 932, Jennings relies not only on his relationship with his mother, who is an insured and whose insurer paid to settle potential claims against her, but also on his <em>own </em>relationship with the insurer as an insured on whose behalf the settlement payments were made. In addition, the fact that Hockridge received partial payment covering her losses was not due to \u201cfortuitous events,\u201d as in <em>Hamilton, </em>but rather, to the fact that Jennings had procured insurance that covered his acts. (Cf. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 942.) Thus, the source of the payment to Hockridge cannot be said to be \u201ccompletely distinct and independent\u201d from Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Under the dissent\u2019s view, based on its assumption that Jennings did not pay for the insurance,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he is not entitled to receive the restitution offset required under <em>Bernal. </em>The dissent would have us hold that in addition to establishing that his insurance company made payments to the victim for the same losses identified in the restitution order, a defendant must show that he individually paid for the insurance. We do not think <em>Bernal </em>requires this.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Bernal </em>holds simply that settlement payments made to a victim by the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier must be offset against the defendant\u2019s restitution obligation \u201cto the extent those payments are for items of loss included in the restitution order.\u201d <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 168.) For purposes of this mle, who paid the premiums is irrelevant. The rule requires nothing more than an inquiry into whether the defendant has insurance covering the loss at issue, whether the insurance carrier made payments to the defendant\u2019s victim on the defendant\u2019s behalf, and whether the payments were for losses covered by the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The dissent focuses on only one portion of the <em>Bernal </em>court\u2019s justification for announcing a rule that payments made by a defendant\u2019s insurer can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>used to offset a defendant\u2019s restitution obligation\u2014i.e., that payments by a defendant\u2019s insurer are different from other third party sources of payment in part because a defendant has paid premiums to maintain the policy in force. (See <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 168.) However, we are not convinced that this particular justification must be present in every case in order to entitle a defendant to an offset. Whether a person directly paid the premiums on a policy is fundamentally unlike the other three reasons cited by the <em>Bernal </em>court in support of its rule that an insured may offset payments made by his insurer to a victim against his restitution obligation. (See <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 167-168.) Whether the defendant procured the insurance in question, whether the defendant has a contractual right to have payments made on his behalf, and whether the insurer has a right to indemnity or subrogation against the defendant, each goes to the heart of the concept of being \u201cinsured.\u201d In contrast to these factors, \u201cthe question who paid the premiums on the policy is irrelevant to determining who is an insured under the policy.\u201d <em>{Alex Robertson Co. v. Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 338, 346 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 165] [defendant insurer possessed no duty to defend plaintiff company even though plaintiff had paid the premiums on policy at issue because third party was \u201cinsured\u201d under policy].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We think the relevant inquiry for purposes of <em>Bernal </em>is whether the defendant has obtained insurance, and is thus an \u201cinsured,\u201d and not the manner by which the insured procured the insurance coverage or how much he may have paid for it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Any individual, regardless of how he or she obtained the insurance has a contractual right to have payments made by the insurer on his behalf such that his \u201cinsurer has no right of equitable subrogation\u201d against him \u201cwith respect to a loss or liability for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>insured is covered under the policy.\u201d <em>(Truck Ins. Exchange v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 13, 21 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 179].) Thus, rather than try to determine how the insurance was procured, a court must determine simply whether or not the insurer\u2019s payments to the victim were made on behalf of the defendant as a result of the defendant\u2019s status as an insured. In our view, if a defendant has obtained insurance that covers the victim\u2019s loss, irrespective of how the defendant went about procuring the insurance (e.g., by purchasing it himself or by having someone else purchase it, etc.), and that insurance results in the payment to the victim, <em>Bernal </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We recognize that there are objectives\u2014apart from simply providing victim indemnification\u2014that underlie the state\u2019s policy of requiring a criminal defendant to pay restitution to his victim. As the dissent notes, rehabilitation of the defendant and deterrence of further crime are at least two other objectives cited by courts as grounds for imposing restitution on criminal defendants. (See <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 161-162.) However, our review of the statute\u2019s provisions suggests that the <em>primary </em>purpose of victim restitution is to fully reimburse the victim for his or her economic losses. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 168.) The legislative intent identified in subdivision (a)(1) of section 1202.4 is that the victim be made whole again. Additionally, the fact that victim restitution may be ordered only to cover economic losses, despite the fact that such a rule may frustrate the goals of rehabilitation and deterrence in cases in which there has been no economic loss, suggests that victim indemnification is the principal concern of subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We note further that the objectives of rehabilitation and deterrence are independently addressed by subdivision (b) of section 1202.4, which requires a court impose a \u201cseparate and additional restitution fine [in addition to that to be paid to the victim pursuant to subdivision (f)], unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so . . . .\u201d The fact that a court must impose a restitution fine <em>in addition </em>to restitution imposed pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f), contradicts the dissent\u2019s assertion that Jennings \u201ccould have escaped all personal responsibility for restitution\u201d and that allowing an offset in this situation \u201csteals\u201d away the rehabilitative and deterrent effect of restitution. (Dis. opn, <em>post, </em>at pp. 63, 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">We conclude that the rule announced in <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pages 167-168, applies in this case. Jennings is thus entitled to offset at least some portion of the payment CSAA made to Hockridge against his restitution obligation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>C. <em>The amount CSAA paid to Hockridge for her medical expenses should offset Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">According to <em>Bernal, </em>the \u201ctrial court must offset against [defendant\u2019s] restitution obligation monies paid to [the victim] by [the defendant\u2019s] insurance carrier for <em>losses subject to the restitution order.\u201d {Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 165, italics added.) The restitution order in this case obligates Jennings to pay restitution covering Hockridge\u2019s medical expenses. Only the portion of Jennings\u2019s civil settlement that covered these economic losses may be used to offset the amount Jennings is obligated to pay Hockridge under the court\u2019s order for restitution. According to the civil settlement, 15 percent of the $105,000 agreement amount was directed toward Hockridge\u2019s medical bills.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, Jennings, through his insurer, has theoretically already paid Hockridge $15,750 toward her medical bills. It is likely, however, that some portion of this amount went to pay for attorney fees. Only that portion of the settlement payment that was directed to cover Hockridge\u2019s medical bills and did not go toward attorney fees should be offset against the amount of Jennings\u2019s criminal restitution obligation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Jennings may not offset the payment made by his insurance company as part of a civil settlement against his obligation to reimburse the victim for her medical expenses, pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f). The evidence before the court established as a matter of law that the settlement payment CSAA made to Hockridge was made on behalf of both Jennings and his mother. Pursuant to <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th 155, Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>should be modified to reflect a credit for the amount tendered by his insurance company to pay for Hockridge\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The order of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions to the trial court to modify the amount of Jennings\u2019s restitution obligation. The trial court shall make a finding as to what portion of the $15,750 allocated to medical expenses went toward attorney fees.

So the restitution is the amount that I stated. That\u2019s my ruling.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> On the basis of these factors, the <em>Bernal </em>court distinguished <em>People </em>v. <em>Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912], and <em>People v.

It is unclear whether the trial court interpreted <em>Bernal </em>as requiring that a defendant be the sole insured under a policy (i.e., the insured) as opposed to one insured among others (i.e., an insured) for purposes of offsetting restitution. In any case, we do not read <em>Bernal </em>as requiring that a defendant be the sole insured on an insurance policy in order to receive credit for an insurance company\u2019s payment made on his behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\"> Additionally, the record reflects that at some point after the accident, CSAA would no longer insure Jennings and required his exclusion from the policy.

However, the trial court never made a factual finding that Jennings did not pay for the insurance\u2014it simply concluded that Jennings was not \u201cthe insured\u201d without the issue of who paid the premiums ever having been raised. Additionally, the record does contain evidence that Jennings paid, at least in part, to maintain the CSAA insurance policy. Jennings submitted a declaration from his mother in which she stated that money Jennings earned during college went to pay for his \u201cextra expenses,\u201d which included his insurance premiums.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\"> The rale the dissent would apply raises a number of difficult issues that the dissent fails to address. For instance, under the dissent\u2019s approach, how much would a defendant have to pay toward insurance premiums in order to be entitled to an offset for the insurer\u2019s settlement payments? What is the impact of the dissent\u2019s proffered rule for a stay-at-home parent who relies on a spouse\u2019s income to pay for his or her insurance? Would the dissent make an exception and decide to apply <em>Bernal </em>in a circumstance where the nonpaying individual was, unlike its description of the defendant here, something other than \u201can impecunious college student\u201d? We think it is wholly unnecessary to open a virtual Pandora\u2019s box regarding which insurer payments can be considered to be \u201cdirectly from\u201d the insured based on whether or not the insured himself wrote a check to the insurance company. If the defendant is an insured on whose behalf the insurer paid the victim, as he was in <em>Bernal, </em>there is no need for a court to delve into the particulars of how the defendant came to be an insured. If the defendant is not an insured on whose behalf the payments were made to the victim, as was the case in <em>Hamilton, </em>the result is equally simple. It is enough, for purposes of <em>Bernal, </em>that the defendant is an insured on whose behalf the insurer paid the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> We note that reaching a different result would have serious and, we think, unintended implications\u2014i.e., that the only individuals who would be able to offset insurance settlement payments would be automobile owners, and not other insured drivers. There was no showing that Jennings owned the vehicle he was driving or that he could have purchased automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>insurance on his own. If Jennings did not own the vehicle, it is questionable whether he could have purchased an automobile insurance policy. Thus, if the <em>Bernal </em>rule applies only to those who individually purchase automobile insurance for themselves, then only those defendants who own their own cars would receive the benefit of an offset. We do not think <em>Bernal </em>intended to make a distinction between automobile owners and nonowners. Rather, the <em>Bernal </em>rule is meant to apply to a driver who has procured automobile insurance, regardless of whether or not that individual is a vehicle owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> Jennings does not challenge the settlement\u2019s allocation of funds. We therefore do not consider possible questions regarding whether the purported allocation of settlement funds must be considered in determining the proper amount of offset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\"> We recognize that there could also be an issue as to how much of the settlement payment should be credited to Jennings because it was made not only on his behalf, but also on behalf of his mother. We decline to consider this issue, as neither party raised or discussed the issue. We note that the People previously conceded that Jennings should be credited for the entire portion of the settlement allocated to Hockridge\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-9\">BENKE, Acting P. J., <em>Dissenting.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A9k\"><em>People v. Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155, 165-168 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622], held that a court must offset against a defendant\u2019s direct restitution obligation monies paid by his insurance company to his victim for losses subject to the restitution order. In the present case the majority extends <em>Bernal </em>by requiring an offset of monies paid to defendant Jason Jennings\u2019s victim by what, in the context of direct restitution law and the record in this case, can only reasonably be described as his mother\u2019s insurance company. I disagree with <em>Bernal </em>and I disagree with the majority\u2019s extension of its holding. I, therefore, respectfully, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">A. <em>Bernal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(1), provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution <em>directly </em>from any defendant convicted of that crime.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The statutory requirement of a defendant\u2019s direct restitution to a victim rests on the concept that such direct payment will emphasize to the defendant the seriousness of the crime or crimes committed. As <em>Bernal </em>itself notes, \u201c \u2018Restitution \u201cis an effective rehabilitative penalty because it forces the defendant to confront, in concrete terms, the harm his actions have caused. Such a penalty will affect the defendant differently than a traditional fine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>paid to the State as an abstract and impersonal entity, and often calculated without regard to the harm the defendant has caused. Similarly, the direct relation between the harm and the punishment gives restitution a more precise deterrent effect than a traditional fine.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 162; see also, e.g., <em>People v. Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 246 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912]; <em>People v. Crow </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 952, 957 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 864 P.2d 80]; <em>In re Brittany L. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1387-1388 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 376].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">My objection to <em>Bernal </em>is that the nature of insurance is antithetical to a core purpose of direct restitution. Insurance is in essence a means of transferring, distributing and sharing risk. (1 Appleman on Insurance 2d (Holmes ed. 1996) ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1.2-1.4, pp. 3-23; see <em>San Diego Housing Com. v. Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 669, 684 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 103]; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>GAB Business Services, Inc. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 519, 523 [207 Cal.Rptr. 519].) As such, insurance dilutes the monetary responsibility for an insured actor\u2019s conduct and dissipates the direct monetary impact on actors for their civil, or in this case criminal, wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">If rehabilitation and deterrence are core purposes of direct victim restitution, which I believe they are, then allowing a defendant to offset a direct restitution obligation with monies paid by his liability insurer effectively disengages the amount of direct restitution the defendant must pay from the calculation of the harm caused and thus steals from the restitution obligation its intended rehabilitative and deterrent effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The court in <em>Bernal </em>supports its conclusion that the monies paid a victim by the defendant\u2019s insurer should be an offset against a restitution obligation by noting that if such offset is not allowed, the victim might receive a windfall. <em>(People v. Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 166-168.) As <em>Bernal </em>itself acknowledges, however, double recovery to the victim is permissible where the victim\u2019s own insurance company pays the victim and the defendant is ordered to make full direct payment as well. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 166; see also <em>People v. Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 246; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 932, 940-941 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 190].) Moreover, California has long permitted windfalls when they are the by-product of socially useful devices. Thus, this state adheres in tort law to the collateral source doctrine <em>(People v. Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 247, fn. 19) and statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>supports the awarding of punitive damages. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3294, 3294.5.) Since the Legislature has declared direct restitution a socially useful device, it is inconsequential that it may in some cases result in a crime victim receiving, to one degree or another, a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In addition to these fundamental differences with <em>Bemal, </em>I also have a somewhat narrower, but I believe significant, difficulty with its holding. Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (j), provides in part: \u201cRestitution collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be credited to any other judgments for the same losses obtained against the defendant arising out of the crime for which the defendant was convicted.\u201d Under this provision an insurer ultimately liable on a judgment is entitled to have its liability reduced by the amount of restitution paid by a criminal defendant. (See <em>People v. Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 942; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clifton </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1168 [219 Cal.Rptr. 904].) The reverse is not true: the statute does not provide the criminal defendant with any credit for amounts paid on a civil judgment. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 942; <em>People v. Clifton, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 1168.) Thus the Legislature has expressed a clear preference that payment come first and foremost from criminal defendants and only then from the myriad of other people and entities potentially liable on a civil judgment. <em>Bernal </em>of course reverses this statutory preference: if a trial court follows <em>Bernal </em>and gives a criminal defendant credit for a judgment paid by his insurer, the trial court will not be able to reduce, as required by Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (j), the amount of any civil judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">B. <em>Jennings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Accepting for the sake of argument that <em>Bemal </em>was correctly decided, I still could not join the majority opinion in this case since, in my view, it unjustifiably expands <em>Bernal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Noting that Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(1), requires restitution be paid directly to the victim by the defendant, <em>Bernal </em>concludes that payments from the defendant\u2019s liability carrier qualify as coming \u201cdirectly from the defendant\u201d because, \u201c(1) the defendant <em>procured </em>the insurance, and unlike the other third party sources, its payments to the victim are not fortuitous but precisely what the defendant bargained for; (2) <em>the defendant paid premiums </em>to maintain the policy in force; (3) the defendant has a contractual right to have payments made by his insurance company to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>victim, on his behalf; and (4) the defendant\u2019s insurance company has no right of indemnity or subrogation against the defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 168, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">It is logical, and of significance to the court in <em>Bernal, </em>that in order for an insurance policy to qualify as \u201cdirect payment\u201d to a victim, the defendant must have both \u201cprocured\u201d the policy and \u201cpaid for the premiums.\u201d Only then can it be said the defendant has made something like direct restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Even by <em>Bernal\u2019s </em>definition, the payment of insurance monies to the victim here cannot reasonably be described as having come \u201cdirectly from the defendant.\u201d The facts of this case are clear. The defendant at the time of the crime was an impecunious college student. His college and living expenses were paid by his mother. The vehicle he was driving at the time of the crime was owned by and registered to his mother. He was a named insured on what even defense counsel described as his mother\u2019s automobile insurance. There is no evidence at all that the defendant sought out or selected the insurance policy here. He did not get it or obtain it. Nor did he pay the premiums on the policy. Defense counsel conceded that the defendant did not pay the insurance premium in full \u201cor anywhere near his proportion.\u201d By declaration, defendant\u2019s mother stated that the defendant worked during vacations and gave money to her to help offset his expenses, including the automobile insurance premiums. However, the record does not reflect what portion of the limited monies he gave his mother for general expenses were actually paid toward insurance. It appears his mother decided what she would use the money for and how much of it was to be used for any particular necessity at any particular time.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Given this state of the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the defendant was not an \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of <em>Bernal. (People v. Draut </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 577, 581 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 469].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The only basis upon which my colleagues can find reversible error is that the trial court failed to correctly apply <em>Bernal </em>so as to create an offset of medical expenses. As I have noted, faced as we are with the facts presented below, and faced as we are with the fully supported factual conclusion that the defendant neither personally procured nor purchased the policy here, the majority\u2019s offset operates as a significant expansion of <em>Bernal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Respectfully, extending <em>Bernal\u2019s </em>holding to anyone insured under an automobile insurance policy as long as the victim has been compensated, further dilutes Penal Code section 1202.4\u2019s requirement of a \u201cdirect\u201d payment from the defendant to the victim and extends the meaning of \u201cprocured\u201d past any interpretation intended by <em>Bernal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Had the entire settlement here of $105,000 been allocated to medical expenses, the defendant could escape not only civil responsibility by virtue of an insurance company paying the amount owed, he could have escaped all personal responsibility for restitution. I .am not prepared to eliminate the sentencing court\u2019s power and, equally important, its obligation under Penal Code 1202.4 to order direct restitution to victims and assure society that the defendant fully understands the import of his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I would affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 29, 2005, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 27, 2005.
