Defendant\u2019s jail term, however, was suspended, on the condition that Defendant abide by certain \u201cSpecial Terms and Conditions of Probation.\u201d Special Condition 5, as set forth in the court\u2019s written judgment, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aif\">You must not make or attempt to make any contact, directly or indirectly, with the victim, without the prior knowledge and authorization of the Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Record on Appeal (R.A.) at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The court clerk\u2019s minutes of Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, however, record a slightly different condition. According to the minutes, Defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Must not make or attempt to make any contact, directly or indirectly, with the victim or any other party significantly related to the victim, without the prior knowledge and authorization of the Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">R.A. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Because of the discrepancy, the State of Hawai'i (State), on January 7,1992, filed a Motion to Clarify Judgment and Sentence, requesting that the written judgment be modified to specify which individuals, in addition to the victim, were part of the court\u2019s no-contact provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Defendant was present at the January 22,1992 hearing on the State\u2019s motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court orally granted the State\u2019s motion, with certain modifications to allow Defendant to visit with Amanda and Zion, his natural children. The court also admonished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Defendant not to contact certain individuals, without approval of his probation officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">THE COURT: Now, I might make one thing clear,. [Defendant]. All these people that you\u2019re not supposed to be having contact with, you can have contact with them as far as I can see if you notify the probation officer and he says, okay, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">[DEFENDANT]: I understand that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">THE COURT: So if your ex-wife comes and visits or you want to go visit your ex-wife<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that is, you can go talk to her and visit her so long as you touch basis [sic] with the probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If she\u2019s at your door, call the probation officer before you let her in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">[DEFENDANT]: I understand that, Your Honor. The trouble is that she\u2019s \u2014 she keeps calling my probation officer saying that I\u2019m threatening her life and then she comes lives next door to me and stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: We\u2019ll have to work it out, Your Honor. Thank you. [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">1/22/92 Tr. at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">The court thereafter entered a written Order Granting Motion to Clarify Judgment and Sentence, which amended Special Condition 5 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A07\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Defendant must not make or attempt to make any contact, directly or indirectly, with the victim without the prior knowledge and authorization of the Probation Officer, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">1. Robin Lim Jehle (Robin) [victim\u2019s mother, with whom Defendant lived for five years];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">2. Edward A. Bernhardt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">3. Edward N. Bernhardt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">4. Amanda Zhou Lee (Amanda) [Defendant\u2019s natural child with Robin];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">5. Zion Pao Shun Lee (Zion) [Defendant\u2019s natural child with Robin];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">6. Robert Jehle [Robin\u2019s father]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">7. Chesencia Jehle [Robin\u2019s mother]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">with the further provision that any contact allowed by a Family Court order between Defendant and Amanda Zhou Lee and Zion Pao Shun Lee shall be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">R.A. at 66-67 (identification of parties involved added in brackets). The form of the lower court\u2019s written order was approved by Defendant\u2019s trial counsel, whose approval signature appears on the document. R.A. at 67. Defendant, however, was never provided with a written copy of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">On May 5, 1992, the State moved to revoke Defendant\u2019s probation, alleging that Defendant had violated the amended Special Condition 5 by making \u201ccontact with Robin Lim Jehle, Amanda Zhou Lee, and Zion Pao Shun Lee, without the prior knowledge and authorization of his Probation Officer.\u201d R.A. at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">The alleged probation violation occurred on May 4, 1992 when Defendant saw Robin\u2019s van in front of his house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and decided to follow it in his car. Defendant hoped to serve some family court papers on Robin, who, according to Defendant, had been evading service by sheriffs. When Robin stopped at the Eddie Tam Gym to summon police, Defendant stopped as well, hoping to get a police officer stationed at the gym to serve Robin with the papers. When Defendant got out of his car, however, he was intercepted by Robin\u2019s then-boyfriend, and a fight ensued between them. Shortly thereafter, police officers arriving at the scene arrested Defendant for probation violation, claiming that Defendant had improperly made contact with Robin and with Defendant\u2019s two natural children, who were in Robin\u2019s vehicle at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">At the June 17, 1992 hearing on the State\u2019s motion, Defendant tried to explain that he was not aware of the modified conditions of probation. The court, however, refused to hear such testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">THE COURT: [Defendant], I\u2019m not going to listen to that, okay? I said right here what the Court\u2019s order was. It is written, I signed it. Your attorney approved it as to form. I\u2019m not going to get into whether you understood or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Okay. That\u2019s true, Your Honor but I \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">THE COURT: It\u2019s understood that you understood, period. Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">6/17/92 Transcript at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">The court thereupon granted the State\u2019s Motion for Probation Revocation and resentenced Defendant to serve an additional five-year probation period, subject to the same terms and conditions as previously ordered. The court also modified its prior suspended sentence of twelve months\u2019 incarceration and ordered Defendant to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>thirty (30) days\u2019 jail time, with the remaining eleven months suspended if Defendant complied with the terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">It is undisputed that Defendant did not receive written notice of the modified conditions of his probation. The State submits, however, that because Defendant received actual notice of the modified conditions, and his trial counsel approved the form of the lower court\u2019s order imposing the modified conditions, revocation of Defendant\u2019s probation for violation of a modified condition was authorized. Answering Brief at 11. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">We are aware of the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>State v. Huggett, </em>55 Haw. 632, 525 P.2d 1119 (1974), that a defendant may have his probation revoked for failure to comply with a probation condition, even though he received only oral, not written, notice of the condition. 55 Haw. at 636-37, 525 P.2d at 1123. <em>Huggett, </em>however, involved an offense committed in 1971, prior to the effective date (January 1, 1973) of the Hawaii Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The Hawaii Penal Code mandates that a defendant be provided with written notice of the terms and conditions of his probation. Specifically, HRS \u00a7 706 \u2014 624 (Supp. 1992), which is entitled \u201cConditions of probation,\u201d provides in subsection (3) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">Written statement of conditions. The defendant shall be given a written copy of any requirements imposed pursuant to this section, stated with sufficient specificity to enable the defendant to guide the defendant\u2019s self accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">The Commentary to HRS \u00a7 706-624 (1985) indicates that the written notice requirement \u201cis an addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>law suggested by the Model Penal Code and accepted in other states. The intent is to provide the defendant with notice of what is expected of him in a form which will not escape his memory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In view of the plain mandate and legislative purpose of HRS \u00a7 706-624, we conclude that since Defendant was never given a written copy of the conditions of his probation, it was error for the trial court to revoke Defendant\u2019s probation for violation of a probation condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We note that in <em>State v. Medina, </em>72 Haw. 493, 824 P.2d 106 (1992), the Hawaii Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of charges against a defendant for violating a court order temporarily restraining him from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing a woman. Although the defendant had actual knowledge of the order, he had never been personally served with the order, contrary to HRS \u00a7 586-6, which then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">Any order issued under this chapter shall be personally served upon the respondent unless the respondent was present at the hearing in which case the respondent may be served by regular mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The supreme court found \u201cunconvincing\u201d the State\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the existence of the order was sufficient to allow prosecution for its violation. 72 Haw. at 494, 824 P.2d at 107. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">Where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive unless literal application would produce an absurd or unjust result clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute. <em>State v. Palama, </em>62 Haw. 159, 612 P.2d 1168 (1980). The plain wording of HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u00a7 586-6 requires personal service of an order. The only stated exception is where the respondent is present at the hearing at which the order issues, in which case the order may be mailed. In all other cases we believe that the personal service requirement eliminates any chance of misunderstanding or confusion by providing assurance that a defendant. prosecuted under the provisions of HRS \u00a7 586-11 has received a written copy of the order, and therefore, knows the exact content of the order.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"APs\"><em>Joyce K.

Takayesu, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The requirement of HRS \u00a7 706-624(3) that a defendant be provided with a written statement of the conditions of his probation also provides assurance that a defendant will know the exact terms and conditions of his probation before his probation can be revoked for failure to comply with the terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"ANEV\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-15\"> Although the court refers to Robin Jehle as Defendant\u2019s ex-wife, it does not appear from the record that Defendant and Robin were ever officially married.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
