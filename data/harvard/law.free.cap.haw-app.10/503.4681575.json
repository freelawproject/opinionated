We accordingly vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">As a result of a September 6, 1988 incident in which James Rockwell (Rockwell), a water plant operator at the Public Works Center, Pearl Harbor Naval Base, was allegedly beaten by Defendant, a grand jury indicted Defendant for having committed the offense of Assault in the Second Degree, a violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-711(l)(a) (Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The evidence at, trial revealed that when Rockwell reported to work on September 6, 1988, he filed \u201csome grievances\u201d with his acting supervisor, David Sax (Sax), concerning \u201ccriminal activities that were going on as well as fraud ... [o]n the part of management of the water plant.\u201d Transcript (Tr.) 10/21/91 at 8-9. Rockwell also filed a separate grievance, in which he complained about the job performance evaluation he had received from Sax, as well as on-the \u2014 job harassment by Sax. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>That evening at about 9:00 p.m., Rockwell telephoned Robert Meyer (Meyer), his immediate supervisor, to inform Meyer of the grievances he had filed. Rockwell claims that he was invited to Meyer\u2019s home in Nu'uanu to discuss the matter and arrived there at around 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Once inside Meyer\u2019s home, Rockwell began to explain why he had filed the grievances. However, instead of discussing the grievances, Meyer turned the subject to Rockwell\u2019s previous allegations regarding criminal wrongdoing, which were already being investigated by the Naval Investigation Service (NIS). Meyer warned Rockwell that he was in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d if he had revealed certain information to the NIS authorities. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Meyer then suggested that the two of them go outside to talk about the matter further. According to Rockwell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">[A]s soon as [Meyer] opened the door to the porch I was grabbed by [Defendant] under my \u2014 [Defendant] was on my right side of the porch and another gentleman on the left too, grabbed both me under my armpits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">They drug [sic] me down this hill of the concrete porch down the sidewalk basically through the little picket gate which ripped open my jeans, threw me down on the McGrew Lane where it\u2019s paved and [Defendant] started pounding my head into the pavement and beating the side of my head and my ribs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">* \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">He was beating my head on the pavement. He said, \u201cI hear you are giving trouble at work and you are messing with the wrong people.\u201d These are the only statements that were made really.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Rockwell testified that the actual assault lasted \u201cat the most five minutes,\u201d and that as soon as the beating ceased, he went straight to his car and drove away. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. He was \u201cpretty disoriented\u201d and \u201cshook up\u201d because he was bleeding from his head and blood was flowing down his face. <em>Id. </em>at 22. He headed for his home in Waipahu but decided instead to go to the home of David Cain (Cain), a co-worker who lived near him. Rockwell told Cain what had happened to him<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asked Cain to drive him to the hospital. However, because Cain was babysitting his children and could not leave them alone, he was unable to drive Rockwell. Cain offered to summon an ambulance, but Rockwell declined the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Rockwell eventually found a ride to Kaiser Hospital in Moanalua, where he arrived at approximately 1:00 the next morning. While there, he was interviewed by a police officer who had been summoned by hospital staff, and was then treated and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At trial, the medical records of Kaiser Hospital relating to the injuries sustained by Rockwell were introduced into evidence by stipulation of the parties. The records clearly indicate that Rockwell suffered from: (1) a one-inch laceration to the left side of his head, for which he received three stitches; (2) two hematomas (i.e., bruise or blood clot) to his head; and (3) a sprained left wrist. Record on Appeal (R.A.) at 153. The medical records also contain several entries by various physicians, suggesting that Rockwell may have sustained a fracture to his left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>third or ninth rib as a result of the alleged beating. Dr. Peter Clapp, a radiologist, took an x-ray of Rockwell on September 7,1988, and thereafter noted that \u201c[t]here is a mild cortical [i.e., outer layer] irregularity involving the anterior end of the left 9th rib which may possibly represent a nondisplaced fracture.\u201d R.A. at 154. Dr. D. Intaraprasong, another radiologist, took a second x-ray on September 21,1988, and concluded that \u201c[t]here is no definite fracture identified at the left 9th rib,\u201d but there is a \u201c[p]ossiblf fracture, either new or old at lateral aspect of left 3rd rib.\u201d R.A. at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At trial, Defendant did not contest the nature of Rockwell\u2019s injuries, but offered evidence that the injuries were inflicted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Meyer testified that when Rockwell arrived at Meyer\u2019s house on the evening in question, Rockwell began accusing Meyer of being the \u201cring leader\u201d of a group that was supposedly stealing government property. Tr. 10/22/91 at 37. Meyer claims that Rockwell then \u201cwent over the handle, he just blew up\u201d and started yelling that he would \u201cget [Meyer]\u201d and \u201cget everybody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. Defendant, who was Meyer\u2019s neighbor, overheard Rockwell screaming at Meyer and telephoned Meyer to offer to call the police. When Meyer declined assistance and said he would handle the matter, Defendant informed Meyer that Defendant would be on his porch if Meyer changed his mind. Meyer subsequently led Rockwell out to Meyer\u2019s porch, a scuffle ensued between them, and Meyer called for Defendant\u2019s help.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Both Meyer and Defendant testified that Rockwell was holding a beer bottle, and when Defendant ran over to Meyer\u2019s house, \u201cRockwell raised his hand with the beer bottle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 96. According to Defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>I thought he was going to hit him so I hit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">When Rockwell \u2014 well, I went go for hit because I thought he\u2019s going to sling that beer bottle at me. I was going to hit him but how I hit him I crack him like this. I hit here over there. He went on the fence and I went on the fence and fell on the fence and got on the \u2014 I got up slowly. I told him he better leave and [Meyer] told him the same thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 96. Defendant admits that he \u201chit [Rockwell] one time and that was it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Following the closing arguments of counsel, the trial court instructed the jurors on the law regarding Assault in the Second Degree, then turned the case over to them for deliberations. No instruction was requested by either party regarding the LIO of Assault in the Third Degree, and the trial court did not, <em>sua sponte, </em>instruct the jury on such LIO.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The jury subsequently convicted Defendant of Assault in the Second Degree and Defendant was sentenced to probation for a term of five years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Failure to Give LIO Instruction Sua Sponte as Plain Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">In Hawaii, a trial court \u201cis not obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense.\u201d HRS \u00a7 701-109(5) (1985). <em>See also State v. Sneed, </em>68 Haw. 463, 718 P.2d 280 (1986). In determining whether the LIO instruction was mandated in this case, therefore, we must initially determine whether, based on the evidence in this case, the jury could rationally have acquitted Defendant of second degree assault charges and convicted him instead of third degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 707-711(l)(a), the offense of Assault in the Second Degree is committed if \u201c[t]he person intentionally or knowingly causes <em>substantial bodily injury </em>to another\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cSubstantial bodily injury,\u201d is defined by HRS \u00a7 707-700 (Supp. 1992) as:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><em>bodily injury </em>which causes:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">(1) <em>A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the skin;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">(2) A chemical, electrical, friction, or scalding burn of second degree severity;</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">(3) A <em>bone fracture;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">(4) A serious concussion; or</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">(5) A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the esophagus, viscera, or other internal organs. [Emphases added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Assault in the Third Degree, on the other hand, is committed if a person \u201c[i]ntentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes <em>bodily injury </em>to another person,\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-712(l)(a) (1985) (emphasis added), and \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined by HRS \u00a7 707-700 as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">The difference between these two types of assault, therefore, is the degree of injury, and pursuant to HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u00a7 701-109(4)(c) (1985),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> every charge of Second Degree Assault under HRS \u00a7 707-711(l)(a) necessarily includes the lesser offense of Third Degree Assault under HRS \u00a7 707 \u2014 712(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The uncontroverted evidence in this case established that Rockwell sustained two scalp hematomas, a sprained left wrist, and a one-inch laceration to the left rear-side of his head which bled considerably and was deep enough to require three stitches. There was also evidence that Rockwell may have suffered a fractured rib.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Defendant contends that Rockwell\u2019s injuries did not amount to \u201csubstantial bodily injury\u201d since: (1) \u201cthe nature of [Rockwell\u2019s] injury was such that it allowed Rockwell to drive himself home from Nu[\u2018]uanu to Waipahu, to refuse emergency ambulance service, and to delay seeking any medical treatment for almost three hours after sustaining the injury\u201d; (2) the evidence did not conclusively establish that Rockwell suffered a fractured rib; and (3) Rockwell\u2019s most significant injury, the one-inch laceration, \u201cdid not rise to the level of <em>\u2018a </em>major laceration\u2019 for purposes of estabhshing \u2018substantial bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d Opening Brief at 26-27. Therefore, there was a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Defendant of the charged offense and convicting him of the LIO of Assault in the Third Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Whether Rockwell\u2019s injuries amounted to a \u2018bone fracture\u201d or a \u201cmajor laceration, avulsion, or penetration of the skin\u201d so as to constitute \u201csubstantial bodily injury\u201d was a question of fact for the jury, which could have concluded that Rockwell did not sustain a \u201csubstantial bodily injury.\u201d Consequently, Defendant could have been acquitted of the Second Degree Assault charges. The jury could also have concluded that Rockwell suffered at least physical pain, illness, or harm amounting to bodily injury and therefore convicted Defendant of the LIO of Third Degree Assault. Therefore, a rational basis existed in the evidence for acquitting Defendant of the greater offense and convicting him of the LIO, and pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-109(5), Defendant was entitled to the LIO instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Hawai\u2018i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 30(e) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(e) Instructions and Objections. The court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed. No party may assign as error the giving or the refusal to give, or the modification of, an instruction, whether settled pursuant to subdivision (b) or subdivision (c), of this rule, unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">In this case, Defendant neither requested an LIO instruction nor objected to the trial court\u2019s instructions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>read.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we are unable to consider the alleged error on appeal unless the failure of the trial court to give the instruction, <em>sua sponte, </em>constituted plain error or a defect affecting the substantial rights of Defendant. HRPP Rule 52(b). <em>See also State v. Onishi, </em>59 Haw. 384, 385, 581 P.2d 763, 765 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Hawai'i case law has not determined the issue of whether, under HRPP Rule 30(e), a trial court commits plain error when it fails, <em>sua sponte, </em>to give an LIO instruction reasonably warranted by the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The majority of courts from other jurisdictions which have considered the issue, however, have concluded that absent an objection or request for an LIO instruction, plain error is not committed when a trial court fails to give such an instruction. <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>648 F.2d 1046, 1050 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>United States v. Carey, </em>475 F.2d 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>People v. Brown, </em>677 P.2d 406, 409 (Colo. App. 1983). Some of these courts, recognizing that defendants are often willing to waive an appropriate LIO instruction on the gamble that they will be acquitted of the greater charge, rationalize that a defendant should'be entitled to forego an LIO instruction for strategic reasons, <em>United States v. Lopez Andino, </em>831 F.2d 1164, 1171 (1st Cir. 1987), and that the LIO issue \u201cis an issue best resolved, in our adversary system, by permitting counsel to decide on tactics.\u201d <em>Walker v. United States, </em>418 F.2d 1116, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Other courts, on the other hand, have concluded that in criminal cases, a trial court has the duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>to give an appropriate LIO instruction, reasonably based on the evidence. <em>People v. Wickersham, </em>32 Cal. 3d 307, 330, 650 P.2d 311, 323, 185 Cal. Rptr. 436, 448 (1982); <em>State v. Riera, </em>276 N.C. 361, 172 S.E.2d 535 (1970); <em>see also United States v. Singleton, </em>447 F. Supp. 852, 854 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In <em>Wickersham, supra, </em>the California Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">The trial court functions both as a neutral arbiter between two contesting parties and as the jury\u2019s guide to the law. This role requires that the court fully instruct the jury on the law applicable to each particular case. \u201c \u2018It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence.... The general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case.\u2019 . . . That obligation has been held to include giving instructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present, but not when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">The fulfillment of this obligation ensures that the jury will consider the full range of possible verdicts \u2014 not limited by the strategy, ignorance, or mistakes of the parties. The jury should not be constrained by the fact that the prosecution and defense have chosen to focus on certain theories. \u201cJust as the People have no legitimate interest in obtaining a conviction of a greater offense than that established by the evidence, a defendant has no right to an acquittal when that evidence is sufficient to establish a lesser included offense... .\u201d Furthermore, where counsel is not aware of alternative verdicts or incorrectly believes them to be irrelevant to the case, the trial court\u2019s action will avoid an unwarranted all-or-nothing choice for the jury and will ensure that the verdict is no harsher or more lenient than the evidence merits. These policies reflect concern both for the rights of persons accused of crimes and for the overall administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>32 Cal. 3d at 323-24, 650 P.2d at 319-20, 185 Cal. Rptr. at 444-45 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We agree that the interests of justice require that a jury in a criminal case be instructed on every LIO reasonably warranted by the evidence. As one legal scholar has articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">[W]e must not forget that justice cuts both ways. If it is j ust to acquit an innocent man, it is also just to convict the guilty. Criminal trials are not sporting events and \u201c \u2018courts are not gambling halls but forums for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d The ultimate goal of criminal proceedings should be a solemn search for the truth, so that one accused of crime will be acquitted or convicted depending on the sufficiency of the evidence when measured against the reasonable-doubt standard of proof. Moreover, if the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct constitutes a lesser-included crime within the offense charged, and the defendant has received sufficient notice thereof to adequately prepare his defense, he will have received that quantum of fairness to which he is entitled under the principles of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Undeniably, the defendant has a constitutional right under the sixth amendment to offer a defense, and, as an adjunct to this right, to devise a proper and appropriate trial strategy to blunt or otherwise neutralize the thrust of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. But this right and option, while relevant to the jury\u2019s duty to properly perform its constitutional functions in arriving at a just decision, is separate and distinct from the independent duty of the court to reasonably assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and instruct the jury in the intelligent discharge of these functions so as to avoid a miscarriage of justice. This duty is of paramount significance to the moral integrity of the judicial process and the crucial need for accurate results in criminal trial proceedings. No one, after all, has a constitutional right to withhold the truth from a jury as a matter of trial tactics and strategy; nor does one possess a constitutional right to either confuse or deceive a jury. In short, neither the defendant nor the government should be permitted to effectively undermine the accuracy of the factfinding process in the criminal justice system, and thereby contribute to a miscarriage of justice. It follows that the reliability of the truth-determining process is so essential to society\u2019s interest in maintaining the integrity of judicial proceedings that the power of a criminal trial court to submit constitutionally appropriate lesser \u2014 included offense instructions to the jury must take precedence over the decision of the accused, as a matter of trial tactics and strategy, to waive his right to such instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Edward G.

Rev. 263, 299-300 (1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In the instant case, there was sufficient evidence proffered at trial from which a jury could have reasonably concluded that Defendant was guilty of Assault in the Third Degree rather than Assault in the Second Degree. Accordingly, the trial court was obligated, even absent a request by either party, to so instruct the jury.
