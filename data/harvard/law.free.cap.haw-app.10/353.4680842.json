On March 12,1992, he was cited by an assistant investigator for the Hawaiian Humane Society for committing the offense of Animal Nuisance. That offense, which is set forth in Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) \u00a7 7-2.3 (1990), provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">It is unlawful to be the owner of an animal, farm animal or poultry engaged in animal nuisance as defined in Section 7-2.2[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The term \u201canimal nuisance\u201d is defined in ROH \u00a7 7-2 .'2 (1990), partly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201cAnimal nuisance,\u201d for the purposes of this section, shall include but not be limited to any animal, farm animal or poultry which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">(a) Makes noise continuously and/or incessantly for a period of 10 minutes or intermittently for one-half horn or more to the disturbance of any person at any time of day or night and regardless of whether the animal, farm animal or poultry is physically situated in or upon private property[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>However, a specific exception to the above offense is established in ROH \u00a7 7-2.4(a) (1990), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">Nothing in this article applies to animals, farm animals or poultry raised, bred or kept as a commercial enterprise or for food purposes where commercial kennels or the keeping of livestock is a permitted use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">At trial, three witnesses testified for the State. An animal control officer for the Hawaiian Humane Society testified that he had issued a warning citation to Defendant on January 15, 1992, notifying Defendant that his roosters were creating too much noise. According to the officer, he spoke to Defendant at the time the citation was issued and advised Defendant that the roosters could not \u201cmake noise for ten minutes constantly or thirty minutes intermittently.\u201d Transcript (Tr.) at 6. Defendant responded that he would try to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">An assistant investigator for the Hawaiian Humane Society stated that on March 12,1992, he monitored roosters on Defendant\u2019s property crowing continuously for a twenty-minute period between 7:25 a.m. and 8:10 a.m. Defendant\u2019s neighbor also testified that on March 12, 1992, she could not sleep because Defendant\u2019s roosters crowed continuously from two o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied. Defendant then declined to put on any evidence and renewed his motion for acquittal, arguing that the State had failed to prove an essential element of the offense of Animal Nuisance; namely, that the keeping of roosters was not a permitted use of Defendant\u2019s property under ROH \u00a77-2.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion was denied, and Defendant was thereafter adjudged guilty of the offense of Animal Nuisance and sentenced to pay a $25 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The crux of Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the State had the burden of proving that Defendant did not fall within any of the exceptions to the general Animal Nuisance ordinance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The general prohibition against Animal Nuisance is set forth in ROH \u00a7\u00a7 7-2.2 and 7-2.3, while the exceptions to Animal Nuisance are set forth in ROH \u00a7 7-2.4(a). The general and well-settled common law rule is that where an exception is embodied in the language of the enacting clause of a criminal statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and therefore appears to be an integral part of the verbal description of the offense, the burden is on the prosecution to negative that exception, prima facie, as part of its main case. Annotation, <em>Burden of Averment and Proof As to Exception in Criminal Statute on Which the Prosecution Is Based, </em>153 A.L.R. 1218,1226(1944); 1 Wharton\u2019S Criminal Evidence \u00a7 20, at 35 (C. Torcia 13th ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">This general rule does not apply, however, \u201cwhen the facts hypothesized in the exceptive provision are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, or the evidence concerning them is within [the defendant\u2019s] private control.\u201d 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 20, at 35. Furthermore, when the exception appears somewhere other than in the enacting clause, and is thus a distinct substantive exception or proviso, the burden is on the defendant to bring forward evidence of exceptive facts that constitute a defense. Annotation, 153 A.L.R. at 1277-78; 1 Wharton\u2019S Criminal Evidence \u00a7 20, at 35. The prosecutor is not required in such instances to negative, by proof in advance, exceptions not found in the enacting clause. 1 Wharton\u2019S Criminal Evidence \u00a7 20, at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In Hawaii, the general common law rules regarding the burden of proving exceptions to a criminal statute appear to be codified in the Hawaii Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-114(l)(a) (1985), the State\u2019s burden is to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the offense with which Defendant was charged. According to HRS \u00a7 702-205 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">The elements of an offense are such (1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">(a) Are specified by the definition of the offense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">(b) Negative a defense (other than a defense based on the statute of limitations, lack of venue, or lack of jurisdiction).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">HRS \u00a7 701-115(1) (1985) defines a \u201cdefense\u201d as \u201ca fact or set of facts which negatives penal liability,\u201d and HRS \u00a7 701-115(2) (1985) provides that \u201c[n]o defense may be considered by the trier of fact unless evidence of the specified fact or facts has been presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Pursuant to the above statutes, the State has the initial burden of negativing statutory exceptions to an offense only if the exceptions are incorporated into the definition of the offense. If a statutory exception to an offense constitutes a separate and distinct defense, however, the State\u2019s burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt arises only after evidence of the defense is first raised by the defendant. The initial burden in such instances is on the defendant \u201cto come forward with some credible evidence of facts constituting the defense, unless, of course, those facts are supplied by the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.\u201d Commentary on HRS \u00a7 701-115.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the instant case, the general prohibition against Animal Nuisance, set forth in ROH \u00a7\u00a7 7-2.2 and 7-2.3, does not incorporate the ROH \u00a7 7-2.4 exceptions into the definition of the offense. Instead, the exceptions are located in a separate and distinct section of the ordinance. Moreover, the exceptive fact that Defendant raised, bred, or kept his roosters as a commercial enterprise or for food purposes is peculiarly within Defendant\u2019s knowledge. Since the exception, if proved, would negative Defendant\u2019s penal liability for Animal Nuisance, it constitutes a defense. Therefore, in order to claim the benefit of this defense, Defendant had the initial burden of bringing himself clearly within the exception, <em>State v. Russell, </em>62 Haw. 474, 480, 617 P.2d 84, 88 (1980), by presenting facts constituting said defense. Only if Defendant had fulfilled his burden would any obligation arise on the State\u2019s part to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Adams, </em>64 Haw. 568, 645 P.2d 308 (1982); <em>State v. McNulty, </em>60 Haw. 259, 262, 588 P.2d 438, 443 (1978).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Seth Thompson </em>(Shigetomi &amp; Thompson, of counsel) on the briefs for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad8\"><em>James M.
