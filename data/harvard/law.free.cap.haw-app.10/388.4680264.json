(hereinafter Compass), the managing general partner of Woods at Ahuimanu Limited Partnership (hereinafter WALP), a Hawaii limited partnership, and WALP filed a complaint on December 29,1989 against Margaret A. Blevins, as Trustee of the Ernes 1980 Irrevocable Trust, and American Trust Company of Hawaii, Inc., as Trustee of the Ernes 1980 Irrevocable Trust (collectively hereinafter Blevins), in a dispute involving the sale of land by Blevins to WALP.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Intervenor DAX Corporation (hereinafter DAX), the other general partner of WALP, was allowed to intervene as a plaintiff to protect its interest in the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>On May 30,1992, the clerk of the court filed an \u201cOrder of Dismissal (no activity).\u201d The Order, signed by the court, stated in relevant part, \u201cCourt Records reflect last case activity (date) SEPTEMBER 18. 1991. Note: Cases dismissed with prejudice for want of prosecution can be reinstated by way of motion . . . within ten days after receipt of the Order for good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Order was filed without prior notice to any party or a prior hearing. The parties assume, and we agree, that the dismissal was with prejudice for failure to prosecute the case. The record does not reflect that the Order was issued pursuant to any statute or rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On June 9, 1992, DAX filed a Motion to Set Aside the Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992. Compass appeared at the hearing and argued the motion. The motion was heard and denied on August 12, 1992. The Order Denying Plaintiff in Intervention DAX Corporation\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed on June 9, 1992 was approved as to form by DAX and Compass and was filed on November 17,1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">On August 17, 1992, Compass filed a Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992 which DAX joined. The motion was essentially a motion for reconsideration but was probably not titled as a motion for reconsideration because the Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Denying Plaintiff in Intervention DAX Corporation\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed on June 9, 1992 had not yet been filed.

The Order Denying Plaintiff Compass Development Inc.\u2019s Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside Order Filed May 30,1992, was filed on September 21,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">On October 2, 1992, Compass filed its Notice of Appeal, appealing the Order of Dismissal, the Order Denying Plaintiff in Intervention Dax Corporation\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed on June 9, 1992, and the Order Denying Plaintiff Compass Development, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992.

The power is of ancient origin, having its roots in judgments of <em>nonsuit </em>and <em>non prosequitur </em>entered at common law, <em>e.g., </em>3 Blackstone, Commentaries (1768), 295-296, and dismissals for want of prosecution of bills in equity, <em>e.g., Id., </em>at 451.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Link v. Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 629-30, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1388, 8 L. Ed. 2d 734, 737 (1962). We hold, therefore, that the courts have inherent power to dismiss cases for want of prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Lim v. Harvis Constr., Inc., </em>65 Haw. 71, 73 n.1, 647 P.2d 290, 291 n.1 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Both Compass and DAX argue that Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(b) implies that involuntary dismissals with prejudice may only be initiated by a defendant\u2019s motion and may not be ordered <em>sua sponte </em>by the court. HRCP Rule 41(b) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute ... a defendant may move for dismissal of any action.\u201d HRCP Rule 41(b) is the same as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. P.) Ride 41(b). Therefore, the interpretation of Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 41(b) by the United States (U.S.) Supreme Court under similar circumstances is persuasive to us. <em>Harada v. Burns, </em>50 Haw. 528, 532, 445 P.2d 376, 380 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1106 (1969). <em>Accord Ellis v. Crockett, </em>51 Haw. 45, 61, 451 P.2d 814, 824 (1969) (citing Harada). In <em>Link, </em>a United States district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed a diversity negligence action after counsel did not appear at a pretrial conference. Reviewing the history of the case, the district court dismissed the \u201caction \u2018for failure of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to appear at the pretrial, for failure to prosecute this action\u2019. . . in the \u2018exercise [of] its inherent power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Link, </em>370 U.S. at 629, 82 S. Ct. at 1388, 8 L. Ed. 2d at 737 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(citations omitted in original). The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 41(b), by implication, \u201cprohibits involuntary dismissals for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute <em>except </em>upon motion by the defendant.\u201d <em>Link, </em>370 U.S. at 630, 82 S. Ct. at 1833, 7 L. Ed. 2d at 738. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">We do not read Rule 41(b) as implying any such restriction. Neither the permissive language of the Rule \u2014 which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant \u2014 nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the purpose of the Rule to abrogate the power of courts, acting on their own initiative, to clear their calendars of cases that have remained dormant because of the inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief. The authority of a court to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of prosecution has generally been considered an \u201cinherent power,\u201d governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"><em>Link, </em>370 U.S. at 630-31, 82 S. Ct. at 1388-89, 7 L. Ed. 2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We adopt the reasoning of the U.S. Supreme Court, and hold that HRCP Rule 41(b) does not constitute a limitation on the inherent power of the court to <em>sua sponte </em>order dismissal of a case for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Compass contends, however, that even if the trial court had inherent power to dismiss for want of prosecution, the Order must be set aside because no hearing was afforded it prior to the Order being filed. Compass relies on <em>Lim v. Harvis Constr., Inc., </em>65 Haw. 71, 647 P.2d 290 (1982). There at footnote one, the Hawaii Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>said, \u201cWe think the circuit courts have inherent power to dismiss a case for want of prosecution but only where the parties have an opportunity to be heard prior to the dismissal.\u201d <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 73 n.1, 647 P.2d at 291 n.1. Clearly, an order of dismissal \u201cwithout notice and without hearing\u201d will not be sanctioned. <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 72-73, 647 P.2d at 291. Notice and a hearing were.not afforded Compass or DAX prior to dismissal being ordered. However, Compass and DAX did have the opportunity to contest the dismissal order at the hearing on DAX\u2019s Motion to Set Aside the Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992 and at the hearing on Compass\u2019 Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside the Order of Dismissal Filed May 30,1992. Both hearings occurred after the entry of the dismissal order. Similar facts were present in <em>Lim. </em>There, it was contended that the \u201cprovision in the order allowing the appellants to show good cause for setting aside the dismissal within ten days and the court\u2019s subsequent action in hearing their motion for reconsideration cured any defects in the proceedings with respect to the dismissal.\u201d <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 73, 647 P.2d at 291-92. In response, the Hawaii Supreme Court did not place primary emphasis on <em>when </em>the hearing occurred but on whether dismissal was an appropriate sanction under the circumstances. We turn, therefore, to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">While a court has inherent power to dismiss a case for want of prosecution, \u201c[a] dismissal of a complaint is such a severe sanction, that it should be used only in extreme circumstances where there is [a] \u2018clear record of delay or contumacious conduct . . . and where lesser sanctions would not serve the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 73, 647 P.2d at 292 (quoting <em>Bagalay v. Lahaina Restoration Foundation, </em>60 Haw. 125, 132, 588 P.2d 416, 422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1978)). A dismissal is also warranted where there is \u201cevidence of actual prejudice\u201d suffered by the defendants. <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 73, 647 P.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Contumacious conduct is not in issue here. Nor does the record disclose \u201cactual prejudice\u201d incurred by the defendants. At the August 12, 1992 hearing on DAX\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992, Blevins contended that it was Compass\u2019 trial strategy to encumber the subject property by a <em>lis pendens, </em>delaying trial to Blevins\u2019 disadvantage. No findings were made by the trial court concerning this contention. Further, the record reveals that Blevins filed a Motion to Expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action on March 7, 1991, almost fifteen months prior to the dismissal order. The matter was apparently resolved between the parties. The court minutes of June 21,1991 state that the motion was withdrawn and a \u201csettlement placed on the record.\u201d The settlement terms are not recited in the record. But it appears the <em>lis pendens </em>problem was mitigated by the action of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Thus, we must determine whether there was a \u201c \u2018clear record of delay5 \u201d which justified dismissal because \u201c \u2018lesser sanctions would not serve the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lim, </em>65 Haw. at 73, 647 P.2d at 292 (quoting <em>Bagalay, </em>60 Haw. at 132, 588 P.2d at 422).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We have held that an order granting involuntary dismissal of a complaint upon the motion of a defendant under HRCP Rule 41(b) is subject to review on appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>Ellis v. Harland Bartholomew and Assocs., </em>1 Haw. App. 420, 426, 620 P.2d 744, 748 (1980). The issues presented for decision being analogous, we hold that where a court <em>sua sponte </em>issues an order of dismissal for want of prosecution, its action is reviewable on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird &amp; Co., </em>6 Haw. App. 431, 438, 726 P.2d 268, 272 (1986). To determine whether the circumstances justify dismissal for failure to prosecute, we must examine the procedural history of the case. <em>Richardson v. Lane, </em>6 Haw. App. 614, 619, 736 P.2d 63, 68 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 953, 108 S. Ct. 345, 98 L. Ed. 2d 371, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>484 U.S. 1037, 108 S. Ct. 764, 98 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1987) (citing <em>Marshall v. Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917, 918 (3d Cir. 1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The Complaint was filed on December 29,1989. The court files indicate that except for July 1991, there was activity of record in every month from December 29,1989 through October 2, 1991. Prior to October 2, 1991, the parties had agreed to an \u201cearly settlement conference.\u201d A settlement conference may be ordered by the court or requested by the parties \u201cat any time\u201d prior to trial. Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaii (RCCH) Rule 12.1(a). The court\u2019s own minutes reveal that settlement conferences were held with the parties on September 23,1991 and October 2,1991. The last date of record \u201cactivity,\u201d therefore, was October 2, 1991. Hence, the court\u2019s Order of Dismissal filed on May 30, 1992 was incorrect in stating that \u201cno activity\u201d took place after September 18,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">After the failed settlement conference of October 2,1991, the parties apparently attempted to settle the matter out of court. Communications or attempts to communicate between Compass and Blevins occurred between October 4, 1991 and January 23, 1992.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Blevins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>opposes any consideration of these contacts. Whether these out-of-court communications should be accepted as satisfying the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to prosecute the case does not have to be resolved by this court because the record indicates that the case should have been set for trial after October 2, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Previously, Compass had filed its pretrial statement on March 21, 1991. DAX had filed its pretrial statement on May 9,1991. Blevins had filed its responsive pretrial statement on May 20,1991. Once the pretrial statements were filed, the case was considered \u201cready to be set for trial\u201d under RCCH Rule 12(b). After the filing of the pretrial statements, the case was required to be placed on the \u201cready calendar\u201d for trial. The calendar is \u201cavailable for public examination.\u201d RCCH Rule 12(a). \u201c[A]ny party may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>move to strike the . . . action from the [ready] calendar.\u201d RCCH Rule 12(f). No motion to strike was ever filed. Thus, by October 2, 1991 the parties had filed their pretrial statements and completed their settlement conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Within sixty days of the filing of the initial pretrial statement, Compass was required to file a document with the court indicating that the parties had agreed to three alternative trial dates or could not agree and \u201cwishted] a trial setting\u201d with the court. RCCH Rule 12(c). That document was not filed. Consequently, a trial date was never assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">It appears, then, that the case file does not reflect activity after October 2,1991, the date of the last settlement conference, because Compass had failed to file the document required by RCCH 12(c). But once the case was placed on the \u201cready calendar,\u201d all that remained for the case to be set for trial was the selection of a trial date. Indeed, prior to the date of dismissal Blevins obtained a trial setting conference date of June 9, 1992 from the court, with the apparent concurrence of Compass and DAX.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, on June 9, 1992, the conference was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>cancelled because dismissal had been entered on May 30, 1992.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">While Compass was obligated to initiate the trial date selection procedure, its failure to do so was certainly known to the other parties and to the court. Selection of a specific trial date for a case on the trial \u201cready calendar\u201d is ultimately the court\u2019s responsibility. Under RCCH Rule 13(a), the court is mandated to \u201cprepare and maintain a trial calendar ... of all civil cases . . . .\u201d Further, \u201c[a]ny case at issue, whether on the ready calendar or not, may be advanced ... or be immediately placed on the trial calendar for hearing or trial\u201d by the court. RCCH Riile 13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Clearly, a plaintiff \u201chas the duty to proceed ... in a diligent fashion.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>1 Haw. App. at 427, 620 P.2d at 749. The failure of a plaintiff to institute selection of a trial date under RCCH Rule 12(c) is a breach of its duty to proceed diligently. This breach is subject to sanctions under RCCH Rule 12(t)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6). However, delay caused by a plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a document designating alternative trial dates or requesting a \u201ctrial setting conference\u201d did not warrant the severe sanction of dismissal. Dismissal for want of prosecution is not warranted when all that remains to be done under the RCCH is to choose a trial date. \u201cThe power of the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>prevent undue delays and to achieve the orderly disposition of cases must be weighed against the policy of law which favors disposition of litigation on its merits.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Lane, </em>6 Haw. App. at 619, 736 P.2d at 68 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 953, 108 S. Ct. 345, 98 L. Ed. 2d 371, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>484 U.S. 1037, 108 S. Ct. 764, 98 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1987) (quoting <em>Marshall v. Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917, 918 (3d Cir. 1974)). \u201cDismissals with prejudice are not favored.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>6 Haw. App. at 619, 736 P.2d at 67. Here, the issues had been joined. The determination of a trial date, primarily a ministerial act, remained. Admittedly, the Plaintiff was responsible for starting the trial setting process. Yet, any party could have moved or arranged for such a setting after the pretrial statements were filed, as Blevins apparently did. Certainly, the court had the discretion to set the trial date under RCCH Rule 13(a) after the case was placed on the ready calendar. Such discretion could have been exercised here because a conference to set the trial date was scheduled by the court prior to it entering the Order of Dismissal. Where the parties have filed their pretrial statements, completed their required settlement conference, and had their case placed on a trial \u201cready calendar,\u201d the public policy in favor of deciding cases on their merits outweighs any delay resulting from the failure of a plaintiff to initiate selection of a specific date for trial. Plainly, the case should have been set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We are constrained to hold that it was an abuse of discretion to impose the \u201csevere sanction\u201d of dismissal under these circumstances. Lesser sanctions against the plaintiff would better serve the interest of justice. Accordingly, we vacate the Order of Dismissal, the Order Denying Plaintiff in Intervention Dax Corporation\u2019s Motion to Set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Aside Order of Dismissal Filed on June 9, 1992, and the Order Denying Plaintiff Compass Development, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANm\"><em>Burt L.

Compass\u2019 failure to file a written motion to set aside the Order of Dismissal filed May 30,1992 is not determinative of any issue under the circumstances here because Compass and DAX had similar interests and because as we indicate later, Compass was entitled to a hearing on the Dismissal Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> On December 17,1992, DAX filed its Notice, appealing the Order of Dismissal, the Order Denying Plaintiff in Intervention Dax Corporation\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed on June 9,1992, and the Order Denying Plaintiff Compass Development, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Rehearing of Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed May 30, 1992. DAX voluntarily dismissed its appeal without prejudice and filed its brief on appeal as Plaintiff in Intervention and Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Once DAX dismissed its own appeal, it arguably had no basis to challenge the decision of the trial court in this appeal with respect to its Motion to Set Aside the Order of Dismissal and its joinder in Compass\u2019 Motion for Rehearing. In its brief, DAX states that its appeal \u201cwas voluntarily dismissed without prejudice to minimize the burden and expense of a separate appeal\u201d and that the dismissal was \u201cby agreement between the parties.\u201d Because DAX\u2019s interest is the same as Compass\u2019, a judgment on appeal would directly affect DAX\u2019s interest and rights. Therefore, it was entitled to \u201can opportunity of being heard and defending [its] rights.\u201d <em>Ting v. Born, </em>21 Haw. 638, 641 (1913).
