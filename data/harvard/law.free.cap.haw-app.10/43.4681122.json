Following a consolidated jury trial, Defendants were convicted as charged and sentenced to life imprisonment, with mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment of fifteen years. Their separate appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We conclude that the trial court reversibly erred when it failed to instruct the jury that Elena and Glenn must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>have \u201cintentionally or knowingly\u201d caused the death of their son in order to be found guilty of murder. We also conclude that Elena\u2019s and Glenn\u2019s confrontational rights were violated when the trial court admitted into evidence the redacted confessions of Elena and Glenn, who did not testify at trial, each of which implicated the other spouse. In view of these errors, we vacate the judgments of the trial court and remand these cases to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">From November 1989 until February 1990, Defendants and their two children, Kaiwa and Baby Glenn, lived with Elena\u2019s grandmother, Mrs. Thelma Mercado, with whom Elena was very close.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In November 1989, the Hawai'i Department of Human Services, Child Protective Services Branch (CPS), became concerned that Baby Glenn was being overfed and not being provided with a clean home. Accordingly, CPS filed a petition in family court, which, in January 1990, entered an order of \u201cfamily supervision\u201d over the Tucker family. The court established a family service plan for Defendants and directed them, among other things, to make sure that Baby Glenn received proper medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In February 1990, Elena\u2019s grandmother was placed in a nursing home, and the Tuckers were forced to move. They moved into the two-bedroom apartment unit of Lisa (Lisa) and George \u201cEddy\u201d Major (George) (collectively, Majors), and were allowed to temporarily occupy the bedroom of the Majors\u2019 daughter, Elesha. The Tuckers and Majors were friends and had shared a house in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>On Tuesday, March 6,1990, Elena told Glenn that she needed to leave for an appointment at the welfare office and that she wanted to take Baby Glenn to the doctor because he had a fever. Glenn told her that he was unable to drive her to her appointments because their car was inoperable and needed to be repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">As Elena was about to leave with Baby Glenn for her appointments, George and Glenn stopped her to check the baby\u2019s head for a fever. Believing that Baby Glenn did not have a fever, George suggested that Elena leave the baby at home, attend her welfare appointment, return home, and then take Baby Glenn to the doctor. Elena agreed and left Baby Glenn at home with George and Glenn. Shortly thereafter, Glenn left the apartment to attend a meeting in downtown Honolulu.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">After Elena and Glenn had left the apartment, George noticed that Baby Glenn appeared tired, so he laid Baby Glenn on the couch and gave him a bottle of milk. George then returned to the kitchen to feed his daughter, Elesha, and Kaiwa Tucker. A few minutes later, George heard Baby Glenn choking and found that he had fallen off the couch onto the pillows on the floor and appeared to be having convulsions. Believing that the baby was choking, George grabbed the child and began stroking his back. However, when the baby continued to shake and his eyes appeared to be \u201cfixed,\u201d George summoned help. . 2/4/91 Transcript at 205. Eventually, Baby Glenn was transported to Pali Momi Medical Center, and then to Kapiolani Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead the next day. An autopsy revealed that death was caused by cranial cerebral injuries due to blunt trauma. The autopsy confirmed the presence of severe bruising of Baby Glenn\u2019s left scalp area and extensive fractures of. the skull area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>beneath, a swollen brain, hemorrhaging on the surface of the brain, and contusions and bruising on portions of the left face and on both thighs. According to the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Baby Glenn\u2019s injuries were sustained anywhere from six hours up to four days prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It was never determined who was actually responsible for the injuries that ultimately caused Baby Glenn\u2019s death. However, Defendants were charged with murdering him by omission of their parental duty to provide him with timely medical care, and were tried jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">At trial, neither Elena nor Glenn testified. However, prior to trial, each of them had given several self-incriminating statements to the police, which inculpated the other spouse. These statements were admitted into evidence, after they had been previously redacted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to eliminate any references made by Elena and Glenn which directly implicated the other spouse, and to replace other references to Elena or Glenn with the words \u201cother person\u201d or \u201canother person.\u201d The trial court gave the jurors a limiting instruction, advising them that each of the statements was to be considered only to determine the guilt of the person giving the statement and not to determine the guilt of the codefendant spouse, and that if the words \u201cother person\u201d or \u201canother person\u201d were used in a statement, they were not to assume that the defendant giving the statement was referring to the other spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">After a trial in which several evidentiary rulings by the court were challenged by Defendants, the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>submitted to the jury. In instructing the jurors about the law which they should apply in deliberating the charges against Defendants, the trial court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that a material element of the offense of murder in the second degree which had to be proved was that Baby Glenn\u2019s death was caused by Elena\u2019s or Glenn\u2019s intentional or knowing failure to perform their duty to provide their son with timely medical care. The trial court specifically refused to instruct the jury that \u201cintentionally\u201d or \u201cknowingly\u201d causing the death of Baby Glenn was an essential element of the offense. The trial court also gave the jury an accomplice liability instruction to which Elena objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On February 15, 1991, the jury returned verdicts against Elena and Glenn, finding each guilty of murder in the second degree. Following their sentencing, each filed a timely notice of appeal, both contending that the trial court committed reversible error by: (1) admitting into evidence the redacted confessions; and (2) failing to instruct the jury that in order to convict Defendants of murder in the second degree, it was required to find that Defendants intentionally or knowingly caused the death of Baby Glenn. Elena also maintains that the trial court erred when it: (1) gave the jury an improper instruction on accomplice liability; (2) failed to instruct the jury, <em>sua sponte, </em>that it had to consider the evidence separately and individually as to each defendant; (3) allowed testimony of Elena\u2019s prior involvement with CPS; (4) admitted testimony that Elena appeared unremorseful about Baby Glenn\u2019s critical condition; and (5) allowed the prosecutor to make an improper closing argument about its burden of proof. Glenn argues, additionally, that there was no substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Requisite State of Mind for Conviction of Murder by Omission</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">We address, first, the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the requisite state of mind for conviction of murder by omission, an issue resolved by the Hawai'i Supreme Court in <em>State v. Batson, </em>73 Haw. 236, 831 P.2d 924 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Pursuant to Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-701.5 (Supp. 1992), \u201ca person commits the offense of murder in the second degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Defendants were charged by the State with committing murder in the second degree \u201cby voluntarily omitting to perform a duty imposed by law,\u201d more specifically, by omitting to perform their parental duty to provide timely medical care to Baby Glenn.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Under HRS \u00a7 702-203 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">Penal liability may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">(1) The omission is expressly made a sufficient basis for penal liability by the law defining the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-14\">(2) A duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 702-204 (1985), moreover, \u201ca person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, with respect to each element of the offense.\u201d The elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of an offense are \u201csuch (1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as: (a) Are specified by the definition of the offense[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 702-205 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In instructing the jury about the offense of murder in the second degree, the trial court, over Defendants\u2019 objections, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">The defendants are charged with the offense of murder in the time [sic] second degree. A person commits the offense of murder in the second degree if he or she intentionally or knowingly causes the death of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">There are three material elements for the offense of murder in the second degree, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. These three elements are: One, that each of the defendants caused the death of their son, Glenn Edward Tucker, Junior. Two, that they did so by voluntarily failing to perform a duty imposed by law; more specifically the duty to provide medical care for their son in a timely manner. And, three, that they intentionally or knowingly failed to perform that duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">In order for you to convict the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants\u2019 failure, individually or together, to provide medical care for Glenn Edward Tucker, Junior resulted in the infant\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">Failure by parents to perform their parental duty which results in the death of their child, if done intentionally or knowingly is murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">2/14/91 Transcript at 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s murder instruction was patently defective because it applied the \u201cintentional or knowing\u201d state of mind requirement to Defendants\u2019 failure to perform a duty, without indicating that Defendants must have \u201cintentionally or knowingly\u201d caused Baby Glenn\u2019s death. Defendants maintain, therefore, that the jury was improperly advised that murder liability could be established if Elena or Glenn were determined to have intentionally or knowingly failed to provide timely medical care to Baby Glenn, even if they had absolutely no intention of causing Baby Glenn\u2019s death, and did not know that his death was practically certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The State argues, however, that the trial court\u2019s instruction was a proper statement of the law. The State contends that HRS \u00a7 702-204 mandates only that a person <em>act </em>with the requisite state of mind in order to be found guilty of an offense, and since omission is inaction, HRS \u00a7702-204 is inapplicable to this case. The State also points out that the Commentary to HRS \u00a7 702-203 states in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">a parent, under civil law, owes a duty to provide food and shelter for his or her infant child. <em>The intentional or reckless omission to perform the duty may result in a conviction for murder or manslaughter, respectively, if the omission causes the death of the child. </em>[Footnote omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The State therefore insists that penal liability for murder by omission can be established if a defendant intentionally or knowingly fails to perform a duty imposed by civil or penal law, and it is not necessary to prove a separate state of mind as to the element of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In <em>State v. Batson, </em>73 Haw. 236, 831 P.2d 924 (1992), the defendant was charged with murder by commission (i.e., \u201cby striking\u201d his son) and by omission (i.e., by \u201cfailing to seek and obtain medical treatment and attention for the injuries [his son] sustained\u201d) in the death of his son. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the prosecution failed to prove that he intentionally or knowingly caused his son\u2019s death and therefore he should not be convicted of second degree murder. 73 Haw. at 252, 831 P.2d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The issue on appeal in <em>Batson </em>was whether there was substantial evidence on the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant acted knowingly \u2014 that he was aware that it was practically certain that his conduct by commission and omission would result in his son\u2019s death. 73 Haw. at 252, 831 P.2d at 933. The supreme court in <em>Batson </em>noted that \u201c[t]he omission of a duty is . . . the equivalent of an act and when death results, the standard for determination of the degree of homicide is identical.\u201d 73 Haw. at 253, 831 P.2d at 933 (quoting <em>People v. Burden, </em>72 Cal. App. 3d 603, 616, 140 Cal. Rptr. 282, 289 (1977)). In addition, the supreme court stated that \u201c[a] combination of individual acts of physical abuse and omissions to discharge parental duties and responsibilities, when coupled with the requisite state of mind, may rise to the level of murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 831 P.2d at 933. The supreme court therefore made no distinction between the elements to support a murder by omission as opposed to a murder by commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In light of the <em>Batson </em>decision, it is clear that the trial court\u2019s murder instruction was fatally flawed and resulted in prejudice to Defendants. Consequently, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, which was based on the erroneous instruction, was likewise improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>H.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Admissibility of Redacted Confessions</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Elena and Glenn gave several self-incriminating statements, which were tape-recorded, to police officers investigating Baby Glenn\u2019s injuries and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Prior to trial, the State filed a Notice of Intent to Use Evidence, indicating its intent to introduce these statements at trial. At a hearing on defense counsels\u2019 objections to the proffered statements, the trial court ruled that the statements would be admissible at trial, if they were redacted to eliminate those parts which inculpated the other spouse, or if the phrase \u201canother person\u201d or \u201cother person\u201d were substituted for the names of the inculpated codefendant spouse. The court also agreed to give the jury a limiting instruction prior to receipt of such statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Elena\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Elena gave five statements to the police. The first three statements are not at issue in this appeal, since they did not in any way incriminate Glenn for the alleged murder of his son.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Glenn contends, however, that the trial court erred by admitting, into evidence redacted versions of Elena\u2019s fourth and fifth statements to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In Elena\u2019s redacted fourth statement to police, she implicated Glenn as the cause of Baby Glenn\u2019s injuries. Elena stated that on Sunday, March 4, 1990, Glenn \u201cwhacked\u201d Baby Glenn twice on the back of his head with a car jack stand. She claimed that the baby fell flat in motionless silence as a result of the blows and began crying only after she picked him up. Elena also said that when Glenn realized that she had witnessed the beating, he told her \u201cnot to say anything to nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">A few hours after Elena had given her fourth statement, she was interviewed briefly by police about inconsistencies in her fourth statement regarding the jack stand used to strike Baby Glenn. She then gave her fifth statement, in which she changed her story and stated that Glenn had struck Baby Glenn only once. She also said that she wasn\u2019t sure if the striking instrument was a jack stand, but described it as a hard, dark object, the size of a note pad.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Elena\u2019s fourth and fifth statements were extensively redacted to totally eliminate passages that directly referred to Glenn and to substitute the phrase \u201canother person\u201d for Glenn\u2019s name in the remaining passages. As a result, Elena\u2019s fourth statement, which was originally thirty-nine pages, was redacted to completely delete fourteen entire pages, as well as substantial portions of twenty other pages, before the trial court allowed a redacted audio version to be played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Glenn argues, however, that even with the redactions, it was obvious from the context of the statements that he was the \u201cperson\u201d whom Elena alleged struck Baby Glenn with the jack stand. Because he was not allowed to cross-examine Elena about these and other statements, Glenn alleges that his constitutional right of confrontation was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Glenn\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Glenn gave three statements to police. In his first statement, on March 6, 1990, Glenn related that he had not been aware that his son was injured and had not noticed any bruising on the baby\u2019s body for the past few days. He also recounted that on March 5th, Elesha, the Majors\u2019 three-year-old daughter, had pulled a pillow out from under Baby Glenn\u2019s head, causing Baby Glenn to fall off the couch and hit his head on the tile floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">On March 8,1990, Glenn gave police a second statement. In this statement, he admitted that he knew Baby Glenn was hurt, was drowsy and fussy, and had a bump on his head that was beginning to swell, but said that he was afraid to take his son to the doctor for fear CPS would get after him. Glenn also implicated Elena as being the source of Baby Glenn\u2019s injuries and reiterated that his son had fallen off the sofa when the Majors\u2019 three-year-old daughter had pulled out a pillow that was supporting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">On March 8,1990, Glenn gave his third statement to police. In this statement, Glenn said that on Saturday evening, he heard a loud bump like something had hit the floor, and two minutes later he heard Baby Glenn crying. When he went to investigate, Elena told him that she had accidentally bumped Baby Glenn\u2019s head against an apartment door. Glenn additionally told the police that on the same day as the door incident, he and Elena argued, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>during the argument, Elena threw an ashtray at him, which inadvertently struck Baby Glenn in the head. Glenn admitted that he knew his son was ill and had a bump on his head that was beginning to swell. However, he said he did not have any transportation to take his son to the doctor and did not consider his son\u2019s injuries serious enough to require an ambulance. He also stated that he was afraid to take the baby to the doctor for fear that CPS would get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Glenn\u2019s statements were not as extensively redacted as Elena\u2019s fourth and fifth statements had been. Instead, references to Elena were deleted, and the phrase \u201canother person\u201d was substituted for her name, whenever it was deleted. Also, references to \u201cthem\u201d were changed to \u201chim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Elena contends that despite these precautions, she was still strongly implicated by the context in which Glenn\u2019s statements were made, and because she was not allowed to cross-examine Glenn, her confrontational rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The Right to Confrontation Guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 14 of the Hawai\u2018i Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The use of the redacted statements in this case implicates the right of confrontation guaranteed by the sixth amendment of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). Article I, \u00a7 14 of the Hawaii State Constitution provides a similar guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The primary object of the confrontation guarantee is to prevent the use of depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits in a criminal proceeding. The guarantee affords the accused the opportunity to test witnesses by cross-examination, and requires witnesses to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the jury. <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 243-44, 15 S. Ct. 337, 389, 39 L. Ed. 409, 411 (1895). \u201cThe overarching \u2018mission\u2019 of this clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process of criminal trials.\u201d <em>State v. Narvaez, </em>68 Haw. 569, 573, 722 P.2d 1036, 1039 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968), the United States Supreme Court established that a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation is violated when the unredacted facially incriminating confession of a codefendant is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is specifically instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court concluded that there was a substantial risk that the jury ignored the curative instruction and used the codefendant\u2019s confession against Bruton, thus violating Bruton\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">[Tjhere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the juiy is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others. The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S. Ct. at 1627-28, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 485 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The United States Supreme Court subsequently narrowed its <em>Bruton </em>ruling in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">First, in <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 23 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1969), the Court held that admission into evidence of an unredacted facially incriminating statement of a codefendant does not offend the Confrontation Clause and mandate reversal of a conviction, if, considering all the other evidence in the case against the defendant, the error is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 395 U.S. at 254, 89 S. Ct. at 1728, 23 L. Ed. 2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Thereafter, in <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S. Ct. 1702, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1987), the Supreme Court held that the admission of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a limiting instruction did not violate the Confrontation Clause, when \u201cthe confession was redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d 481 U.S. at 212, 107 S. Ct. at 1709, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 188. The Court did not consider it likely that the jury would disregard the limiting instruction, since the confession did not facially incriminate the defendant but only became incriminating when linked to the defendant\u2019s own testimony introduced later at trial. 481 U.S. at 208, 107 S. Ct. at 1708, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 186. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, rejected as impractical, the suggestion that defendants be tried separately whenever an incriminating statement of one of them is sought to be introduced at trial, pointing out how important confessions are to the criminal justice system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">It would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal justice system to require, in all these cases of joint crimes where incriminating statements exist, that prosecutors bring separate proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution\u2019s case beforehand. Joint trials generally serve the interests of justice by avoiding inconsistent verdicts and enabling more accurate assessment of relative culpability \u2014 advantages which sometimes operate to the defendant\u2019s benefit. Even apart from these tacti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>cal considerations, joint trials generally serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts. The other way of assuring compliance with an expansive <em>Bruton </em>rule would be to forgo [sic] use of codefendant confessions. That price also is too high, since confessions \u201care more than merely \u2018desirable\u2019; they are essential to society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">481 U.S. at 210, 107 S. Ct. at 1708-09, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 187-88 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The <em>Richardson </em>Court expressly limited its ruling to the situation in which a codefendant\u2019s confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but all references to the defendant\u2019s existence or role in the crime. In a footnote, the Supreme Court specifically \u201cexpressed] no opinion on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant\u2019s name has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun.\u201d 481 U.S. at 211, n.5, 107 S. Ct. at 1709, n.5, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 188, n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The State argues that the very issue which the <em>Richardson </em>Court declined to confront was addressed by the Hawai'i Supreme Court in <em>State v. Torres, </em>70 Haw. 219, 768 P.2d 230 (1989), in which the supreme court approved of the practice of substituting a defendant\u2019s name with a symbol or neutral pronoun. In <em>Torres, </em>the trial court admitted into evidence the post-arrest statement of a non-testifying codefendant, which had been redacted to replace all references to the defendant\u2019s name with the phrase \u201cthe other person.\u201d Citing <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>the supreme court concluded that the Confrontation Clause was not violated because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>[Codefendant\u2019s] references to another person related only to the burglary charge, of which [Appellant] was acquitted, and not to the felon in possession conviction being appealed from here. Therefore, we cannot say that [codefendant\u2019s] confession \u201cpowerfully incriminated\u201d Appellant in the possession charge. Nor can we say that it was [codefendant\u2019s] statement, \u201cmore than any other evidence,\u201d which established before the jury that Appellant illegally possessed the shotgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Moreover, even if the admission of [codefendant\u2019s] confession referring to \u201canother person\u201d violated <em>Bruton, </em>the admission of the statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">70 Haw. at 223, 768 P.2d at 233 (citations omitted). The supreme court\u2019s conclusion was thus based on the particular facts in <em>Torres, </em>which were clearly distinguishable from the <em>Richardson </em>facts, where the redacted statement eliminated all references to the involvement of the defendant. We therefore do not construe <em>Torres </em>as adopting a rule that a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession is admissible <em>per se </em>if any incriminating references to the defendant\u2019s name are replaced by a neutral phrase or symbol.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Since <em>Richardson, </em>courts in other jurisdictions have adopted different tests to decide the admissibility of a codefendant\u2019s confession, redacted to substitute a neutral pronoun or other general word for the name of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The majority of federal circuits have applied a rule of admissibility <em>per se, </em>admitting into evidence any redacted confession that, on its face, does not incriminate the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>dant. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>936 F.2d 698, 700 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Vogt, </em>910 F.2d 1184, 1192 (4th Cir. 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1083, 111 S. Ct. 955, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1991); <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>935 F.2d 822, 826 (7th Cir. 1991), <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 112 S. Ct. 884, 116 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1992); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>874 F.2d 1515, 1518 (11th Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1046, 110 S. Ct. 845, 107 L. Ed. 2d 840 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In comparison, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, has taken a different approach. It analyzes whether \u201cpresentation of the redacted statement draws the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that a name was omitted, and invites the jury to fill in the blank.\u201d <em>United States v. Long, </em>900 F.2d 1270, 1280 (8th Cir. 1990). If speculation is invited, the confession is deemed inadmissible as violative of the sixth amendment right to confrontation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The Michigan Supreme Court has similarly taken a case-by-case contextual approach in determining the admissibility of a redacted confession. In <em>People v. Banks, </em>438 Mich. 408, 475 N.W.2d 769 (1991), <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 112 S. Ct. 955, 117 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1992), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">In cases such as the one before us now, where redaction is achieved through replacement of the defendant\u2019s name with a neutral pronoun or \u201cblank,\u201d the ease with which a jury will be able to fill in a blank will vary from case to case, depending upon the overall evidentiary context in which it is introduced to the jury. A rule of admissibility per se is simply not appropriate for the form of redaction used in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We therefore return to the basic tenets of <em>Bruton. </em>Because codefendant statements are \u201cinevitably suspect\u201d because of the strong potential for blame shifting, <em>Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. p. 136, 88 S.Ct. p. 1628, even redacted confessions like the one challenged here should be clothed with a presumption of unreliability. If a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d exists that the jury, despite cautionary instructions, will consider a codefendant\u2019s out-of-court statement in deciding the defendant\u2019s guilt, the statement \u2014 even though redacted to delete the defendant\u2019s name \u2014 will be rendered inadmissible at a joint trial. <em>Bruton, supra, </em>p. 128, 88 S.Ct. p. 1622. Other independent evidence may, by necessity, have to be considered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201c[T]he court must decide whether the statement incriminates the defendant against whom it is inadmissible in such a way as to create a \u2018substantial risk\u2019 that the jury will look to the statement in deciding on that defendant\u2019s guilt. Such an assessment may require consideration of other evidence in order to determine whether mere deletion of the defendant\u2019s name will be effective in making the statement non-incriminating as to him. Biit consideration of the weight of independent evidence is both improper and unnecessary to determination of the <em>Bruton </em>issue at the trial court level.\u201d <em>Hodges v. Rose, </em>570 F.2d 643, 647 (CA 6, 1978), cert. den. 436 U.S. 909, 98 S.Ct. 2243, 2244, 56 L.Ed.2d 408 (1978). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>also <em>Foster v. United States, </em>548 A.2d 1370 (App. D.C., 1988) (and cases cited therein).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">We believe that this case-by-case approach best protects the Confrontation Clause rights of a defendant in situations where redaction is used to edit an otherwise inadmissible out-of-court statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">438 Mich, at 420-21, 475 N.W.2d at 774-75 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In our view, the case-by-case approach is preferable. It more fairly protects a defendant\u2019s confrontational rights, and at the same time allows the use of a joint trial when doing so will not undermine the purpose of the right. We, therefore, evaluate Elena\u2019s and Glenn\u2019s redacted confessions in light of this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Analysis of Elena\u2019s and Glenn\u2019s Redacted Confessions</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">A. Elena\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">As indicated, Elena\u2019s fourth and fifth statements were extensively redacted to eliminate any reference to Glenn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Glenn contends, however, that although the trial court eliminated his name from the statements, his existence was still apparent and obvious from the context of Elena\u2019s statements. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The statements clearly conveyed to the jury that Elena witnessed an assault on Baby Glenn so forceful that he fell flat on his face in silence; that the weapon came from the closet next to the bedroom which she and Glenn occupied; that the weapon was too heavy for her to lift; that she knew who committed the assault but didn\u2019t get help because she \u201cwas told not to say anything\u201d; and that she had been taking care of \u201cour daughter\u201d at the time of the assault. Moreover, although Elena\u2019s statements were extensively redacted to eliminate all direct references to Glenn, Elena\u2019s references to \u201cEddy\u201d [George Major], who had previously been described as a violent person and a possible suspect in Baby Glenn\u2019s death, were left in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In view of the evidentiary context in which Elena\u2019s statements were presented to the jury, we believe that a substantial risk existed that the jury would surmise that the individual who was responsible for striking Baby Glenn and advising Elena \u201cnot to tell anyone\u201d was her husband, Glenn. The statements were therefore \u201cpower<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>fully incriminating\u201d as to Glenn and should not have been admitted into evidence in the form presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">B. Glenn\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Glenn\u2019s statements, unlike Elena\u2019s, were not substantially redacted to eliminate entire pages or sections that referred to Elena. Instead, the trial court, relying on <em>State v. Torres, supra, </em>allowed references to Elena to be replaced by the phrase \u201canother person\u201d or \u201cother person.\u201d Also, references to \u201cthem\u201d were replaced by \u201chim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Elena contends that although these precautions were taken, she was still strongly implicated in view of the context in which the statements were made. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Glenn\u2019s statements revealed that \u201c[a]nother person had the baby and tried to open the door and bumped the baby\u2019s head against the door by accident.\u201d While Glenn didn\u2019t actually witness the accident, he heard a loud bump, followed by Baby Glenn\u2019s crying, and went to investigate what had happened. He was told that \u201c[ajnother person had the baby and opened the door and it got stuck on the rug so the other person pulled on it and it \u2014 it banged the baby\u2019s head.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 96 at 5, 7. Glenn also indicated that Lisa Major had heard the loud bump and asked, \u201cif everything was okay with the baby.\u201d The next morning, Lisa again asked if the baby \u201cwas all right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 30. Glenn further mentions, \u201c[Y]ou know, I told another person take [Baby Glenn] to the doctor\u2019s on Monday. I told the other person take him on Sunday too.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Glenn also responded to questions about an incident in which an ashtray thrown at him hit the baby instead. After Glenn described the ashtray, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">Q How many of these ashtrays do you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">A Ionlyjustgottheone. Because her grandmother gave it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>QQ Glenn, did baby cry when the ashtray hit him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">A Well, he was crying before I picked him up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">QQ As soon as the ashtray hit him, he cried?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">A Uh-hum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">Although the jury was specifically instructed that it was not to infer that Elena was the \u201cother person\u201d referred to in Glenn\u2019s statement, we believe that it was difficult for the jury to not make the inference in the instant case. Only Glenn\u2019s references to Elena were redacted; his references to Lisa and George remained in his statement. There is thus a very real possibility that the jury inferred that Elena, the only other adult in the household, was the \u201cother person\u201d whom Glenn directed to take his child to the doctor. As Elena points out, a husband/father would be unlikely to give such a direction to anyone but his wife, the mother of his child. Glenn\u2019s statement that the ashtray which hit Baby Glenn was a gift from \u201cher grandmother\u201d also obviously indicates that \u201cher\u201d is Elena, since there was considerable testimony at trial about Elena\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We therefore conclude that the introduction of Glenn\u2019s . redacted statements into evidence violated Elena\u2019s confrontational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Harmless Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">Normally, a finding that a statement was introduced into evidence in violation of the <em>Bruton </em>principles does not end the inquiry, since the violation is subject to the harmless error standard. <em>Harrington, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 23 L. Ed. 2d 284. We find it unnecessary to engage in such an inquiry, however, in view of our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s erroneous jury instruction on murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>requires vacation of the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Other Alleged Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The Defendants have alleged that the trial court committed several other errors in its evidentiary rulings and instructions to the jury. However, in view of our decision to vacate the judgments below and remand these cases for appropriate proceedings, we find it unnecessary to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court reversibly erred when it gave a flawed jury instruction on the elements of murder in the second degree, which led to an improper closing argument by the prosecutor. The court also erred when it admitted into evidence the redacted confessions of Elena and Glenn, which implicated the other spouse. We accordingly vacate the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Steven West, </em>Deputy Public Defender <em>{Linda C.

Redaction designed to eliminate all references to a codefendant, however, actually rewrites the document, distorting the facts presented to the jury. The jury, being unaware of the redaction, attributes the redacted confession to the confessor. Because confessions are often patently implausible after the type of redaction used in <em>Marsh, </em>the jury might begin to question the confessor\u2019s credibility. It might disbelieve mitigating aspects of his confession and find him guilty of a more serious offense than it would have absent the redaction.... Fully redacted confessions carry a great risk of prejudice to the confessor. Only the most single-minded devotion to judicial economy could allow the convenience of joint trials to overcome an accused person\u2019s right to have the jury consider his confession in an undistorted form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnP\">Case Note, <em>Richardson v. Marsh: Codefendant Confessions and the Demise of Confrontation, </em>101 Harv. L.

Standard 13-3.2, II ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 13.34 (2d ed. 1986 Supp.), entitled \u201cSeverance of defendants,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">(a) When a defendant moves for severance because an out-of-court statement of a codefendant makes reference to, but is not admissible against, the moving defendant, the court should determine whether the prosecution intends to offer the statement in evidence as part of its case in chief. If so, the court should require the prosecuting attorney to elect one of the following courses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">(i) a joint trial at which the statement is not admitted into evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>(ii) a joint trial at which the statement is admitted into evidence only after all references to the moving defendant have been deleted, provided that, as deleted, the statement will not prejudice the moving defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ2\">(iii) severance of the moving defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASQ\">The Commentary to Standard 13-3.2 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgU\">The standard provides that a prosecutor who does intend to use the statement of a codefendant in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief must elect to abandon the statement, to modify the statement by effectively deleting references to the moving defendant, or to sever the moving defendant. The duty to elect is placed upon the prosecutor rather than upon the court, because the prosecutor is in a better position to evaluate which course of action will have the least impact upon the prosecution case and upon the prosecution caseload.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWz\">Two of the prosecutor\u2019s options are accompanied by significant disadvantages: abandonment of the statement weakens the case against the codefendant while severance of the moving defendant results in duplicate trials. Some jurisdictions have experimented with unusual trial procedures that may protect the moving defendant while minimizing the costs to the prosecution. One experiment involves a joint trial in which the jury hears the statement of the codefendant only after it has reached a verdict on the moving defendant. A second experiment involves a joint trial with two juries, each of which hears only the evidence relevant to its defendant. Such experiments may provide solutions not only to the specific problem of codefendant statements but also to some of the general problems of prejudice that occur in joint trials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">In the meantime, the modification or redaction of the statement is likely to be the option preferred by the prosecutor, who will then be able to use the statement against its maker without incurring the expense of duplicate trials. However, not all statements can be successfully edited to delete references to the moving defendant. If the references to the moving defendant are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>central to the statement, the edited product may be meaningless or distorted \u201cto the substantial prejudice of either the declarant or the Government.\u201d Where the prosecutor\u2019s deletions are ineffective, the court must require the prosecutor to elect one of the other options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaG\"><em>Id. </em>at 13.36-13.37 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
