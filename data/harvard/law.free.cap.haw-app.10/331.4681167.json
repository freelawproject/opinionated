Myers (Myers), individually and as special administrator of the estate of Marla Colleen Myers (Marla), appeals from the December 19, 1990 judgment in favor of DefendantsAppellees South Seas Corporation, dba Rudy\u2019s Italian Restaurant and Hideaway Lounge (Rudy\u2019s), and Outrigger Hotels Hawai\u2018i, Inc. (Outrigger), dba Outrigger Surf Hotel (Hotel), and the February 1,1991 order denying his motion to amend the judgment or in the alternative for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment in favor of Rudy\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>remand Myers\u2019 claim against Rudy\u2019s for retrial. We affirm the judgment in favor of Outrigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On December 25, 1986, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Marla arrived at Rudy\u2019s, which is located in the Hotel, accompanied by Gordon Wesley Sodorff (Sodorff). Defendant Lautusi Taua (Taua) was in Rudy\u2019s at the time. Taua had with him a six-foot inflatable Godzilla doll.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Marla and Sodorff went to the bar in Rudy\u2019s, where Marla ordered a glass of wine. Before she could be served, Marla began to circulate among the tables greeting friends. Within a very short time, Marla was engaged in an altercation with Taua, during which they were shouting at each other. It is unclear how the altercation started; however, it appears that Marla slapped Taua\u2019s doll and knocked'it over. Marla returned to the bar, but the two continued to exchange words. Taua approached Marla at the bar and slapped her. Marla slapped back and Taua punched her, knocking her off her bar stool. Taua punched Marla again as she fell. While Marla was on the ground, Taua appeared, to stomp on her head. Rudy\u2019s bartender, Bruce Spewak (Spewak), and another customer, Brian Dragger (Dragger), pulled Taua away from Marla. Marla then left Rudy\u2019s through a back stairway and door leading to the Hotel lobby. Shortly after that, Spewak and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Dragger let Taua go, and Taiia left through the front door leading to the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While the altercation was going on, another patron informed the Hotel\u2019s night auditor, who was upstairs in the lobby area, that a fight was occurring in the bar. The night auditor called the Outrigger\u2019s private security dispatcher at the Outrigger Prince Kuhio Hotel some four blocks away and requested that security personnel be sent. Although Outrigger, which owns a number of hotels in the Waikiki area, maintained a security staff, it did not station security personnel at each hotel. Instead it maintained a dispatch center for routing its security personnel to its hotels when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Shortly thereafter, Marla entered the lobby and asked the night auditor to call security or the police. The night auditor and Marla were standing in the front entrance of the Hotel waiting for security to arrive when Taua emerged from Rudy\u2019s onto the street. The Hotel\u2019s front entrance is quite close to Rudy\u2019s front entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Taua began walking off carrying his doll, then turned and walked up to Marla and the night auditor. As he approached, Taua twice said to Marla: \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again.\u201d When he got to Marla, he pushed her. She fell backwards, and her head hit the concrete floor. As Marla lay there, Taua kicked her three or four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Outrigger\u2019s security guards (guards) arrived as Taua was kicking Marla. Taua walked away, but was stopped and held by the guards until the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Marla was confined in a hospital for injuries suffered from Taua\u2019s attack. She died several days later when life support systems were removed. Dr. Gonzalo Chong testified that the blows Marla received in either confrontation could have been the cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Myers filed the initial complaint on May 18, 1987, and an amended complaint on May 9,1989. In his second amended settlement conference statement filed on September 12,1990, Myers outlined his theories of liability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[Rudy\u2019s] a. Negligent sale of alcoholic beverage in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) (1985).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">b. Failure to exercise reasonable care to protect its patrons from harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">c. Failure to provide proper and/or adequate security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">d. Creation of a false appearance of safety upon which [Marla] relied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">e. Negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">[Outrigger] a. Failure to provide adequate and proper security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">b. Negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">The jury rendered a special verdict in which it found that Outrigger was not negligent and that Rudy\u2019s was negligent; however, it found that Rudy\u2019s negligence was not \u201ca legal cause of injury to the Plaintiff[.]\u201d Judgment was entered on December 19, 1990. On January 17, 1991, Myers filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">Myers\u2019 first argument on appeal is an attack on the court\u2019s charge to the jury. Specifically, Myers argues that the court erred in giving instructions no. 16 (instruction no. 16) and 51 (instruction no. 51) and refusing to give Myers\u2019 requested instructions no. 11 (instruction no. 11) and 40 (instruction no. 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>In reviewing the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, the instructions must be considered as a whole. <em>SGM Partners v. The Profit Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 86, 793 P.2d 1189, <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>71 Haw. 506, 795 P.2d 853 (1990). The function of jury instructions is to inform the jury of the law applicable to the case. <em>Campbell v. Hipawai Corp., </em>3 Haw. App. 11, 639 P.2d 1119 (1982). The question is not whether the instructions were technically correct but whether the appellant could have suffered prejudice on their account. <em>In re Estate of Lorenzo, </em>61 Haw. 236, 602 P.2d 521 (1979). In determining the sufficiency of a particular instruction, it is not to be considered apart from its context or the rest of the charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We note, at the outset, that we have examined the instructions as a whole and found that they correctly informed the jury of the law of negligence to be applied by them to the evidence. Nevertheless, since we are remanding Myers\u2019 claim against Rudy\u2019s for retrial, we will discuss Myers\u2019 arguments regarding the instructions noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Instructions No. 16 and No. 40</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Myers asserts that the trial court erred in giving instruction no. 16 and refusing his instruction no. 40. The instructions, respectively, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTION NO. 16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">Violation of a statute may be considered by you in determining whether, taken together with all of the other evidence in the case, there was negligence on the part of the violator. Whether there was any violation of a statute and the effect thereof is for you to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Under the statutes of the State of Hawaii, a cocktail lounge operator must exercise reasonable care to prevent or suppress any violent, quarrelsome, disorderly or unlawful conduct of any person on its premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">[MYERS\u2019] JURY INSTRUCTION NO. 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">At no time under any circumstances shall any bar operator knowingly permit any person under the influence of liquor or disorderly person to be or remain on the bar\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The thrust of Myers\u2019 argument is that instruction no. 16 is an incorrect statement of the law as expressed in HRS \u00a7 281 \u2014 78(b)(2) (1985), while instruction no. 40 correctly states the law set forth in HRS \u00a7 281-78(b)(l) (1985). HRS \u00a7 281-78(b)(l) and (2) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">(b) At no time under any circumstances shall any licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(1) Knowingly permit any person under the influence of liquor or disorderly person to be or remain in or on the licensed premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">(2) Fail immediately to prevent or suppress any violent, quarrelsome, disorderly, lewd, immoral or unlawful conduct of any person on the premises[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Myers argues that (1) since the evidence shows that Rudy\u2019s had notice that Marla was under the influence of liquor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it should have removed her from the premises immediately, as required by HRS \u00a7 281-78(b)(l), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>(2) Rudy\u2019s did not take immediate steps to quell the altercation between Marla and Taua, as required by HRS \u00a7 281-78(b)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Myers contends that the court should have instructed the jury in the language of the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The question is whether a violation of either statutory provision may be evidence of negligence. Our appellate courts have not had occasion to consider that question. The supreme court has done so, however, with regard to other provisions of HRS \u00a7 281-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In <em>Ono v. Applegate, </em>62 Haw. 131, 612 P.2d 533 (1980), the supreme court held that a third party injured in a collision with an automobile driven by an intoxicated driver who had earlier that evening been furnished liquor by the defendant\u2019s bar, when the bar knew that the driver was already under the influence of liquor, was within the class of persons protected by HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) (1976) and could recover damages for his injuries from the defendant bar owner. Under HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B), a liquor licensee was prohibited from selling or furnishing liquor to \u201c[a]ny person at the time under the influence of liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Bertelmann v. Taas Associates, </em>69 Haw. 95, 735 P.2d 930 (1987), a customer of a bar was killed shortly after he left the bar while driving alone in a car that crashed on a highway in Kona. The administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate and the decedent\u2019s survivors sued the owner of the bar for the decedent\u2019s wrongful death. The evidence showed that when the bar furnished liquor to the decedent before the crash, it knew or should have known that the decedent was already under the influence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>liquor. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On appeal, the supreme court \u201cemphatically rejected] the contention that intoxicated liquor consumers can seek recovery from the bar or tavern which sold them alcohol. Drunken persons who harm themselves are solely responsible for their voluntary intoxication and cannot prevail under a common law or statutory basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 735 P.2d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The supreme court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">HRS \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) and 281-78(b)(l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were created to protect the general public from drunk driving accidents, not to reward intoxicated liquor consumers for the consequences of their voluntary inebriation... . Liquor consumers are not within the class of persons for whose benefit HRS \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) and 281 \u2014 78(b)(1) were enacted. Sheraton Hotel\u2019s statutory violations did not create a cause of action in favor of Appellants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">We realize a bar or tavern owes a duty to avoid affirmative acts which increase the peril to an intoxicated customer .... But, in the absence of harm to an innocent third party, merely serving liquor to an already intoxicated customer and allowing said customer to leave the premises, of itself, does not constitute actionable negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 101, 735 P.2d at 934 (citations omitted and footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Winters v. Silver Fox Bar, </em>71 Haw. 524, 797 P.2d 51 (1990), the United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i certified the following question to the supreme court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Whether the sale of liquor to a minor (in violation of Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(A) [1985 and Supp. 1989]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who subsequently becomes drunk and sustains injury precludes the minor (or the estate and survivors) from suing the commercial liquor supplier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 525, 797 P.2d at 51-52 (footnote omitted and footnote added). The supreme court answered in the affirmative, holding that a minor who sustains injury due to his or her own voluntary intoxication is not within the class of persons protected under the statute. The supreme court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">absent legislative intent or public policy to change the common law and allow a tort right of action utilizing regulatory and criminal statutes to establish duty and conduct of care, the courts refuse to judicially legislate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 529, 797 P.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Myers argues that <em>Ono, Bertelmann, </em>and <em>Winters </em>are not applicable because they involve patrons under the influence of intoxicating liquor who were involved in traffic accidents after they had left a bar. Here, of course, Marla was still in the bar when she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We acknowledge the distinction. Nevertheless, the principle established in those cases regarding reliance on a regulatory statute to establish negligence is applicable here. Marla was under the influence of liquor and disorderly; she was clearly a participant in the altercation with Taua and was not within the class of persons protected by the liquor licensing statutes. Thus, the court did not err in refusing to give instruction no. 40 or to quote HRS \u00a7 281 \u2014 78(b)(2) in instruction no. 16. We now turn to the question whether instruction no. 16 correctly stated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Instruction no. 16 was internally inconsistent in that, although it informed the jury that if they found that the statute was violated they could find that the violation was negligence, it did not instruct the jury as to the duty actually imposed by any statute. Instead, it instructed the jury that the duty owed was the duty of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Nevertheless, Myers was not harmed by the instruction, since instruction no. 16 correctly stated Rudy\u2019s duty to its patrons, including Marla. The general rule is that proprietors of bars or taverns owe their customers the duty of exercising reasonable care to protect them from injury at the hands of other patrons. <em>Thomas v. Bruza, </em>151 Cal. App. 2d 150, 311 P.2d 128 (1957); <em>Worth v. Stahl, </em>388 So. 2d 340 (Fla. 1980); <em>Filas v. Daher, </em>300 Minn. 137, 218 N.W.2d 467 (1974); <em>Klingbeil v. Truesdell, </em>256 Minn. 360, 98 N.W.2d 134 (1959); 45 Am. JUR. 2d <em>Intoxicating Liquors </em>\u00a7 557 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Instruction No. 11</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The trial court correctly refused to give the jury instruction no. 11, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">You are instructed that the independent acts of Defendant LAUTUSI TAUA do not excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>any other Defendants from liability if the other Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to protect MARLA COLLEEN MYERS and that failure to exercise reasonable care created a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to MARLA COLLEEN MYERS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Instruction no. 11 is based on the doctrine of superseding cause in tort law. Rudy\u2019s and Outrigger argue that instruction no. 11 was correctly denied, since superseding cause was not an issue in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Neither defendant in this case claimed that .Taua\u2019s acts were a superseding cause of Marla\u2019s injury which relieved them of liability. Moreover, in instruction no. 45 the court told the jury that it had already determined Taua\u2019s liability, that the liability of each defendant was to be considered separately, and that the jury\u2019s duty was to determine whether Rudy\u2019s or Outrigger was negligent and, if so, whether such negligence was the legal cause of Marla\u2019s injuries and death. In instruction no. 29, the court instructed the jury on legal cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The instruction stated that the conduct of more than one person may operate independently or together to cause an injury, in which case each may be a legal cause of the injury. The jury was properly instructed on the issue of legal cause. <em>Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., </em>69 Haw. 376, 742 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>377 (1987) (negligent conduct is the legal cause of harm if it is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Instruction No. 51</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Instruction no. 51 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">If under all the circumstances there is an unreasonable risk of physical harm to a patron of a cocktail lounge or a person on hotel premises from the conduct of a third person, whether intentional or criminal, and if such risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable by the cocktail lounge or hotel in sufficient time through the exercise of reasonable care to have prevented such harm, then a failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent such harm is negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Myers argues that the court erred in giving instruction no. 51 because it mixes duty, breach of duty, and causation. He contends that, under instruction no. 51, if the jury found a breach of duty, <em>i.e., \u201ca </em>failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent such harm[,]\u201d it would impliedly find causation; however, instruction no. 51 does not mention causation; it only allows the jury to establish breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Outrigger argues that (1) instruction no. 11 is a correct statement of the law, and (2) Myers did not raise a proper objection in the lower.court. We have examined the record and find that Myers\u2019 objection was not so far afield that it deprived him of the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Considered in the light of the charge as a whole, instruction no. 51, while not a paradigm of legal precision, was not prejudicial to Myers. Even if the jury only understood the instruction as relating to duty and breach of duty, the other instructions adequately instructed them on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Myers\u2019 second argument is that the special verdict returned by the jury with regard to Rudy\u2019s was irreconcilably inconsistent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The pertinent provisions of the special verdict form, and the jury\u2019s answers, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">SPECIAL VERDICT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">1. Was the Defendant RUDY\u2019S HIDEAWAY LOUNGE negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">ANSWER: Yes - X\u2014 No-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">If your answer to question No. 1 is \u201cNo\u201d, then do not answer Question No. 2. Go directly to Question No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">2. Was Defendant RUDYS HIDEAWAY LOUNGE\u2019S negligence a legal cause of injury to the Plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">ANSWER: Yes \u2014 - No \u2014 X_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">An appellate court will order a new trial when the jury\u2019s answers to interrogatories posed on a special verdict form are irreconcilably inconsistent. <em>Kalilikane v. McCravey, </em>69 Haw. 145, 737 P.2d 862 (1987). However, the verdict will not be disturbed if the answers can be reconciled under any theory. <em>Hauenstein v. Loctite Corp., </em>347 N.W.2d 272 (Minn. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Myers argues that under the court\u2019s instructions no. 46, relating to the duty of care owed by the defendants in this case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> no. 51, relating to the standard of care, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>no. 29, relating to legal cause,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in order for the jury to find Rudy\u2019s negligent, it had to have found that an unreasonable risk of harm to Marla was foreseeable and that Rudy\u2019s had time to act to prevent that harm. Since the jury found Rudy\u2019s had time to act, it had to find that Rudy\u2019s failure to act was a legal cause of the harm suffered by Marla.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Rudy\u2019s argues, however, that, since negligence and legal cause are separate legal and factual requirements, the jury\u2019s findings are reconcilable under the facts in this case. Rudy\u2019s contends that the jury may have found that Rudy\u2019s was negligent in not providing a bouncer on the premises, but that the events occurred so rapidly that the jury could also have found that the omission was not the legal cause of the harm, since a bouncer would not have changed the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The fallacy of Rudy\u2019s argument lies in the fact that, under instruction no. 51, in order for the jury to find that Rudy\u2019s was negligent, it had to find that the risk of harm to Marla was foreseeable in sufficient time for Rudy\u2019s to have prevented it. Since the jury found there was time for Rudy\u2019s to have prevented the harm, the jury had to find that Rudy\u2019s omission was a legal cause of Marla\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Rudy\u2019s further argues that the jury could have found it negligent under instructions no. 23, a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>negligence instruction,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and no. 24, a definition of reasonable care.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, those are general instructions that are not specifically related to the evidence in this case. It is more reasonable to infer that the jury was guided by and applied the instructions relating to the duty and breach of duty of a cocktail lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The only possible way of reconciling the special verdict is to infer that, although the jury found Rudy\u2019s negligent, it did not find Rudy\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to Marla. However, as stated earlier, under instruction no. 51, the jury had to find that the harm to Marla was preventable in order to find Rudy\u2019s negligent. Thus, Rudy\u2019s negligence was a failure to prevent preventable harm and had to be a substantial factor in causing that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">A hearing was held on an <em>in limine </em>motion by Rudy\u2019s to preclude Myers from introducing Sodorff\u2019s and Dragger\u2019s opinions on Spewak\u2019s actions at the time of the incident. Myers asserts that the court erred in ruling that the opinions would not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Myers intended to present Sodorff\u2019s testimony through his deposition. The court ruled that the following emphasized portions of SodorfFs deposition testimony would be excluded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Q. You actually looked to the bartender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">A. Yeah, I said, \u201cGet this thing broken up. Call the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Q. <em>And what did he do?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">A. <em>He very slowly reacted, I thought, for [sic] under the circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">Q. <em>Now you stated that you believed in your own opinion that under the circumstances the bartender reacted slow?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\"><em>A. Or either that </em>\u2014 <em>he was big enough that he should have gotten the guy thrown out of there, which he finally did get accomplished.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">Q. <em>So in your opinion that would be the proper thing to do under those circumstances, would be to call the police.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">A. <em>The first thing I would have done if I would have been tending bar would be to call the police immediately, called security and escorted him out. I\u2019ve tended bar before, so that\u2019s what I would have done exactly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Sodorff did not testify, and the emphasized testimony was not admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">After reviewing Dragger\u2019s deposition testimony during the same hearing, the court stated that it did not think Dragger should be allowed to give his opinion regarding whether the police should have been called. The court\u2019s precise ruling on Dragger\u2019s testimony is unclear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>record, and Rudy\u2019s counsel did not prepare a written order. However, the following excerpt from Dragger\u2019s deposition testimony had been the subject of the discussion at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Dragger\u2019s Deposition Testimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">Q. In your mind at that point, the confrontation was going to be over, you thought?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">A. I thought it was, but I didn\u2019t want to let him go. I thought after what I saw happen that we should hold him and call the police. But Bruce said let him go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">Q. When you said \u201ccall the police,\u201d you thought the police should be called?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">A. Yeah, because of what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">Q. Because of what he had already done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">A. Right. He jumped on her head. I think that\u2019s reason to call the cops.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">At trial, Dragger was not allowed to testify that he believed the police should have been called after Taua attacked Marla.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Myers argues that the disputed evidence was admissible under Rule 701, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE), Chapter 626, HRS (1985).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Myers also contends that his witnesses should have been allowed to counter Rudy\u2019s employees\u2019 testimony that their actions were reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The admission of evidence lies within the discretion of the trial court, and the court\u2019s decision will be overturned only where there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Yorita v. Okumoto, </em>3 Haw. App. 148, 643 P.2d 820 (1982). Abuse of discretion is shown when the court\u2019s decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded principles of law. <em>Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc. v. Powley, </em>2 Haw. App. 265, 630 P.2d 642 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The question is whether the opinion testimony would have been helpful to the jury in the determination of a fact in issue. Rule 701, HRE. The opinion of both witnesses related to events that took place after Taua\u2019s initial assault on Marla. Marla had already been knocked off the bar stool when Sodorff spoke to Spewak and when Dragger and Spewak pulled Taua away. Consequently, the testimony was not relevant to the issue of whether Rudy\u2019s exercised reasonable care to protect Marla from the unreasonable risk of harm from Taua\u2019s initial assault. While Dragger\u2019s testimony had some relevance to whether Spewak acted reasonably in releasing Taua rather than holding him for the police, we are not convinced, under all the circumstances of this case, that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We reject Myers\u2019 argument that the lower court erred in not admitting Honolulu Police Department statistics relating to the incidence of crime in the Waikiki area. Myers\u2019 purpose in seeking to introduce the evidence was to show that the Hotel was in a high crime area and that Outrigger was negligent in failing to provide adequate security to protect persons lawfully on the Hotel\u2019s premises. Although the court originally refused to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>statistics into evidence, the court reconsidered its ruling during Outrigger\u2019s case in chief when Outrigger\u2019s security chief testified that the Hotel is located in a low crime area. However, Myers did not avail himself of the court\u2019s change of mind and made no effort to renew his request for introduction of the statistics.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We take up, now, the question of the relief to be accorded to Myers. In his opening brief, Myers requested that we amend the judgment to indicate that Rudy\u2019s negligence was the legal cause of Myers\u2019 harm and enter judgment accordingly. In the alternative, Myers requested a new trial on liability and affirmance of the jury\u2019s award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We reject Myers\u2019 request for entry of judgment in his favor. Causation is an essential factual element of negligence which is for the jury to decide. The evidence on causation in this record is not so clear that it can be said as a matter of law that causation has been established. <em>See McKenna v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, </em>57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On the record in this case, the issue of liability is sufficiently separate from the question of damages so that we may exercise our discretion and remand Myers\u2019 claim against Rudy\u2019s for a retrial on the issue of liability only. <em>Kojima v. Uyeda, 2 </em>Haw. App. 172, 175, 628 P.2d 208, 211 (1981). Moreover, since neither the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination of the damages suffered by Myers nor the adequacy of the damages have been questioned by any of the parties, w\u00e9 may affirm the amount of the award. <em>See City &amp; County v. Bishop Trust Co., </em>49 Haw. 494, 421 P.2d 300 (1966).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6k\"><em>Stacy Moniz (David C. Schutter </em>and <em>Paul D. Hicks </em>with him on the briefs; Schutter &amp; Glickstein, of counsel) for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AG0B\"><em>David J. Dezzani (Margaret C. Jenkins </em>with him on the brief; Goodsill Anderson Quinn &amp; Stifel, of counsel) for defendant-appellee South Seas Corp.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AU9\"><em>Kari A. Wilhelm {Arthur F. Roeca </em>with her on the brief; Roeca, Louie &amp; Hiraoka, of counsel) for defendantappellee Outrigger.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in favor of Outrigger. We vacate the judgment in favor of Rudy\u2019s and remand Myers\u2019 claim against Rudy\u2019s for a new trial on the issue of liability alone. The jury\u2019s award of damages is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\"> Defendant-Appellee Outrigger Hotels Hawaii, Inc. (Outrigger), dba Outrigger Surf Hotel, argued below and in its answering brief that Plaintiff-Appellant Michael S. Myers\u2019 (Myers) motion to amend the judgment or in the alternative for a new trial was untimely because it was not served within ten days of the entry of the judgment as required by Rule 59, Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1980). Judgment was entered on December 19,1990. The motion to amend the judgment or for a new trial was filed with the circuit court clerk on January 3,1991, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>and was served on South Seas Corporation, dba Rudy\u2019s Italian Restaurant and Hideaway Lounge (Rudy\u2019s) that same day and on Outrigger on January 4,1991. Rudy\u2019s did not raise this argument below or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A6d\">Outrigger\u2019s timeliness argument is correct. <em>Escritor v. Maui County Council, Ltd., </em>2 Haw. App. 200, 629 P.2d 1146 (1981).
