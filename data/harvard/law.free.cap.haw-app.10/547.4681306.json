(collectively Defendant),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing all of Plaintiff-Appellant Patricia Wagatsuma\u2019s (Plaintiff) negligence, strict products liability, and emotional distress claims against Defendant and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">This action arose from the drowning of Plaintiff\u2019s four-year-old son Wayne Robert (Wayne) on February 8, 1988, in a swimming pool (pool) manufactured by Defendant. On that date, Plaintiff left Wayne and Plaintiff\u2019s two other minor children, Kelly Jones (Kelly), 12, and Sandy, 20 months, at the residence of co-defendants Linda Penn (Penn) and Wallace Patch (Patch) in Pahoa, Hawai'i, while Plaintiff went on an errand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sometime after Plaintiff left, Penn and Kelly discovered Wayne\u2019s lifeless body floating face down in the pool which was attached to the residence. An autopsy confirmed that Wayne had drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Patch, who was the owner of the premises and Penn\u2019s landlord, purchased the pool in California in 1979 from one of Defendant\u2019s distributors, brought the pool to Hawafi, and installed it on the property. The above ground pool was approximately four feet deep and was surrounded at its top by a wooden deck which connected the pool to the house. The deck, in turn, was partly sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rounded by a fence with a gate that prevented access to the pool from the ground. However, there was no fence or gate between the pool area and the residence. Thus, the pool was directly accessible from the residence by crossing over the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On February 2, 1990, Plaintiff, for herself and as administrator of Wayne\u2019s estate, filed the original complaint against Patch and Penn alleging that their negligence had caused Wayne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">On September 11, 1990, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint to include claims against Defendant. In Count I of the amended complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was negligent because it \u201cfailed to use good engineering practices in designing, constructing and marketing\u201d the pool. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was negligent because Defendant (1) did not include in its sales package to Patch an \u201caquatic safety system\u201d that included, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csafety fencing, a safety ladder, a pool alarm and a safety pool cover,\u201d for use on the pool, (2) did not provide Patch with any \u201caquatic safety documents concerning, inter alia [sic], adequate fencing, self-closing and positive self-latching gates, house latching and locking mechanisms, pool alarms and safety pool covers[,]\u201d either at the time of the sale or at any time before Wayne\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count II, Plaintiff\u2019s claim for products liability, alleged that the \u201cpool was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user\u201d because of the design and manufacturing defects and the \u201cfail[ure] to warn the user about the dangers incident to the intended or foreseeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>use of the swimming pool[.]\u201d In Count III, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant\u2019s negligence caused her \u201csevere emotional distress[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On January 17, 1992, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment (Motion) on Plaintiff\u2019s claims. In support of the Motion, Defendant filed excerpts from depositions taken of Patch, Penn, Plaintiff, and Kelly, as well as excerpts from Plaintiff\u2019s responses to Defendant\u2019s interrogatories. Defendant\u2019s evidence indicates that, although Patch always had a fence and gate to prevent access to the pool from the ground, he chose not to install a gate limiting access to the pool from the residence. Additionally, Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony indicates that Plaintiff, a former lifeguard and swimming instructor, had been teaching Wayne to swim but that he could not yet do so. Penn\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s depositions indicate that neither of them saw Wayne enter the pool or knew how he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In opposing the Motion, Plaintiff submitted affidavits from George F. Lawniczak, Jr., Ph.D. (Dr. Lawniczak), David S. Smith, Ph.D. (Dr. Smith), and Philip L. Carey (Carey), Plaintiff's counsel. Dr. Lawniczak\u2019s resume, attached to the affidavit, establishes his rather extensive experience in \u201caquatic safety.\u201d Dr. Lawniczak also attached excerpts and articles from a number of trade journals and other publications, and from the national safety council, dealing with swimming pools and drownings. Some of the attachments contain statistical data and other information on the incidence of children drowning in swimming pools. The essence of Dr. Lawniczak\u2019s affidavit is that the statistics and data indicate that all swimming pools should be equipped with safety devices to prevent such drownings. Dr. Lawniczak opines that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Patch\u2019s pool had been so equipped, Wayne might not have drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Dr. Smith\u2019s affidavit similarly asserts that he is an aquatic safety expert. Dr. Smith avers that, based on his knowledge of the subject of drownings, special care must be taken to protect children from drowning in swimming pools. Dr. Smith advocates constant supervision of children around swimming pools and instruction for all pool owners on pool safety. Dr. Smith also states that information on safety devices should have been provided to Patch and that if the devices had been installed, Wayne\u2019s death could have been prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Carey\u2019s affidavit submitted numerous documents, including (1) depositions of Plaintiff, Penn, and Dr. Lawniczak in this case; (2) depositions of certain of Defendant\u2019s officers and employees from an unrelated drowning suit against Defendant in Alabama; and (3) portions of Defendant\u2019s responses to interrogatories in the Alabama case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Before the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiff filed an affidavit from Patch in which Patch averred that when he bought the pool from Defendant\u2019s distributor in Santa Cruz, California, he was not provided with any safety equipment or safety system; he was not informed that such equipment was available; he was aware of some kinds of safety equipment; he did not recall that Defendant supplied him with any literature relating to the safe operation of the pool with regard to children; and he did not receive any information or warnings about safety from Defendant after he bought the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence indicates that (1) the incidence of child drownings in swimming pools was well known; (2) pool safety devices were available at the time Patch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>bought the pool from Defendant; (3) Defendant knew about such devices but neither offered them to Patch nor informed him of their availability; and (4) Plaintiff\u2019s experts were of the opinion that if such devices had been installed on the pool, Wayne\u2019s death could have been prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The briefs engage in a lengthy discussion of the admissibility of Plaintiff\u2019s experts\u2019 affidavits and attached supporting materials. Defendant argues that, since the supporting materials are inadmissible hearsay, the expert opinions are unfounded. Defendant also contends that the depositions from the Alabama case are not properly certified or sworn to as required by Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Ride 56(e) (1990). Consequently, Defendant contends that Plaintiff\u2019s evidence fails to establish any genuine issue of material fact. In our view of the case, the debate is irrelevant. It is generally held that \u201c[t]he question of negligence or the standard of reasonable care is one within the jury\u2019s competence and opinion testimony on this subject is generally excluded.\u201d <em>Sherry v. Asing, </em>56 Haw. 135, 147-48, 531 P.2d 648, 657 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">As the following discussion will show, expert testimony was not needed to establish genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Brown v. Clark Equipment Co., </em>62 Haw. 530, 618 P.2d 267 (1980) (expert testimony unnecessary where the issues are within the common knowledge of the jurors).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>After a hearing, the court granted the Motion and entered the Judgment, which was properly certified as final for appeal purposes in accordance with HRCP Rule 54(b) (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff thereafter timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">At the outset, we emphasize that our decision in this case is strictly limited to the question of whether summary judgment was properly granted. The standard of review is whether the record shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to any element or elements of Plaintiff\u2019s negligence and strict liability claims and Defendant is entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law. <em>Beamer v. Nishiki, </em>66 Haw. 572, 670 P.2d 1264 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The movant in a summary judgment proceeding has the burden of showing the absence of any material fact issue, <em>First Hawaiian Bank v. Weeks, 70 </em>Haw. 392, 772 P.2d 1187 (1989), and the movant may discharge that burden by showing that if the case went to trial there would be no evidence to support the non-movant\u2019s position. <em>Id. </em>The evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non \u2014 moving party, <em>Bidar v. AMFAC, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 669 P.2d 154 (1983), and summary judgment will be denied where the movant\u2019s proof supplies evidence showing a genuine issue of material fact, <em>see Dalke v. Upjohn Co., </em>555 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1977), even if the opposing party has presented no opposing evidence. The general rule is that \u201c[wjhere the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied <em>even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\u201d </em>10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2739, at 524 (1983) (Wright &amp; Miller) (quoting Advisory Committee on Civil Rules Note to the 1963 amendments to Rule 56) (emphasis in Wright &amp; Miller).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Summary judgment must be used with due regard for its purpose and should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of disputed factual issues. <em>Miller v. Manuel, </em>9 Haw. App. 56, 828 P.2d 286 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>72 Haw. 618, 841 P.2d 1075 (1992). As a general rule, questions of negligence are ordinarily not susceptible to summary judgment. <em>McKeague v. Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. 646, 658 P.2d 898 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Summary judgment is analogous to a directed verdict, <em>id., </em>and where the evidence proffered in support of a motion for summary judgment and the inferences fairly to be drawn from them are reasonably susceptible of differing interpretations, summary judgment should not be granted. <em>Kawaihae v. Hawaiian Ins. Cos., 1 </em>Haw. App. 355, 619 P.2d 1086 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist as to Plaintiff\u2019s claims and summary judgment was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">HI. PARTIES\u2019CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Plaintiff argues that (1) there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant was negligent in not including one or more of the following items in the pool sales package: (a) labels warning pool users that the pool posed a particular and unique danger for young, unsupervised children; (b) an \u201caquatic safety system\u201d including, <em>inter alia, </em>one or more of the following: (i) warning labels, (ii) safety fencing, (iii) a self-locking, child-proof gate, (iv) a pool cover, (v) a pool alarm system, (vi) a safety ladder; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>(vii) printed material informing pool purchasers of the availability of such aquatic safety systems; and (2) the absence of such safety items rendered the pool dangerously defective. Essentially, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant was negligent in designing, manufacturing, and marketing the pool without any devices reasonably designed to prevent young children from falling into the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument implicitly concedes that swimming pools are dangerous to improperly supervised young children. However, Defendant contends that (1) the danger is so commonly known that it had no duty to provide labels warning of the hazard of allowing unattended or unsupervised young children in the vicinity of a swimming pool; (2) it had no duty to provide its customers with safety equipment or devices to prevent unattended young children from falling into its swimming pool, or provide them with information of the availability of those devices, because it was not reasonably foreseeable that a parent or other custodian would leave a young child unsupervised in the area of a swimming pool; (3) Plaintiff failed to produce any proof that the pool was \u201cdangerously defective\u201d; and (4) Plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole legal cause of Wayne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">IV. PRINCIPLES OF PRODUCTS LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">A party who asserts that his or her injuries were caused by a defective product may proceed against the alleged tortfeasor under principles of negligence and/or strict liability. <em>Ontai v. Straub Clinic and Hospital, </em>66 Haw. 237, 659 P.2d 734 (1983); <em>Brown v. Clark Equipment Co., </em>62 Haw. 530, 618 P.2d 267 (1980); 2 American Law of Products Liability, \u00a7 28:5 (1987) (hereinafter 2 ALPL).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>A product may be defective \u201cunder any one of three general theories: defective manufacture, defective design, or insufficient warning.\u201d Note, <em>Unreasonably Dangerous Products From A Child\u2019s Perspective: A Proposal For A Reasonable Child Consumer Expectation Test, </em>20 Rutgers L.J. 433, 436 (1989) (footnotes omitted). Unlike a claim that a product was defectively manufactured, a product that is claimed to be dangerous because of a design defect cannot be measured against a standard set by the manufacturer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>O'Brien v. Muskin, </em>94 N.J. 169, 181, 463 A.2d 298, 304 (1983). The failure of a manufacturer to equip its product with a safety device may constitute a design defect. <em>Ontai.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Generally, a products liability claim based on either negligence or strict liability has three elements: (1) a duty to anticipate and design against reasonably foreseeable hazards; (2) breach of that duty; and (3) injury proximately caused by the breach. 2 ALPL \u00a7 28:33, at 47. In negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant breached its duty of care, while in strict liability the plaintiff must show that the product was defective because it was unreasonably dangerous. <em>Anguiano v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., </em>808 F. Supp. 719, 722 (D. Ariz. 1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Negligence theory concerns itself with determining whether the conduct of the defendant was rear sonable in view of the foreseeable risk of injury; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>strict liability is concerned with whether the product itself was unreasonably dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">2 ALPL, \u00a7 28:16, at 31 (1987) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A. Negligence Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s burden in a negligent design claim is to prove that the manufacturer was negligent in not taking reasonable measures in designing its product to protect against a foreseeable risk of injury, <em>see Dart v. Wiebe Mfg., Inc., </em>147 Ariz. 242, 709 P.2d 876 (1985), and the manufacturer\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>Ono v. Applegate, </em>62 Haw. 131, 612 P.2d 533 (1980). Negligence can result from a failure to act as well as from an affirmative act, <em>Quality Furniture, Inc. v. Hay, </em>61 Haw. 89, 595 P.2d 1066 (1979), and causation may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>American Broadcasting Cos. v. Kenai Air of Hawaii [Hawai'i], </em>67 Haw. 219, 686 P.2d 1 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Among the factors the fact finder should consider in determining whether the manufacturer acted reasonably are: (1) balancing the likelihood and gravity of the potential harm against the burden of precautions which would effectively avoid the harm; (2) the style, type, and particular purpose of the product; (3) the cost of an alternative design, since the product\u2019s marketability maybe adversely affected by a cost factor that greatly outweighs the added safety of the product; and (4) the price of the product itself. 2 ALPL, \u00a7 28:33, at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">B. Strict Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">The doctrine of strict liability has eased the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof in a design defect case by eliminating the requirement that the plaintiff prove the manufacturer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>94 N.J. at 178-79, 463 A.2d at 303 (citing Keeton, <em>Product Liability and the Meaning of Defect, </em>5 St. Mary\u2019s L.J. 30, 34-35 (1973)). The plaintiff\u2019s burden in such a case is to prove (1) a defect in the product which rendered it unreasonably dangerous for its intended or reasonably foreseeable use; and (2) a causal connection between the defect and plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>Ontai, </em>66 Haw. at 243, 659 P.2d at 740. Proof of defect and causation may be provided by expert testimony or by circumstantial evidence. <em>American Broadcasting Cos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><em>Ontai </em>establishes two alternative tests to ascertain whether a product is defective: the consumer expectation test and the risk-utility test. Under the consumer expectation test, the plaintiff must show that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when it was used in its intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. On the other hand, the risk-utility test requires that once the plaintiff proves that the product\u2019s design caused the injury complained of, the defendant must prove that the benefits of the design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in that design.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ontai, </em>66 Haw. at 242, 659 P.2d at 739-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Under the risk-utility test, the fact finder balances a number of relevant factors, which are listed in <em>Larsen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>Pacesetter Systems, Inc., </em>74 Haw. 1, 23 n.6, 837 P.2d 1273, 1285 n.6 (1992).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The procedure in applying the risk-utility test is best described in <em>Barker v. Lull Eng\u2019g Co., </em>20 Cal. 3d 413, 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978), cited with approval by the <em>Ontai </em>court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">[OJnce the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the injury was pr\u00f3ximately caused by the product\u2019s design, the burden should appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>shift to the defendant to prove, in light of the relevant factors, that the product is not defective. Moreover, inasmuch as this conclusion flows from our determination that the fundamental public policies embraced in <em>Greenman [v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., </em>59 Cal. 2d 57, 27 Cal. Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897 (1963)]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> dictate that a manufacturer who seeks to escape liability for an injury proximately caused by its product\u2019s design on a risk-benefit theory should bear the burden of persuading the trier of fact that its product should not be judged defective, the defendant\u2019s burden is one affecting the burden of proof, rather than simply the burden of producing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\"><em>Barker, </em>20 Cal. 3d at 431-32, 143 Cal. Rptr. at 237, 573 P.2d at 455 (footnote added). <footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em>Accord Campbell v. General Motors Corp., </em>32 Cal. 3d 112, 184 Cal.

DUTY</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Since, as we have noted, Defendant contends that it had no duty to Plaintiff to warn Plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the pool or to provide safeguards against injury to young children from the use of the pool, we must first determine whether Defendant had any duty to Wayne. If Defendant had no duty, it cannot be held liable under either negligence or strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Whether a duty exists,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">that is, \u201cwhether... such a relation exists between the parties that the community will impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of the other \u2014 or, more simply, whether the interest of the plaintiff which has suffered invasion was entitled to legal protection at the hands of the defendant,\u201d <em>is entirely a question of law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\"><em>Bidar, </em>66 Haw. at 552, 669 P.2d at 158 (quoting W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 37, at 206 (4th ed. 1971)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">[t]he legal duty of manufacturers ... to exercise reasonable care in the design and incorporation of safety features to protect against foreseeable dangers is well established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-13\"><em>Ontai, </em>66 Haw. at 247, 659 P.2d at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">However, a manufacturer\u2019s duty of care to protect against injury from the use of its product extends only to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-15\">those \u201cwho are foreseeably endangered by the conduct and only with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the [manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>turer\u2019s] conduct unreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Foreseeability is a question of law that this court can competently determine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><em>Hulsman v. Hemmeter Dev. Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 68, 647 P.2d 713, 720-21 (1982) (citations <em>omitted; </em>emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Since it is obvious to all that swimming pools are dangerous to young children, we take judicial notice of that fact. Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 626 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Because of the obvious danger, it is unreasonable to require that Defendant furnish labels with its pools warning of that danger. The manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn only extends to known dangers which the user of the manufacturer\u2019s product would not ordinarily discover. <em>Ontai, </em>66 Haw. at 248, 659 P.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">However, we do not agree that the obvious danger entirely relieves Defendant of any duty to reasonably protect against such injury, as a matter of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">The obviousness of the danger, unless it justifies the conclusion that the condition is not unreasonably dangerous, has been held not to preclude liability on the part of a manufacturer who negligently designs a machine. The obviousness of peril is relevant to the manufacturer\u2019s defenses (e.g. contributory negligence), and not to the issue of duty. The creation of any unreasonable danger is enough to establish negligence, even though the danger is obvious. <em>And it is ordinarily a question for the jury as to whether or not a failure to install a safety device creates an unreasonable risk.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-10\"><em>Brown, </em>62 Haw. 530, 541, 618 P.2d 267, 273 (citations omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Defendant further argues, however, that it was not reasonably foreseeable that Plaintiff would allow Wayne to be in the vicinity of the pool without proper supervision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">While it may be correct, as Defendant asserts, that consumers are expected to conduct their affairs with care and caution, it must be recognized that the expectation is not always realized. The consumers\u2019 attentiveness is very often undermined by human frailties, and their care and attention is not always exercised on a consistently high plane. Rather, their attentiveness is subject to ebbs and flows. Indeed, the unevenness of care is perhaps nowhere more evident than with respect to parental attention to their children\u2019s safety and welfare. Even the most cautious parents suffer lapses of attention and are distracted from the watchful care of their children \u201cjust for a minute,\u201d or overestimate the trustworthiness and reliability of those to whom they may entrust their children. It is reasonably foreseeable that, because of such lapses, even the most attentive parent\u2019s young child will not always be prevented from going \u201cin harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Our view is supported by the language of the ordinances (hereinafter ordinances) of the City and County of Honolulu and the County of Hawai'i recognizing the need for fences and other protective devices within and around private swimming pools to protect against injury to young children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The ordinances, although enacted in only two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of four counties of the state, clearly indicate that the community in general recognizes the foreseeable danger,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>and the need to protect against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Accordingly, we hold that a swimming pool manufacturer\u2019s duty to put a safe product on the market includes the duty to take such measures in manufacturing and marketing the pool as will reasonably protect against injury to young children arising from their use of the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We are keenly aware that we should not impose a new duty upon members of our society without logical, sound, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and compelling reasons, considering the social and human relationships of our society. <em>Birmingham v. Fodor\u2019s Travel Publications, Inc., </em>73 Haw. 359, 833 P.2d 70 (1992). Nevertheless, the same policy of assuring the safety and welfare of young children that motivated the two counties to adopt the ordinances compels us to impose a similar duty on pool manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">It may be argued, of course, that, since the ordinances\u2019 safety requirements apply only to the pool owner, the policy underlying the ordinances should not affect the manufacturer\u2019s duty. However, the policy of the ordinances to protect young children is based on the foreseeability of injury to them. We see no reason why that underlying foreseeability should not extend to the pool manufacturer and require the manufacturer to share in the responsibility of protecting against injury to young children. We do not believe that the pool manufacturer, having knowingly put the admittedly dangerous product on the market, should be allowed to rely on the obvious foreseeability of injury to young children to relieve itself of the responsibility to protect them from that injury. Stated otherwise, the manufacturer should not be allowed to put a product on the market which it admits is dangerous to young children without taking some reasonable measures to protect against foreseeable injury to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Nor do we think that imposing such a duty on the manufacturer is unreasonable. It will not add to the pool owner\u2019s total cost since, at least in Honolulu County and Hawai'i County, the pool owner must install such equipment anyway. Therefore, the manufacturer\u2019s sales will not be affected. Moreover, in accordance with the underlying policy of products liability law, the manufacturer is best able, through the purchase of liability insurance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>increased prices, to spread the costs of complying with the duty we now impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">We reject Defendant\u2019s argument that the reasoning relied upon to support the duty we now impose on the swimming pool manufacturer would also require (1) cities to erect fences around all of their public streets, \u201csince it is well known that young, unsupervised children sometimes dart onto the road and are injured\u201d; and (2) the State to erect fences around beaches, \u201csince unsupervised children can just as easily drown in the ocean as a pool.\u201d Suffice it to say that those questions are not before us. Moreover, the question is whether the imposition of the duty is reasonable in view of all the circumstances. <em>See Ontai.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">VL BREACH OF DUTY IN NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The issue of breach of duty is common to both negligent and strict products liability claims and is ordinarily one for the jury. <em>Brown. </em>However, as we have noted, the considerations for determining breach of duty in products liability cases differ between those two theories: in a negligence claim the plaintiff must prove the defendant\u2019s breach of duty of due care; however, under the doctrine of strict liability the plaintiff need only prove that the product was defective because it was unreasonably dangerous. As we have also indicated, under strict liability law, proof of a product\u2019s defectiveness is interlaced with proof of causation. Consequently, we will defer discussion of proof of the defectiveness of the pool until we discuss the question of causation in the following section of this opinion. In this section, we will discuss the issue of breach of duty under the principles of negligence outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The question, here, is whether Defendant carried its burden of showing from the evidence in the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether it discharged its duty to guard against the foreseeable risk discussed above and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, <em>see Beamer, </em>or that if the case went to trial Plaintiff could not prove Defendant\u2019s breach of duty. <em>First Hawaiian Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In light of the duty we have imposed on Defendant, Defendant was required to show from the evidence that there was no question that it had taken reasonable measures to protect against injury to young children. However, since Defendant claimed that it had no duty to warn or guard against such injury and that Plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the entire cause of Wayne\u2019s death, Defendant introduced no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">On the other hand, Patch\u2019s affidavit, introduced by Plaintiff, indicates that, although he did not request or purchase any safety devices from Defendant when he bought the pool, and Defendant did not send him such devices after that, he could not remember whether Defendant offered him such devices at the time of the purchase or advised him that they were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">It is clear from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, that Defendant failed to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant offered Patch any safety materials or devices or informed him of their availability either at the time of or after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">It will be up to the jury to decide from the evidence produced at trial what reasonable steps Defendant should have taken to guard against foreseeable injury to young children and whether Defendant was negligent in not taking those steps in this case. Based upon the evidence produced the jury may decide that the devices proposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Plaintiff would provide such reasonable protection, or it may decide that Defendant should have undertaken some other measure or measures that would provid\u00e9 reasonable protection against injury from the use of its product.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">VH. CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We turn, now, to the question of whether the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, show that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the pool\u2019s design was a proximate cause of Wayne\u2019s death under negligence or strict liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We first deal with Defendant\u2019s contentions regarding Plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Defendant argues that Plaintiff was required, but failed to prove, (1) that the absence of safety devices enabled Wayne to enter the pool; or (2) that any of the safety devices would have prevented Wayne from entering the pool. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">First, Plaintiff did not have the burden ascribed to her by Defendant. Defendant had the burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of fact on the question of causation. Second, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove causation in an action based on negligence, <em>see Kaeo v. Davis, </em>68 Haw. 447, 719 P.2d 387 (1986), and/or strict liability. <em>Stewart v. Budget Rent-A-Car Corp., </em>52 Haw. 71, 470 P.2d 240 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In <em>Campbell, </em>the California Supreme Court outlined the basis for the use of circumstantial evidence to prove causation in products liability cases. In that case, the plaintiff claimed that she was injured because the manufacturer of the bus in which she was a passenger failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>install a safety device that would have prevented her from falling when the bus made a sudden movement. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of nonsuit based on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the bus was defective in design or that the alleged defect was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The California Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">Unless very unusual circumstances exist, [a claim that an injury was caused by a manufacturer\u2019s failure to provide a safety device] presents a factual issue which can only be resolved by the trier of fact. \u201cIn the ordinary case the question becomes one of what would have happened if [the product had been] otherwise. This is of course incapable of mathematical proof, and a certain element of guesswork is always involved. Proof of the relation of cause and effect can never be more than \u2018the projection of our habit of expecting certain consequents to follow certain antecedents merely because we have observed those sequences on previous occasions.\u2019 When a child is drowned in a swimming pool, no one can say with certainty that a lifeguard would have saved him; but the experience of the community is that with guards present people are commonly saved, and this affords a sufficient basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the absence of the guard played a significant part in the drowning. Such questions are peculiarly for the jury. Whether proper construction of a building would have withstood an earthquake, whether reasonable police precautions would have prevented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>boy from shooting the plaintiff in the eye with an airgun, whether a broken flange would have made an electric car leave the rails in the absence of excessive speed, whether a collision would have occurred if the defendant had not partially obstructed the highway, and many similar questions, cannot be decided as a matter of law.\u201d (Prosser, <em>Proximate Cause in California </em>(1950) 38 Cal. L. Rev. 369, 382-383, fns. omitted, emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">The plaintiff in a strict liability action is not required to disprove every possible alternative explanation of the injury in order to have the case submitted to the jury. \u201cIt is not incumbent upon a plaintiff to show that an inference in his favor is the only one that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence; he need only show that the material fact to be proved may logically and reasonably be inferred from the circumst\u00e1ntial evidence. <em>(Estate of Rowley </em>[1967] 257 Cal. App. 2d 324, 334-35, 65 Cal.Rptr. 139, and cases cited therein; Witkin, <em>Cal. Evidence </em>(2d ed.) [\u00a7 133,] pp. 1050-1051.) . . . The mere fact that other inferences adverse to plaintiff might be drawn does not render the inference favorable to plaintiff too conjectural or speculative for consideration [by the jury].\u201d <em>(Dimond v. Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 173, 182, 134 Cal.Rptr. 895; see also <em>Blank v. Coffin </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 457, 460-61, 126 P.2d 868 (opn. by Traynor, J.) [\u201cIf a jury can reasonably infer from these primary facts that the material fact exists, the party has introduced sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>evidence to entitle him to have the jury decide the issue.\u201d]; <em>Greco v. Bucciconi Engineering Company, </em>(W.D.Pa. 1967) 283 F.Supp. 978, 984, affd. (3d Cir. 1969) 407 F.2d 87; Witkin, <em>Cal. Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 1133, pp. 1050-51.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">It is particularly appropriate that the jury be allowed to determine the inference to be drawn when the evidence indicates that a safety device, designed to prevent the very injury that occurred, was not present. To take the case from the jury simply because the plaintiff could not prove to a certainty that the device would have prevented the accident would enable the manufacturer to prevail on the basis of its failure to provide the safeguard. See <em>Haft v. Lone Palm Hotel, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 756, 772, 91 Cal.Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a rule would provide a disincentive to improve the safety features of a product and thereby interfere with one of the major policy goals of strict liability.

Then what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">A. I went into the room and started sewing. Kelly then maybe approximately five minutes later came into the room, [sic] I turned from my sewing and I looked her in the eyes and I said, \u201cKelly, is it all right for Wayne to be out there by himself?\u201d And Kelly said, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">A. I turned back to my sewing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-15\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-16\">A. Kelly was drawing out of a book. She was doing some drawing on the sofa, and I was sewing. And then in about ten minutes I didn\u2019t hear Wayne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Robert. I didn\u2019t hear anything, so I got up to see where he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">A. He was lying in the swimming pool.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Kelly\u2019s deposition contained the following pertinent testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">A. I finished my picture, then got up to go show Linda. And then I looked out the sliding doors, and then I saw my brother in the pool floating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">Q. He was entirely in the pool?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">A. (Witness nods head up and down.) Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">Q. Was he floating in the pool or was he submerged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">A. He was floating in the pool.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">Additionally, the evidence shows that two days before Wayne drowned, he had been swimming in the pool under Plaintiff\u2019s supervision and with the aid of a flotation device.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">The evidence in the record clearly supports a reasonable inference that, after being denied permission to go swimming again on February 8, 1988, a single-minded and unsuspecting Wayne went out to the pool and either fell or jumped in. The question of whether a safety device installed in or around the pool would have prevented Wayne from entering the pool is a genuine issue of material fact that must be determined by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">We also find no merit in Defendant\u2019s argument that Plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole legal cause of Wayne\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>death. There is clearly a genuine dispute over whether Plaintiffleft Wayne in the care of Penn or Kelly. In either event, a fact finder could find that Plaintiff was not negligent in doing so. Moreover, even if a fact finder should find Plaintiff negligent, it could also find from the evidence that her negligence was not the sole cause of Wayne\u2019s death but was only one of the factors contributing to it, along with the negligence of all the defendants. In such case, Plaintiff\u2019s recovery on her negligent products liability claim would only be defeated completely if the fact finder found that her negligence was greater than the negligence of the defendants in this case. HRS \u00a7 663-31 (1985). On the other hand, her recovery, if any, on her strict liability claim would only be reduced by the fact finder\u2019s assessment of the extent to which her negligence contributed to Wayne\u2019s death. <em>Armstrong v. Cione, </em>69 Haw. 176, 738 P.2d 79 (1987). At this juncture, it cannot be said as a matter of law that Plaintiff\u2019s negligence, if any, was the sole legal cause of Wayne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Similarly, the fact that Patch did not install any safety devices in or around the pool, or, as Defendant argues, that pool owners in general may not wish to install the kind of safety devices proposed by Plaintiff because such equipment may be inconvenient to themselves or their neighbors, does not as a matter of law relieve Defendant of liability in this case, since a third party\u2019s negligence is not a defense unless such negligence is the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>Ontai, </em>66 Haw. at 249, 659 P.2d at 743.

Honolulu County requires the owner of premises on which a swimming, dipping, or wading pool is located to completely surround either the pool or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>property with a wall or a fence at least \u201cfour and one-half feet high\u201d and \u201csufficient to make the pool inaccessible to small children[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-6.2(a). Additionally, all gates and doors must be self-closing and equipped with self-latching devices placed at least four feet above the ground or be otherwise inaccessible to small children. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-6.2(b). In lieu of a fence or wall, the pool owner may provide a competent person to keep watch over the pool, or a pool cover or other protective device approved by the proper official \u201ccapable of preventing small children from falling into the water[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-6.2(c). The ordinance also provides that no new permits for such pools may be issued unless provision is made for such fence, wall, pool cover or other protective device. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-6.3.</p>\n<p id=\"AqyG\">At the time of Wayne\u2019s death, the County of Hawai'i (Hawai'i County) characterized \u201cunfenced man-made swimming pools\u201d as an \u201cattractive nuisance which may prove detrimental to children whether in a building, on the premises of a building, or upon an unoccupied lot.\u201d Hawai'i County Code, chapter 11, article 1, \u00a7 11\u20147(a)(28)(B) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AAt\">Effective November 8,1993, Hawai'i County enacted Ordinance No. 93-85 (No. 93-85), which adopted The 1991 Uniform Building Code (the Code). No. 93-85 adopts the language of both the ROH and the Code, particularly \u00a7 6309 of the Code, requiring protective devices for swimming, dipping and wading pools. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> We note that Honolulu County and Hawai'i County have approximately 75.4% and 8.2% of the state\u2019s population, respectively. <em>The State of Hawaii [Hawai'i] Data Book, 1992.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> In <em>Haft, </em>a father and son drowned in a hotel swimming pool. Contrary to statute, no lifeguard was on duty at the pool and no sign was posted advising guests of this fact. <em>(Haft, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d at pp. 762-763, 91 Cal. Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465.) Finding that \u201cthe evidentiary void in the instant action results primarily from defendants\u2019 failure to provide a lifeguard to observe occurrences within the pool area\u201d (p. 771, 91 Cal. Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465), this court held that once the plaintiffs proved that the defendants were negligent in this regard, and that a competent lifeguard probably would have prevented the deaths, the burden of proof on the issue of causation shifted to the defendants (p. 772, 91 Cal. Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465). \u201cTb require plaintiffs to establish \u2018proximate causation\u2019 to a greater certainty than they have in the instant case, would permit defendants to gain the advantage of the lack of proof inherent in the lifeguardless situation which they have created.
