On April 30,1992, the circuit court entered an order dismissing the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The single issue is whether PECAB was required to hold a contested case hearing in accordance with HRS chapter 91 (1985 and Supp. 1992) on HGEA\u2019s pricing appeal. A review of the provisions of HRS \u00a7 77-4 is essential to a resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">HRS \u00a7 77-4 had its genesis in Act 188, \u00a7 3,1961 Haw. Sess. Laws 305, 306-07, whose legislative purpose was to \u201cprovide uniform policies and procedures in matters of compensation [for public employees] among the state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>its political subdivisions in order to assure \u2018equal pay for equal work.\u2019\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 903, in 1961 House Journal, at 1018. The standing committee report noted that the \u201clong and prevailing\u201d struggle for uniformity in compensation matters \u201chas been a compelling factor in motivating the Legislature to take action in this respect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021. In its present form, HRS \u00a7 77-4 includes several amendments enacted after Act 188; however, no subsequent enactments have affected the law\u2019s original purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The goal of uniformity touted by Act 188 is achieved by a process where the directors of personnel or civil service for the state, the counties, and the judiciary meet in a conference every odd-numbered year to review the state compensation plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 77-4(a). The conference considers \u201cthe identification and price of bench mark classes;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> policies and standards; rules and regulations and any and all areas in the plan which are not inconsistent with the intent and purpose\u201d of HRS chapter 77. <em>Id. </em>(footnote added). Before October 15 of each odd-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>numbered year, HRS \u00a7 77-4(b) requires the conference to present its views and recommendations and a tentative compensation plan to PECAB, which is established in HRS \u00a7 77-4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">HRS \u00a7 77-4(c) requires PECAB to \u201cadopt policies and standards relative to compensation[,]\u201d and \u201cto meet biennially to receive [the conference\u2019s] recommendations and comments relating to the compensation plant,]\u201d and allows PECAB to hold public hearings on the compensation plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">HRS \u00a7 77-4(c) also provides that affected persons and parties may file a \u201cpricing appeal,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an appeal with PECAB from the pricing aspect of the compensation plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In other words, an appeal is allowed from that portion of the compensation plan in which classes are assigned to a salary range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> PECAB must conduct hearings on all pricing appeals and may make any necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>adjustments to the compensation plan for classes for which appeals were filed in accordance with the policies and standards provided for in HRS \u00a7 77-4(c). HRS \u00a7 77-4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Final adjustments to the compensation plan must be completed before the third Wednesday of J anuary of every even-numbered year. <em>Id. </em>After the final adjustments have been completed, the individual directors must submit a report to the legislature, through the governor\u2019s office, of the final compensation plan and its cost for the legislature\u2019s information and approval. <em>Id. </em>Once approved, the compensation plan becomes effective on July 1 of the even-numbered year, and salary range assignments may not be appealed until the next biennial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">When new classes are created, HRS \u00a7 77-4(e) requires the Director to assign them \u201cto salary ranges on the basis of the policies and standards\u201d provided for in chapter 77. Such assignments are effective immediately if funds are available and remain in effect until the next compensation plan is adopted. <em>Id. </em>Pricing appeals from those initial assignments may be heard by PECAB every six months or at the time of the next biennial review. <em>Id. </em>The appeal hearings are conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed in HRS \u00a7 77-4(c) and (d) and PECAB\u2019s rules and regulations. <em>Id. </em>After completing the hearings, PECAB is required to make any necessary adjustments to the appealed classes in accordance with the policies and standards of the statute. <em>Id. </em>The final adjustments for the initial pricing appeals must be completed and submitted to the legislature at the same time as the compensation plan. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the reallocations were made in accordance with HRS \u00a7 77-4(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">HGEA argues that (1) HRS \u00a7 77-4(c) establishes two separate and distinct types of hearings: public hearings on the compensation plan and pricing appeal hearings; and (2) pricing appeal hearings are contested case hearings because they determine the \u201clegal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties,\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-1(5) (1985), and are adjudicative functions as described in <em>Shoreline Transp., Inc. v. Robert\u2019s Tours and Transp., Inc., </em>70 Haw. 585, 779 P.2d 868 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cRulemaking is the process by which an agency lays down new prescriptions to govern the future conduct of those subject to its authority; adjudication is the process by which the agency applies either law or policy or both, to the facts of a particular case.\u201d . . . Rulemaking \u201cis essentially legislative in nature, not only because it operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely with considerations of policy.\u201d . . . \u201cAdjudication, conversely, is concerned with the determination of past and present rights and liabilities. Typically, [it] involve[s] a determination as to whether past conduct was unlawful so that the proceeding is characterized by an accusatory flavor and may result in disciplinary action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 591, 779 P.2d at 872 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">HGEA contends that the pricing appeal in this case requires a contested case hearing because (1) it deals with the prior conduct of the Director in assigning the new classes to a lower salary range and does not set new standards for future conduct; (2) PECAB\u2019s decision was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>decision of general applicability, but was a resolution of a specific dispute between HGEA and DPS; and (3) in determining the dispute, PECAB applied the facts of the case to rules laid down in chapter 77. Thus, HGEA contends that PECAB was required to provide a contested case hearing in accordance with HRS \u00a7 77-7 (1985), which requires PECAB to comply with HRS chapter 91 \u201cin all respects.\u201d HGEA\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The applicability of HRS chapter 91 contested case proceedings in this case depends upon whether the pricing appeal provided for in HRS \u00a7 77-4 creates a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of chapter 91. <em>See Abramson v. Board of Regents, </em>56 Haw. 680, 548 P.2d 253 (1976). In other words, is a pricing appeal \u201ca proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing?\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-1(5) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Generally, a contested case is one in which the agency performs an adjudicative as compared to an administrative function. <em>See Shoreline. </em>\u201c \u2018[T]he line between [the rulemaking and adjudicating] functions is not always a clear one and in fact the two functions merge at many points.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shoreline, </em>70 Haw. at 591, 779 P.2d at 872 (quoting <em>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 770, 89 S. Ct. 1426, 1432, 22 L. Ed. 2d 709, 717 (1969) (Black, concurring)). HRS chapter 77 is one of those points where the two functions merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The entire thrust of chapter 77\u2019s provisions is to establish the procedures, policies, and standards for developing the compensation plan through uniform allocation or assignment of all positions in the position classification plan to appropriate salary ranges in the salary structure. The statutory scheme assures that all positions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>similar duties, responsibilities, and functions are compensated at the same level of pay. Even though a pricing appeal requires PECAB to decide whether the pricing actions, which are <em>faits accompli, </em>conform to the procedures, policies, and standards of the statute, and the decision affects an individual employee, nevertheless, the end result \u2014 the compensation plan \u2014 is a statement of general application that governs the future conduct of the personnel departments of the state and county governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Additionally, the fact that the compensation plan must be submitted to the legislature for biennial approval indicates that PECAB\u2019s function is legislative in nature rather than adjudicatory. In essence, the compensation plan provides the basis for a statement of legislative policy governing employee compensation for the succeeding biennium. Indeed, the compensation plan is little more than a report to the legislature for its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Citing <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Mallen, </em>486 U.S. 230, 108 S. Ct. 1780, 100 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1988), HGEA further argues that the employees affected by the reallocation \u201chave a property interest in their governmental jobs and the wage scales of their governmental jobs.\u201d Therefore, in accordance with <em>Town v. Land Use Comm\u2019n, </em>55 Haw. 538, 524 P.2d 84 (1974), PECAB was required to accord contested case hearing procedures to the pricing appeal in this case. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">It is well-settled that the claim of a right to a due process hearing requires that the interest for which the protection is being sought must be in the nature of \u201cproperty\u201d Within the meaning of the due process clauses of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>federal and state constitutions. <em>Aguiar v. Hawai'i Hous. Auth., </em>55 Haw. 478, 522 P.2d 1255 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Sandy Beach Defense Fund v. City Council, </em>70 Haw. 361, 377, 773 P.2d 250, 260 (1989) (quoting <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 561 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In our view, HGEA has failed to show that the affected employees in this case clearly had a legitimate claim to have their class of positions assigned to a particular salary range. At best, they had only a desire to see that their class was assigned to the highest salary range possible. We cannot agree that the affected employees\u2019 claim rises to the level of a property interest within the meaning of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Although the supreme court has noted that wages are property subject to the protection of the due process clause, <em>Kekoa v. Supreme Court, </em>55 Haw. 104, 108, 516 P.2d 1239, 1242 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 930, 94 S. Ct. 2641, 41 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1974), the salary range assignment in this case did not, in and of itself, affect the incumbent employees\u2019 salaries. It only determined the range of salaries applicable to the newly created class of positions, considering the principles of HRS chapter 77. The employees\u2019 salaries may be affected when the positions held by them are allocated or reallocated within the <em>position classification plan </em>in accordance with HRS \u00a7 76-13(8)(A) and (B) (1985 and Supp. 1992), respectively. However, such actions are dependent upon the duties and responsibilities of each position, are separate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>assignment of classes to salary ranges within the <em>compensation plan, </em>and are subject to appeal to the civil service commission in accordance with the procedures established in HRS \u00a7 76-47 (1985), which provides for substantially the same procedures for hearing such appeals as provided for contested cases under HRS chapter 91.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AEW\"><em>Charles K.
