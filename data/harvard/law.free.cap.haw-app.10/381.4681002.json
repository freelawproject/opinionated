Thereafter, the State and the Defendant entered into a plea bargain. The plea bargain provided, in pertinent part, that the Class C felony would be reduced to Terroristic Threatening in the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Degree, a misdemeanor, and that the State, at sentencing, would be allowed to \u201cargue for jail.\u201d At the hearing to receive her guilty plea, the Defendant affirmed that she understood the plea bargain, that one year was the maximum term of imprisonment on the misdemeanor charge, and that the court could impose a sentence it believed was appropriate under the circumstances. The record, in relevant part, indicates the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">THE COURT: Now, you have not been promised any kind of deal or favor of leniency for your plea except you have been told that the Government\u2019s reduction for a Class C Offense of intimidating a witness to a misdemeanor offense of Second Degree, Terroristic Threatening in the exchange of your plea of guilty to the amended [sic], and an agreement not to move for, or defer except [sic] of a guilty plea and the State is free at sentencing to argue for jail; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">THE COURT: You fully understand the terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">THE COURT: And you do understand, however, that the Court is not a party to this case, and the Court will be free to impose any kind of sentence that the Court feels will be justified under the facts and circumstances of the case, you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">The Defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, based upon the plea agreement, was accepted by the trial court. On the Guilty Plea form the Defendant stated, \u201cI considered the risk of a felony conviction if trial proceeded and decided to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the State\u2019s plea offer. I do not contest the charges against me.\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">At the sentencing hearing the State argued for \u201ca minimum of 30 days incarceration.\u201d The defense requested probation. Acknowledging that the Defendant had \u201ca different version\u201d of the facts, the court nevertheless found that the police report stated the Defendant had \u201cthreatened to kill\u201d the complaining witness and the court could not \u201ctolerate that kind of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On August 28, 1992, the court entered its judgment sentencing the Defendant to probation, and as a condition of probation, imprisonment for a period of seven days. The Defendant appealed the condition of imprisonment. Subsequently, on October 27, 1992, the Defendant filed a Motion for Reconsideration or Reduction of Sentence, contending that the lack of a criminal record and the nature of the offense did not warrant imprisonment in her case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing on the motion, the Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>denied she threatened the complaining witness but said she pleaded guilty because her counsel advised her the felony charge would be reduced to a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, finding that its sentence was \u201cfair and reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d The Defendant appealed the court\u2019s order filed on November 27,1992, denying her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Both appeals were consolidated for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">On appeal, our review is a limited one. A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in imposing a sentence. <em>State v. Valera, </em>74 Haw. 424, 435, 848 P.2d 376, 381 (1993). \u201cThe applicable standard of review in sentencing matters is whether the court committed a plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its decision.\u201d <em>State v. Fry, </em>61 Haw. 226, 231, 602 P.2d 13, 17 (1979). \u201c[F]actors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant\u2019s contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under HRS \u00a7 706-624(2) (Supp. 1992), the court \u201cmay provide, as [one of the] further conditions of a sentence of probation . . . that the defendant: (a) serve a term of imprisonment . . . not exceeding six months in misdemeanor cases.\u201d Hence, the seven-day term of imprisonment was a condition well within the discretion accorded the sentencing court by statute. Where a defendant pleads guilty with full knowledge of the court\u2019s authority to impose an indeterminate term of imprisonment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>court\u2019s imposition of imprisonment does not ordinarily constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u201cDeprivation of liberty\u201d may be imposed as a condition of a sentence to the extent that it is \u201creasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section 706-606(2) [HRS]____\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-624(2). The factors to be considered by the court under HRS \u00a7 706-606(2) include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense. HRS \u00a7 706-606 (Supp. 1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Defendant claims that in imposing sentence, the trial court failed to give proper weight to her denial of wrongful conduct. Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree here, involves the threat, by word or conduct, of bodily injury to another person. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 707-715 (1985), 707-717 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The Defendant did not contest the charge. She entered her guilty plea in writing and orally in open court with full knowledge that she was subject to a maximum indeterminate sentence of one year, and that the State could argue for imprisonment. These matters were reflected on the Guilty Plea form. Further, the court considered the argument of counsel, the statements of the Defendant and letters in support of the Defendant. At the hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence, the transcript indicates that the court stated, \u201cThe court has carefully considered this matter. I do appreciate the letters of support and the information that Mr. Taylor [Defendant\u2019s counsel] has presented, however, the court will deny the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Considering the nature of the offense and the circumstances presented by the record, we hold that a seven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related to the factors set forth in HRS \u00a7 706-606. The weight to be given the factors set forth in HRS \u00a7 706-606 in imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of each case. A sentencing court is \u201cafforded wide latitude in the selection of penalties from those prescribed and in the determination of their severity.\u201d <em>State v. Murray, </em>63 Haw. 12, 25, 621 P.2d 334, 342 (1980). Thus, \u201c[a] sentencing court exercises a broad discretion in deciding whether to impose a prison term <em>...\" State v. Kicklighter, </em>60 Haw. 314, 316, 588 P.2d 929, 931 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The court did not act arbitrarily or capriciously, nor did it rigidly refuse to consider the Defendant\u2019s contentions. There was no plain and manifest abuse of its sentencing discretion. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court entered on August 28, 1992 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>November 27, 1992 order of the circuit court denying Defendant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration or Reduction of Sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ag0\"><em>Dwight C.

I know that the court has not promised me leniency.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 35 provides that a motion for correction or reduction of sentence made within ninety days after the imposition of sentence is timely and the filing of a notice of appeal shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain such motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> We are not faced with a motion to withdraw guilty plea or with the question of whether a guilty plea accompanied by a denial of guilt may be accepted. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25 (1970). The sole ground for appeal is the reasonableness of the condition of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> HRS \u00a7 706-606 in its entirety, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.
