The court sentenced Corpuz to five years\u2019incarceration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The circuit court unlawfully used the \u201cstruck jury\u201d method to impanel the jury. <em>State v. Shiroma, </em>9 Haw. App. 578, 855 P.2d 34, <em>cert. denied, </em>74 Haw. 652, 857 P.2d 600 (1993). Corpuz, however, did not object to the method used to impanel the jury. Corpuz contends that the trial court\u2019s use of the \u201cstruck jury\u201d method of selection was plain error. We disagree. As we stated in <em>Shiroma, </em>absent a showing that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings or defendant\u2019s substantial rights, a trial court\u2019s use of the \u201cstruck jury\u201d method of impaneling a jury is not plain error. Corpuz did not make the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Corpuz contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree (TT2), HRS \u00a7 707-717 (1985), was plain error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">HRS \u00a7 701-109(5) (1985) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">The court is not obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">With respect to terroristic threatening, the relevant HRS provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u00a7707-715 Terroristic threatening, defined. A person commits the offense of terroristic threatening if he threatens, by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to another person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>serious damage to property of another or to commit a felony:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">(1) With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">HRS \u00a7 707-715 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u00a7707-716 Terroristic threatening in the first degree.

Corpuz and Rafael Caguioa (Rafael), who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>with Corpuz when the alleged crime occurred, testified in Corpuz\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Kimberly testified in substance as follows. On July 29, 1991, she picked up Jason from work and drove home. Their four-year-old niece was with them. As Kimberly was parking the car makai (ocean side) of Kuakini Street near Lanakila Avenue, Kimberly and Jason noticed two boys sitting on a chair in an empty lot across the street, mauka (mountain side) of Kuakini Street, staring at them. At trial, she identified one of the boys as Corpuz. As was typical, Kimberly, Jason, and their niece crossed the street and proceeded to walk through the empty lot on their way home.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At some point, while walking through the lot, Jason asked one of the boys, \u201cwhat are you guys staring at.\u201d Kimberly was walking away with her niece when Corpuz then responded to Jason, \u201coh why. You have a problem.\u201d Jason stood there as Corpuz walked up to him and picked up two rocks. Jason was carrying a lunch can. Corpuz said something to Jason, but Kimberly could not hear what was said. Jason then began to walk away and Corpuz followed him. Corpuz was about four feet away from Jason when Corpuz dropped the rocks and pulled out a butterfly knife, which Kimberly described as being silver and, with the blade open, about ten inches long. Corpuz opened the blade and told Jason, \u201coh, you want me to kill you now.\u201d Corpuz held out the knife, but did not make any stabbing motions. Jason said, \u201coh, no! No! No!,\u201d and ran to the house. Kimberly then called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Jason\u2019s testimony basically corroborated Kimberly\u2019s story with slight differences. Jason could not remember whether Corpuz said anything to him after Corpuz picked up the rocks. Also, Jason recounted that, after Corpuz pulled out the knife, which Jason described as a silver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>butterfly knife approximately eleven inches long when opened, Jason ran to a construction area located next door to his house. There, he picked up a two-by-four piece of wood approximately two and one-half feet long. However, he then dropped it because Corpuz and his companion had run away. Jason did not specify whether Corpuz and his companion left before he reached the construction area or after he picked up the two-by-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The testimony of Corpuz and Rafael differed from Kimberly\u2019s and Jason\u2019s. Corpuz testified that he was waiting with a companion for their friend to come home so they could go to the beach. Jason came up to them, face red and drunk, and said, \u201cWhat you guys looking at,\u201d along with some \u201cF words.\u201d Jason was carrying a cooler in his right hand and a beer can in his left. While Kimberly walked away, Jason turned toward them. Corpuz stood up and picked up two rocks to protect himself because he thought Jason was going to throw the beer at him. Jason said that he did not want any trouble. Corpuz explained what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[Corpuz]: ... I when drop one rock. So I pick up my \u2014 I put my left hand in my back pocket, grab the knife and show \u2019em.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">[Defense Counsel]: ... Now, that knife, when you say you took it out of your pocket, what did you do with it, if anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">A. I was just showing it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">Q. Okay, now this knife, it has a blade, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">Q. Did you show the blade?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">Q. Did you keep the knife open or closed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>A. Closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">Q. Why did you do that? Why did you show him the knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">A. \u2019cauz I was scared, you know, I was scared. I was scared. It\u2019s the first time a man came up to us and he was all drunk. I protect myself. Self-defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Q. Now, when you say that the man said no, I don\u2019t want any trouble, why did you have to take out the knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">A. \u2019cauz he\u2019s just like he make troubles still, you know. He just walking back and running. So just keep walking. I take three step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">Q. Towards him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">Q. Okay. Why did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">A. Because . . . [h]e had a beer can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">Q. In his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-17\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-18\">A. He start calling me out. He said Come on! Come on! Come on, chicken. So, I just was keep on walking to him. And he went to his house pick up a two by four and start pounding on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-19\">Q. Okay. And what was he doing when he was pounding it on the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-20\">A. Was saying Come on! Come on! Then I tell my friend Rafael told me let\u2019s go so we left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">Corpuz denied having said anything to Jason or threatening him in any way. When asked to respond to Kimberly\u2019s and Jason\u2019s testimony about the staring, Corpuz explained, \u2018You sit one place you just looking around, you know, whose coming or thought that was our friend because my car always park the car across the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Rafael testified that he and Corpuz were waiting for a friend in the empty lot when Jason, yelling with a beer can in one hand and a cooler in the other, approached them and challenged Corpuz to a fight. Corpuz picked up two rocks and Jason ran to the construction site. Corpuz then dropped the rocks, pulled out his knife, and held it without showing the blade. Corpuz chased after Jason, who by then had picked up a stick and was waving his hand toward Corpuz calling Corpuz over to fight, and saying, \u201ccome on! Come on!\u201d Corpuz did nothing. Rafael then told Corpuz to leave and they ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">TT2 can be an offense included in TT1. See State v. <em>Nakachi, </em>7 Haw. App. 28, 31, 742 P.2d 388, 391 (1987). The question is whether there was a rational basis in the record to acquit Corpuz of TT1 and convict him of TT2. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 701-109(5); <em>State v. Kupau, </em>10 Haw. App. 503 (1994), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>76 Hawai'i 387, 879 P.2d 492 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Corpuz contends there was a rational basis in the record for the jury to decide that, although Corpuz made a terroristic threat, he did not do so with a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d as defined in HRS \u00a7 707-700. Corpuz points to Jason\u2019s testimony that Corpuz \u201cnever made any stabbing motions with the knife nor swung the knife in a slashing motion,\u201d and both defense witnesses\u2019 testimony that Corpuz \u201conly took a closed knife out of his pocket.\u201d Thus, Corpuz argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Should the jury have chosen to believe the defense version of the facts, it could have logically concluded that the manner in which Corpuz used or intended to use the knife, i.e., simply holding it while it was closed, was not known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. From this conclusion, the jury would have found that there was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>to show that a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d was used, and thus would have acquitted Corpuz of Iferroristic Threatening in the First Degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">A \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d is statutorily defined as any weapon or instrument, \u201cwhich in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Corpuz\u2019s interpretation is that a closed knife used or intended to be used only to make a terroristic threat is not a dangerous instrument because it is not known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. In our view, Corpuz\u2019s interpretation ignores the words \u201cor is intended to be used[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Our interpretation is that, in the terroristic threatening context, an instrument is a dangerous instrument, as defined in HRS \u00a7 707-700, when it is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury when used in the manner it is threatened to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Legislative history supports our interpretation. The House Committee Report states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">Your Committee feels that although words rather than actual physical harm are involved, the psychological trauma resulting from such threats and the possibility that harm may actually occur justifies criminal prosecution. More severe penalties should be instituted when . . . dangerous weapons or explosives are used in connection therewith because the mere presence of a weapon in the possession of the offender is traumatic in itself and would present an imminent danger to the victim. There is a likelihood that in the event the victim resisted to the demands or threats of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the offender, the offender may elect to utilize the weapon.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AP3\"><em>Joyce K.

It reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u00a7134-51 Deadly weapons; prohibitions; penalty, (a) Any person, not authorized by law, who carries concealed upon the person\u2019s self or within any vehicle... or who is found armed with any . . . butterfly knife . . .or other deadly or dangerous weapon shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be immediately arrested without warrant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">HRS \u00a7 134-51 (Comp. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s April 27, 1992 judgment convicting Corpuz of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, HRS \u00a7 707-716(l)(d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
