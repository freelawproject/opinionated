We reverse both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Defendant George M. Matyas (Matyas) was arrested for threatening a law enforcement officer with what appeared to be a gun. A search of Matyas\u2019 home resulted in the recovery of both a real gun and a toy gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On October 10,1990, a grand jury indicted Matyas for having committed the following two offenses on June 17, 1989: Count I, Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree with the use of a dangerous instrument, a class C felony, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-716(l)(d) (Supp. 1992); and Count II, Place to Keep Pistol or Revolver, a class C felony. HRS \u00a7 134-6(a) and (c) (Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">HRS Chapter 853 (1985 and Supp. 1992) states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">853-1 Deferred acceptance of guilty plea or nolo contendere plea; discharge and dismissal, expungement of records, (a) Upon proper motion as provided by this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">(1) When a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or nolo contendere, prior to commencement of trial, to a felony, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">(2) It appears to the court that the defendant is not likely again to engage in a criminal course of conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(3) The ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">the court, without accepting the plea of nolo contendere or entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the defendant and after considering the recommendations, if any, of the prosecutor, may defer further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">(b) The proceedings may be deferred upon any of the conditions specified by section 706-624. The court may defer the proceedings for such period of time as the court shall direct but in no case to exceed the maximum sentence allowable unless the defendant has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a petty misdemeanor, in which case the court may defer the proceedings for a period not to exceed one year. The defendant may be subject to bail or recognizance at the court\u2019s discretion during the period during which the proceedings are deferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">(c) Upon the defendant\u2019s completion of the period designated by the court and in compliance with the terms and conditions established, the court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the charge against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">(d) Discharge of the defendant and dismissal of the charge against the defendant under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt, shall eliminate any civil admission of guilt, and is not a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">(e) Upon discharge of the defendant and dismissal of the charge against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>under this section, the defendant may apply for expungement not less than one year following discharge, pursuant to section 831-3.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">853-4 Chapter not applicable when. This chapter shall not apply when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\"><em>(9) A </em>firearm was used in the commission of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Under the October 10,1990 Indictment, Matyas was not eligible for an HRS Chapter 853 deferred acceptance of a guilty plea (DAGP) because HRS \u00a7 853-4(9) forbids DAGPs when a firearm was used in the commission of the offense charged. Matyas, however, contended that he used a fake gun, not a firearm. His position was that he was guilty of the lesser-included offense of Second Degree Terroristic Threatening, a misdemeanor, HRS \u00a7 707-717. Prior to the July 1991 trial (first trial), Matyas offered to settle both counts by pleading guilty to Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree. The prosecutor, however, rejected this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">On August 7, 1991, a jury found Matyas not guilty of Place to Keep Pistol or Revolver, deadlocked on Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, and found Matyas guilty of the lesser-included offense of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree. Matyas\u2019 conviction of the lesser-included offense automatically acquitted him of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree. <em>State v. Feliciano, </em>62 Haw. 637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980); <em>State v. Ferreira, </em>8 Haw. App. 1, 791 P.2d 407, <em>cert. denied, </em>71 Haw. 668, 833 P.2d 901 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Matyas immediately moved for a new trial, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 635-56 (1985) and Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 33. The former permits the court to \u201cgrant a new trial for any legal cause\u201d and the latter permits the court to \u201cgrant a new trial... if required in the interest of justice.\u201d Matyas promised that if his motion were granted he would plead guilty to Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree and move for a DAGP. On October 25, 1991, the circuit court orally granted a one-year DAGP. The Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Motion for a New Trial was subsequently entered on March 18, 1992. In reaching its decision, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">This Court presided oyer the trial of this matter. And as I may have indicated on the record earlier, it\u2019s my view that although the defendant had no burden whatsoever at the trial that, in fact, the evidence adduced at the trial established by at least a preponderance of the evidence if not beyond a reasonable doubt that the item that the defendant held in his car in his hand at the time of the incident was a toy gun rather than a real one. This isn\u2019t to say that the grand jury did not have probable cause to indict Mr. Matyas. I think we\u2019re all agreed that it did, that on the basis of the testimony of the complaining witness, if believed,..., a reasonable grand jury could clearly have found probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed, specifically, Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree and that Mr. Matyas committed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">If I remember correctly, [Defense Counsel] moved orally for judgments of acquittal both at the close of the State\u2019s case and at the close of all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the evidence. And the court denied those motions based upon the grounds that in the Court\u2019s view a reasonable trier of fact could conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the record before it. So the view that I\u2019m expressing regarding what the evidence did or did not establish is my own personal view which I am not entitled to impute to.the jury inasmuch as I wasn\u2019t the trier of fact at the trial of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">But for purposes of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial I am entitled to exercise my own judgment regarding the state of the record and the weight of the evidence. And it\u2019s my own personal view that the evidence established at least by a preponderance that Mr. Matyas was guilty at most of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree and not of the offense charged inasmuch as a firearm was not present in his car at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">This Court does not believe that the cases cited by the State delineate exhaustively the circumstances under which a Rule 33 motion for new trial may be granted. By the plain language of the rule a motion for new trial can be granted in the interests of justice. Mr. Matyas vigorously sought to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree prior to trial in order to avoid the very dilemma which we all face at this point. The State was entitled to decline to consent to the entry of that plea. And the State did so, and we went to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">The jury reached the result that the defendant was willing to admit to prior to trial. In this Court\u2019s view it would be contrary to the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of justice not to accord the defendant an opportunity for deferral of an adjudication of guilt as to the offense of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">10/25/91 Tr. at 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">HRPP Rule 33, which is modeled after Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) Rule 33, provides that the standard for granting new trials is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d According to Professor Wright, Rule 33 \u201crecognizes the traditional principle that the trial court has broad powers to grant a new trial if for any reason it concludes that the trial has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d 3 C. Weight, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal 2d \u00a7 551 at 236-37 (1982). Despite this broad authority, however, \u201cmotions [for new trials] are not favored and new trials are to be granted with caution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">In Matyas\u2019 case, this was the situation: (1) the defendant was indicted for two offenses at least one of which did not permit a DAGP; (2) prior to the first trial the defendant offered to settle both counts by pleading guilty to one lesser-included offense that permitted a DAGP and to seek a DAGP; (3) the prosecutor opposed a DAGP and declined to reduce the indictment charge; (4) at the first trial, the jury found the defendant not guilty of one count and acquitted him of the other by finding him guilty of the lesser-included offense to which he had offered to plead guilty; (5) the defendant moved for a new trial so as to permit him to plead guilty to the lesser-included offense and seek a DAGP; (6) over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion, and entered a DAGP.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Matyas wanted his motion for a new trial to be granted, but he did not want a new trial. He was happy with, and took full advantage of, the verdict of the first trial. His only disagreement with the first trial was the fact that it occurred. He was unhappy with the prosecutor\u2019s pre-first trial refusal to reduce the indictment charge and to agree to a DAGP. Immediately after his motion for a new trial was granted and the first trial\u2019s guilty verdict was set aside, he pled guilty to the same offense. In other words, Matyas and the court used the jury\u2019s lesser\u2014 included offense verdict and HRPP Rule 33 to avoid the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to reduce the indictment charges and authorize the court to accept Matyas\u2019 DAGP to the reduced charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In Hawafi, DAGPs are authorized by HRS \u00a7 853 \u2014 1(a)(1). The first question is whether HRS \u00a7 853-l(a)( 1) authorized the circuit court to enter a DAGP. The answer is no. Under HRS \u00a7 853-l(a)( 1), the defendant is not eligible for a DAGP unless the defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or nolo contendere \u201cprior to commencement of trial....\u201d When this requirement was inserted by Act 147 in 1979, the reason was expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">Your Committee received testimony that many individuals have caused the State to proceed through an entire trial and, subsequent to the presentation of the defense case, enter a plea of guilty and ask for and receive a DAG plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">Your Committee finds that allowing DAG pleas only prior to trial would certainly eliminate a considerable amount of extra costs and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>provide for a more meaningful plea bargaining . arrangement. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 671, in 1979 House Journal, at 1476-77.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">Your Committee is of the distinct view that the DAG plea should not be available to the person who is convinced of his own guilt, but who would like to chance a trial to see if he can \u201cget away with it\u201d and who would use the DAG plea at the very last minute when that wrongful hope has been dispelled. We expect that our criminal justice system will have availed every accused sufficient time to obtain counsel or otherwise evaluate his circumstances prior to commencement of trial. With such commencement begins the imposition upon witnesses and the court, and the accrual of public expense for the cost of trial. Accordingly, we feel it is proper that the availability of the DAG plea should terminate with the commencement of trial when the prosecution presents its first witness. We also think that specifying a deadline after which the DAG plea will cease to be available will have the salutary effect of inducing a reasonable timetable for plea bargaining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 855, in 1979 Senate Journal, at 1384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Matyas did not plead guilty or nolo contendere prior to commencement of the first trial. He pled guilty prior to commencement of the new trial. We conclude that, in the light of its purpose, HRS \u00a7 853-l(a)(l)\u2019s requirement that defendant plead guilty \u201cprior to commencement of trial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>means that it be done prior to commencement of the first trial. Matyas\u2019 plea of guilty after the first trial and before the new trial did not satisfy that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The second question is whether HRS \u00a7 635-56 and HRPP Rule 33 authorized the circuit court to grant Matyas\u2019 motion for a new trial. HRS \u00a7 635-56 states in relevant part that \u201cthe court may in any... criminal case grant a new trial for any legal cause.\u201d HRPP Rule 33 states in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court on motion of a defendant may grant a new trial to him if required in the interest of justice.\u201d HRPP Rule 33 is applied when the prior trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 3 C. Wright, <em>supra, </em>at 237. It is typically used to correct errors that have occurred in the conduct of the trial or proceedings. Having decided that the circuit court was not authorized to enter a DAGP, we conclude that the circuit court was not authorized to grant Matyas\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">When a HRPP Rule 33 motion for a new trial asks for a jury\u2019s guilty verdict to be set aside and for a new trial to allow the defendant to request a DAGP that the circuit court is statutorily not authorized to enter, the cause is neither legal nor in the interest of justice. In Matyas\u2019 case, the first trial did not result in a miscarriage of justice and a new trial cannot achieve the result he sought in his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In essence, Matyas appeals (1) the legislature\u2019s decision not to allow DAGPs unless the defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or nolo contendere prior to commencement of trial and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s decision, prior to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>trial, not to allow him to settle the indictment charges by pleading guilty to Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree and thereby make him eligible for a DAGP. With respect to (1), Matyas is appealing to the wrong branch of government. With respect to (2), Matyas reasonably did not challenge the valid indictment charges, and it was well within the prosecutor\u2019s allowable discretion to decline to reduce them. <em>State v.

We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b55-10\">CONCURRING OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"AG-\">HEEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">I concur in the reasoning and the result of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">However, I believe that the opinion should go further and issue a clear admonition to the trial courts of this jurisdiction to refrain from abusing their discretion by crossing the boundary demarking the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive branch. In my view, that is what the trial court did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>As the majority points out, the motion for a new trial serves a specific function. It allows the trial court \u201cto correct its own errors, or <em>errors that have occurred in the conduct of the trial or proceedings, </em>without the delay, expense, inconvenience, or other hardship of an appeal[.]\u201d 66 C.J.S. <em>New Trial </em>\u00a7 1(b) (1950) (emphasis added and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In this case, there was no trial error to correct, and Defendant suffered no injustice from the trial. Instead, the motion was used by the Defendant, with the court\u2019s concurrence, to correct a perceived injustice by the prosecutor in refusing the plea bargain proffered by Defendant before the first trial. The motion was misused, and the result was a clear invasion of the prosecutor\u2019s turf.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Trial courts should always keep in mind that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">[a] county attorney or district attorney is the representative of the State in criminal prosecutions. As such, he or she controls criminal prosecutions. It is the county or district attorney who has the authority to dismiss any charge or to reduce any charge. The prosecuting attorney has broad discretion in discharging his or her duty. The scope of this discretion extends to the power to investigate and to determine who shall be prosecuted and what crimes shall be charged. The prosecuting attorney has discretion to dismiss charges, and the court cannot refuse to allow a dismissal. Similarly, the court cannot restrain a prosecutor from prosecuting an action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\"><em>State v. Williamson, </em>253 Kan. 163, 165-66, 853 P.2d 56, 58 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">In using the new trial motion to correct the prosecutor\u2019s alleged abuse of discretion in declining the plea bargain, the trial court grossly abused its own discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
