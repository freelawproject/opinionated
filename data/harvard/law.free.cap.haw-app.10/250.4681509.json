Smith (Jerald) and Kathleen Smith (Kathleen), husband and wife (collectively Plaintiffs where appropriate), appeal from summary judgments (Judgments) entered in favor of Defendant-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of the Royal Kahana (Association) on December 12, 1991, and Defendant-Appellee Chaney Brooks Realty, Inc., dba Chaney Brooks &amp; Co. (Chaney), Royal Kahana Condominiums\u2019 (RKC) \u201cmanaging agent\u201d for \u201cfiscal affairs\u201d (collectively Defendants where appropriate) on January 2, 1992. We vacate both Judgments and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">On November 23, 1987, Jerald was hired as RKC\u2019s assistant manager on Maui by Thomas Jewell (Jewell), RKC\u2019s resident manager. After several months on the job, Jerald, believing that Kathleen was covered by Association\u2019s employees\u2019 medical insurance policy, submitted a bill for her medical treatment and requested payment by Association\u2019s medical insurance carrier. Jerald\u2019s ensuing paycheck, dated July 6, 1988, showed a deduction of $141.08 for \u201cHMSAF\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which had never been withheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>from previous paychecks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Jerald questioned the new resident manager (Jewell\u2019s replacement) about the deduction, Jerald was told to ask Chaney about it. When Jerald contacted Chaney, he was told that Chaney had mistakenly failed to deduct the $141.08 from his previous paychecks for Kathleen\u2019s coverage and that the deductions would be made thereafter. Jerald directed Chaney to cancel the coverage and reimburse him the amount deducted. On July 15, 1988, Jerald\u2019s employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On August 5, 1991, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging that Jerald had contracted with Defendants to be RKC\u2019s assistant manager, and that Defendants had unlawfully conspired to deprive him of the benefits of his employment \u201cin retaliation for his inquiry into a paycheck deduction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">On November 4,1991, and November 6,1991, respectively, Association and Chaney filed separate motions for summary judgment. Association claimed that Jerald\u2019s employment was terminable at will and that Jerald was terminated for misconduct, insubordination, and unsatisfactory work performance. Chaney asserted that (1) it was not Jerald\u2019s employer and therefore was not liable for any injury Jerald suffered from his discharge; and (2) even if it were Jerald\u2019s employer, Jerald\u2019s employment was terminable at will and his discharge did not fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>limitations on an employer\u2019s power to discharge such an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In opposing the motions, Jerald submitted his affidavit and transcripts of his tape recorded conversations with a Chaney employee and RKC\u2019s resident manager. The telephone conversations occurred shortly after Jerald\u2019s termination and indicated that Jerald was discharged because he did not \u201cgo through the [proper] chain of command\u201d and because he had inquired about the payroll deduction. Although the statements in the telephone conversations are hearsay, Rule 801, Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE), Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 626 (1985), we deem them to be admissible under Rule 803(a)(2)(B), HRE.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">After a hearing, the lower court entered orders (Orders) granting both motions; the Judgments followed. In almost identical language, the Orders concluded that Jerald\u2019s employment was terminable at will and that he \u201ccould be terminated or discharged with or without cause.\u201d Additionally, the Orders stated that \u201c[e]ven assuming that [Jerald] was terminated solely due to his inquiry with regard to payroll deductions, [Jerald\u2019s] alleged reason for termination does not violate a clear mandate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>public policy. No exception to the termination at will doctrine is applicable to [Jerald]\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Appellate review of a lower court\u2019s decision granting a summary judgment motion is governed by the same standard as that employed by the trial court. <em>Beamer v. Nishiki, </em>66 Haw. 572, 670 P.2d 1264 (1983). The question is whether, after thoroughly reviewing the record and considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, no genuine issue of material fact exists, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Arimizu v. Financial Sec. Ins. Co., </em>5 Haw. App. 106, 679 P.2d 627 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">On appeal, Jerald argues that the lower court erred in concluding that his discharge did not violate the public policy underlying HRS Chapter 388 (1985 and Supp. 1992). Jerald asserts that (1) Chapter 388\u2019s purpose is to supply the employee with the information necessary to determine if the employer is fully compensating the employee; (2) in accordance with Chapter 388\u2019s policy, he had the right to inquire into the accuracy of his paycheck deductions; and (3) his discharge violated the statute\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Chaney and Association argue that Jerald waived the public policy question because he did not raise it in the lower court. However, Jerald\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the summary judgment motions did discuss Chapter 388\u2019s provisions, and the transcript of the motions hearing indicates that Jerald\u2019s counsel asked the court to examine the provisions of \u201c388-1.\u201d Moreover, the court\u2019s oral statement at the hearing indicates that it clearly understood Jerald\u2019s argument to be that (1) HRS Chapter 388\u2019s legislative policy was to enable employees to inquire about their payroll deductions and (2) Jerald\u2019s discharge violated that policy. The record is sufficient to preserve the question for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We reject Chaney\u2019s argument that Jerald has challenged only the lower court\u2019s oral findings and not the \u2022Orders or the Judgments. Jerald\u2019s notice of appeal and opening brief clearly state that he challenges both Orders and both Judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Association argues that Jerald\u2019s opening brief fails to assert that any genuine issues of material fact exist in this case. However, the briefs and the record show that the reason for Jerald\u2019s discharge is a genuine issue of material fact. Notably, Association\u2019s answering brief states: \u201cDefendants-Appellees do not admit and contest the fact that JERALD H. SMITH was fired because he questioned the deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In <em>Parnar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 370, 652 P.2d 625 (1982), our supreme court adopted the principle established in <em>Petermann v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>174 Cal. App. 2d 184, 344 P.2d 25 (1959): an employer\u2019s generally unlimited right to discharge an at will employee does not extend to a termination that conflicts with the state\u2019s public policy. Our supreme court, however, carefully specified that this limitation applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to a discharge that violates a \u201cclear mandate of public policy.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">In determining whether a clear mandate of public policy is violated, courts should inquire whether the employer\u2019s conduct contravenes the letter or purpose of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision or scheme. Prior judicial decisions may also establish the relevant public policy. However, courts should proceed cautiously if called upon to declare public policy absent some prior legislative or judicial expression oil the subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Parnar </em>at 380, 652 P.2d at 631.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">The term \u201cpublic policy\u201d is inherently not subject to precise definition ... By \u201cpublic policy\u201d <em>is intended that principle of law which holds that no citizen can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public </em>good\\_.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">(Emphasis in original.) S. Ichinose, <em>Hawaii\u2019s Supreme Court Recognizes Tort of Retaliatory Discharge of an At-Will Employee, </em>XVII Haw. B. J., Vol. 2, 123, 124 n.16 (1982) (quoting <em>Petermann, </em>174 Cal. App. 2d at 188, 344 P.2d at 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Those courts that have adopted the public policy exception have applied it to actions against an employer by an at will employee who was discharged for: (1) refusing to commit an unlawful act, such as refusing to give false testimony at a trial or administrative hearing; (2) performing an important public obligation, such as jury duty, whistle blowing, or refusing to violate a profes sional code of ethics; and (3) exercising a statutory right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>privilege, such as filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim. D. Perry, <em>Deterring Egregious Violations of Public Policy: A Proposed Amendment to the Model Employment Termination Act, </em>67 Wash. L. Rev. 915, 917\u201418 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Citing <em>Hew-Len v. F. W. Woolworth, </em>737 F. Supp. 1104 (D. Haw. 1990), and <em>Lapinad v. Pacific Oldsmobile-GMC, Inc., </em>679 F. Supp. 991 (D. Haw. 1988), Association argues that, regardless of the policy underlying HRS Chapter 388, Jerald is limited to the statutory remedies provided by that chapter and cannot recover in a common law action for wrongful discharge. Association contends that HRS \u00a7\u00a7 388-10 and -11 provide exclusive remedies that preclude Jerald\u2019s action here. However, Association\u2019s reliance on <em>Hew-Len </em>and <em>Lapinad </em>is misplaced because those cases involved HRS Chapter 378, this state\u2019s employment discrimination statute. The court in those cases held that Chapter 378\u2019s provisions afforded a sufficient remedy for wrongful discharge, thus barring the employee\u2019s resort to the common law action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As a general rule, the common law remedy for wrongful discharge is precluded only when the statutory provision relied upon as a bar to the action provides a sufficient remedy in itself, making the creation of an additional common law remedy unnecessary. <em>See Jones v. Industrial Electric-Seattle, </em>53 Wash. App. 536, 768 P.2d 520 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Our supreme court has generally recognized that a statutory remedy is \u201cmerely cumulative and does not abolish an existing common law remedy unless so declared in express terms or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Watson v. Brown, </em>67 Haw. 252, 256, 686 P.2d 12, 15 (1984). Our appellate courts have not had a prior occasion to apply that precept to a wrongful discharge action; however, the courts of other jurisdictions have done so. In those courts, the decision has turned on the legislative intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thus, in <em>Lally v. Copygraphics, </em>85 N.J. 668, 428 A.2d 1317 (1981), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the state\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation statute did not preclude an employee from pursuing the common law remedy, stating that \u201c[i]f the Legislature had wanted to foreclose a judicial cause of action, it would have done so expressly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 428 A.2d at 1319. Similarly, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that remedies contained in an anti-discrimination statute did not, by design or by default, abrogate the common law remedies, since both the statute and its legislative history were devoid of any evidence of legislative intent to supersede the common law wrongful discharge remedy. <em>Holien v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>66 Or. App. 911, 677 P.2d 704 (1984). <em>See also Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc., </em>74 Ill. 2d 172, 384 N.E.2d 353 (1978). California, however, has held that its Labor Code supersedes common law relief for wrongful discharge because the code established (1) a specific forum for the trial and determination of all matters under the code; and (2) a comprehensive system for relief, including reinstatement, lost wages, and work benefits. <em>Portillo v. G.T. Price Products, Inc., </em>131 Cal. App. 3d 285, 182 Cal.Rptr. 291 (1982). The Washington appellate court reached the same conclusion in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In accordance with the principles illustrated by those cases, it is our view that HRS Chapter 388 (1) establishes a clear mandate of public policy to protect an at will employee from being discharged for asserting the rights accorded him by its provisions; and (2) does not itself provide a sufficient remedy for such a discharge. Additionally, we do not detect a legislative intent in Chapter 388 to supersede an at will employee\u2019s common law remedy for wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In <em>Arimizu, </em>we stated that the purpose of Part I of HRS Chapter 388 is to require that an employer pay his employees at least twice each calendar month. An obvious further purpose of Chapter 388 is to require the employer to accurately inform the employee of the compensation due and pay that amount in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The law ensures compliance by (1) only allowing payroll deductions authorized by federal or state statute, by court process, or by written authorization from the employee (HRS \u00a7 388-6); and (2) requiring the employer to provide the employee with a written record listing the employee\u2019s gross earnings, deductions, net compensation, and date of payment (HRS \u00a7 388-7(4)). The statute also requires the employer to retain for six years a copy of the record furnished to the employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The clearly established policy of Chapter 388 is to ensure that the employee is fully compensated and has available to him or her all the records necessary to accurately determine that full payment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In our view, discharging an at will employee for inquiring into the nature of and basis for the deductions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the employer made from the employee\u2019s gross compensation would violate the clear mandate of Chapter 388\u2019s policy. Allowing the employer to discharge an employee who requests further information regarding apparently questionable deductions would effectively insulate the employer from the statute\u2019s requirements and sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Although HRS \u00a7\u00a7 388-10 and -11 provide the employee with remedies for the employer\u2019s failure to fully compensate the employee, their terms dn not provide relief for an employee discharged for attempting to assert his or her rights under the statute. Instead, the statute authorizes the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) to enforce Chapter 388 through (1) administrative investigations and hearings; or (2) specific actions for penalties or for an injunction to halt the employer\u2019s business operation until he satisfies any judgment for unpaid wages (\u00a7 388-9). Further, the employer is civilly liable to the employee for unpaid wages (\u00a7 388-10(a)); and may incur criminal penalties (\u00a7 388-10(b)). An employee is authorized to sue for unpaid wages (\u00a7 388-ll(a)); and certain categories of employees may assign their claims for unpaid wages to the Director for collection (\u00a7 388-ll(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Clearly, Chapter 388 provides remedies when an employer fails to pay an employee in full. Just as clearly, Chapter 388 does not, in itself, provide any remedy to an employee who has been discharged in retaliation for seeking to enforce his rights under the statute. Additionally, we find no legislative intent in Chapter 388 to supersede the common law remedy of wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Accordingly, since the reason for Jerald\u2019s discharge is disputed, a genuine issue of material fact exists, and the lower court erred when it concluded that Jerald\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>discharge fell outside the limitations to the discharge at will rule.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab2\"><em>Matthew N.
