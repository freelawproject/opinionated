White (White) appeals the district court\u2019s March 17, 1992 decision finding him guilty of Theft in the Fourth Degree, Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 708-833(1) (Supp. 1992). On May 12,1992, White was sentenced to pay a $100 fine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">Nelson Miller (Miller), a store detective at the Princeville Foodland Supermarket (PFS), testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>on November 15, 1991, White entered PFS with Ladonia Gouveia (Gouveia). Gouveia was carrying a blue purse with a drawstring. Miller saw Gouveia go to the cigarette rack, remove four packs of cigarettes, and proceed to the liquor department. At the liquor department, White removed a bottle of \u201cRamie Martin (phonetic spelling)\u201d Cognac, gave the bottle to Gouveia, and Gouveia put it into her blue bag. White and Gouveia then went to the front of PFS, met up with Gouveia\u2019s daughter, bypassed two operational cash registers, and exited PFS without making any attempt to pay for the merchandise concealed in Gouveia\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">White testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">A. I went into the store with two or three other people. They was shopping their way and I was just kinda wandering around. They was at the checkout stand and I was over by the camera department looking at the stuff they had there. And then when I got ready to leave the store, I was arrested, handcuffed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Transcript, March 17, 1992 at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">At defense counsel\u2019s request, the district court took judicial notice that Gouveia pled guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">White contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the judgment. Specifically, he argues that the evidence did not prove his intent. We disagree. HRS \u00a7 702-222 (1985) states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(1) With the intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(b) Aids ... or attempts to aid the other person in ... committing it[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The Hawaii Supreme Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">since intent can rarely be proved by direct evidence, proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the act is sufficient to establish the requisite intent. Thus, the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACP\"><em>State v. Sadino, </em>64 Haw. 427, 430, 642 P.2d 534, 536-37 (1982) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, <em>State v. </em>Tripp, 71 Haw. 479, 795 P.2d 280 (1990), the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that White intended to promote or facilitate a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">White contends that the district court erroneously denied his Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal which he made at the close of the evidence offered by the prosecution. Based on our decisions stated in section 1 above, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">The State contends that White waived his right to challenge the denial of his motion when he introduced evidence after his motion was denied. <em>State v. Halemanu, </em>3 Haw. App. 300, 650 P.2d 587 (1989). The State is wrong. The rule of <em>Halemanu </em>applies in jury trials. It does not apply in jury-waived trials. 2 Wright, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Criminal </em>2d \u00a7 469 at p. 673 (1982).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHd\"><em>Stephen M.

Kea, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, County of Kaua'i, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s May 12, 1992judgment convicting defendant Tim S. White of Theft in the Fourth Degree, HRS \u00a7 708-833(1), and sentencing him to pay a $100 fine.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
