On January 30,1987, after a bench trial, Defend-. ant was convicted on both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 10, 1987, the State filed a motion for imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years for each conviction pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(a) (1985)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Defendant used a gun in committing the offenses, which were part of one episode. On March 25, 1987, the court sentenced Defendant to two concurrent maximum prison terms of 20 years. The court also granted the State\u2019s motion and sentenced Defendant to serve a concurrent mandatory minimum term of ten years on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Defendant appealed his convictions on April 20,1987. On July 15, 1987, Defendant filed a motion for reduction of his sentence, which was denied. The convictions were affirmed by this court in a memorandum opinion filed on October 6,1988 (S. Ct. No. 12142).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On July 6, 1989, Defendant, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a Motion To Correct Illegal Sentence (Motion).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and an order (Order) denying the Motion on April 26,1991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant filed his notice of appeal of the Order on May 23,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">On appeal, Defendant argues that:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">(1) the entire sentence was illegal because the court was not provided with a report of a \u201cpre-sentence correc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tional diagnosis\u201d of Defendant as required by HRS \u00a7 706-601 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991);</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">(2) the mandatory minimum sentence imposed for Count II was illegal because (a) the indictment did not give him notice of the possibility of its imposition, and (b) the sentencing court did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant had used or threatened to use a firearm while committing a felony; and</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">(3) the court erred in not ordering and considering a pre \u2014 sentence correctional diagnosis and report before ruling on his motion for a reduction of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">. We affirm the Order except with respect to the minimum sentence imposed for Count II and remand with instructions to vacate the mandatory minimum sentence imposed for that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">HRS \u00a7 706-600 (1985) requires that all sentences be imposed in accordance with HRS chapter 706. Defendant asserts that the court did not order or receive a presentence correctional diagnosis and report as required by HRS \u00a7 706-601(l)(a) (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, since the information required under HRS \u00a7 706-602 (1985)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was not furnished to the court for its consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>in imposing sentence, the sentences were not imposed in accordance with the provisions of HRS chapter 706, and were illegal. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The record shows that, upon finding Defendant guilty, the trial court \u201creferred [Defendant] to the Adult Probation Division for a pre-sentence report prior to [the sentencing] hearing.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the court stated it had \u201cread and reviewed the pre-sentence report\u201d dated March 11,1987. The record also shows that Defendant was furnished a copy of the report, examined it with his attorney, and made minor corrections to it through his attorney. A copy of the pre-sentence report is attached to Defendant\u2019s \u201cEx Parte Motion For Leave To File Presentence Report\u201d filed on October 30,1991. The report set forth the circumstances of the offense and information on Defendant\u2019s arrest in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on the probation officer\u2019s statement in the first paragraph of the report that the report was \u201cin lieu of a presentence report\u201d because Defendant had refused to furnish any information to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>probation officer. The probation officer\u2019s statement does not affect the substance of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Admittedly, due to Defendant\u2019s recalcitrance, the portion of the report prepared by the probation officer does not contain information regarding Defendant\u2019s \u201cphysical and mental condition, family situation and background, economic status and capacity to make restitution or to make reparation . . ., education, occupation, and personal habits,\u201d as required by HRS \u00a7 706-602. However, the report includes a handwritten letter from Defendant to the probation officer, which provides enough of the missing information to satisfy the statute. In the letter, Defendant set forth, albeit not in great detail, information regarding his family, employment, arrest record, \u201cpresent and future prison life,\u201d and prospects for his future.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Additionally, the report includes a letter from Mr. Wally Inglis, Program Director of the Mental Health Association in Hawaii, which describes Defendant as \u201ca bright, articulate, sensitive person who cares not only for his own well-being, but is also willing to speak up for the rights and needs of those who share his predicament.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In our view, the material presented to the court provided sufficient information for the court to make a reasoned judgment on the proper sentence to be imposed for Defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The pre-sentence report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sufficiently complied with HRS \u00a7 706-602, and HRS chapter 706 was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The indictment\u2019s counts read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">COUNT I: On or about the 13th day of April, 1985, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, ERIC W. SCHROEDER, while in the course of committing theft, and while armed with a dangerous instrument, to wit, a handgun, did threaten the imminent use of force against Phillip M. Richards, a person who was present, with the intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with the property, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the First Degree in violation of Section 708 \u2014 840C l)(b)(ii) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">COUNT II: On or about the 13th day of April, 1985, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, ERIC W. SCHROEDER did intentionally restrain Phillip M. Richards with intent to facilitate the commission of a felony or flight after the commission of a felony, thereby committing the offense of Kidnapping in violation of Section 707-720(l)(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Citing <em>State v. Estrada, </em>69 Haw. 204, 738 P.2d 812 (1987), and <em>State v. Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978), Defendant argues that the mandatory minimum sentence imposed for Count II was illegal because the indictment did not give him fair notice that the charge against him included the use of a handgun, and the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>judge did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that a handgun was used in committing the offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In <em>Estrada, </em>the defendant was convicted of attempted murder, and the State moved for an enhanced sentence under HRS \u00a7 706-606.l(l)(a) on the ground that the defendant\u2019s conviction was for the attempted murder of a police officer on active duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court held the statute applicable and sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">On appeal, the defendant contended that, since the complaint did not charge a violation of HRS \u00a7 706-606.1(l)(a), he never received notice that the statute would be invoked, and the sentence was illegal. He also argued that the applicability of the statute was a fact question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\"><em>Apao </em>required a defendant to have \u201cfair notice of the charges against\u201d him: the aggravating circumstances must be <em>alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Estrada was entitled to due process at his sentencing. Judge Mossman could not make the factual findings that Officer Taguma was on duty when shot. The jury had to but did not determine whether Estrada committed attempted murder and the applicability of HRS \u00a7 706-606.1(l)(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Estrada, </em>69 Haw. at 230, 738 P.2d at 829 (emphasis in original and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In <em>Apao, </em>the indictment charged the defendant with the murder of a person who the defendant knew was a witness in a separate murder prosecution. <em>See generally </em>HRS \u00a7 706-606(a)(ii) (1976).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On appeal from his conviction, the defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the indictment because knowledge of the victim\u2019s status was not an element of the offense, and the allegation was inflammatory and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Although the supreme court agreed that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s status was not an element of the offense, it held that its inclusion did not prejudice the defendant or destroy his presumption of innocence. The supreme court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">the better rule is to include in the indictment the allegations which, if proved, would result in application of a statute enhancing the penalty for the crime committed. This will give defendants fair notice of the charges against them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\"><em>Apao, </em>59 Haw. at 636, 586 P.2d at 258 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\"><em>Estrada </em>went beyond <em>Apao </em>and established an unequivocal rule: a defendant may not be given an enhanced sentence on account of aggravating circumstances pursuant to. a statute providing therefor unless the aggravating circumstances are alleged in the complaint or indictment, and the statute\u2019s applicability has been determined by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>However, the State correctly points out that in <em>State v. Guerrios, </em>7 Haw. App. 424, 774 P.2d 246 (1989), we held that under HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(a) the finding that the defendant used a firearm in committing a felony did not have to be made by the jury; the finding could be made by the sentencing judge. <em>Guerrios </em>applied the two-step process set forth in <em>State v. Huelsman, </em>60 Haw. 71, 588 P.2d 394 (1978), where the supreme court held that in imposing an extended prison term under HRS \u00a7 706-662, the sentencing court must find (1) beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is within the class of offenders to which the statute applies; and (2) in accordance with the requirements of ordinary sentencing, that the extended term of imprisonment is necessary for the public\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In <em>Estrada, </em>the supreme court marked the divergence of <em>Estrada </em>and <em>Huelsman </em>when it noted that <em>Huelsman </em>established \u201cdifferent procedures for sentencing under the multiple offender statutes, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-662 (1985) and 706-664 (1985).\u201d <em>Estrada, </em>69 Haw. at 230, 738 P.2d at 829. However, the supreme court did not state the reasons for the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In our view, the difference is based on the nature of the aggravating circumstances in the two statutes. In <em>Huelsman, </em>the supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">The determination that the defendant is a member of the class of offenders to which the particular subsection of \u00a7 662 applies involves \u201chistorical facts\u201d, the proof of which exposes the defendant to punishment by an extended term sentence, similarly to the manner in which the proof of his guilt exposes him to ordinary sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\"><em>Huelsman, </em>60 Haw. at 79, 588 P.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In contrast, the aggravating circumstances of HRS \u00a7 706-660.1 were considered by the supreme court in <em>Estrada </em>as so enmeshed in the commission of the crime charged that the court stated that those facts <em>must </em>be alleged in the indictment in order to give the defendant notice that they will be relied on to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt, and support the sentence to be imposed, and they must be determined by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The aggravating circumstance in <em>Guerrios, </em>i.e., that a firearm was used in committing a felony, was the type of aggravating circumstance so enmeshed in the commission of the charged offense that it was required to be found by the jury, as in <em>Estrada. </em>In <em>Guerrios, </em>we erroneously followed <em>Huelsman </em>rather than <em>Estrada. </em>Consequently, to the extent that <em>Guerrios </em>is contrary to the opinion we render here, <em>Guerrios </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In this case, also, it is clear that the use of a handgun was a fact enmeshed in the kidnapping. Consequently, <em>Estrada </em>applies. The aggravating circumstance should have been alleged in the indictment and determined by the trier of fact. Since the aggravating circumstance was not alleged in the indictment, the mandatory minimum sentence was illegally imposed and must be vacated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">We reject the State\u2019s argument that the allegation in Count I that a gun was used in the robbery can be deemed as incorporated by reference in Count II pursuant to Rule 7(d), Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (1983). Count II contains no language incorporating or referring to Count I. 41 Am.

This matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate the mandatory minimum sentence imposed in Count II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> In announcing the verdict at the end of trial, the court found that Defendant had not released the kidnapping victim in a safe place prior to trial.
