Walker (Husband) and dismissing Wife\u2019s September 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1990 Complaint for Divorce. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Chronologically listed, the relevant events occurred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">1971 Husband joined the United States Air Force.</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">November 4, 1976 Husband and Wife were married.</p>\n<p id=\"AiP\">April 6, 1977 Daughter Tina was born.</p>\n<p id=\"AK0\">October 13, 1979 Daughter Patricia was bom.</p>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">February 1983 The Air Force assigned Husband to Hawaii. Husband, Wife, and daughters moved to Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"AcT\">December 12,1985 Husband filed his Complaint for Divorce in Hawaii First Circuit Family Court FC-D No. 85-4480.</p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">March 31, 1986 Husband was reassigned to Texas. Wife, Tina, and Patricia remained in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2U\">May 19, 1988 FC-D No. 85-4480 was dismissed without prejudice for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"ASDJ\">August 1, 1990 Husband filed a complaint for divorce in No. 322-151563-90 in the District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, 322nd Judicial District. Wife was served in Hawaii by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">September 6,1990 Wife filed her Complaint for Divorce in this case, FC-D No. 90-3447; in it Wife sought a divorce, spousal support, custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of the daughters, child support, and a portion of the property and debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">January 31,1991 A Final Decree of Divorce was entered in No. 322-151563-90; it named Wife \u201cManaging Conservator\u201d and Husband \u201cPossessory Conservator\u201d of Tina and Patricia; it awarded Husband the right \u201cto possession\u201d of Tina and Patricia at certain specific times; it ordered Husband to pay Wife child support of $500 per month through the Tarrant County Child Support Office commencing February 1, 1991, and continuing until no later than when both children reach the age of 18 years; it ordered Husband to maintain major medical and health insurance coverage for the daughters and to pay one-half of all health care expenses for them that are not paid by insurance; it awarded Husband the right to claim the dependency exemption for Tina; and it awarded Husband the property and debts in his name or possession (including his vested and future military retirement benefits) and Wife the property and debts in her name or possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>June 20, 1991 In FC-D No. 90-3447, Husband was personally served in Honolulu, Hawai'i.</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">October 1, 1991 In FC-D No. 90-3447, attorney Richard Hacker was appointed counsel for Husband in compliance with the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act.</p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">October 18, 1991 Husband filed a Hawai'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 7 Motion to Dismiss Wife\u2019s Complaint for Divorce \u201cFor the reason that the parties are not married,</p>\n<p id=\"Agd\">November 5,1991 The family court entered an order granting Husband\u2019s October 18, 1991 Motion to Dismiss Wife\u2019s Complaint for Divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">November 13,1991 Wife filed a notice of appeal of the family court\u2019s November 5, 1991 order dismissing her Complaint for Divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">March 9,1992 The family court filed its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order. Conclusion of Law No. 3 states that \u201cSince [Wife] and [Husband] are not married to one another, this Court has no jurisdiction to grant a divorce to [Wife].\u201d The Order states that \u201cThis Court has no jurisdiction over the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>matter of this Complaint for Divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">POINTS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Wife contends that the family court reversibly erred in dismissing her complaint because (1) Husband failed to submit his affidavit and a memorandum of Texas law and procedure in violation of Hawafi Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 7; (2) the family court did not decide that the Texas court had jurisdiction over the cause of action and the parties and was not authorized to give the Texas divorce decree full faith and credit until it did so; and (3) the family court did not consider the other economic claims made by Wife in her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">HFCR Rule 7(b) states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">(b) Motions and Affidavits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">(1) An application to the court for an order ... if involving a question of law shall be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">(2) If a motion requires the consideration of facts not appearing of record, it shall be supported by affidavit, signed by the person having knowledge of the facts and competent to testify. . ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Since all relevant facts are on the record and no relevant facts are disputed, HFCR Rule 7(b)(2) did not require an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">HFCR Rule 7(b)(1) required Husband\u2019s October 18, 1991 Motion to Dismiss to be accompanied by a memorandum of law. However, Husband\u2019s violation of HFCR Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>7(b)(1) does not mandate a dismissal of his motion. The family court\u2019s implicit waiver of the violation was within its allowable discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In a March 6,1991 letter to Husband\u2019s counsel, Wife\u2019s counsel stated in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">There is no doubt that Texas had jurisdiction to terminate the marriage and the divorce is entitled to full faith and credit. However, the Court has no personal jurisdiction of [Wife]. . . . Therefore, the orders in the decree which requires [sic] personal jurisdiction is [sic] not entitled to full faith and credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">We agree with this statement of law by Wife\u2019s counsel. <em>See Rodrigues v. Rodrigues, </em>7 Haw. App. 102, 108, 747 P.2d 1281, 1286 (1987); 24 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>\u00a7 242 (1983); 20 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Courts </em>\u00a7 118 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The four discrete parts of a divorce case are (1) the divorce, (2) spousal support, (3) child custody, visitation, and support, and (4) the division of property (assets and liabilities). <em>Black v. Black, </em>6 Haw. App. 493, 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). Wife\u2019s September 6, 1990 Complaint for Divorce asked the family court to adjudicate parts (1), (2), (3), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The Texas court had in personam jurisdiction over Husband and in rem jurisdiction over part (1). Therefore, the Texas decree finally adjudicated part (1) and there was no part (1) for Hawai'i to adjudicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The Texas court did not have in rem jurisdiction with respect to part (4), <em>see Rodrigues v. Rodrigues, supra, </em>or in personam jurisdiction over Wife. Thus, it did not have any jurisdiction with respect to Wife\u2019s interest in parts (2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(3), and (4). <em>See </em>24 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>\u00a7 550(1983). Therefore, with respect to Wife\u2019s interest in parts (2), (3), and (4), the Texas court\u2019s decree is void.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1U\"><em>Fred Y. Abe </em>(McCorrison Miho &amp; Miller, of counsel) on the brief for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AbS\"><em>James A. Walker, </em>defendant-appellee, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">HawaiTs Family Court of the First Circuit has in personam jurisdiction over Husband and Wife and their interests in parts (2), (3), and (4). The fact that the Texas decree finally adjudicated part (1) does not preclude or inhibit HawaiTs jurisdiction to subsequently adjudicate parts (2), (3), and (4) when it has in personam jurisdiction over Husband and Wife. It follows that the family court was right when it dismissed Wife\u2019s Complaint for Divorce with respect to part (1), but it was wrong when it dismissed Wife\u2019s Complaint for Divorce with respect to parts (2), (3), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Accordingly, we affirm that part of the family court\u2019s November 5, 1991 order that dismissed plaintiff Fumiko Walker\u2019s September 6, 1990 Complaint for Divorce with respect to part (1) (the divorce), but reverse that part that dismissed it with respect to parts (2) (spousal support), (3) (child custody, visitation, and support), and (4) (spousal support). We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
