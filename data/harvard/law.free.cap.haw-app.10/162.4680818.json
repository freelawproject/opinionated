Defendant-Counterclaimant Lone Star of Kauai, Inc. (LSKI), is the lessee of space in the HFM in which it operates a restaurant and cocktail lounge under the name \u201cJimmy\u2019s Grill.\u201d Defendants Richard Jasper (Richard) and Jimmy Jasper, Jr. (Jimmy) are officers, directors, and shareholders of LSKI and guarantors of LSKI\u2019s performance of the lease. LSKI, Richard, and Jimmy (collectively Defendants) appeal the district court\u2019s October 24, 1991 judgment which awards (1) to 4000 OPRP as plaintiff: a writ of possession of the leased premises on October 27, 1991; judgment against Defendants for $4,000.00 for the increased cost of an appraisal and $456.48 for the cost of the audit; and reasonable attorney fees and costs; and (2) to Defendants as counterclaimants: judgment against 4000 OPRP for $130.00, plus attorney fees of $32.50 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) section 607-14 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In response to Defendants\u2019 motion for a stay based on District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 62(d), the district court entered identical orders on October 25, 1991 and November 19, 1991 approving a supersedeas bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and staying the enforcement of the October 24,1991 judgment pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We affirm (1) the order to issue a writ of possession in favor of4000 OPRP and against Defendants; (2) the order requiring Defendants to pay 4000 OPRP\u2019s reasonable costs and attorney fees; and (3) the judgment in favor of Defendants and against 4000 OPRP in the amount of $130.00 plus attorney fees of $32.50.

Amy Hayashi (Hayashi), HFM\u2019s property manager, testified that she retained Hawaiian Appraisal Council (HAC) to do an appraisal of HFM for use in obtaining a bank loan. By letter dated July 20, 1990, HAC asked Defendants for \u201cmonthly gross sales figures beginning with the first month of operation through and including February 1989.\u201d Defendants\u2019 response did not satisfy Hayashi. She testified that she asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cJimmy, are you reporting your T-shirt sales to us?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">And Jimmy said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to. Go check the lease,\u201d which I promptly did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Further investigation caused Hayashi to schedule an audit which she conducted on December 6,1990. Michael H. Nekoba (Nekoba), a CPA with the accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, represented Defendants. According to the record, the audit and inquiry revealed the following relevant facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">1. The bar was downstairs and the restaurant was upstairs. The restaurant used a cash and carry system where each waitress was her own bank. When a waitress ended her shift, she turned in her sales chits, cash, travelers checks, and charge card receipts. The restaurant did not have a cash register. The bar had a cash register but it was not equipped with a sealed cumulative totaling device. In addition to selling food and liquor at the premises, LSKI also sold apparel bearing the logo of Jimmy\u2019s Grill. T-shirts were the primary item of apparel. Richard testified that Jimmy\u2019s Grill gave away approximately fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>per cent of its T-shirts. LSKI\u2019s mark-up on T-shirt sales was 100% on average.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">2. At times, LSKI purchased Jimmy\u2019s Grill apparel with cash. At times, the father of Jimmy and Richard purchased Jimmy\u2019s Grill apparel for LSKI with cash. At least some of the cash purchases of apparel were not reported by LSKI as costs for income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">3. LSKI maintained a daily sales journal listing the following two totals of the sales from the premises (A) the combined total of the restaurant and apparel sales, and (B) the total of the bar sales. LSKI attached all charge card slips to the daily sales journals. It reported LSKI\u2019s monthly receipts to 4000 OPRP on a form supplied by 4000 OPRP. It discarded the sales chits and cash register tapes 60-90 days later. Nekoba testified that without the sales chits and cash register tapes, it was impossible to audit the reported sales. In his view, the only way for the landlord to verify the numbers was to do \u201cwhat the IRS would do in a fraud audit, which is, what they do is they subpoena all of your bank records and ask you to explain all your deposits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">4. Nekoba\u2019s review revealed that LSKI had erred when it added the amounts reported in its daily sales journals. These errors of addition caused an underreporting of $92,530.38 of sales (excluding gross income taxes) for the 1989-1990 period. The additional rent due was $6,477.13 plus 4.167% general excise tax, or $6,747.03. Since the revised total of the sales for that period was $1,924,400 (excluding gross income taxes), the discrepancy was 4.80827%. Inexplicably, LSKI\u2019s error in under-reporting its gross income for gross income tax purposes during the same period was only $69,468.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>After correcting LSKI\u2019s errors of addition, LSKI\u2019s reported gross sales were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Month 1988 \u2019 1989 1990 1991</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">January 18,691 87,845 71,310 40,340</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">February 52,148 87,566 44,065</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">March 58,467 112,914 80,672</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">April 59,090 100,089 86,048</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">May 54,360 104,029 87,580</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">June 53,515 117,433 75,316</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">July 54,936 13,092 77,223</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">August 80,906 25,313 78,698</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">September 60,397 96,805 75,167</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">October 80,274 91,391 67,495</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">November 68,953 88,091 56,196</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">December 70,819 77,038 48,718</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">TOTAL 712,556 1,201,606 848,488</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">5. LSKI\u2019s 1989 gross income was $1,201,606. Of that amount, $752,555 was for food and apparel. Nekoba testified that he could only estimate the gross receipts from apparel sales. He estimat\u00e9d that the gross receipts for T-shirt sales in 1989 was $110,961. Jimmy or Richard told him they were selling $700 per day. Nekoba testified that \"the food side is slow, and without the bar and the T-shirt business they would be out of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">By letter dated January 29,1991, a lawyer representing 4000 OPRP advised LSKI as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-21\">We are in receipt of your letter of January 21, 1991 and the check for $6,747.03. My client intends to cash the check without prejudice to its position that the terms of the lease have been breached by the failure to report all gross sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>as required by the lease. The notable absence of certain cash register tapes and the fact that the t-shirt sales were for cash and no records were kept of such sales only reinforce our contention that the terms of the lease have been breached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On February 5,1991, 4000 OPRP filed its Complaint for Summary Possession and Damages against Defendants. Defendants were served on February 7,1991. The case was tried on June 10 and argued on June 25,1991. When the argument concluded, the judge stated in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">And although it is a very, you know, harsh remedy I don\u2019t feel the Court has any other option but to award the termination because of the lack of other remedies that can be proposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">And the reason [4000 OPRP] cannot come up with any figures to come up with the actual under payment that they\u2019re saying occurred \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">And I\u2019m not saying that there is deliberate under payment or, you know, this is intentional on any part, you know, by [Defendants].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">What I\u2019m saying is that there is no way for [4000 OPRP] to come up with a figure and that is because the records are just not kept in the manner that I think is customary here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">I don\u2019t know what other, you know, way to fashion a remedy for this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">If you have termination I think there are other equitable factors which would include what improvements [Defendants] have put into the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">The district court entered Findings of Fact (FOF) and Conclusions of Law (COL) in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>FINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">9. The Lease sets forth in specific detail the obligations of Defendant, as Tenant, to maintain records for a period of not less than two years of the gross sales of all business conducted on the Demised Premises. There are no prerequisites to Defendant\u2019s duty to comply with the record-keeping requirements of the Lease. None of the provisions of the Amendment relate in any way to the Defendant\u2019s record-keeping requirements set forth in the Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">10. The record-keeping requirements set forth in Section 5 of the Lease include the obligation to install and use sealed cash registers and keep the tapes from such cash registers for a period of not less than two years. There is no provision in the Lease that Defendant must be given advance notice of its obligation to install and use sealed cash registers. None of the provisions of the Amendment relate in any way to the Lease provisions regarding the installation and use of cash registers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">11. The Lease gives Plaintiff the explicit right to re \u2014 enter the Demised Premises and terminate the Lease in the event that, <em>inter alia, </em>Defendant defaults in the payment of any sum required to be paid under the Lease or Defendant defaults in the performance of any other provision, covenant or condition of the Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">12.

Some of the provisions of the Amendment modify or amend some of the clauses of Article 18 of the Lease. The amendment does not affect Defendant\u2019s obligation to keep and maintain records as set forth in Section 5 of the Lease and the amendment does not affect Plaintiff\u2019s rights, as Landlord, to re-enter the Demised Premises or to terminate the Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">2. As a result of Defendant\u2019s failure to record all gross sales and to maintain records of such gross sales, as required by the Lease, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>gross sales recorded and reported by Defendant are only an \u201cestimate\u201d which eludes meaningful verification. As such, Plaintiff is deprived of the benefit for which it bargained: rental payments equivalent to a percentage of Defendant\u2019s gross sales and the right to verify that the gross sales reported to it are the true gross sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">3. The provisions of Article 5 nf the Lease, regarding the requirements that Defendant maintain cash registers and records and books of account is worded explicitly and unambiguously so as to provide adequate notice to Defendant of Defendant\u2019s obligations thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">4. Defendant\u2019s failure to maintain the records of its gross sales as required by the Lease constitutes a material breach of the Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">5.

Relief from forfeiture is unavailable to Defendant because the considerations which orginally moved Plaintiff to enter into its lease have been irretrievably compromised and because Defendant\u2019s failure to record its gross sales as required by the Lease is grossly negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">7.

A review of the record reveals no substantial evidence to support these \u201cfacts.\u201d There is no substantial evidence of any unrecorded gross sales or that LSKI did not daily record the total of all of its gross sales. When the trial began, 4000 OPRP thought LSKI was not including receipts from the sale of apparel in its reported gross sales. Hayashi testified that Jimmy told her that the lease did not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>LSKI to report T-shirt sales. However, no other witness was asked about that alleged statement. Moreover, when viewed in context, the record reveals that Jimmy was referring to the fact that the lease did not require LSKI to report T-shirt sales separately from food and beverage sales. Jimmy and Richard testified that LSKI reported all receipts from food, apparel, and beverage in its daily sales reports. The concept of \u201cestimate\u201d arose when Nekoba was asked if he could tell what the gross receipts were from the sale of T-shirts. Obviously, since LSKI did not segregate the food and apparel receipts by source, the best Nekoba could do was estimate. Nekoba\u2019s testimony does not support a finding that the total of the gross receipts LSKI reported for the sale of food, apparel and beverage were estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">However, we conclude that the district court\u2019s error is not fatal to its October 24,1991 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Defendants challenge FOF 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15 and COL Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9. Defendants contend that (1) LSKI\u2019s default did not constitute a material default; (2) under the Amendment, 4000 OPRP\u2019s exclusive remedy for underpayment of rent is, at the maximum, payment of the cost of an audit and the deficiency found therein; and (3) because notice must be given for any non-monetary preliminary defaults, LSKI could not be held in non-monetary ultimate default without notice and an opportunity to cure. We will discuss these contentions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Defendants contend that LSKI\u2019s default did not constitute a material default. We disagree. We agree with the view that \u201c[a] tenant\u2019s maintenance of records and supplying landlord with statements of sales is essential to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>operation of a percentage lease.\u201d M. Friedman, 1 <em>Friedman on Leases </em>\u00a7 6.5, at 216 (3d ed. 1990). Therefore, we conclude that LSKI\u2019s failure to record each sale in the manner required by the lease and to keep the records for the period of time required by the lease was a material default of the percentage lease. Moreover, Defendants did not appeal COL 4 which concludes that their failure to maintain records of the gross sales as required by the lease' was a material default of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Defendants note that the Amendment states that 4000 OPRP\u2019s exclusive maximum remedy for underpayment of rent is the payment of the cost of an audit and the deficiency found therein. This fact, however, is irrelevant. The relevant material defaults supporting the judgment in this case do not include the underpayment of rent. The relevant material defaults are LSKI\u2019s failures to record each sale in the manner required by the lease and to keep the record for the period of time required by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Defendants contend that because notice was required to be given of any non-monetary preliminary defaults, LSKI could not be in ultimate default without prior notice and an opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">We agree that LSKI\u2019s failure to record each sale in the manner required by the lease and to keep the records for the period of time required by the lease were non-monetary preliminary defaults. As to any non-monetary preliminary default, LSKI had 90 days after notice in which to cure such preliminary default. If LSKI commenced curative action within 30 days of receipt of notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and diligently prosecuted correction, it would be entitled to such additional time as was reasonably required to correct the preliminary default.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">4000 OPRP responds that where a tenant irremediably defaults on a lease so that the default cannot be cured within the period allowed for cure, courts readily find that notice and opportunity to cure are unnecessary prerequisites to landlord\u2019s remedy. It cites <em>Taylor v. Gill Street Investments, </em>743 P.2d 345, 348 (Alaska 1987); <em>Coronado Company, Inc. v. Jacome\u2019s Department Store, Inc., </em>129 Ariz. 137, 140, 629 P.2d 553, 556 (Ct. App. 1981); <em>Poundstone v. Gofoor, </em>104 Cal. App. 212, 216, 285 P. 403, 405 (1930); <em>Matthews v. Digges, </em>45 Cal. App. 561, 564-65, 188 P. 283, 285 (1920). 4000 OPRP contends that LSKI\u2019s defaults were irremediable because \u201c[t]here is no way for [LSKI] to turn back the clock to 1989 and 1990 and keep accurate and honest records of actual sales consummated on the Leased Premises, as required by the Lease and Amendment.\u201d W\u00e9 agree, that there is no evidence that LSKI can comply precisely with the record keeping requirements for 1989 and 1990. However, that does not mean that LSKI cannot, in some alternate way, cure such preliminary default by proving the accuracy of its records. We cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that LSKI\u2019s preliminary defaults were irremediable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Alternatively, 4000 OPRP also contends that if notice was required, their January 29, 1991 letter, and/or the service of the complaint on February 7,1991, satisfied the notice requirement because, by the time the trial commenced on June 10,1991, LSKI had not remedied or cured its preliminary defaults. Under the facts of this case, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>According to paragraph 9 of the Amendment, LSKI is not in ultimate default until it (A) receives notice of the preliminary default; and (B) has had 30 or 90 days after notice of the preliminary default in which to cure it. The January 29, 1991 letter was a notice of the following alleged preliminary defaults: (1) failure to report all gross sales; (2) absence of cash register tapes; (3) liability for rent due in excess of 5%. Although LSKI was legally entitled to no less than 90 days after January 29, 1991 in which to cure preliminary defaults (1) and (2) and 30 days in which to cure preliminary default (3), 4000 OPRP filed its suit on February 5,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">This is a summary possession case in district court. What is the district court\u2019s appropriate response when the tenant objects to the fact that the landlord\u2019s summary possession complaint was filed after the tenant was notified of the preliminary defaults but before the tenant\u2019s cure period has expired? This appears to be an issue of first impression. We conclude that it depends on the timing of tenant\u2019s objection to the timing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">LSKI was not in ultimate default until 30 or 90 days after the January 29, 1991 notice. 4000 OPRP did not have grounds to file a complaint until LSKI was in ultimate default. Court rules afforded LSKI an additional period of time before summary judgment could have been entered. The Lease contemplates these time periods in favor of LSKI. 4000 OPRP cannot unilaterally advance them or shorten them. The clock runs on 4000 OPRP\u2019s time, not on LSKI\u2019s or the court\u2019s. Thus if the tenant, before the expiration of the cure period or the commencement of the trial, moves for dismissal of the landlord\u2019s complaint on the ground that it was filed prematurely, landlord\u2019s complaint should be dismissed. In that situation, the parties experience exactly what they bargained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>for and the court is not prematurely involved in the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On the other hand, if the tenant, after the expiration of the cure period and the commencement of the trial, moves for dismissal of the complaint on the ground that it was filed prematurely, it would be an unreasonable benefit to the tenant, burden on the landlord, preference for form over substance, and waste of judicial resources to dismiss the complaint and require the landlord to file a new complaint. In that situation, the landlord\u2019s complaint should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In this case, the second scenario occurred. Therefore, 4000 OPRP\u2019s premature filing of its complaint was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The Hawai'i Supreme Court concluded, in <em>Queen Emma Foundation v. Tingco, </em>74 Haw. 294, 845 P.2d 1186 (1992), that a lessor seeking to dispossess a lessee of a long-term lease of residential property must file the complaint in circuit court because title to real estate is in question. The <em>Tingco </em>rule, however, does not apply to LSKI\u2019s case which deals with a medium-term lease of commercial property.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Defendants contend that principles of equity require a balancing of interests, which the district court did not perform. We disagree that principles of equity are applicable. This was a summary possession case in the district court. The district court lacks equity jurisdiction. <em>American Sec. Bank v. Nishihara, </em>3 Haw. App. 594, 599, 656 P.2d 1347, 1352 (Haw. App. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In Lum <em>v. Sun, </em>70 Haw. 288, 769 P.2d 1091 (1989), the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the district court has the exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate the summary possession claim and that when a timely demand for a jury trial [is] made pertaining to other claims, counterclaims, and legal and equity issues, those matters should be transferred to the circuit court for trial by jury. Thus, it follows that if Defendants wanted their equity issues adjudicated, it was their burden to initiate appropriate proceedings in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Moreover, the rule in equity is that \u201cwhere the lessee\u2019s breach has not been due to gross negligence, or to persistent and wilful conduct on his part, and the lessor can reasonably and adequately be compensated for his injury, courts in equity will generally grant relief.\u201d <em>Food Pantry v. Waikiki Business Plaza, </em>58 Haw. 606, 614, 575 P.2d 869, 876 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">With respect to the first requirement in <em>Food Pantry, </em>Defendants contend that although LSKI\u2019s default frustrated 4000 OPRP\u2019s ability to conduct an audit, the failure was not intentional. Even if we agree with Defendants, they have not satisfied this requirement. The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that LSKI\u2019s default was caused by LSKI\u2019s gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The second requirement in <em>Food Pantry </em>is implicated in Defendants\u2019 contention that there is no evidence that 4000 OPRP suffered any financial damage as a result of LSKI\u2019s default. Defendants suggest that 4000 OPRP could have reconstructed gross sales by taking discovery of LSKI\u2019s T-shirt manufacturers and other vendors, taking depositions of LSKI\u2019s employees regarding sales, and comparing pre- and post-audit sales figures. We agree that the record does not establish whether it was possible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>LSKI to remedy or cure its material default by introducing objective evidence reasonably and adequately corroborating its accurate reporting of all gross sales. The question is whether 4000 OPRP or Defendants had the burden on this issue. The answer is the Defendants. As noted earlier, 4000 OPRP had the burden of proving LSKI\u2019s material default. It did so and, pursuant to the provisions of the Lease, was authorized to terminate the Lease for that reason. Defendants\u2019 sought equitable relief from 4000 OPRP\u2019s right to terminate the Lease. Since it was Defendants who alleged and would have benefitted by proof that 4000 OPRP suffered no damage or that all damages it suffered had been remedied or sufficiently mitigated, it was Defendants\u2019 burden to prove that fact. 29 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 127 (1967). Defendants failed to fulfil their burden. The breaching party suffers the risk that the default is irremediable. The fact that in 1991 LSKI paid the rent deficiency determined by the audit, installed sealed cash registers, and maintained records as required by the lease did not address the problems created by its prior two non-monetary defaults in 1989 and 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Defendants challenge COL No. 8. They contend that nothing in the lease or otherwise permits 4000 OPRP to recover the costs of a private appraisal obtained solely to benefit 4000 OPRP. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the part of the district court\u2019s October 24,1991 judgment that (1) orders a writ of possession to issue in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants awarding Plaintiff possession of the leased premises; (2) states that Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>fees incurred and costs of suit, which amounts shall be submitted by way of affidavit, and which sums may be included in the judgment; and (3) enters judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff in the amount of $130.00, plus attorneys\u2019 fees of $32.50 pursuant to HRS section 607-14.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANp\"><em>Edward A.
