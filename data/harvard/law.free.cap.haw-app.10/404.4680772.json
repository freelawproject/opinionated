The police subsequently seized a wooden implement from his truck and charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Defendant with carrying a \u201cbilly\u201d in a vehicle, in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 134-51 (Supp. 1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant appealed from the family court\u2019s February 10, 1992 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the seizure of the implement and Defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider which had attacked the applicability of HRS \u00a7 134-51 on various grounds, and from the guilty finding in the February 10, 1992 Decree Re: Law Violation Petition. The suppression portion of the Order need not be determined on appeal under our disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">That part of HRS \u00a7 134-51 applicable to this case states, \u201cAny person not authorized by law, who carries ... within any vehicle used ... by the person ... any ... billy ... or other deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The court concluded as a matter of law, that the implement \u201cfalls within the definition of... \u2018billy\u2019 as that term is used in HRS Section 134-51.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusions of law are freely reviewable on appeal. <em>State v. Ferraro, </em>8 Haw. App. 284, 290, 800 P.2d 623, 628 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Received in evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 1, the purported \u201cbilly\u201d is a wooden implement sixteen and one-fourth inches in length, cylindrically shaped, with a knobbed handle at its grip end. The diameter of the handle base is two and seven-sixteenths inches. The head end is flat at the top, measuring two inches in diameter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The circumference of the implement measures seven and seven-eighths inches at its widest point, and five and one-fourth inches at its narrowest point. The trial court found it was \u201csimilar to the shape of a baseball bat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The purpose of the implement is to stun or kill fish. The parties stipulated that the implement was made by Defendant\u2019s friend in the school wood shop for Defendant. The parties also stipulated that the shop teacher \u201cin the past permitted students to make clubs of the kind that\u2019s [sic] involved in this case for purposes of killing fish.\u201d Defendant\u2019s undisputed testimony is that he \u201cuse[d] it to knock out the fish instead of... a gun____\u201d The arresting officer himself testified that the implement resembled equipment used to kill fish. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Also received in evidence was Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 3, an \u201caluminum fishing club.\u201d The implement is seventeen and three-fourths inches in length, cylindrically shaped, with a knobbed handle at its grip end. The diameter of the handle base is two inches. The rounded head end measures two and one-fourth inches in diameter. The circumference of the implement measures seven and one-fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>inches at its widest point and three and one-fourth inches at its narrowest point. It also resembles a small baseball bat and is heavier than the wooden implement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that the metal implement was an \u201caluminum fish club... made available for sale... [at two] [flishing [s]upply\u201d stores and purchased from one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The aluminum fishing club closely resembles the wooden implement found in Defendant\u2019s truck. Based on the evidence, then, the court properly found that \u201cclubs such as State\u2019s Exhibit 1 [the wooden club] are used by fishermen for the purpose of killing large fish caught on the open sea.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe wooden club . . . was designed to be used as a weapon for striking animals on the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The term \u201cbilly\u201d is not statutorily defined. However, \u201cbilly\u201d is almost universally defined as a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Even the arresting officer defined a \u201cbilly club\u201d as a \u201cpolice officer\u2019s night stick.\u201d According to the officer a billy club is \u201ca long stick ... [with] a small handle.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">All the evidence at trial established that Defendant\u2019s wooden club was a \u201cfishing club,\u201d not a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d Thus, a club-like implement designed for the purpose of striking or killing fish is not a \u201cbilly\u201d as that term is used in HRS \u00a7 134-51. Rather, the term \u201cbilly\u201d as used in HRS \u00a7 134-51 refers to a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The family court had concluded that the fishing club \u201ccould be used as a deadly weapon against either large fish or humans.\u201d But HRS \u00a7 134-51 does not reach so far. \u201cThe statute is founded upon public policy having for its principal object the preservation of human life.....\u201d <em>State v. Ogata, </em>58 Haw. 514, 520, 572 P.2d 1222, 1226 (1977). And in construing the statute the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe statute . . . bring[s] within its ambit instruments closely associated with criminal activity whose sole design and purpose is to inflict bodily injury or death <em>upon another human being\u201d State v. Rackle, </em>55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Haw. 531, 537, 523 P.2d 299, 303 (1974) (emphasis added). Thus, HRS \u00a7 134-51 extends only to weapons deadly or dangerous to people.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The possibility that a fishing club \u201ccould be used\u201d as a weapon against \u201chumans\u201d does not bring it within the statutory proscription. \u201cThe fact that an object originally designed for normal or lawful use can be perverted to a use dangerous to oiie attacked does not convert it into a \u2018deadly or dangerous weapon\u2019 within the meaning of [the] statute.\u201d <em>State v. Giltner, </em>56 Haw. 374, 376, 537 P.2d 14, 16 (1975). In refining its interpretation of HRS \u00a7 134-51, the Hawai'i Supreme Court has distinguished those weapons which \u201c\u2018can be <em>used </em>offensively... but also have recognized uses of a socially acceptable nature\u2019\u201d from those weapons which are offensive in themselves. <em>State v. Muliufi, </em>64 Haw. 485, 488, 643 P.2d 546, 548 (1982) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Adams, </em>245 Pa. Super. 431, 436, 369 A.2d 479, 482 (1976))(emphasis in original) (nunchaku sticks not considered dangerous weapons). <em>See also, State v. Giltner, </em>56 Haw. 374, 537 P.2d 14 (1975) (diver\u2019s knife not considered \u201cdagger\u201d). The \u201cfishing club\u201d here may be so distinguished. Thus, \u201cif the health, safety, and welfare of the public\u201d require the inclusion of fishing clubs under HRS \u00a7 134-51, the \u201cmeans of providing such [inclusion] lies solely within the province of the legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Rodrigues, </em>56 Haw. 642, 643 n.2, 547 P.2d 587, 588 n.2 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Accordingly, with respect to its determination of a violation of HRS \u00a7 134-51 and a finding of guilt therefor, the family court\u2019s Order filed on February 10, 1992, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Decree Re: Law Violation Petition(s) filed on February 10, 1992 are reversed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aeq\"><em>Todd W.
