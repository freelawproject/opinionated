Hall (Hall) appeals from the October 3, 1991 findings of fact (FOF), conclusions of law (COL), and order (Order) dismissing his action against Defendants-Appellees State of Hawai'i and its Director of Health, John C. Lewin [M.D.] (collectively Defendants), for declaratory and injunctive relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">On April 24, 1991, Defendants published a notice (Notice) announcing a public hearing on proposed amendments (Amendments) to the administrative rules and regulations governing potable water systems, Chapter 11-20, Hawai\u2018i Administrative Rules (HAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ch. 11-20). On May 7,1991, Hall filed a complaint in the circuit court alleging that (1) the Notice did not comply with the requirements of Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 91-3 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (2) the room scheduled for conducting the public hearing was too small to accommodate the anticipated crowd; and (3) public hearings should be held on all islands because the proposed simultaneous tele-video arrangements were inadequate to accommodate neighbor island residents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hall also attacked the substance of the Amendments. The complaint requested the lower court, <em>inter alia, </em>to declare the Notice \u201cnull and void\u201d and to enjoin Defendants from proceeding with the public hearing until a valid notice was published.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On May 19, 1991, Defendants moved the court to (1) grant them summary judgment, pursuant to Rule 56(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1990), on Hall\u2019s claim that the Notice was legally insufficient;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), HRCP (1980), Hall\u2019s assertion that the hearing room was too small and separate public hearings should be held on the neighbor islands; and (3) dismiss as premature Hall\u2019s claim challenging the Amendments\u2019 substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The Order (1) entered summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Hall\u2019s claim that the Notice was legally insufficient; (2) dismissed with prejudice Hall\u2019s claims regarding the hearing room and neighbor island hearings; and (3) dismissed without prejudice Hall\u2019s claim relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>to the substance of the Amendments. Hall timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In reviewing an award of summary judgment, the appellate court is bound by the same standard applied by the trial court. Under Rule 56(c), HRCP, summary judgment is proper where the moving party demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Kane\u2018ohe Bay Cruises, Inc. v. Hirata, </em>75 Haw. 250, 861 P.2d 1 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The Notice stated that the purpose of the Amendments was to establish new requirements for public water systems to ensure that drinking water would meet \u201cspecific public health standards\u201d developed under the applicable federal law. The Notice listed the existing and proposed maximum contaminant levels for \u201cspecified contaminants [and] certain inorganic, organic, volatile synthetic organic[,] and miscellaneous chemicals.\u201d The Notice also advised of the following proposed Amendments:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">(1) expanding the rules to govern all public water systems in the State;</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">(2) establishing a special monitoring system for previously unregulated contaminants;</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">(3) creating new requirements for notifying water system customers when the water system violates the mies governing potable water systems;</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">(4) implementing additional enforcement measures; and</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">(5) requiring the State Health Director\u2019s approval before additives are introduced into the public water system.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The Notice also announced that the Department\u2019s hearing officer would conduct the public hearing on June 13, 1991, at 6:30 p.m., in the Kalanimoku Video Conference Center in Honolulu and \u201csimultaneously by tele[-]video conference communications to [video conference centers] in Lihu[\u2018]e, Kaua[\u2018]i, and Hilo, Hawai[\u2018]i.\u201d Finally, the Notice advised where interested persons could obtain more information, examine the Amendments, or obtain free copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Hall specifically claimed that this Notice was \u201cfalse [and] misleading\u201d and insufficiently described the Amendments. After examining the Notice\u2019s publication and contents, we find no disputed material facts. Therefore, the key question becomes whether the Defendants should prevail as a matter of law. Specifically, whether the Notice conforms with the intent and purpose of HRS \u00a7 91-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In construing a statute we are required to ascertain and give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent, <em>Methven-Abreu v. Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>73 Haw. 385, 834 P.2d 279 (1992), as derived primarily from the statute\u2019s language. <em>Kam v. Noh, </em>70 Haw. 321, 770 P.2d 414 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The present form of \u00a7 91-3 was enacted in 1989, Act 64, \u00a7 2, 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws 114-17 (Act 64). Act 64\u2019s findings and purpose section indicates that the amendment was the legislature\u2019s response to the supreme court\u2019s interpretation of the former language of HRS \u00a7 91-3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Costa v. Sunn, </em>64 Haw. 389, 642 P.2d 530 (1982), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>State v. Rowley, </em>70 Haw. 135, 764 P.2d 1233 (1988), the court examined the legal sufficiency of the notices for public hearings on proposed rule amendments under the then existing provisions of HRS \u00a7 91-3, and held that the notices in question did not provide sufficient information to interested persons. Because <em>Costa </em>and <em>Rowley </em>created far-reaching administrative and financial repercussions, the legislature specifically stated in Act 64\u2019s purpose section that one goal of the amendment was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[p]rovide clarifying statutory wording that will expressly enable agencies to publish notices that generally describe the subjects involved and the purposes to be achieved by a proposed rule, together with a description of where and how free copies of the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed may be requested, instead of including in the notice only a statement of the substance of the proposed rule[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Act 64, \u00a7 1,1989 Haw. Sess. Laws 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The legislature accomplished that purpose by amending \u00a7 91-3 to read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00a7 91-3 Procedure for adoption, amendment or repeal of rules, (a) Prior to the adoption of any rule authorized by law, or the amendment or repeal thereof, the adopting agency shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">(1) Give at least thirty days\u2019 notice for a public hearing. The notice shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">(A) Either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(i) A statement of the substance of the proposed rule adoption, amendment, or repeal; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(ii) A general description of the subjects involved and the purposes to be achieved by the proposed rule adoption, amendment, or repeal; \u00e1nd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(B) A statement that a copy of the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed will be mailed at no cost to any interested person who requests a copy, together with a description of where and how the requests may be made; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(C) The date, time, and place where the public hearing will be held and where interested persons may be heard on the proposed rule adoption, amendment, or repeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Act 64, \u00a7 2, 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The clear intent and purpose of Act 64 is to require that a notice of a public hearing on a proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of an administrative rule must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>minimally include a summary of the proposal. However, in order to provide the most information possible without requiring the administrative agency to detail the proposal\u2019s specifics, Act 64 requires that the notice also indicate where and how free copies of the proposal may be obtained, where the public hearing will be held, and where interested persons may be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Our interpretation of Act 64 echoes the general view of the notice requirement of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553b (1988). Specifically, although the APA \u201crequires that the notice advise of the potential content of a final rule either by providing a proposed rule or \u2018a description of the subject or issues involved!,]\u2019 \u201d it does not necessarily require that the notice exactly state the agency\u2019s intended actions. 1 C. Koch, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 4.6, at 208 (1985) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553b(3)). Notice under the APA is sufficient if it affords interested parties a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to participate in the rule-making process. Therefore, the Notice need not be unduly precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In our case, the Notice met all the present requirements of HRS \u00a7 91-3. The Notice clearly summarized the Amendments and their purpose, advised where copies of the Amendments could be obtained, and stated where the public could be heard on the matter. The Notice provided enough information or access to information to enable interested persons to participate meaningfully in the rule amendment process. Therefore, Hall\u2019s argument that some of its words are false and misleading is utterly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Hall\u2019s claim that the Notice was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">SIZE OF HEARING ROOM AND NEIGHBOR ISLAND HEARINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Hall\u2019s opening brief fails to present discernible arguments supporting his points on appeal that the court erroneously dismissed his claims that the proposed hearing room was too small and that separate hearings should be held on the neighbor islands. Consequently, we may disregard those points of error. <em>Johnson v. Robert\u2019s Hawai'i Tour, Inc., 4 </em>Haw. App. 175, 182 n.4, 664 P.2d 262, 267 n.4 (1983). In spite of Hall\u2019s remissness, however, we have considered the points and found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In its COL, the lower court held that nothing in HRS \u00a7 91-3(a)(2) (1985) \u201crequire[s] a public hearing room to be of any particular size,\u201d or in \u00a7 91-3(a)(l)(C) (Supp.1992) \u201cthat [requires] a public hearing be held with a hearing officer present in person on each major island.\u201d We agree with the lower court. Consequently, since Hall could not prove he was entitled to relief under the law, the court was correct in dismissing his claims with prejudice. <em>Marsland v. Pang, </em>5 Haw. App. 463, 701 P.2d 175 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We also agree with the lower court that Hall\u2019s claims against the validity or effect of the Amendments were premature. At the time of Hall\u2019s complaint no one could be sure what form the rules would eventually take. The rules\u2019 final form would be decided and known only after the public hearing. Hall would then have the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to file an action for declaratory judgment on the rules\u2019 validity pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-7 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axe\"><em>Robert W.

Lau, </em>Deputy Attorneys General, on the brief for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we affirm the Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Hall apparently anticipated heightened public interest in the hearing because of an apprehension that the proposed amendment could affect the level of fluoride allowed in potable water systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AV7\"> Lewin attached a copy of the Notice and affidavits from several newspapers from all islands attesting to its publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Prior to 1989, Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 91-3 (1985) read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Procedure for adoption, amendment or repeal of rules.
