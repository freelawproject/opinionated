On September 25, 1991, the motions court ordered the State to provide Defendant with any statements made by the complaining witness. This order was made in response to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery filed September 10, 1991 pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Defendant\u2019s jury trial began on March 30,1992. After four witnesses, including the complaining witness, had testified, defense counsel informed the court that a police officer had handed him a document entitled, \u201cSuspect Weapon Vehicle Description\u201d (Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Form 458)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> signed by the complaining witness after the incident. In its opening brief, the State indicated the form \u201ccontained [the complaining witness\u2019] description of the suspect and vehicle----\u201d Defense counsel contended that the failure to disclose this document was \u201cextremely prejudicial.\u201d The prosecutor admitted he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>had been informed of the document \u201capproximately two weeks before trial\u201d but stated he \u201cforgot about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The court granted Defendant\u2019s oral motion for mistrial and dismissed with prejudice. It stated that the form, which was marked as a defense exhibit and made part of the record, was a \u201csubstantial part of Defendant\u2019s defense and was necessary for Defendant for his use in cross examination of the complaining witness.\u201d The court further found that \u201c[f]rom this form alone, it can be seen that the complaining witness\u2019 testimony would have been impeached.\u201d The Findings of Facts,- Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Oral Motion for Mistrial and Dismissal with Prejudice (hereinafter Dismissal Order) was filed on May 4, 1992. The State timely appealed from this Dismissal Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In its brief, the State \u201cconcedes that the failure to provide . . . H.P.D. Form 458 . . . was a violation of both Rule 16, H.R.P.P. and the court\u2019s Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery.\u201d But it argues that the trial court \u201cshould be required to make a full inquiry on the record showing that. . . alternatives were explored\u201d that were \u201cless severe than mistrial or dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">While not stated in the Dismissal Order, HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> governs sanctions in cases where \u201ca party has failed to comply with this [R]ule [16] or an order issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>pursuant thereto____\u201d \u201c[HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(i)] provides that where a party fails to comply with its terms \u2018the court may order such party to permit the discovery, grant a continuance, <em>or... enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d State v. Sugimoto, </em>62 Haw. 259, 262, 614 P.2d 386, 389 (1980) (emphasis in the original) (quoting HRPP Rule 16(e)[(9)](i)). Thus, it cannot be controverted that \u201cthe trial court is ... empowered to dismiss under HRPP Rule 16(e)[(9)(i)] for non-compliance [with] Rule 16.\u201d <em>State v. Marzo, </em>64 Haw. 395, 397, 641 P.2d 1338, 1340 (1982) (footnote omitted). \u201cObviously, the sanction of dismissal is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, \u201c[i]n exercising the broad discretion as to sanctions [under HRPP Rule 16], the trial court should take into account the reasons why the disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, <em>the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, </em>and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Under related circumstances, the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court has said, \u201c[t]he test for determining if a lower court has abused its discretion in handling a Rule 16 problem... is if after finding a violation of the rule, the court takes measures to alleviate any prejudice----\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>67 Haw. 121, 122, 680 P.2d 251, 251 (1984). We hold, therefore, that before the court orders dismissal of a case because of the State\u2019s violation of HRPP Rule 16, it must consider whether less severe measures would rectify prejudice caused to the defendant by the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Here, dismissal was ordered on the second day of trial. The State had not yet completed its case. There is no indication that the complaining witness could not have been recalled for further examination by Defendant on HPD Form 458. A short continuance to allow Defendant to examine the form and to prepare cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>would have cured whatever prejudice resulted because of the document\u2019s late production. <em>Cf. Miller, </em>67 Haw. 121, 680 P.2d 251 (1984). None of the parties requested a continuance. Neither the trial court\u2019s oral ruling nor its written order indicates any consideration of measures less severe than dismissal. The trial court here failed to \u201ctake into account ... the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance . ...\u201d <em>Marzo, </em>64 Haw. at 397, 641 P.2d at 1340. Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in failing to grant a continuance to allow the prejudice to be rectified. <em>See also People v. District Court, </em>808 P.2d 831 (Colo. 1991) (it is an abuse of discretion to grant dismissal for failure to disclose potentially exculpatory information when a continuance would cure the prejudice to the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Defendant complains that in \u201ccase after case reversed by [the appellate] court[s] ... no action is ever taken against the offending prosecutors.\u201d He relates that the effect of reversal is that the State \u201cgets to retry the accused.\u201d It has been reiterated in cases involving the prosecutor\u2019s violation of HRPP Rule 16 that \u201c[t]he prosecution has a duty \u2018to seek justice, to exercise the highest good faith in the interest of the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair advantage over the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Moriwaki, </em>71 Haw. 347, 354, 791 P.2d 392, 396 (1990) (quoting <em>State v. Quelnan, </em>70 Haw. 194, 198, 767 P.2d 243, 246 (1989)). <em>Accord Miller, </em>67 Haw. at 122, 680 P.2d at 251 (quoted in <em>Quelnan).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">As in <em>Miller, </em>\u201cthe trial prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case is disturbing.\u201d Miller, 67 Haw. at 122, 680 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>251. HPD Form 458 was prepared by the complaining witness after the incident. The form indicates that it was completed on April 12, 1990 before Defendant was indicted. The State clearly should have made it available within a reasonable time after the indictment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not in the middle of a jury trial nearly two years after it was completed. Failure to disclose the document properly resulted in an unnecessary interruption of the trial affecting the jury, the court, Defendant, the witnesses, and other pending criminal cases. The information on the form arguably \u201ctends to negate the guilt of the accused [or] mitigate the degree of the offense . .. .\u201d Hawai'i Rules of Professional Responsibility DR 7-103(B) (1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the prosecutor was also ethically bound to \u201cmake timely disclosure\u201d to the defense under Hawafi Rules of Professional Responsibility Rule DR 7-103(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The obligation to seek justice is paramount and the prosecution\u2019s duty under HRPP Rule 16 must be diligently observed. Discovery is at the foundation of the fact finding and truth seeking process. Faithful adherence to discovery obligations serves the public interest: Discovery provides the basic information which is necessary to expedite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>trials and plea decisions in an already overburdened court system and promotes fairness in the adversary system.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">[T]he ends of justice will best be served by a system of liberal discovery which gives both parties the maximum possible amount of information with which to prepare their cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at trial. . . . The growth of such discovery devices is a salutary development which, by increasing the evidence available to both parties, enhances the fairness of the adversary system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>Wardius v. Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 473-74, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 2211, 37 L. Ed. 2d 82, 87 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii) governs sanctions for violation of discovery rules or orders. It provides that a <em>\u201c[wjillful </em>violation by counsel of an applicable discovery rule or an order issued pursuant thereto <em>may </em>subject counsel to appropriate sanctions by the court.\u201d HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii) (emphasis added). \u201cA willful act may be described as one done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly, or inadvertently.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 1599 (6th ed. 1990). Accordingly, sanctions imposed on counsel pursuant to HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii) for willful violations of discovery rules or orders require a showing that the violations were intentional, knowing, or purposeful.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Clearly, intentional, knowing or purposeful violations of a court rule or order should not be countenanced. Thus, there is little benefit to a rule which permits the discretionary and random imposition of sanctions for such conduct, as opposed to the advantages of mandatory imposition of sanctions. Furthermore, in light of continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>HRPP Rule 16 problems it is questionable that a \u201cwillful\u201d standard is an effective deterrent to discovery violations. Certainly, negligent non-compliance has equally deleterious effects on discovery objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Absent an amendment to HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii), it rests on the trial judges to enforce strict adherence to such rules, and orders to secure \u201cfairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d HRPP Rule 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Standard 11-4.7(b) of the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards for Criminal Justice is essentially the same as HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii). It states: \u201cIf an applicable discovery rule or an order issued pursuant thereto is not promptly implemented:... (b) the court may subject counsel to appropriate sanctions upon a finding that counsel willfully violated the rule or order.\u201d 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Standard 11-4.7 (2d ed. 1986). The commentary to Standard ll-4.7(b) states that it \u201cspecifically authorizes the court to take action against the attorney personally . . . including] the use of the contempt power and referral for professional disciplinary action.\u201d 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Standard 11-4.7 commentary at 11-68 (2d ed. 1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Considering the salutary purpose of the Standard, we hold that contempt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>referral for professional disciplinary action are available to the court as sanctions against counsel under HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(ii) for willfully violating discovery rules and orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Defendant further contends that, if we hold that the trial court erred in issuing the Dismissal Order, retrial of Defendant is barred by the double jeopardy clauses in the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i. \u201cThe prohibition contained in the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 of the Hawai[\u2018]i State Constitution is that \u2018[n]o person shall... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Decenso, </em>5 Haw. App. 127, 135, 681 P.2d 573, 580 (1984). Of course,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">the fact that the lower court dismissed [the indictment] after the jury was impaneled does not bar a revival of [the indictment]. Although jeopardy attaches when the jury is impaneled,... dismissal of a charge after jeopardy attaches does not always bar further prosecution on the same charge. . . . [For] [w]here, as here, a defendant succeeds during trial in having a charge against him dismissed without submitting the question of his guilt or innocence of that charge to the . . . jury, the double jeopardy clause does not bar a second trial of that charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 681 P.2d at 580 (citations omitted). Consequently, retrial is not barred because Defendant moved for dismissal in this case and was successful in having the charge dismissed before a determination was made of whether he was guilty or not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>However, the United States Supreme Court has \u201ccarved a narrow exception to the general rule that retrial is possible following mistrial in instances where deliberate prosecutorial or judicial misconduct results in a successful motion for mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Hamala, </em>73 Haw. 289, 294, 834 P.2d 275, 277 (1992). The double jeopardy clause will bar a retrial when \u2018\u201cthe [prosecutor\u2019s] conduct giving rise to the [defendant\u2019s] successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294, 834 P.2d at 278 (quoting <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 2091, 72 L. Ed. 2d 416, 427 (1982)). In order to bar retrial, the \u201c \u2018defendant^ must show that the prosecution intended to provoke a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 834 P.2d at 278 (quoting <em>State v. Hoke, </em>69 Haw. 44, 47, 731 P.2d 1261, 1263 (1987)). Defendant does not make any showing that the prosecutor intended to provoke a mistrial. The prosecutor admitted he forgot to disclose the form, and stated that \u201cit wasn\u2019t intentional that [he] withheld it.\u201d Indeed, at trial, Defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI do not believe that the prosecutor intentionally intended to deceive the court. . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Apparently recognizing that the prosecutor did not intentionally provoke a mistrial, Defendant requests that we adopt a standard barring retrial where there is an \u201cindifferent\u201d rather than an \u201cintentional\u201d prosecutorial provocation of a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial. He relies on <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or. 260, 666 P.2d 1316 (1983). However, <em>Hamala </em>is controlling in our jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court of Oregon admits, it \u201chas . . . given independent interpretation [to its double jeopardy clause] with results that might not correspond to those in other states . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 666 P.2d at 1318.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1Yr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Doraine F.

As we have discussed above, the facts of this case did not warrant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Therefore, we vacate the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Oral Motion for Mistrial and Dismissing with Prejudice filed May 4, 1992 and remand the case for retrial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\"> The Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Form 458 was not part of the record on appeal. It was marked as an exhibit and \u201coffered into the record\u201d by the defense. The court had the HPD Form 458 marked as Defense Exhibit A and made it \u201ca part of the record.\u201d The exhibit was subsequently withdrawn. The State attached a copy as Appendix A to its opening brief of what purports and this court assumes to be the HPD Form 458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> In 1993, during the pendency of this case, Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 16(e)(8) was renumbered to HRPP Rule 16(e)(9).
