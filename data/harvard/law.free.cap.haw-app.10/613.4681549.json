Richards (hereafter Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Kailua Auto Machine Service (hereafter Defendant) for damages to her 1984 Pontiac Fiero automobile (hereafter vehicle) allegedly caused by Defendant\u2019s negligent repair of her vehicle in January 1990. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint also claimed breach of contract and of warranties based upon the same allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Defendant entered a \u201cgeneral denial\u201d on January 17, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Trial before the district court began on April 25,1991. At trial, the following evidence was adduced, and Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 4,5,6,7 and 8 were received in evidence. On January 25, 1990, the vehicle stalled. This occurred after Defendant\u2019s work on Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. Mileage on the vehicle was 56,000 miles. It was towed at a cost of $31.20 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 4) to Mike Salta Pontiac (hereafter MSP). A mechanic at MSP indicated that a metal nut had passed through the carburetor into the vehicle\u2019s number three cylinder. The cost of the mechanic\u2019s examination was $170.83 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 5). Plaintiff removed the nut from the engine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She purchased a General Motors engine which was supposed to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with her vehicle at a cost of $624.00 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 6). When her friends were unable to install the engine for her, Plaintiff had the vehicle towed to MSP. The cost of towing the vehicle back to MSP and for its inspection was $153.64 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 7). Apparently, MSP\u2019s quoted cost to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>install the new engine was not satisfactory and the Plaintiff took the vehicle to Bob Sato\u2019s Auto Repair Shop (hereafter BSARS). It was in the shop \u201cfor approximately three weeks.\u201d The cost of BSARS\u2019s repair work was $671.30 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8). Of the $671.30, $69.70 was attributable to a battery, $128.46 was attributable to a catalytic convertor, and $12.01 was attributable to a rear brake spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Plaintiff obtained the car from BSARS in July 1990. Plaintiff testified that even with the repairs, the vehicle \u201cdid not run smoothly[,] . . . [took] a full minute [to warm up,]... and had a problem with... overheating.\u201d In January 1991, she traded it in for another automobile and \u201creceived a thousand dollars\u201d on the trade-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Plaintiff claimed loss of the vehicle\u2019s use for seven months. She used a taxicab \u201cat a minimum of twice a week\u201d and the bus. The taxi fare was \u201capproximately $5 each way\u201d for \u201c20-22 weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">James M. Campbell, a consulting engineer, was Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness. He examined the parts involved and testified that the nut caused the engine\u2019s cylinder wall to crack. The expert testified that the engine could be repaired. He stated that \u201cit depends on whether the owner . . . would accept the types of repair that\u2019s [sic] possible. It\u2019s possible to repair it if you want to spend the money to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Plaintiff offered Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 11 into evidence, papers from the \u201cblue book,\u201d \u201cto show the loss of value... to establish some link between the blue book value and the trade-in value____\u201d However, an objection to this exhibit was sustained. No cross-appeal was filed by Plaintiff on this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Bob Crivello, Defendant\u2019s owner who worked on the vehicle, testified that his work did not result in the nut entering the cylinder. On January 14, 1990, Defendant billed Plaintiff $60 for the tune-up, troubleshooting, and rear brake work and $60 for a \u201cprevious bill,\u201d for a total of $120.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In her post-trial memorandum filed August 22,1991, Plaintiff requested a judgment \u201cin Plaintiff\u2019s favor against Defendant in the amount of $11,310.00.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that $9,400 was for the difference in the purchase price of the vehicle ($10,400) and the resale price of the vehicle after it was damaged ($1,000). \u201cOut-of-pocket expenses\u201d totaled $1,710.97. Plaintiff asserted that this amount was \u201csupported by exhibits introduced at trial,\u201d but never specified which exhibits provided such support, nor indicated how the sum of $1,710.97 was calculated. Lastly, Plaintiff claimed $220 for taxi fees incurred as a result of the loss of the vehicle\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The district court entered its judgment on January 30, 1992 for $5,000 on the \u201camount claimed by Plaintiff\u2019 only. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were not filed by the court. Interest and costs were not awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">On appeal, Defendant does not contest its liability. Its sole contention is that there is \u201cno evidence in this case to support a damage award in excess of $1,840.80.\u201d The $1,840.80 sum consists of the amounts represented by Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7, $461.13 based on Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8, and an allowance of \u201c$400 for taxi charges at $20.00 per week for . . . twenty weeks.\u201d The $671.30 reflected on Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8 was reduced by \u201c$210.17 ... for parts unrelated to engine damage,\u201d thus leaving the balance of $461.13 agreed to by the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Defendant conceded the expenditure for taxi fees was $400. Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s testimony at trial was that she took the taxi \u201ctwice a week to and from work. That was approximately five dollars each way. . . . For seven months. 20 to 22 weeks.\u201d Based on this testimony, Plaintiff\u2019s expenditure would actually amount to between $400 and $440 rather than the $220 claimed by Plaintiff\u2019s counsel. As Defendant concedes to $400 and this amount is greater than the amount Plaintiff requested in her post-trial memorandum, $400 is acceptable for taxi costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">But aside from conceding damages in the amount of $1,840.80, Defendant specifically argues that \u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence of loss of value\u201d of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s only response on appeal is that Defendant failed to include all of the evidence below in the record on appeal because the \u201ctranscript of [Plaintiff\u2019s] testimony on the first day of trial was incomplete[,]\u201d specifically that the testimony of Plaintiff that \u201cshe purchased her car for $10,400\u201d was not recorded. Plaintiff relies on the statement in <em>Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., </em>5 Haw. App. 146, 151-52, 682 P.2d 82, <em>87, reconsideration granted, </em>5 Haw. App. 683, 753 P.2d 253 (1984), that the defendant having failed to \u201cinclude in the record all of the evidence on which the lower court might have based its findings[,]... the lower court must be affirmed.\u201d However, the lower court here did not make any \u201cfindings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In any event, in its reply brief, Defendant, relying on <em>City &amp; County v. Toyama, </em>61 Haw. 156, 158 n.1, 598 P.2d 168, 170-171 n.1 (1979), maintains that \u201ca party must either... [provide]... an adequate record, or concede the disputed point in its briefs or at oral argument.\u201d Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>quently, it concedes that \u201c[e]vidence at trial showed that [Plaintiff] purchased her car in 1984 for $10,400.00.\u201d Defendant having conceded that there was evidence Plaintiff purchased her vehicle in 1984 for $10,400, any alleged insufficiency in the record is a moot point because \u201cthe briefs of the parties treat [this] fact[] as true[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Plaintiff laments the lack of findings and Defendant claimed the record was incomplete, neither party moved to have the case remanded to the district court for the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Rule 52(a) of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) is pertinent. It provides that \u201c[u]nless findings are requested, the court shall not be required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d DCRCP Rule 52(a). The district court was not required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law because neither party requested findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">However, \u201c[w]henever a notice of appeal is filed and findings of fact and conclusions of law have not been made, unless such findings and conclusions are unnecessary as provided by subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d DCRCP Rule 52(c). Under DCRCP Rule 52(a), findings and conclusions are unnecessary when \u201can opinion or memorandum of decision is filed\u201d or when \u201cdecisions of motions except as provided in Rule 41(b)\u201d are involved. DCRCP Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Here, a motion was not involved and an opinion or memorandum of decision was not filed. Thus, findings and conclusions are seemingly necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">On their faces DCRCP Rules 52(a) and (c) are similar to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Rule 52(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and manifestly, the purposes of findings of fact under the DCRCP and HRCP are the same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">One purpose of requiring findings of fact is to aid the appellate court by affording it a clear understanding of the ground or basis of the decision of the trial court. Another purpose is to make definite just what is decided by the case in order to apply the doctrines of estoppel and res judicata in future cases. Finally, and possibly most important, the requirement that findings of fact be made is intended to evoke care on the part of the trial judge in ascertaining the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2571 at 679-80 (1971) (footnotes omitted). Hence, those decisions construing HRCP Rule 52(a) are an aid to construing DCRCP Rules 52(a) and (c). While HRCP Rule 52(a) should be strictly followed, findings of fact by the circuit court are not jurisdictional and the appellate court may proceed where the record is clear and findings are unnecessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cThe duty of the trial court to make findings of fact should be strictly followed. But such findings are not a jurisdictional requirement of appeal which this court may not waive. Their purpose is to aid appellate courts in reviewing-the decision below. In cases where the record is so clear that the court does not need the aid of findings it may waive such a defect on the ground that the error is not substantial in the particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\"><em>Lalakea v. Baker, </em>43 Haw. 321, 329 (1959) (quoting <em>Hurwitz v. Hurwitz, </em>136 F.2d 796, 799 (D.C. Cir. 1943)). It follows, then, that the appellate court may also waive the district court findings required under DCRCP Rules 52(a) and (c) where the record is clear and such findings are unnecessary to a determination of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In its brief, Defendant concedes the award of damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,840.80. Plaintiff, on the other hand, did not cross-appeal on any damages issue. Her answering brief did not respond at all to Defendant\u2019s calculation of damages or its contention that the \u201crecord is devoid of any loss of value\u201d of the vehicle. Hence, the sole issue on appeal is whether there was evidence establishing the vehicle\u2019s loss in value caused by the faulty repair, from which the district court could have based its award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>damages in excess of $1,840.80. We find the record is clear enough without the necessity of findings for purposes of deciding this sole issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u201cThe general rule in measuring damages is \u2018to give a sum of money to the person wronged which as nearly as possible, will restore him [or her] to the position he [or she] would be in if the wrong had not been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodrigues v. State, </em>52 Haw. 156, 167, 472 P.2d 509, 517 (1970) (quoting C. McCormick, Handbook on the Law of Damages \u00a7 137 at 561 (1935)). <em>Accord Nobriga v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>67 Haw. 157, 162, 683 P.2d 389, 393 (1984) (quoting <em>Rodrigues); Greene v. Texeira, </em>54 Haw. 231, 241, 505 P.2d 1169, 1175-76 (1973) (Levinson, J. dissenting) (citing <em>Rodrigues).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In this respect, when personal property is damaged rather than destroyed, the traditional starting point in measuring damages is \u201cthe depreciation rule, which gives the [injured party] the difference between the value of the chattel immediately before damage and the value immediately after, that is, the depreciation in value caused by the damage.\u201d D. Dobbs, Handbook on the Law of Remedies, \u00a7 5.10 at 379 (1973). <em>See also </em>Annotation, <em>Measure and Elements ofDamages in Action Against Garageman Based on Failure to Properly Perform Repair or Service on Motor Vehicle, </em>1 A.L.R. 4th \u00a7 4 (1980). This measure of damages is \u201cthe one most often approved by the courts\u201d where an automobile is readily susceptible to repair. C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 124 at 472 (1935). Courts which \u201cfollowG the depreciation measure of damages generally recognize that cost of repair is evidence of the depreciation, though not in itself a measure of damages.\u201d D. Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.10 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>379. See C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7124 at 472. This measure was also apparently relied on by Plaintiff at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Courts have applied various measures of damages to personal property. D. Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.10 at 379; C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 124 at 471-72; <em>Measure and Elements of Damage, supra, </em>\u00a7 2. But \u201c[a]ll [of] the [different] measures [for damages to personal property] are merely \u2018guides to common sense,\u2019 and the question in each case is ultimately a question of fully compensating the [injured party]. Thus, the various measures should be adjusted as required to meet the goal of compensation.\u201d D. Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.10 at 379 (footnote omitted). It follows then that \u201cno mechanical rule can be applied with exactitude in [the] assessment of property damage . . . [and] [e]ach case must rest on its own facts and circumstances as supported by the proof in the record.\u201d <em>Williams v. Louisiana Machinery Co., </em>387 So.2d 8, 13 (La. Ct. App. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We are not required to apply any specific measure of damages under the circumstances of this case. Defendant does not contest the award of corrective repair costs (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8). Additionally, Defendant\u2019s only argument with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s claim of the vehicle\u2019s depreciated value after the corrective repair work is that there was a lack of evidence to support such a claim. Because we agree that the evidence was insufficient to establish that claim, we do not, as a general matter, express an opinion one way or the other as to what effect, if any, recovery of repair costs should have on a claim for a vehicle\u2019s loss in value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we indicated above, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>determining the appropriate measure of damages for injury to personal property, each case must be determined on its own facts, the objective being to fully compensate the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">While it is conceded that Plaintiff purchased her vehicle for $10,400 in 1984, this was not evidence of its value immediately before Defendant\u2019s work in January 1990. Additionally, the $1,000 Plaintiff received in January 1991 on a \u201ctrade-in\u201d of her vehicle did not establish the value immediately after the alleged defective work was completed in January 1990, there being no evidence the \u201ctrade-in\u201d amount in 1991 had any relation to the value of the vehicle after the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Consequently, the evidence was insufficient to establish the depreciated value of the vehicle caused by Defendant\u2019s defective work. Therefore, the evidence did not support the award of $5,000 on \u201cthe amount claimed by Plaintiff\u201d beyond the sum of $1,840.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">While no award for post judgment interest was made, interest from the date judgment was entered in the district court should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 478-3 (Supp. 1992) provides that, \u201c[ijnterest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, shall be allowed on any judgment recovered before any court in the State, in any civil suit.\u201d In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>particular case, interest should run from the date of the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 37 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">[I]f a judgment for money in a civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed by law shall be payable from the date the judgment was entered in the circuit or district court. If the judgment is modified or reversed with a direction that a judgment for money be entered in the circuit or district court, the notice of entry of judgment shall contain instructions with respect to allowance of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">When a judgment is modified or reversed, the notice of entry of judgment on appeal \u201cshould specify whether interest is to run from the date of entry of the appellate judgment or from the date on which the judgment would have been entered in the [lower] court but for the erroneous ruling corrected on the appeal.\u201d 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. CoopEr &amp; E. Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil \u00a7 </em>3984 at 463 (1977). When the judgment is affirmed in part, the portion of the judgment that is affirmed accrues interest from the date the judgment was originally entered in the court below. <em>Masinter v. Tenneco Oil Co., </em>929 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir. 1991). <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ness dictates this result because \u201cCalculating interest from the date of the second judgment would penalize appellees for the trial judge\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, </em>922 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 1990). Thus, in this case interest would run from January 30,1992, the date that the judgment was entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Furthermore, as the prevailing party, Plaintiff would ordinarily be entitled to reimbursement for her costs. DCRCP Rule 54(d) provides that, \u201ccosts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs[.]\u201d Also, HRS \u00a7 607-9 (Supp. 1992) provides, in part, that \u201c[a]ll actual disbursements ... sworn to by an attorney or a party, and deemed reasonable by the court, may be allowed in taxation of costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Plaintiff requested recovery of costs in her complaint, but the record does not reflect a request for recovery of costs after judgment was entered. However, we believe that under the circumstances, an award of costs should be considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Accordingly, the judgment entered by the district court on January 30,1992 is affirmed with respect to the award of $1,840.80 to Plaintiff, and vacated as to the remainder of the judgment amount. Also, the case is remanded with instructions to enter an order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>post judgment interest on $1,840.80 from January 30, 1992 until the judgment is paid, and for an award of costs to Plaintiff as may be determined appropriate by the district court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab1\"><em>Melvin Y.
