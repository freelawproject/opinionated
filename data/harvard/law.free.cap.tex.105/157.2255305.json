In accordance with the verdict of a jury judgment was entered for appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201cIt could not be said, we think, from the testimony, that a contract was made by appellant to ship or undertake the shipment of the corpse C. O. D. the undertakers\u2019 charges at destination. And it follows that the assignments must be sustained. In the particular facts of the case it is shown that Thomas Gathright, the husband of appellee, died in El Paso, Texas, on December 7, 1907, in the forenoon, at a hotel, and the control of the corpse was turned over to a firm of undertakers by the hotel authorities. It appears that a member of the firm of undertakers had information that the wife of deceased resided in Fort Worth, and he went to the express office of appellant and told the express agent of the death and informed him that there were undertakers\u2019 charges against the body, and told him the amount of the charges, and asked him to have the agent at Fort Worth to arrange with appellee for the shipment of the corpse to Fort Worth. It appears that the undertakers were unwilling to deliver up tfie corpse or ship the same until their charges were satisfied or satisfactorily arranged for, and there was no tender or offer of the body by the undertakers at the time for shipment by appellant. Upon this request by and at the instance of the undertaker, the agent at El Paso at once wired the agent at Fort Worth, \u201cSee Mrs. Gathright 1300, Ninth street, arrange for shipment corpse Thomas Gathright, advise me by wire, \u2019 \u2019 Acting on the telegram and in behalf of appellee, Leon Gross, for Washer Brothers, agreed to guarantee the payment at destination of the charges necessary to have the remains shipped to Fort Worth, and so informed the agent at El Paso, and the said agent then sent a reply telegram to the agent at El Paso, \u201cForward corpse collect; charges guaranteed; advise if O. K.\u201d Neither appellee nor Gross nor the Fort Worth agent knew at the time of the message that there were undertakers\u2019 charges. The agent at El Paso, after receiving the reply telegram, notified the undertakers and told them it was a guarantee of express charges only, and the undertakers refused to let the body go until their charges were guaranteed or paid. Appellee did not know that the body was not shipped till the 9th of the month, when she got on the train and went to El Paso, paid the undertakers\u2019 charges and buried her husband there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We are of the opinion that the evidence justified the finding of the Honorable Court of Civil Appeals that no contract was made. The agent at El Paso sent the telegram to the agent at Fort Worth by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>request of the undertaker, for the purpose of informing Mrs. Gathright of the death of her husband, suggesting that she arrange for the shipment of the body. This was a purely gratuitous and personal act in which Crowson did not represent the express company. The agent at Fort Worth gave notice to Mrs. Gathright which was no part of his duty as agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">The facts do not express the elements of a contract for the Company that it would pay the undertakers\u2019 charges and ship the body, but make the impression that the two agents were endeavoring to aid the woman to remove the body of her husband to Fort Worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">If we grant that both agents intended to bind the Company to pay the undertakers\u2019 bill and ship the corpse, it would not have bound the Company, because neither of them had the authority to do so. The agent at Fort Worth could not make a contract for a shipment from El Paso. Missouri K. &amp; T. Ry Co. v. Belcher, 88 Texas, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The local agent\u2019s authority is confined to the business of his locality. If such agent make contracts for the transaction of business at other stations, confusion would soon prevail. To ship the body from El Paso involved the payment or assumption for the Company of the undertakers\u2019 charges, which neither agent had the power to do. It is true that a party guaranteed the payment at Fort Worth, but that was an agreement with the agent, and, if the contract resting upon that guaranty bound the Company to ship, it also bound it to collect the money from the guarantor and to pay it to the undertaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The rule of law which limits the authority of the agent to the scope of his employment is \u2019salutary and must be enforced by courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Mrs. Gathright having applied for a writ of error on the ground that the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals practically settles the ease, we approve that decision, and it is ordered that judgment be entered for the Pacific Express Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and judgment rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
