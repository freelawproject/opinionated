The executive committee, in a certificate showing these facts, designated the Democrat as party nominee, The District Court, in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>action for mandamus, ordered the committee to certify the name of the Republican as the nominee.

E. Dewees, chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee of Wilson County and others, praying c for a writ of mandamus to compel the said Dewees, as such chairman, to certify to the county clerk of Wilson County the name of Kott as the regular Democratic nominee for the office of county commissioner of Precinct No. 3 of Wilson County. The petition, in substance, alleged that Kott, with two others, was a candidate before the Democratic primary held on July 27, 1912, for the Democratic nomination for county commissioner of Precinct No. 3 of Wilson County and that he had received a plurality of all the votes cast for the candidates-for said office and was, therefore, entitled to have his name certified to the county clerk as the nominee for such office, in compliance with the primary election laws of this State. The cause was set down for hearing in vacation, and after such hearing, on August 20, 1912, an order was entered by the district judge requiring J. E. Dewees, as chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee of Wilson County, to certify to the county clerk of said county the vote received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Hugo Kotfc in the primary election showing his nomination .for such office.</p>\n<p id=\"A5K\">The cause was submitted to the trial judge upon the pleadings and the following facts, both as agreed upon and as shown by the eertificate of the county chairman, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u201cIt is hereby agreed by and between the parties to this suit, that the plaintiff, Hugo Kott, is now and has been continuously for several years past a Republican and that at the time of mating his application for his name to be placed upon the Democratic ballot for the July primary in the year 1912, he was a Republican and that he was a Republican prior to said time and that he has been a Republican continuously since before the making of said application up to the present, and is still a Republican and did not in any way or manner participate in the Democratic primary election held on July 27, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u201cThat the said Hugo Kott has been postmaster at Lavernia, in Wilson County, Texas, continuously for a period of about six years next preceding this date and that he is now such postmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the plaintiff Kott\u2019s name appeared upon the official ballot in the Democratic primary as a candidate for such office and at the primary election held on said date he received a plurality of the votes cast in said election for said office and a plurality of all votes was sufficient to nominate in said election.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u201cThat the members of the Democratic executive committee did not know that the plaintiff, Hugo Kott, was a Republican at the time said committee placed his name upon the ballot to be used in the Democratic primary election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The certificate of the chairman of the Democratic executive committee to the county clerk was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cFloresville, Texas, August <em>5,' </em>1912.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6-\">\u201cTo the Hon.

H. Hill, Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">This proceeding is an action by,J. E. Dewees, relator, against the said E. A. Stevens, respondent, upon a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to set aside and vacate the said order so entered by him in vacation. The petition having been presented to the writer in vacation a temporary order was made directing the respondent to suspend further execution of his order until the petition could be heard by a full court. At the time the temporary order was made the writer was not aware that the certificate of the county chairman anywhere stated that Kott had received a plurality of the votes cast at the primary election for the office of commissioner, or that his name was at all mentioned' in the certificate, such portion of the certificate being separated or detached as it appeared in the exhibits to the petition for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The separate or added portion of the certificate of the chairman must be taken as part of the certificate made to the county clerk, and for the reason that such certificate disclosed the fact that Kott was a candidate before the primary and that he had received a plurality of all the votes cast for the several candidates for the office of county commissioner for Precinct No. 3, the trial court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and his action was the determination of a legal question calling for the exercise of a judicial discretion, and therefore not subject to review by the process of mandamus. The neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sity for the exercise of judicial discretion arose out of the irregularity of the wording of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\">Had the certificate of the county chairman shown without qualification that Callaway had received a plurality of the votes cast at the primary election Kotfc\u2019s remedy would have been a different one from that pursued, and a different question would have been presented by the present proceeding. . But the certificate having shown that Kott received a plurality of the votes east he was entitled to have a certificate of such fact free from all conditions as might have rendered the duty of the county clerk of doubtful execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u25a0 We do not think it amiss to say that in view of the facts and circumstances of this ease as disclosed by the record, Calloway is not without an efficacious remedy. It was one of the evident purposes of the primary election law to preserve to each political party its political integrity, and where a member of one party has by misrepresentation or silence caused his name to be placed on the -primary ballot of another party and has defeated a member of such party the wrong may be righted by an action to contest the .nomination, for which remedy ample provision has been made by the primary election laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Because of the facts recited in the certificate made by the chairman to the county clerk, the writ of mandamus will be denied, and the restraining order heretofore made will be dissolved, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
