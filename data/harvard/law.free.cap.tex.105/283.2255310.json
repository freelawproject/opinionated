It is perfectly clear to our minds that the petition above set forth shows a cause of action in plaintiffs and against the defendant, Houston Packing Company. It will not be necessary to go into any technical analysis of the allegations of the pleadings, but it will be sufficient to state a few \"of the things alleged and apply them to such principles of law as may be applicable and well determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">It appears from the petition that the plaintiffs stand in the place of the original lessors and that Walther was at one time.in possession of the leased property as the tenant of plaintiffs, without authority to sub-let the property, or assign the lease of the property without the consent of the plaintiffs. It also appears from the pleadings that Walther a tenant of plaintiffs gave the defendant, Houston Packing Company a chattel mortgage on the leased contract to secure the sum of $800.00 advanced him before he became a bankrupt and after he had gone into bankruptcy advanced him the further sum of $650.00 so that he might effect a composition with his creditors. With this mortgage lien the possession of the leased property together with the lease itself, the fixtures and other things pertaining to the business in which Walther was engaged, was given to Chandler the agent of the Houston Packing Company, and therefore to such company, to hold for a period of time, or until by using the leased premises, the lease, the fixtures, etc., he could pay off and fully discharge the indebtedness due the defendant. This is the clear purport and legal effect of the contract between Walther and Chandler. It is immaterial what language the contract employs to disclaim the intent and purpose of.the contracting parties to assign or transfer the lease or to stay the acquisition of any vested interest in Chandler in the lease of the premises, provided the practical effect of the contract on the whole was to give a lien on the lease and possession of the lease and leased premises to the mortgagee for the purpose of extinguishing the mortgagor\u2019s indebtedness and to be held for such period of time as might be required to so extinguish such indebtedness. If this was the reasonable and legal import of the contract, and there can be no reasonable doubt but that it was, then the law fixes the legal status in which Walther and the Houston Packing Company stood toward plaintiffs. In such event the disclaimer of the contract and the declaration of what its import should not be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>will be treated as a subterfuge and a fraud upon the rights of the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The language of the agreement is \u201cthat the said Herman Walther in consideration of the advances made by the said Chandler, agrees that the said Chandler may go into possession of said leased premises at 503 Main Street, and shall continue to run the same,_ using the lease and fixtures, and what stock in trade may be on hand and to run said business until the said advances made by the said Chandler are paid off in full, and the amount due the Houston Packing Company is fully extinguished and settled in full.\u201d By the plain terms of the contract the possession of the lease, the leased premises, the fixtures and the business were turned over to Chandler, with full authority to occupy the leased building, to buy upon his own credit such supplies, goods, ware and merchandise as might be necessary to continue the business. So that we think the petition showed clearly that without the consent of plaintiffs their tenant mortgaged the lease contract to secure a debt and gave the mortgagee possession of the leased premises. \"The l\u00e9gal effect of this transaction was to make the mortgagee in possession the assignee of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The mortgagee of a lease who takes possession of the leased premises is in the attitude of an assignee of such lease and is therefore liable to the landlord for the rent. It seems to be a well settled rule applicable to our law that the mortgagee of a lease not in possession of the leased property, cannot be considered as an assignee, but if he takes possession of the leased premises he becomes in law the assignee of the lease and is liable for the rents to the landlord. 24 Cyc., 1177, (Y) ; Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, 7th ed., sec. 455; Jones on Mortgages, vol. 1, sec. 785; Walton v. Cronly, 14 Wend. (N. Y.) 63; Astor v. Miller, 2 Paige (N. Y.) 68; Astor v. Hoyt, 5 Wend. (N. Y.) 603; Childs v. Clark, 3 Barb. Ch., 52, 49 Am. Dec., 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Applying the rule above laid down, when the defendant took a. mortgage on the lease contract from Walther, the tenant, and took possession of the lease and the leased property, it became liable to plaintiffs to pay the rent for the period it occupied such premises. Thus it follows that a good cause of action is alleged by plaintiffs and it was error to have sustained the general demurrer to such pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">It would be no answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action to say that the mortgage of the lease was void or voidable as it affected the rights of plaintiffs, since Walther was denied the right to sub-let or assign the lease contract without the consent of plaintiffs, for the reason the defendant having taken the mortgage of the lease and possession of the leased premises would be liable to plaintiffs for the reasonable rent for the period it occupied such premises and would be estopped to effectually plead the nullity or voidableness of the mortgage. It is immaterial if under the facts pleaded the defendant was a trespasser in possession of the leased premises, for that reason it would be none the less liable to pay the reasonable rental value of the property so illegally withheld from plaintiffs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Under the facts alleged, which must be assumed to be true for the purpose of disposing of the general demurrer, we are. unable to conceive of any phase of this case, turn and shift it as may be done, under which plaintiffs could be denied the right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">We do not think the contract between Walther and Chandler was in effect \u201ca contract of agency, whereby Chandler is empowered as Walther's agent to run Walther\u2019s business for the accomplishment of a specific purpose.\u201d Nor do we agree to the proposition that Chandler's possession was Walther's possession. The preamble of the contract sets out the fact that Walther had previously given the Houston Packing Company a chattel mortgage on the lease for $800.00 and for the purpose of paying that amount and the further amount of $650.00, possession is given of the lease and the premises and the fixtures of the business, the character of which nowhere appears in the record, with full power and authority in Chandler to retain possession of the lease and premises and fixtures until out of the business the specified amounts mught be paid, when possession was to be returned to- Walther. This is the language of the contract. If the possession of Chandler was the possession of Walther, why provide for a return to Walther of such possession <em>\u00cd </em>The contract was clearly a mortgage of the lease with possession of the leased premises, which was in contemplation of law an assignment of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The legal effect which we give to the contract is not altered by the specious provision that it is \u201cclearly and distinctly understood that the said E. P. Chandler shall simply operate such business in the name of Herman Walther as his agent,\u201d for the contract proceeds to say that such agency shall be \u201cunder the terms of this instrument until the advances made by him and the claim of the Houston Packing Company are paid in full.\u201d The idea that the effect of the contract was to make Chandler Walther's agent in the operation of his business is entirely repudiated by the fact that the only interest retained in the lease, the leased premises and the fixtures is the right to draw from said business the sum of $6.50 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">To our minds no force or significance is gathered from that provision in the contract which provides \u201cthat the said Chandler, in consideration of his services in running said business, shall be permitted to draw from said business a reasonable compensation for his services for so doing.\u201d It will be observed that there is nothing in the contract that places upon Walther any obligation to pay Chandler for his services or to replenish the stock in trade whatever that may have been, or to pay rent or taxes or to do anything save receive $6.50 per month. It is apparent the contract was a security to defendant with possession of the lease and leased premises as the subject of the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Entertaining the. view we do of the transaction set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 petition and in the light of those facts construing the contract as we do, there remains nothing to be done but to reverse the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals and of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and remand the cause to the District Court of Harris County for further proceeding, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
