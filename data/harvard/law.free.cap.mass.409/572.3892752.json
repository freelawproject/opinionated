The board found that D\u2019Amour: (1) committed malpractice in failing to observe, document, and discuss a cancerous lesion inside the mouth of a seventy-nine year old patient, and in inserting dentures after observing the lesion; (2) failed adequately to inform a minor patient and her parents what they could reasonably expect from an unorthodox treatment; (3) engaged in irregular billing practices; and (4) committed gross misconduct in photographing a nude patient without a scientific or professional basis for doing so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On November 13, 1989, D\u2019Amour appealed to a single justice of this court. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64 (1988 ed.). On June 27, 1990, the single justice vacated the part of the order involving the irregular billing practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He affirmed the rest of the board\u2019s decision. On appeal to this court, D\u2019Amour claims that: (1) the board deprived him of due process by failing to provide an impartial hearing; and (2) the board\u2019s order was unsupported by substantial evidence. So much of the board\u2019s order as involved the taking of nude photographs of a patient is to be vacated. We affirm the judgment of the single justice in all other respects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>Before us are the findings by the board against D\u2019Amour which involve three different patients. We proceed to discuss the evidence submitted at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">a. <em>JC. </em>On April 17, 1986, JC, a seventy-nine year old man, visited his physician, Dr. Frederick Schwendenmann, complaining of a sore throat. A throat culture was performed and the result was negative. On May 2, 1986, JC visited D\u2019Amour for the first time, and requested a new set of lower dentures. After an initial examination, D\u2019Amour concluded that JC could not be fitted for dentures at that time because JC\u2019s gums were swollen. D\u2019Amour wrote in his treatment notes that JC\u2019s mouth and throat were irritated, and that JC was under a physician\u2019s care for the throat condition. JC visited D\u2019Amour three more times during the next three weeks. The dentures were inserted on May 21, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On May 19, 1986, JC visited Dr. Schwendenmann, who noticed that there was a ragged lesion across the soft palate and into the right tonsillar fossa of JC\u2019s mouth. Dr. Schwendenmann referred JC to Dr. George Charkoudian, an oral surgeon. On May 22, 1986, JC visited Dr. Charkoudian, who performed a biopsy and found the lesion to be cancerous. At the hearing, Dr. Charkoudian testified as an expert in oral maxillofacial surgery. He stated that D\u2019Amour was negligent in failing to recognize the cancer, and in inserting the dentures without first referring JC to an oral surgeon. According to Dr. Charkoudian, the dentures inserted by D\u2019Amour came in contact with a section of the cancerous lesion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">D\u2019Amour testified that on May 21, 1986, the day on which the dentures were installed, he recognized the lesion as being cancerous, and that he asked JC whether he was being treated by a physician for the lesion. According to D\u2019Amour, JC told him that he was being treated for the condition. Dr. Charles White, an expert in oncology who reviewed JC\u2019s medical records, testified that D\u2019Amour met the standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>care when he made sure that a physician was treating JC for the lesion. Dr. White also stated that the dentures did not come in contact with the cancerous lesion, and that the insertion of the dentures did not have an impact on the cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The board concluded that D\u2019Amour\u2019s testimony that he noticed the cancerous lesion was not credible since it was not corroborated by his treatment notes. The board also found that, assuming D\u2019Amour did observe the lesion in JC\u2019s throat, the insertion of the dentures \u201cwas conduct which fell below good and accepted dental practice standards and constituted malpractice in the practice of dentistry, in violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 (1988 ed.).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board suspended D\u2019Amour\u2019s license for six months to run concurrently with a three-year suspension imposed for another violation, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>and ordered him to complete a course in oral diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">b. <em>BP. </em>In March, 1986, BP, a fourteen year old female, was referred to D\u2019Amour by Dr. Randall Schaetzke, a chiropractor. Dr. Schaetzke had examined BP and concluded that she had scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. On March 24, 1986, during BP\u2019s first visit to D\u2019Amour\u2019s office, he performed a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction screening test. According to DP, BP\u2019s mother, D\u2019Amour told her that BP had TMJ dysfunction, and that BP\u2019s jaw disorder was affecting the muscles in her back. DP testified that D\u2019Amour told her that he would be able to treat BP\u2019s scoliosis by placing an equilibrium appliance in BP\u2019s mouth. According to DP, D\u2019Amour stated that he was going \u201cto move [BP\u2019s] spine.\u201d Dr. Schaetzke testified that, after D\u2019Amour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>began treating BP, D\u2019Amour told him that BP\u2019s \u201cspine was moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Dr. John Emans, an orthopedic surgeon who began treating BP in March, 1987, after BP stopped seeing D\u2019Amour, stated in a deposition admitted in evidence that there were no appreciable changes in BP\u2019s scoliosis between January, 1986, and March, 1987. Dr. Emans also stated that there was no scientific proof that \u201cscoliosis of the lumbar spine is altered by treatment to the temporomandibular joint.\u201d Dr. David Keith, an oral surgeon, testified that there were \u201cdifferences of opinion\u201d regarding the relationship between the treatment for TMJ disorder and scoliosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">D\u2019Amour testified; he denied that he told DP or BP that he would treat BP\u2019s scoliosis. D\u2019Amour contended at the hearing that he told DP there was a possibility the TMJ treatment would have a salutary effect on BP\u2019s scoliosis. D\u2019Amour also denied telling Dr. Schaetzke that he had succeeded in moving BP\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">D\u2019Amour called two dentists to testify about the relationship between TMJ dysfunction and scoliosis. Dr. Roger Kourey testified that, when TMJ disorder is eliminated, \u201cit also seems to help straighten out some of the advanced curvatures of the spine.\u201d Dr. Gerald Smith testified that he believed there was a \u201cdirect connection between malocclusions and spinal posture.\u201d Dr. Smith also stated that this was a \u201cpioneering\u201d field of dentistry, and \u201cthat future healing teams are going to see chiropractic dental people in the mainstream treating scoliosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The board found that D\u2019Amour \u201cmisled BP and her parents as to the results they could reasonably expect from the treatments and inappropriately blurred the boundaries between the dental treatment rendered by [D\u2019Amour] and the chiropractic treatment provided by Dr. Schaetzke.\u201d The board also found that D\u2019Amour\u2019s \u201cstatements and treatment modalities created DP\u2019s reasonable belief that [D\u2019Amour\u2019s] treatments were directed to and, in fact, had resulted in, the straightening of BP\u2019s spine.\u201d The board concluded that \u201c[although [D\u2019Amour\u2019s] behavior in this matter does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>support a finding that he violated [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61] by committing malpractice in his treatment of BP, [D\u2019Amour] failed to adequately and properly advise BP and her parents as to the \u2018pioneering\u2019 nature of his prescribed treatment and the results which could reasonably be expected to be obtained therefrom.\u201d As a result, the board reprimanded D\u2019Amour.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">c. <em>LC. </em>On October 9, 1984, LC, a thirty-one year old woman, visited D\u2019Amour complaining of pain in her face and jaw. On October 24, 1984, after a TMJ examination, D\u2019Amour diagnosed LC as having TMJ disorder. LC testified that D\u2019Amour explained to her that the TMJ dysfunction was probably related to a pinched nerve in her neck. According, to LC, D\u2019Amour told her that he wanted to photograph her naked in order to present the photographs at a medical seminar. D\u2019Amour explained to LC that he would need to mark her back, and that therefore her back would have to be exposed. LC asked if she could wear a bathing suit, and D\u2019Amour explained to her that it would be difficult to mark her back if she wore a bathing suit. D\u2019Amour told LC that he had taken photographs of nude patients in the past, and that he would reduce her treatment costs if she allowed him to take the photographs. LC testified that she asked D\u2019Amour if she could bring her mother to the photograph session, and that D\u2019Amour agreed. LC also asked D\u2019Amour whether she could see the photographs of the other nude patients, and D\u2019Amour told her that he would show them to her when she came in to have the photographs taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On October 30, 1984, LC and her mother arrived at D\u2019Amour\u2019s office after it closed for business. D\u2019Amour showed LC a set of photographs which he had taken of another nude patient. After D\u2019Amour took a few photographs of LC\u2019s mouth, she once again asked him if she could wear a bathing suit. D\u2019Amour explained that, if she wore the bathing suit, it would be difficult to mark her back. LC then went into another room, and changed into a beach towel. When LC returned, D\u2019Amour marked her back with the marker and proceeded to take several photographs of her back. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>then asked LC to take the towel off; after hesitating for a couple of minutes, she dropped the towel. D\u2019Amour took additional photographs of LC\u2019s back, and then asked her to turn around, and proceeded to take more photographs. At one point, D\u2019Amour touched LC\u2019s pelvic area and asked her to place her thumbs in that area. LC\u2019s mother was in the room as D\u2019Amour took the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">D\u2019Amour\u2019s testimony regarding the nude photographs was essentially the same as LC\u2019s, except D\u2019Amour claimed that: (1) he suggested taking the photographs <em>after </em>LC volunteered to assist him with his research; (2) he suggested that LC bring a chaperon; and (3) LC, on the night in which the photographs were taken, never mentioned to him that she had brought a bathing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">D\u2019Amour testified that the photographs of LC had to be taken without any clothes because \u201cthe postural imbalances and distortions in body structures are best illustrated if the body is unencumbered by any form of restrictive clothing.\u201d Dr. Gerald Smith, a dentist who reviewed LC\u2019s medical records, testified that she \u201chad a multitude of problems\u201d including TMJ dysfunction, malocclusion, partial tilt of the head, shoulder and pelvic distortion, and chronic pain. Dr. Smith testified that it was not unusual for a dentist engaged in clinical research to photograph a nude patient in order to document postural distortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">D\u2019Amour used one close-up photograph of LC\u2019s face during a presentation titled \u201cWorkshop on Applied Kinesiology\u201d sponsored by the Academy of Stress and Chronic Disease in Hartford, Connecticut, on November 15, 1984. D\u2019Amour used a slide of another naked patient at the seminar. D\u2019Amour testified that he did not use any of the nude photographs of LC because they were not the best examples of postural deformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The board found that, with the exception of a few photographs depicting LC\u2019s head, shoulders, hip, and back, the photographs \u201cdo not support [D\u2019Amour\u2019s] testimony that the range of poses and angles in the photos taken of LC resulted from his effort \u2018to show the lineup of the cervical curvature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>with the thoracic curvature with the lumbar curvature\u2019 based on the absence of any discernable scientific purpose to the photographs.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board noted that an inspection protocol of the spine and extremities, admitted in evidence as an exhibit, recommended that \u201c[t]o ensure a thorough examination of the hip joint and related areas, it is preferable that the patient disrobe completely. However, if doing so causes him discomfort or embarrassment, he may keep his underwear on.\u201d The board also noted that the photographs appearing in the excerpts of two articles related to postural deformities, admitted in evidence as exhibits, were of fully clothed patients. The board concluded that D\u2019Amour\u2019s taking of nude photographs as part of his \u201calleged \u2018clinical research\u2019 was inappropriate, without scientific or professional basis, and constituted unethical behavior which violated his professional and fiduciary relationship with the patient, had the potential to undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the dental profession, and constituted gross misconduct in the practice of dentistry, in violation of [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61].\u201d The board suspended D\u2019Amour\u2019s license for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">2. <em>Due process. </em>D\u2019Amour argues that his right to due process was violated because the board failed to provide him with an impartial hearing. D\u2019Amour contends that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>denied due process when Dr. Walter Guralnick, the chairman of the board, solicited the participation of an expert witness to testify at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Administrative agencies and boards, by their very nature, have a dual investigative and adjudicative function. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 56 (1975), held that this dual function does not violate principles of due process of law. In <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>387 Mass. 708 (1982), we rejected a physician\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated when, inter alia, \u201cthe member of the board who moved that the order to show cause be served upon [the physician] was thereafter appointed hearing officer and conducted the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714-715. In <em>Craven </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 191, 198-199 (1983), we held that the alleged participation by the chairman of the State Ethics Commission in the decision authorizing a preliminary inquiry in the conduct of the plaintiff, in addition to his participation in the issuance of an order to show cause, and his sitting as hearing officer, did not deprive the plaintiff of due process. D\u2019Amour was not denied the right to an impartial hearing simply because the chairman of the board asked an expert to testify at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">D\u2019Amour also alleges that Dr. Guralnick had a personal bias against him. In support of this allegation, D\u2019Amour points to the fact that Dr. Guralnick interrupted the hearing and made a statement defending himself against allegations made by D\u2019Amour\u2019s attorney during the cross-examination of the expert witness whom Dr. Guralnick asked to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>We do not think that the interruption by Dr. Guralnick overcomes the assumption that \u201cstate administrators \u2018are . . . men of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 716, quoting <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 55. In any event, even if we were to assume that Dr. Guralnick\u2019s statement during the hearing demonstrated a bias against D\u2019Amour, there was no due process violation since Dr. Guralnick did not act as the hearing officer, and also recused himself from any deliberations by the board. See <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration, supra </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">3. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>D\u2019Amour argues that the board\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence. \u201cThe scope of review under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [1988 ed.], is circumscribed. . . . We must uphold the decision of the board where, considering the entire record, its findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 379 (1985). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). \u201cWhile we must consider the entire record, and must take into account whatever in the record detracts from the weight of the [board\u2019s] opinion, ... as long as there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the [board], we will not substitute our views as to the facts\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>403 Mass. 350, 354 (1988), quoting <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>proceed to apply this standard of review to each of the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">a. <em>JC. </em>The board\u2019s conclusion that D\u2019Amour violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61, when he failed to observe, document, and discuss JC\u2019s cancerous lesion, and inserted the dentures after observing the lesion, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Dr. Charkoudian, an oral surgeon, testified that JC\u2019s lesion was probably obvious on May 2, 1986, during JC\u2019s first visit to D\u2019Amour, and was certainly obvious on May 21, 1986, the day on which D\u2019Amour inserted the dentures. Dr. Charkoudian\u2019s testimony was especially compelling since he observed the lesion on May 22, 1986. The board did not believe D\u2019Amour\u2019s testimony that he noticed the cancerous lesion, but did not write it in his treatment notes because JC assured him that he was receiving treatment from a physician for the condition. \u201cThe board, and not this court, has the responsibility of deciding preliminary questions of credibility and the weight of the evidence; the board was not required to believe . . . [D\u2019Amour\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The board heard testimony from Dr. Charkoudian that D\u2019Amour violated the standard of care when he inserted the dentures without first referring JC to an oral surgeon. The board also heard testimony from Dr. White, an oncologist, who stated that D\u2019Amour met the standard of care when he made sure that JC was receiving treatment for the condition. D\u2019Amour suggests that greater weight should be given to Dr. White\u2019s testimony since he, and not Dr. Charkoudian, is a cancer expert. We believe that this is the type of decision which falls within the expertise of the board, and therefore, we will not displace the board\u2019s choice between the two conflicting views. See <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 355; <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 381. See also <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 526, 529 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">b. <em>BP. </em>The board\u2019s conclusion that D\u2019Amour did not adequately inform BP and her parents as to what they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>reasonably expect from the treatment he provided was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">DP testified that D\u2019Amour told her he would improve BP\u2019s scoliosis through the TMJ dysfunction treatment. D\u2019Amour denied that he had ever made the statement. Again, it is for the board to determine the credibility of the witnesses and to resolve factual disputes. <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 356. <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>It was also within the board\u2019s discretion to use its expertise in order to choose among conflicting medical testimony regarding the effect of TMJ dysfunction treatment on scoliosis. See <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">c. <em>LC. </em>The board\u2019s conclusion that D\u2019Amour engaged in gross misconduct in the practice of his profession by taking nude photographs of LC was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The board concluded that the photographs lacked a \u201cscientific or professional basis.\u201d There was not sufficient evidence in the record for the board to have made this determination. \u201cThe board may put its expertise to use in evaluating the complexities of technical evidence. However, the board may not use its expertise as a substitute for evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 310. \u201c[A]n agency or board may not sit as a silent witness where expert testimony is required to establish an evidentiary basis for its conclusions.\u201d <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The only evidence in the record relied upon by the board in evaluating the scientific or professional validity of the photographs was: (1) an examination protocol which recommends that in order to examine thoroughly the \u201chip joint and related areas\u201d it is preferable that the patient be naked, but, if the patient is embarrassed, he may wear his underwear; and (2) excerpts of two articles which discuss postural deformities and which include photographs of patients who are fully clothed. We do not think that these three documents constitute a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which the board could have concluded that the photographs in question lacked a scientific or professional basis, especially since Dr. Smith testified that it is not unusual for a dentist involved in certain types of clinical research to take photographs of nude patients. \u201cThe substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 466, quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Since the record contains very little evidence which questions the scientific or professional validity of the photographs, we can assume that the board relied mainly on its expertise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>in reaching its conclusions. When an agency or board relies on its expertise, it must put in the record the basis for that expertise. See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 309. See also <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>405 Mass. 103, 113, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989) (\u201cboard exceeded its proper role in announcing, with no expert evidence in the record to support it, that its special expertise permits it to identify \u2018red flags indicative of sexual abuse\u2019 \u201d). The board is not required to introduce.expert evidence in every case; if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which the board can apply its expertise, the board may evaluate the facts without the assistance of expert evidence. See <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark>The board, however, \u201cmust make certain that sufficient evidence is in the record for a court to review the evidence on which the agency relies.\u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The board in this case failed to put in the record the basis for the expertise which it used to evaluate the photographs and, as a result, the record does not contain sufficient evidence for us properly to review the board\u2019s conclusion that the photographs lacked a scientific or professional basis. The board substituted its expertise for evidence. The board\u2019s finding that D\u2019Amour engaged in gross misconduct in the practice of his profession was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the single justice is to be amended so as to vacate so much of the board\u2019s decision as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>imposed sanctions on D\u2019Amour for photographing LC in the nude, and to remand the matter to the board for further consideration consistent with this opinion. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The board imposed the following sanctions: as to the first violation, a six-month suspension of D\u2019Amour\u2019s license to practice dentistry; as to the second violation, a reprimand; as to the third violation, a three-year period of probation; as to the fourth violation, a three-year suspension of license, to run concurrently with the six-month suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The single justice held that D\u2019Amour did not receive adequate notice of this charge because, while the board found that his irregular billing practices violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 52E (1988 ed.), the order to show cause charged him with violating G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 (1988 ed). The sanction imposed by the part of the order vacated by the single justice was the three-year probationary period scheduled to commence at the end of the suspension period. The board does not appeal this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">\u201c Although this matter comes to us in the form of an \u2018appeal\u2019 from the decisions of the single justice, we review the decision of the board di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>rectly.\u201d <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>403 Mass. 350, 352 n.4 (1988). See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (1988 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 61, states in part that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, each board of registration or examination in the division of registration of the department of civil service and registration, after a hearing, may, by a majority vote of the whole board, suspend, revoke or cancel any certificate, registration, license or authority issued by it, if it appears to said board that the holder of such certificate, registration, license or authority, is incapacitated by reason of mental illness, or is guilty of deceit, malpractice, gross misconduct in the practice of his profession, or of any offense against the laws of the commonwealth relating thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The board described the photographs as follows: \u201cThe 36 slides taken by [D\u2019Amour] of LC include five slides of LC\u2019s back, nineteen side/front views, eight frontal views, three slides of LC lying on the floor with her thumbs on her pelvic area, and one slide too dark to read. None of the slides show LC\u2019s lower legs and feet or include the surface which she was standing on when the pictures were taken. The side/front views do not validly depict any postural deformities since, in each view, either LC\u2019s hands or arms are covering her hips or her full shoulders, head or hips are not included in the picture. The frontal view slides are similarly deficient in documenting any postural relationships since, except for one or two slides, they are focused on the area from the top of LC\u2019s breasts to just below her pubic area and do not include either her full shoulders, hips, or head. Notwithstanding the placement of LC\u2019s thumbs on her pelvic bones, no scientific purpose is evident in the close-up views of LC lying on her back. One of the photos of LC lying on her back was taken from the angle of LC\u2019s feet looking towards her head with the camera level with her thighs. This slide is focused on LC\u2019s mid-thighs to her breasts (no shoulders or head included) with a full view of her pubic area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Dr. Guralnick, after asking the hearing officer if he could make a statement, said the following: \u201cI resent very much the implication that this Board is biased and that the chairman is biased. This Board has never gone on any witch hunts against dentists. Its officers are and Board members have tried to be as fair handed as they can be in all hearings and in all complaints brought before it and I think counsel owes the Board and me an apology for implying that there is some sort of collusion between me and Dr. Keith, who is a recognized authority in his field, as I have been at one time a recognized authority in the same field, could be with any other thousand, hundred oral surgeons, we could have brought here as witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>as experts whom I know as well as I know Dr. Keith. And I deeply feel that the Board has been insulted by this implication and I would like that to be recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">D\u2019Amour also alleges that Dr. Guralnick was biased because Guralnick testified against him at a prior proceeding. There is nothing in the record to substantiate this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\">D\u2019Amour argues that his due process rights were violated when the board, in the part of its decision involving the nude photographs of LC, \u201cfailed to identify or establish any standard of applicable professional conduct.\u201d The board applied the standard of professional conduct contained in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61. We have stated that \u201cgross misconduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 61, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>\u201cis not too indefinite as a ground for discipline of a registered [professional] by the board.\u201d <em>Forziati </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>333 Mass. 125, 128 (1955). See <em>Hellman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>404 Mass. 800, 804 (1989) (defining \u201cgross misconduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The board, in its factual findings, summarized the testimony of all the witnesses, except for Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony regarding the scientific and professional value of having a dentist take photographs of a nude patient. The relevant testimony of Dr. Smith was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Q. \u201cDoctor, would you then consider it unusual for a dentist to examine a patient\u2019s pelvic area during a routine examination of a TMJ dysfunction patient?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A. \u201cNot at all. Expecially [\u00edz'c] when one is versed in the total concept of physiologic dentistry.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Q. \u201cDoctor, would you consider it unusual if a dentist photographed a patient in the nude to document pelvic, spinal or shoulder distortions as they relate to the TMJ dysfunction or treatment?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">A. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t find it unusual at all. Especially an individual who lectures, an individual who\u2019s conducting clinical research. And an individual who, you know, is in the forefront of his field. That\u2019s how progress, you know, comes about. It\u2019s not doing the same thing over and over again. It\u2019s breaking new waters and the information that\u2019s obtained through clinical examination and documentation is what provides the change that occurs in any profession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">If appropriate, the board may take administrative notice of the standard of care. <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>(board took notice of own regulations which established scope of chiropractic care and nature of supportive procedures). See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 310; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The board found that D\u2019Amour continued to charge LC after he told her that he would not do so if she agreed to be photographed. It appears that this played a relatively minor role in the board\u2019s decision to suspend D\u2019Amour\u2019s license for three years. The core of the board\u2019s accusations revolved around the claimed lack of a scientific or professional basis for the photographs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
