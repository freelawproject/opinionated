Regs. \u00a7 123.00 (1989), issued by the commissioner exceeded the scope of his statutory authority; that there was insufficient reason for issuance of the emergency regulation; and that direct payment plans submitted by the defendants, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company (Arbella), The Kemper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>National Property &amp; Casualty Companies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Kemper), and the Massachusetts Automobile Rating and Accident Prevention Bureau (bureau),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were improperly approved by the commissioner. On a statement of agreed facts, the Superior Court judge ordered judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">On November 5, 1988, the Legislature enacted, with emergency preamble, St. 1988, c. 273, the so-called Automobile Insurance Reform Act (act), the purpose of which was to lower the cost of automobile insurance premiums by restructuring the automobile insurance system in a number of ways. Prior to passage of the act, insurers could pay a claim for repairs only after the insured had certified the repairs had already been completed. Sections 24 and 51 of the act, effective January 1, 1989, allow insurers for the first time to file plans for approval by the commissioner under which they can make direct payment to the insured for certain covered losses, prior to completion of repair work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those sections allow the commissioner to require that any such plan provide that the insured will be given a referral list of repair shops which can do the required repair work for the amount of the payment to the insured, plus any applicable deductible. The sections allow the commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations he deems necessary for implementation of the direct payment system.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In November, 1988, the bureau and Arbella filed direct payment plans with the commissioner for his approval. On December 8, 1988, the commissioner issued on an emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>basis and without public hearing, a regulation governing direct payment plans and referral repair shop programs, 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.00. Before issuing the emergency regulation, the commissioner\u2019s staff met several times with interested persons, including at least twice with representatives of the plaintiff association. On December 8, the commissioner gave notice that a hearing on approval of the bureau and Arbella plans would be held on December 22, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">On December 15, 1988, Kemper filed a direct payment plan for the first time, and Arbella and the bureau filed revised plans. According to the association, it was notified for the first time on December 20, 1988, that Kemper had filed a plan, that the bureau and Arbella had filed revised plans, and that the hearing on December 22 would be for approval of the newly filed plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The December 22 hearing was not conducted as an adjudicatory proceeding. The association participated in the hearing, giving oral and written testimony. Subsequently, the commissioner approved all three plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In January, 1989, the commissioner gave notice and held a hearing regarding the approval of 211 Code Mass Regs \u00a7 123.00 as a final regulation. The association participated in that hearing. In February, 1989, the commissioner issued 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.00 as a final regulation. The challenged portions of the regulation are the same in both emergency and final form.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">1. <em>Substantive challenges to the regulation. </em>The association challenges three provisions of the regulation: (1) the allowance of a transition period and a waiver concerning the number of repair shops on an insurer\u2019s referral list, 211 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 123.06 (2) (a); (2) the allowance of supplemental payments for unexpected damage, 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (3) (a) (ii); and (3) a provision permitting repair shops to offer discounts on parts, glass, labor rate or other item or customer service, 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (8) (b). The association contends these provisions violate the following statutory language, referring to direct payment plans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>\u201cThe commissioner <em>may </em>require any plan filed pursuant to the preceding paragraph to provide (a) that the insured will be given a list of <em>at least five </em>registered repair shops, geographically convenient for the insured, from which the insured may at his or her option select a shop, which will without undue delay complete the repair work <em>for the amount of the payment to the insured, </em>plus any applicable deductible ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201c(e) ... No repair shop, or employee, owner or agent thereof, shall give or pay, or offer to give or pay, <em>any thing of value </em>to any person <em>in exchange for being included, or as an inducement to be included, </em>on such a list of repair shops . , .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 24, 4th par.; \u00a7 51, 3d par.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">a. <em>Transition period and waiver. </em>The regulation promulgated by the commissioner does require all plans to provide that insurers give insureds a list of at least five repair shops, with two exceptions. First; it allowed a one-year transition period in 1989, during which insurers were permitted to have fewer than five shops on their referral lists while they built up the lists to reach the five-shop minimum. 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (2) (a). Second, it provides that, even after the transition period, insurers may petition for a waiver of the five-shop minimum based on \u201cspecific facts regarding market share, geographic location, availability of repair shops, or other circumstances.\u201d 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (2) (c). The association contends that both the transition period and the waiver provision go beyond the commissioner\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The transition period expired at the end of 1989, making the question of its validity moot. See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782 (1984); <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>367 Mass. 293, 298 (1975). Because it is not capable of repetition, we need not address the issue further. <em>Lockhart, supra </em>at 783-785. <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Superintendent, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>389 Mass. 883, 887 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">With respect to the waiver provision, the association argues that the word \u201cmay\u201d in the relevant statutory language gives the commissioner discretion only so far as the choice whether to implement a referral list program. Once he chooses to implement such a program, it is argued, the commissioner has no discretion to permit any list to name fewer than \u201cat least five\u201d shops under any circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\u201c[W]e must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). Furthermore, when an agency is given \u201ca broad grant of authority to implement a program of reform or social welfare, the administrative agency generally has a wide range of discretion in establishing the parameters of its authority pursuant to the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 525 (1979). See <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The commissioner interprets the statutory language, stating what he \u201cmay\u201d require any plan to provide, as giving him discretion to decide what the direct payment plans should include. The contrasting mandatory language in a preceding paragraph supports this interpretation. There, the statute requires that a direct payment plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\"><em>\u201cshall </em>not be approved unless it: (a) provides for a procedure acceptable to the commissioner to resolve any dispute between the insured and the insurer as to the adequacy of the payment; (b) provides for adequate disclosure to the insured of his or her rights hereunder; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>and (c) contains such other terms and conditions as the commissioner shall prescribe\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 24, 2d par.; \u00a7 51, 2d par.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">In addition to giving the commissioner discretion to decide whether to implement a referral list system at all, and authority to prescribe what terms and conditions direct payment plans shall contain, the statute also expressly grants the commissioner \u201cauthority to promulgate such rules and regulations as he deems necessary for the implementation\u201d of a direct payment system. St. 1988, c. 373, \u00a7 24, 3d par.; \u00a7 51, 2d par. The commissioner concluded that a waiver provision was necessary for the referral list program to be implemented at all in geographical areas with a small number of registered repair shops. The commissioner could reasonably interpret the broad authority granted him to implement the statute as permitting him to make an adjustment such as the waiver provision rather than deny insureds in those areas the benefits of a referral list system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">b. <em>Supplemental payment. </em>The regulation provides for approval of plans under which shops will complete repair work \u201cfor the amount of the direct payment to the insured plus any applicable deductible, plus any supplemental payment authorized by the insurer.\u201d 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (3) (a) (ii). The \u201cdirect\u201d payment is the amount paid to the insured before the repair is completed, based on the insurer\u2019s initial appraisal. 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.05 (1). A supplemental payment may be made only after a claimant disputes the initial appraisal as underestimating the actual cost of repairs. See 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.05 (3). This may occur when, for instance, damage is discovered during the repair process which was not visible at the time of the initial appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>The association claims that the language of the act, authorizing the commissioner to approve plans under which shops will complete repair work \u201cfor the amount of the payment to the insured plus any applicable deductible,\u201d permits only a single pre-repair payment in the amount of the initial appraisal, plus any deductible, and no further payment. The association argues that allowing supplemental payments to shops to which the claimants have already been referred puts them at an unfair competitive advantage: shops will dishonestly claim they can complete repairs for the amount of the initial appraisal, intending to get a supplemental payment later, in order to lure business away from shops which admit from the start that they cannot complete the work for the appraisal amount.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We must uphold the regulation if it can be interpreted in harmony with the act by any reasonable construction. <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). The supplemental payment provision can easily be interpreted as in harmony with the act. The act is silent as to precisely how or when \u201cthe payment to the insured\u201d shall be made, and does not prohibit supplemental payments of the type authorized by the regulation. Moreover, the act expressly requires that no direct payment plan shall be approved \u201cunless it . . . provides for a procedure acceptable to the commissioner to resolve any dispute between the insured and the insurer as to the adequacy of the payment.\u201d St. 1988, c. 373, \u00a7 24, 2d par. (a); \u00a7 51, 2d par. (a). It is difficult to imagine how certain disputes about the adequacy of payment could be resolved without some provision for supplemental payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In response to the association\u2019s concerns about shops on referral lists receiving an unfair advantage, we note that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>claimant who successfully disputes the initial appraisal is entitled to a supplemental payment whether or not the repair shop he or she has used is on the referral list.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.05 (3). Whether insurers will approve supplemental payments evenhandedly is not before us in this case. We decide here only that the provision, on its face, does not conflict with the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">c. <em>Discount. </em>The regulation mirrors part (e) of the relevant sections of the act by stating: \u201cNo repair shop, or employee, owner or agent thereof, shall give or pay, or offer to give or pay, any thing of value to any person in exchange for being included, or as an inducement for being included, on an insurer\u2019s list of repair shops.\u201d 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (8) (a). The regulation, however, goes on to provide: \u201cA discount on parts, glass, labor rate or other item or customer service in connection with the repair of motor vehicles offered by a repair shop to an insurer shall not constitute a \u2018payment, gift or any other thing of value\u2019 for purposes of [the previous subsection].\u201d 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06 (8) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The association claims this provision violates part (e) of \u00a7 24, 4th par., and \u00a7 51, 3d par., of the act. The commissioner argues that an arrangement negotiated between an insurer and a repair shop for a bona fide discount on certain repair costs does not constitute the kind of illegitimate kickback, unrelated to services provided, that part (e) was meant to prohibit. On the contrary, the commissioner claims, it reflects a continuation of the commissioner\u2019s practice, approved by this court in <em>Massachusetts Auto. Rating &amp; Accident Prevention Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>401 Mass. 282, 299-301 (1987), of encouraging insurance companies to negotiate with repair shops for reduced repair costs. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>fact that the act\u2019s purpose was to promote lower insurance costs, and that the act explicitly allows an insurer to consider the cost of repairs at a particular shop in determining which repair shops shall be included on its referral lists, St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 24, 4th par. (d); \u00a7 51, 3d par. (d), the commissioner\u2019s interpretation is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The association also claims the provision conflicts with G. L. c. 100A, \u00a7 8 (c) (1988 ed.),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which states that no registered automobile repair shop shall \u201ccharge or offer to charge a higher rate or discount for an insured repair than for an uninsured repair.\u201d Since nothing in the regulation prevents a repair shop from offering the same discount to an uninsured customer, we cannot say that, on its face, the provision conflicts with G. L. c. 100A, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">2. <em>Emergency regulation. </em>Initially, in December, 1988, 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.00 was promulgated as an emergency regulation. The association claims the emergency regulation was invalid under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7 (1988 ed.), because the commissioner did not have sufficient reason for issuing it on an emergency basis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Because the emergency regulation was replaced by a final regulation in February, 1989, this procedural objection is, arguably, moot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, even if reviewed on its merits, the association\u2019s argument would fail. In <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309, 323 (1984), this court held that an agency\u2019s finding of an emergency is given every presumption in its favor and is not subject to question unless palpably wrong. In the instant case the commissioner deemed the emergency regulation nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>essary to get the direct payment system into place quickly, so that savings could be realized and consumers could benefit from lower insurance rates in 1989, as the Legislature intended. If the agency\u2019s reason for the emergency regulation in <em>American Grain Prods, </em>withstood challenge, it certainly must do so here. Furthermore, the Legislature itself specifically acknowledged the emergency. The act\u2019s preamble declares it to be \u201can emergency law,\u201d the deferred operation of which \u201cwould tend to defeat its purpose\u201d immediately to lower the cost of automobile insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">3. <em>Approval of insurers\u2019 plans. </em>The association raises two procedural challenges to approval by the commissioner of the defendant insurers\u2019 plans. First, it claims, for the first time on appeal, that the hearing on approval of the plans should have been an adjudicatory proceeding, but even if the hearing was not required to be adjudicatory, it did not follow the proper procedures even for a rulemaking proceeding. Second, the association claims the agency violated its own requirement, at 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.04 (5), of ten days\u2019 advance notice of a hearing for approval of the Kemper and Arbella plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In order successfully to challenge the agency\u2019s action based on procedural errors, the association must demonstrate that the errors have harmed its substantial rights. <em>AmherstPelham Regional School Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 497 (1978). The association fails to make this showing. It participated in the hearing with both oral and written comments, and, except for the claim that the hearing should have been adjudicatory, it raises no new objections on appeal that it did not raise at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Even if the association could make a showing of substantial harm, however, its procedural objection would fail. We could not decide the merits of the first objection because, if the hearing was adjudicatory, the association is not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the decision and cannot appeal it. At best, some of the association\u2019s members <em>may </em>suffer competitive injury as a result of <em>implementation </em>of the plans. This is too indirect and speculative an effect to make the association a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>\u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d See <em>Group Ins. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>381 Mass. 199, 204 (1980); <em>Shaker Community, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Mass. 213 (1963). If, on the other hand, the hearing was a rulemaking proceeding, the association was a party and waived its right to challenge the conduct of the hearing because it did not raise the issue before the agency. See <em>Vaspourakan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 347, 354 (1987); <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Older Americans, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>393 Mass. 404, 413-414 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">With regard to the second procedural objection, the commissioner argues that ten days\u2019 advance notice was required only for plans filed to become effective <em>after </em>January 1, 1989. With respect to plans filed to become effective on January 1, 1989, including the three plans at issue here, the commissioner had only to \u201cschedule the hearing thereon for such date as will allow full and fair consideration of the plan[s].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.04 (5). In the absence of clear error, an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to deference. We will overturn such an interpretation only if it is arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the rule itself. <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 782 (1980). See <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 74 (1985). The commissioner\u2019s interpretation of his regulation in this case was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Finally, the association claims the Kemper and Arbella plans should not have been approved because they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>meet the substantive requirements of the regulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The regulation states: \u201cNo plan shall be approved unless it contains each of the following [specified] provisions.\u201d 211 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 123.05. However, the Kemper and Arbella plans do not contain any of the guidelines for inclusion of shops on their referral lists set out in 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 123.06.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plans do provide for repair certification forms that notify insureds of their right to be given a list of repair shops. Also, in his decisions approving each of the plans, the commissioner asserted that the statement of Kemper and Arbella\u2019s representative submitted at the hearing \u201cassures the Division that [Kemper and Arbella\u2019s] direct payment plan[s] will include a referral shop program which will follow the timetable and other requirements of 211 Code Mass. Regs. 123.06.\u201d The commissioner directed Kemper and Arbella to incorporate counsel\u2019s statement into their plans, \u201cthereby binding [them] to the regulations governing the nature and operation of referral shop programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Counsel\u2019s statement is not in the record before us. The association does not say in its brief that the referral shop component would be insufficient even with counsel\u2019s statement, but in its complaint it says, \u201cAlthough the commissioner\u2019s decisions mandate the inclusion of such a component in the Kemper and Arbella plans, approval of such plans is given without revelation of the specifics of such component.\u201d The commissioner had discretion to approve the plans subject to the assurances given by counsel at the hearing. If the association wishes to contest the implementation of the plans as being contrary to counsel\u2019s assurances, it may raise that issue before the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-15\">The plaintiff is a trade association with a membership of about 680 of the approximately 2,000 auto body repair shops in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company, American Motorists Insurance Company, and American Protection Insurance Company, doing business as The Kemper National Property &amp; Casualty Companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The bureau, an insurance rating organization, has since changed its name to the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\">The portions of \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 51 at issue are virtually identical in every respect, except that \u00a7 24 amended G.

However, the commissioner was authorized to approve the plans whether or not any regulations were in effect, St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 51, 2d pars., and the plans would have been approved under the identical final regulations at any rate. The association also argues that the issue of sufficiency of the reason for an emergency regulation evades review if it can be rendered moot by the agency quickly replacing the emergency regulation with a final regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The emergency regulation states, in pertinent part: \u201c <em>Timing of Hearing. </em>With respect to any plan for which a hearing is required and which is filed to be effective on January 1, 1989, the Commissioner shall schedule the hearing thereon for such date as will allow a full and fair consideration of the plan .... With respect to any other plan for which a hearing is required, the Commissioner shall schedule the hearing thereon to begin no less than 21 days after the plan is filed. The party filing the plan and other persons affected shall be notified of the date of the hearing at least ten days in advance.\u201d 211 Code Mass.
