A divided panel of the Appeals Court concluded that the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the challenge. See 28 Mass. App. Ct. 724, 728 (1990). We disagree, and conclude that the trial judge should have disallowed the challenge. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The defendant, a black man, was convicted of murder in the second degree as the result of the stabbing death of a student at a fraternity party at a college in Cambridge. The Appeals Court opinion states the following account of the juror challenge issue which we quote in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u201cDuring the empanelment of the jury, the prosecutor used one of his peremptory challenges to exclude a black woman. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, pointing out that she was the only black person on the panel. The judge asked the prosecutor for his reasons. The latter responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u2018First of all, Your Honor, I would note that this is not a black on white crime . . . [both the victim and the defendant are black]. She reminds me, frankly, of the defendant\u2019s mother who collapsed hysterically at the arraignment and I assume will be here continually through the trial. I\u2019m just afraid that would affect her ability \u2014 the resemblance that I find between her and the mother would affect her ability to sit impartially. She is also from Cambridge and there is going to be a young woman I understand is going to testify for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>defense from Cambridge. Even though she says she does not know her, I\u2019m afraid she might tend to believe that woman more who is going to represent a different view of the evidence, I assume a different view of the evidence, than witnesses who are going to be called on behalf of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u2018There is certainly no pattern of challenging jurors because of race. It\u2019s the only black on the panel at this point.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cThe defendant objected on the grounds that, despite the prosecutor\u2019s disclaimers, the only reason for the challenge was that the woman was black. He said, \u2018the only resemblance [to the defendant\u2019s mother] is that she\u2019s black,\u2019 and the witness from Cambridge also is black. The only reason \u2018you think this [juror] might relate to her [is] because [the witness is] black.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u201cThe judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u2018I\u2019m not going to prevent the challenge. It\u2019s not a pattern. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that the one black juror isn\u2019t \u2014 one black potential juror won\u2019t end up sitting as a juror on this particular case. I think that\u2019s regrettable, but there is not a pattern and the government submits sufficient reason that I don\u2019t think that I should bar the peremptory challenge. It should only be done under certain carefully articulated circumstances. As I say, I feel it\u2019s unfortunate, but I\u2019m not in a position to block it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u201cOn the next day of trial \u2014 the jury had not yet been sworn \u2014 the prosecutor informed the judge that although the Commonwealth\u2019s position was that the peremptory challenge was exercised with appropriate reasons, he would not object to a request that the judge, in his discretion, discharge the jury and begin again simply to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The defendant rejected the offer \u2018for the simple reason that there is no guarantee that a new panel will produce any blacks, considering the situation in Middlesex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>County.\u2019 The judge put on the record that he had ruled in the lobby that he would not start a fresh empanelment. While expressing his \u2018personal regret that ... the one individual who was black was excluded through a peremptory challenge,\u2019 he was \u2018satisfied\u2019 with the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u2018One of the reasons was the Commonwealth desired to strike individuals who lived in Cambridge. I carefully monitored the Commonwealth\u2019s challenges during the empanelment process, and all but one Cambridge person were in fact challenged by the Commonwealth. For those reasons, as I said, I\u2019m not going to interfere with the process.\u2019 \u201d 28 Mass. App. Ct. at 725-727.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the allowance of the challenge violated rights guaranteed him by both art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely because of bias presumed to derive from their membership in discrete community groups is prohibited both by art. 12, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486-488, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and the equal protection clause, see <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 84-88 (1986). Under these decisions, once the party contesting a peremptory challenge rebuts the ordinary presumption that the challenge was properly used by making a showing of an improper basis for the challenge, the challenging party must provide, if possible, a neutral explanation establishing that the challenge is unrelated to the prospective juror\u2019s group affiliation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 491; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra </em>at 97-98. Evidence of a pattern of challenges of members of the same discrete group as the defendant is sufficient to rebut the presumption of proper use of challenges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 473 n.8, 486-488 (involving challenges to twelve black persons in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>venire); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>395 Mass. 568, 571 (1985) (involving challenges to twelve female persons in the venire).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">However, a pattern of challenges is not the exclusive basis on which a party can make a prima facie showing of impropriety, because the principles stated in the <em>Soares </em>and <em>Bat-son </em>decisions apply as well to the peremptory challenge of a single prospective juror within a protected class. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 407 n.17 (1979) (assuming that the peremptory challenge of the lone black member of venire could be improper under Soares); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 553 (1981) (\u201c[T]he dismissal [from the jury venire] of the only member of a [discrete] group is as repugnant to the Declaration of Rights as the dismissal of all but one member of the [same] group\u201d). See, e.g., <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>909 F.2d 84, 88 (3d Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>866 F.2d 103, 105 (4th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>David, </em>803 F.2d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir. 1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on this premise, courts of other jurisdictions have held or assumed that the use of a peremptory challenge to remove the only prospective juror who belongs to the same discrete group as the defendant by itself constitutes a prima facie case of impropriety or discrimination in the use of the challenge. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Horsley, </em>864 F.2d 1543, 1544-1546 (11th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cloyd, </em>819 F.2d 836, 837-838 (8th Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Love, </em>815 F.2d 53, 54-55 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 484 U.S. 861 (1987); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 Md. 50, 84-87 (1988); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>295 Ark. 341, 348-351 (1988); <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>State, </em>514 So.2d. 374, 375-376 (Fla. App. 1987); <em>Saadiq </em>v. <em>State, </em>387 N.W.2d 315, 326 (Iowa), appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 878 (1986); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>762 P.2d 959, 961-962 (Okla. App. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>94 Or. App. 87, 91-92 (1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra, </em>we identified as a fundamental feature of a fair jury representation of a broad cross-section of the community. See 377 Mass, at 478. This basic characteristic of a fair jury should be maintained, we stated, because it furthered a \u201ckey objective,\u201d the \u201cassurance of a diffused impartiality\u201d on the part of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 480, quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 530-531 (1975). This objective remains one of critical importance, and is no less pressing when, as in this case, there is only one person in the particular jury venire who belongs to the same discrete community group as the defendant. Indeed, because there is a very real risk in such cases that <em>all </em>members of a particular group might be excluded from service, the chances that a final jury of truly diffuse impartiality will be assembled are significantly reduced. To make the objective of diffuse impartiality meaningful when this occurs, we hold that a party contesting the use of a single peremptory challenge can make a prima facie showing rebutting the presumption that the challenge was properly used simply by demonstrating that he is a member of a constitutionally protected, discrete community group, and that the only prospective juror of the same group has been peremptorily challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge allowed the disputed challenge because: (1) there was no pattern of challenges, and (2) he con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>eluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s purported reasons for the challenge were sufficient. The judge\u2019s reliance on the fact that there was no pattern of challenges of black persons was incorrect as a matter of law. The defendant made a prima facie showing that the challenge was improper by pointing out that the challenged person was the only black person on the venire. The second basis on which the judge allowed the peremptory challenge \u2014 the determination that the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons for the challenge were sufficient \u2014 also will not withstand scrutiny. The Commonwealth advanced four reasons in support of its challenge, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">First, the prosecutor claimed to have challenged the black person because \u201c[s]he reminds me ... of the defendant\u2019s mother .... I\u2019m afraid that . . . resemblance . . . would affect her ability to sit impartially.\u201d At the time of this bench conference, however, the only evident similarity between the two women was their skin color and gender: both were black and women.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Second, the prosecutor contended that his challenge was based on the fact that the person was from Cambridge, and that he was concerned that she would find more believable a defense witness (also black) from Cambridge. If this purported basis for the challenge was more than a pretext, however, the prosecutor should have used one of his remaining peremptory challenges to remove a white male, also a Cambridge resident, whom he allowed to remain on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Third, the prosecutor noted that the defendant\u2019s mother became hysterical at the arraignment. This point was irrelevant. There was no reason to think that the black woman in the venire would not be able to sit and judge the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>impartially simply because there was evidence that the defendant\u2019s mother was highly emotional at a preliminary stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Fourth, and finally, the prosecutor pointed out that both the defendant and the victim were black. This fact is not irrelevant to analysis of a <em>Soares </em>issue. Nevertheless, it does not detract from the defendant\u2019s right to be protected from the Commonwealth\u2019s improper use of peremptory challenges, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Little, 384 Mass. 262, 265 (1981) and, by itself, does not justify the challenge. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge, suffused as it was with racial and gender-based overtones, plainly was not for neutral reasons unrelated to the prospective juror\u2019s group membership. The judge should have disallowed the challenge and, unless a challenge for cause could be made, ordered the person seated. See <em>id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As the Appeals Court correctly recognized, trial judges possess broad discretion to decide questions regarding the use of peremptory challenges. That discretion, however, is not unlimited, and courts have not hesitated to reverse convictions based in part on an improper jury-selection process. See, e.g., <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Ryan, supra, United States </em>v. <em>Chinchilla, </em>874 F.2d 695 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Horsley, supra, United States </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>817 F.2d 1538 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>Gamble </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Ga. 325 (1987). The defendant made a prima facie showing that the Commonwealth\u2019s challenge of the sole black person was improper. The Commonwealth subsequently failed to justify the challenge with a persuasive neutral reason unrelated to the defendant\u2019s group membership. The defendant\u2019s conviction was obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees, and must be reversed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 492-493; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We discuss the issues likely to occur at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">(a) <em>Victim\u2019s father as witness. </em>The defendant contended that it was improper for the prosecutor to have called the victim\u2019s father as a witness. We agree with the Appeals Court that no \u201ccalculated impropriety\u201d has been shown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the use of the witness, and that the witness may be called at retrial unless new reasons are advanced to persuade the trial judge that the prosecutor is purposely calling the witness to attract sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">(b) <em>Hearsay statement. </em>Shortly before the confrontation during which the victim was stabbed, a woman who knew the defendant, and was in attendance at the party, told the victim that some people at the party were getting ready to fight. The woman then warned the victim not to go outside because \u201cthey might be carrying [knives].\u201d The woman testified to this conversation at trial over the defendant\u2019s objection. The defendant argues that this testimony was the functional equivalent of improper character evidence because the witness had not seen a knife, but only inferred that the defendant had one because she knew him. Therefore, the defendant argues, the testimony suggested to the jury that the defendant was known to carry a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">While we agree with the Appeals Court that the evidence had some relevance because it related to the victim\u2019s state of mind (which was material because the defendant\u2019s case essentially was that the victim was the aggressor), there is active danger that a jury could misuse the evidence. As the Appeals Court noted, there was other evidence apart from this testimony that the victim could have known that the defendant was armed with a knife. The statement thus tends unfairly to prejudice the defendant and at the same time is cumulative of other evidence. It should not be admitted on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">(c) <em>Presence of the victim advocate. </em>A victim advocate sat with the victim\u2019s mother in the courtroom during the trial. Near the beginning of the trial, defense counsel observed the advocate holding the mother\u2019s hand, and objected. This handholding apparently occurred at other times during the course of the trial. Defense counsel renewed his objection at the end of the trial and also referred to the conduct in his motion for a new trial. The trial judge found the handholding \u201cunfortunate and avoidable,\u201d but not enough to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Comments about the role of victim advocates in the courtroom are in order. The victim advocates serve an important and salutary function. They provide victims, witnesses, and family members needed assistance, information, and support, and generally help them to cope with the realities of the criminal justice system and the disruption of personal affairs attending a criminal prosecution during a time of personal trauma. See G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5 (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">At the same time, however, the work of the victim advocate cannot be allowed to impair a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial. The danger of unfair prejudice to a defendant\u2019s case because of a perception by a jury that an agent of the district attorney is manifestly sympathetic to the victim or a family member is apparent. Such a situation can be analogized to an endorsement by the Commonwealth of the credibility of the victim or family member and, by extension, of any testimony that they might be called to give. The situation may also amount to a subtle (but nonetheless dramatic) appeal to the emotions of the jury that is unrelated to the hard factual questions presented by the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">For these reasons, the judge should pay particular attention to the behavior and demeanor of a victim advocate at any time when the jury is present. Visible displays of consolation, support, or sympathy (for example: crying, handholding, and hugging) should not be permitted. If potentially prejudicial conduct does occur, remedial action should be taken sua sponte. At the discretion of the judge, contemporaneous curative instructions should be employed. A supplemental jury instruction at the close of the evidence may also be appropriate. Other measures may also be necessary depending on the circumstances of a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Beyond these general admonitions and suggestions, we leave it to trial judges to draw on their experience and wisdom to respond to these issues on a case-by-case basis. Our paramount concern is that defendants\u2019 fair trial rights remain uncompromised by extraneous influences and that unnecessary issues not be created for argument on appeal. So long as these goals are met, and consistent with the require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>merits of effective courtroom management, victim advocates should not be restrained in their valuable efforts to serve the needs of their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The assistant attorney general conceded this point at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A1x\">See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roan Eagle, </em>867 F.2d 436, 441 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 490 U.S. 1028 (1989) (noting that party can make prima facie case that challenges were improper by showing that 100% of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>spective jurors in party\u2019s discrete group were challenged); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chalan, </em>812 F.2d 1302, 1314 (10th Cir. 1987) (same); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>(same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Although conceding that the defendant properly raised and did not waive the <em>Soares </em>issue, the Commonwealth nevertheless argues that, because the defendant did not agree to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s offer (made so as to avoid any \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d) of a fresh empanelment, this court should not reach the merits of this issue. This contention is unpersuasive. The judge refused to interfere with the empanelment process because he found the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation for the disputed challenge valid, <em>not </em>because the defendant was reluctant to re-do empanelment. (Defense counsel rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s offer because, in his considerable experience, few black people appeared in Middlesex County jury venires, so he felt that there was no real prospect that there would be any in a second venire.) The defendant\u2019s position regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s offer was reasonable, and, in the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>this case, we conclude that the rejection of the remedy should not foreclose decision of the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">We will not assume that the prosecutor was referring to age or some other neutral linkage between the two women when he used the term \u201cresemblance.\u201d If the prosecutor had in mind some other articulable similarity between the two women that might affect the prospective juror\u2019s ability to be impartial, he should have brought it to the judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b487-7\">Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABI\">(dissenting).

There was a sound basis for the judge\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s challenge was founded on a neutral reason. This court\u2019s holding today flies in the face of the trial judge\u2019s thoughtful ruling and the well-considered opinion of the Appeals Court. It is regrettable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
