Carr, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and trafficking in cocaine (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A, 32E [1988 ed.]), a Superior Court judge declared a mistrial on Poretta\u2019s motion. Poretta subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that retrial was barred by double jeopardy principles under both State and Federal law. Another Superior Court judge denied the motion. Poretta then sought similar relief before a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.). The single justice denied his petition and the defendant appeals. We affirm the single justice\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced the eyewitness testimony of two Salem police officers from which the jury could have found the following facts. Robert Carr agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>sell cocaine to an undercover police officer, who met Carr for that purpose in a Salem parking lot at 7:20 p.m. on August 18, 1988. While sitting in the officer\u2019s unmarked vehicle, the officer gave Carr $1,600, whereupon Carr got out of the vehicle saying, \u201cMy connection is around the corner. I have to go give them the money.\u201d Carr walked across the street and approached a pickup truck operated by Poretta. Kim Sullivan was in the passenger seat of the truck. Carr handed the cash to Poretta, conversed with Poretta briefly, then returned to the undercover officer\u2019s vehicle. Carr instructed the officer to \u201cjust drive around,\u201d which they did for approximately ten minutes before pulling into the parking lot behind a \u201cfast food\u201d restaurant in Salem. The pickup truck entered the lot behind them and then parked in an adjacent lot. Carr again approached the truck, spoke with Poretta (whom the undercover officer recognized from past dealings) and Sullivan, and put his hands in the truck. He then returned to the officer\u2019s car and handed the officer a bag containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Carr testified in his own defense. On cross-examination, he absolved Sullivan and Poretta of any complicity in the drug transaction (although he admitted that, by coincidence, they were also at the scene) and implicated another individual as the cocaine supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">After Carr related his version of the events, Sullivan\u2019s attorney asked to be heard at sidebar. There Sullivan\u2019s attorney stated that Carr\u2019s testimony was \u201cat complete variance\u201d with his earlier statement of the facts in a discussion among Carr and the attorneys representing Carr, Poretta, and Sullivan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Noting that he brought this issue to the judge\u2019s attention \u201cin my capacity as an officer of the court\u201d and \u201cto protect my client\u2019s rights,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial. Poretta\u2019s lawyer adopted these statements and joined in the motion for mistrial. The Commonwealth objected, offering that Carr could be \u201crehabilitated\u201d on redirect examination, but Poretta\u2019s attorney argued that Carr\u2019s testimony would \u201ccompound what I conceive as prejudice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>confusion in the minds of the jurors against my client and Miss Sullivan.\u201d The judge granted the motions for mistrial with respect to Sullivan and Poretta based in part on the possibility of prejudice to their defenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trial of Carr resumed with redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Poretta then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment arguing that retrial was barred by State and Federal double jeopardy principles. In an accompanying affidavit he stated that his attorney never consulted with him before requesting the mistrial and that the implications of a mistrial were never explained to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further asserted: \u201cI thought Robert Carr\u2019s testimony was helpful to my case because he told the jury that I was not involved with the drug deal for which I was being charged.\u201d A Superior Court judge denied Poretta\u2019s motion, ruling that the attorney\u2019s \u201ctactical decision\u201d to request a mistrial \u201cdid not require the personal consent of Poretta in order to avoid violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Under both Federal and Massachusetts law, the protection against double jeopardy does not bar retrial after a mistrial is declared on a defendant\u2019s motion, absent prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke the defendant to move for a mistrial. See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679 (1982); <em>Mercedes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>405 Mass. 693, 696 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 373-374 (1989). Poretta does not allege that the prosecutor intentionally goaded him into moving for a mistrial in this case, however. In fact, the prosecutor opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Rather, Poretta contends that this mistrial motion constituted a waiver of his right not to be placed twice in jeopardy, and that such a waiver must satisfy the \u201cknowing, intelligent, and voluntary\u201d standard established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458 (1938). Thus, Poretta claims, the trial judge was obligated to inquire either of Poretta\u2019s lawyer or of Poretta himself whether he assented to the motion for mistrial. Because the judge failed to conduct such a colloquy, Poretta concludes that his \u201cwaiver\u201d of the protection against multiple prosecutions was invalid. Therefore, Poretta suggests, retrial should be permitted only if the mistrial was justified by \u201cmanifest necessity,\u201d the exacting standard governing retrial after a mistrial is granted over the defendant\u2019s objection. See Kennedy, <em>supra </em>at 672. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The Supreme Court has squarely rejected the argument that a defendant\u2019s mistrial motion must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary in order for a retrial to be permissible under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609-610 n.11 (1976). Following the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Dinitz, </em>there can be no doubt that the Federal Constitution does not condition the permissibility of retrial on the defendant\u2019s personal, explicit assent to a mistrial motion brought by his attorney. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>621 F.2d 350, 352-353 n.3 (9th Cir. 1980), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1087 (1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>586 F.2d 355, 363-365 (5th Cir. 1978), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 976 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Therefore, Poretta\u2019s argument reduces to an invitation to this court to create such a requirement under the double jeopardy principles of Massachusetts law. We decline to do so. We have held that the standard for barring retrial on double jeopardy grounds is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d under Federal and Massachusetts law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>404 Mass. 1, 4 (1989). We see no reason to depart from this guideline here because we agree with the balancing of interests embodied in the Federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The case law defining the ban on double jeopardy, in broad strokes, represents an accommodation of the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding oppressive multiple prosecutions and the public interest in just results. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 447-448 (1988), quoting <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 682-683 (Stevens, J., concurring). Thus, the defendant\u2019s interests \u201cmust be balanced against society\u2019s interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to the jury.\u201d <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 682 (Stevens, J., concurring). We conclude that a requirement that the defendant personally and knowingly consent to a mistrial motion-brought on his behalf would weigh too heavily in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">A mistrial is not always inimical to the defendant\u2019s interests. \u201cIn the event of severely prejudicial error a defendant might well consider an immediate new trial a preferable alternative to the prospect of a probable conviction followed by an appeal, a reversal of the conviction, and a later retrial.\u201d <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 610. \u201cIn such circumstances, a defendant\u2019s mistrial request has objectives not unlike the interests served by the Double Jeopardy Clause \u2014 the avoidance of the anxiety, expense, and delay occasioned by multiple prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In this light, a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial is distinguishable from the waiver of a constitutional right, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the right to counsel, which must satisfy the \u201cknowing, intelligent, and voluntary\u201d standard. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458 (1938). While a mistrial may promote the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding double jeopardy, a waiver by definition subverts the relevant constitutionally protected interests of the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For this reason, we too reject the analogy between a defendant\u2019s mistrial request and the waiver of a constitutional right. Accord <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 609 &amp; n.11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">In addition, the defendant\u2019s argument undervalues the State\u2019s legitimate prosecutorial interest. A fundamental goal underlying the protection against double jeopardy is to safeguard against too-zealous use of the State\u2019s accusatory power by prohibiting the State from making repeated attempts to convict an individual for the same offense. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-188 (1957). The concern in this case is not the State\u2019s relentless pursuit of Poretta, however, but Poretta\u2019s claim that his attorney erred by letting exculpatory testimony slip away before consulting with him. If the lack of a knowing waiver were a bar to retrial in these circumstances, the State would be deprived of its right to \u201cone complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws,\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 509 (1978), without a hint of governmental misconduct or overreaching. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bobo, supra </em>at 364, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jamison, </em>505 F.2d 407, 413 (D.C. Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>That sacrifice of the State\u2019s interest is too great, and the corresponding benefit to the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests too small, to justify the rule for which Poretta argues. We hold that, under Massachusetts law, the permissibility of reprosecution of a defendant following the defendant\u2019s successful motion for mistrial does not depend on whether the motion satisfied the \u201cknowing, intelligent, and voluntary\u201d standard of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458 (1938). The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes no such requirement. <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 609 n.11. Therefore, the declaration of a mistrial in this case on Poretta\u2019s motion does not bar a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Poretta\u2019s counsel for this appeal did not represent him at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In declaring the mistrial, the judge noted in part: \u201c[A]s I listened to the testimony of Carr, I believe, and I find, that the jury could adopt a position which would be prejudicial to Sullivan and Poretta. The testimony, in my view \u2014 and I am not the finder of fact here \u2014 might well be viewed by the jury as untrue when weighed against the testimony of the officers in the case. Should the jury adopt such a view, it would be to the detriment of Sullivan and Poretta.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The affidavit states in part: \u201cAt no point did my attorney ever tell me that he had asked the court for a mistrial. I was never asked if I wanted a mistrial or explained what would happen if a mistrial occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\"><em>Walker </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>620 F,2d 683 (8th Cir. 1980), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1085 (1981), on which Poretta relies, is inapposite. In that case, the court found that the trial judge granted a mistrial motion made on the defendant\u2019s behalf knowing that the defendant had expressed opposition to the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 687. In ruling that counsel was not entitled to waive a constitutional right under the facts of that case, the <em>Walker </em>court relied on <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1 (1966). See <em>Walker, supra </em>at 686-687. <em>Brookhart </em>stands for the narrow proposition that counsel does not have the \u201cpower to enter a [guilty] plea which is inconsistent with his client\u2019s <em>expressed </em>desire and thereby waive his client\u2019s constitutional right\u201d to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>front the witnesses against him (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 7. The instant case is factually distinguishable from both <em>Walker </em>and <em>Brookhart, </em>because here the defendant never expressed his opposition to his attorney\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Dinitz </em>concluded: \u201c [Traditional waiver concepts have little relevance where the defendant must determine whether or not to request or consent to a mistrial in response to judicial or prosecutorial error. . . . The important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error.\u201d <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Under this analysis, it is of little consequence that in this particular case the declaration of a mistrial arguably harmed Poretta\u2019s interests by denying him the benefit of Carr\u2019s exculpatory, albeit perjurious, testimony. We note, however, that both the trial judge and the motion judge found that the mistrial served Poretta\u2019s interests. The trial judge found, in part, that the jury might view Carr\u2019s testimony as untrue and that this conclusion would prejudice their evaluation of Poretta\u2019s credibility.
