The commission\u2019s decision restricts construction on a lot the plaintiffs own in Edgartown. We transferred the case here on our motion, and we now re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>verse on the ground that the commission lacked jurisdiction under St. 1977, c. 831, amending St. 1974, c. 637, to review a proposed building on the plaintiffs\u2019 lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We begin with a brief overview of the mission and procedures of the agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the commission is to preserve the island\u2019s many natural and historical treasures \u201cby protecting these values from development and uses which would impair them, and by promoting the enhancement of sound local economies.\u201d St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 1 (hereinafter the enabling statute). Therefore the enabling statute, in pertinent part, authorizes the commission to review \u201cdevelopments of regional impact\u201d (DRI), <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 13, which the statute defines as developments which, \u201cbecause of their magnitude or the magnitude of their effect on the surrounding environment, are likely to present development issues significant to more than one municipality of the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12. Local agencies may not grant a development permit for a DRI without the commission\u2019s approval. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Section 13 of the enabling statute authorizes local permitting agencies to refer such applications to the commission for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 13, after concluding that a project will have regional impact as determined by criteria promulgated by the commission, the \u201cgovernmental agency within each municipality which has responsibility for issuing a development permit\u201d shall refer the permit application to the commission. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 13. The commission has formulated \u201cstandards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>criteria\u201d and an administrative checklist, generally focusing on the size or commercial nature of the project, to guide the agency\u2019s determination of whether a project is a DRI. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 7, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">In addition, the commission itself has established an alternative procedure for referral of projects to the commission. Under the commission\u2019s regulation 3.101 (reproduced in full in the margin), any town or State agency may request that the commission designate a proposed construction project in another town as a DRI. According to the regulation, after such a \u201ccross-town referral,\u201d the commission, rather than the local permitting agency where the project is located, may declare the project to be a DRI if it satisfies at least one of the considerations listed in St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. The plaintiffs (who are brother and sister) own a parcel of vacant, waterfront land on North Water Street in Edgartown, overlooking Edgartown Harbor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 6, 1985, the plaintiff Bourne applied to the Edgartown building inspector for the necessary permit to build a guest house on the lot, construction of which was permitted under the Edgartown zoning bylaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">On February 25, 1986, the selectmen of Edgartown concluded that the town could not refer the proposed building to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the commission for review because it did not satisfy the criteria for a DRI as delineated in the commission\u2019s \u201cstandards and criteria\u201d and administrative checklist. Therefore, the Edgartown selectmen decided to ask the selectmen of West Tisbury to refer the application to the commission for review as a \u201ccross-town referral.\u201d The Edgartown selectmen wrote to their counterparts in West Tisbury that a building on the site would block the scenic vista from North Water Street to Edgartown Harbor and the island of Chappaquiddick, and therefore that the proposed construction was \u201ca regional issue for obvious reasons.\u201d One week later, the board of selectmen of West Tisbury voted to make the cross-town referral to the commission, noting that \u201cit will give Edgartown an opportunity to comment on this proposed project.\u201d The chairman of the West Tisbury board also noted in acknowledging Edgartown\u2019s request that, \u201cunder . . . regulations now in affect [jic], you are prevented from doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After a public hearing, the commission voted to approve the application to build on the plaintiffs\u2019 lot, but imposed several conditions. See St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 16 (permitting approval with conditions). The conditions limited the size and number of structures on the lot to a greater extent than the local zoning requirements, and required that the plan be submitted to the Edgartown conservation commission for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Superior Court pursuant to St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 18. There the plaintiffs argued, in pertinent part, that the cross-town referral procedure is an impermissible expansion of the commission\u2019s statutory grant of authority, which is limited by \u00a7 13 of the enabling act to the review of a project determined to be a DRI by the permitting agency of the town in which the project is located.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiffs contended, the commission\u2019s decision was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The judge upheld the commission\u2019s decision, however, ruling in part that the regulation allowing cross-town referrals did not contradict \u00a7 13. He noted that, while \u00a7 13 empowers the local permitting agency to refer applications to the commission, it does not exclude other referral procedures. The judge relied on \u00a7 20 of the amended enabling act, providing that regulations which were enacted pursuant to the original enabling statute, St. 1974, c. 638, amended by St. 1977, c. 831, and which were in effect when the amended statute became effective, \u201cshall continue in full force and effect.\u201d St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He ruled that this provision ratified the cross-town referral regulation, which was in effect when the amended version of the enabling act was passed in 1977.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the judge ruled the cross-town referral procedure to be consonant with the legislative goal of ensuring broad review of the regional impact of proposed projects because it provided another avenue to bring such projects before the commission. This ruling was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The regulation permitting cross-town referrals impermissibly arrogates to the commission broader authority than the Legislature has chosen to grant it. Section 13 plainly establishes that the municipal agency with responsibility for issuing a development permit shall refer the project to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>mission. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 13. Other sections of the statute also suggest that the Legislature envisioned referral by the local permitting authority. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 14 (describing the \u201creferring agency\u201d as that which may \u201cgrant a development permit\u201d), 16 (same). Thus, the language of the statute suggests that the Legislature intended <em>only </em>the local permitting agency to refer projects to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">It is true, as the trial judge noted, that the enabling act does not explicitly exclude other referral procedures. An administrative agency, however, has only the powers and duties expressly conferred upon it by statute and such as are reasonably necessary to carry out its mission. See <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 23, 27 (1990); <em>Saccone </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Mass. 326, 335 (1985). The cross-town referral procedure is neither. It is irrelevant, therefore, that the enabling act does not expressly exclude the cross-town referral procedure, or that the procedure arguably promotes the goals of the act; the procedure is ultra vires because it is neither expressly nor impliedly granted by statute. The commission had no authority to promulgate a regulation which exceeds the authority conferred upon it by the enabling statute. <em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>402 Mass. 672, 676-677 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The commission points to various sections of the enabling statute to save the cross-town referral regulation. Section 12 empowers the commission to adopt criteria identifying which project will have sufficient regional impact to be considered DRI. St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 12. Logically, however, this provision cannot be read to limit the requirement under \u00a7 13 that those criteria be applied by the local permitting authority, which alone may then refer a project to the commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Nor does \u00a7 20, upon which the Superior Court judge relied in upholding the regulation, validate the cross-town referral regulation. Section 20 provides that regulations \u201cduly made\u201d by the commission under the original enabling act, St. 1974, c. 637, shall continue to be enforced under the amended version of the act. St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the regulation exceeded the commission\u2019s statutory grant of authority under the original enabling act, however, it cannot be considered \u201cduly made.\u201d See <em>Electronics Corp. of America, supra. </em>Furthermore, to the extent that the two provisions conflict, under principles of statutory construction the general language of \u00a7 20 must yield to the more precise language of \u00a7 13, in which the Legislature specifically addressed the referral procedure. <em>Risk Management Found. of Harvard Medical Insts. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 505 (1990). See <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Comm\u2019n, </em>407 Mass. 77, 80-81 n.6 (1990). This construction of the two provisions is reinforced by the fact that, in amending the enabling act, the Legislature reenacted the provision which provides for referral only by local agencies. Compare St. 1974, c. 637, \u00a7 14, with St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 13. \u201cWhen statutory language is reenacted, it is a principle of statutory construction that no change was intended in its meaning or scope.\u201d <em>Risk Management Found., supra </em>at 503, quoting <em>General </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>402 Mass. 523, 530 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Finally, the commission invokes \u00a7 7 of the enabling act. St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 7. That provision states that the \u201cstandards and criteria\u201d promulgated by the commission to define a DRI must be approved by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA). The commission relies on the final sentence of \u00a7 7, providing that the \u201cstandards and criteria\u201d established under the original enabling act (1) \u201cshall be deemed in full compliance with this section\u201d and (2) \u201cshall continue in full force\u201d after passage of the amended act. <em>Id. </em>This sentence does not ratify the cross-town referral regulation, however. Even assuming that regulation 3.101 is among the \u201cstandards and criteria\u201d established within the original act, the first clause merely states that prior existing standards and criteria are deemed in compliance with the requirement of approval by the EOEA imposed by \u00a7 7. The general language of the second clause, like the similar language in \u00a7 20, must yield to the more specific terms of \u00a7 13 under the principles of statutory construction discussed above. Thus, we construe neither clause as ratifying the commission\u2019s regulation 3.101, establishing the cross-town referral procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We hold, therefore, that the cross-town referral procedure is invalid. The commission\u2019s enabling act permits only the permitting agency in the town where a project is located to refer that project to the commission for review as a DRI. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 application was not referred by Edgar-town, the commission lacked jurisdiction to review the application. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and a new judgment shall be entered annulling the commission\u2019s decision as to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">For more detailed discussion of the purpose and structure of the commission, see <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S.

The commission argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 application falls within this category, and therefore that Edgartown could have referred the application to the commission without resorting to the cross-town referral pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>cedure. We disagree. If the location of a project \u201cnear a waterway,\u201d without more, distinguished it as a DRI, then an inordinate number of projects \u2014 regardless of size or regional impact \u2014 would be subject to review by the commission because, on an island the size of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, virtually everything is arguably \u201cnear a waterway.\u201d We construe \u00a7 12 (/), therefore, merely as identifying proximity to a waterway as one factor to be weighed in deciding whether a proposed construction project is of regional impact, that is, a project \u201clikely to present development issues significant to more than one municipality of the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.!\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12. This construction comports more closely with the commission\u2019s legislative mandate and the remaining portions of \u00a7 12.
