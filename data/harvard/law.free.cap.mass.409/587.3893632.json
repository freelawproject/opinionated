G. L. c. 23A, \u00a7 40. The Superior Court judge entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs and ordered the agency to certify the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Joyce Sturdy and Hancock Electronics Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ration, as a women\u2019s business enterprise which is defined in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 40N (1988 ed.), as: \u201c \u2018Women-owned business\u2019, any contracting or subcontracting business which is beneficially owned by one or more women meeting the requirements set forth in clauses (1) to (4), inclusive, of the definition of minority business, except that the terms \u2018women\u2019, \u2018women owners\u2019, and \u2018women-owned business\u2019, shall be substituted for the terms \u2018minority\u2019 and \u2018minority persons\u2019, \u2018minority owners\u2019, and \u2018minority business\u2019 appearing in said definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A reading of the statute reveals that the deputy commissioner of administration reserves five percent of the estimated construction cost of each capital facility project for certified women-owned businesses. The issue in this case is whether Sturdy and Hancock qualify as a women\u2019s business enterprise. We rule that they qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The factual underpinnings are important. Sturdy\u2019s husband was a director of Inconix Corporation, and both he and Sturdy had invested in Inconix, which ultimately went into bankruptcy. Sturdy and her husband bought the assets of Inconix at auction, giving the auctioneer two checks totalling $10,000 to secure the bid. Sturdy and her husband then jointly borrowed $55,000 from a bank to apply to the purchase price. The business was incorporated as Hancock Electronics Corporation. Sturdy became president, treasurer and chief executive officer. She and her husband became directors and voted to issue 10,000 shares of common stock. Sturdy bought 5,100 shares for $5,100 and her husband bought 4,900 shares for $4,900. The funds for the stock purchase came from a bank account jointly owned by Sturdy and her husband. Sturdy has been solely responsible for the financial and operational control of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The agency argues that Sturdy does not meet the requirements of its regulations, 425 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2:02 and 2:03 (5), which require, among other things, a fifty-one percent personal investment by a woman, because the source of the funds which she used to purchase the investment was a bank account held jointly by Sturdy and her husband. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Sturdy\u2019s rejoinder is that (1) the agency had no authority to adopt regulations, and (2) she meets the statutory tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We have examined G. L. c. 23A, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44. These statutes created the State Office of Minority and Women Business Assistance and set forth its powers and duties. There is no suggestion in any of these statutes that the agency has the power to adopt regulations. General Laws c. 23A, \u00a7 44, which describes the powers and duties is suspiciously silent as to the agency\u2019s power to adopt regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that there is no such power and, therefore, Sturdy is not required to meet the demands of the purported regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The agency does not argue that it should have the opportunity to pass upon the question of Sturdy\u2019s compliance with the statute if the regulation is struck. Therefore, we need not address the question whether Sturdy \u2022 meets the statutory standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Accordingly, the record clearly supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that Sturdy and Hancock are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-15\">The plaintiffs are described in the record as \u201cJoyce Sturdy, d/b/a/ Hancock Electronics Corporation and Hancock Electronic Corporation.\u201d For facility in identification, we shall refer to the plaintiffs either as Sturdy or Hancock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">We do not address the validity of any regulation promulgated under G. L. c. 23A, \u00a7 39A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
