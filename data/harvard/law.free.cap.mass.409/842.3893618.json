(ISKCON N.E.). The defendant now appeals claiming that the trial below constituted a \u201cheresy trial\u201d and that the jury\u2019s verdicts against the defendant represent an impermissible restraint on ISKCON N.E.\u2019s right to practice freely its religion. The defendant argues that one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, for intentional interference with parental rights, does not exist under the common law of the Commonwealth. The defendant also alleges that the plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence to meet their burden of proof on their tort claims and that the verdicts are invalid due to the judge\u2019s erroneous jury instructions. Finally, the defendant claims that the trial judge improperly deprived ISKCON N.E. of the protection of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>statutory liability limit of $20,000 for charitable organizations. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the trial below impermissibly infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to practice freely its religion. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments against the defendant for the counts of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and order entry of judgment for the defendant on those counts. We remand the case for retrial on the claims of intentional interference with parental rights, breach of a duty of care, and vicarious liability for assault and battery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We present a brief description of the facts the jury could have found, based on the evidence put before it. Additional facts will be discussed in later sections of this opinion as they become relevant to our legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">This case originated in Randolph in the winter of 1971 when Susan Murphy, then thirteen years old, began to explore the beliefs of the Hare Krishna religion, also referred to as Krishna Consciousness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this time Susan occasionally attended Sunday feasts at a Krishna temple located in Boston. During the summer of 1972, Susan began to attend the temple more frequently after she became acquainted with Doug Hewer, a nineteen or twenty year old occasional practitioner of Krishna Consciousness. At some point during the fall of 1972, Susan and Doug became girl friend and boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Susan\u2019s mother, Mary Murphy, remained unaware of Susan\u2019s interest in Krishna Consciousness or her attendance at the Boston Krishna temple until February or March, 1973. Mary forbade Susan from visiting the temple again, but Susan continued to attend the temple without informing her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>In February, 1973, Susan and Doug met with Vishnu-Jana, a Krishna sannyasi, or swami,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to discuss Susan\u2019s desire to become \u201cKrishna conscious\u201d by living according to the principles of Krishna Consciousness. Susan also told Vishnu-Jana of her mother\u2019s unwillingness to allow Susan to attend the Boston temple. Vishnu-Jana told Susan and Doug that the most important goal for Susan was to become Krishna conscious, and that she should do what was necessary to attain that goal. After the meeting, Susan and Doug considered themselves married to each other by the power of Vishnu-Jana\u2019s advice. From then on, they presented themselves as a married couple, with Susan wearing traditional Krishna symbols of marriage. At this time, Susan was fourteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">About March, 1973, Susan ran away with Doug to Toronto, Canada, and then to Los Angeles, California. During their travels, Susan and Doug received the assistance and friendship of several Krishna Consciousness practitioners. Susan, after speaking with her mother on the telephone, returned to Massachusetts in the fall of 1973 with Doug and resumed living with her mother. Approximately two months after returning to Massachusetts, Susan and Doug ran away again to Toronto. From Toronto, Susan and Doug traveled to Los Angeles, where they remained for several months. During this time, Susan and Doug regularly visited a Krishna temple in Los Angeles. Susan and Doug then moved to Hawaii until late 1973 or early 1974, when they returned to Massachusetts and took up residence together. Several weeks after their return to Massachusetts, Susan and Doug left once again for Los Angeles. They remained in Los Angeles for several weeks before traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they resided in a local Krishna temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The defendant ISKCON N.E. was incorporated in Massachusetts on February 19, 1974. Some time during the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>mer of 1974, Susan returned to Massachusetts with Doug to assist Mary in certain legal proceedings unrelated to the present case. For one month Susan and Doug lived together in a rented room. They then moved into the apartment of Tra\u00eddas and Pramada, members of ISKCON N.E.\u2019s temple. Susan testified that at this time Tra\u00eddas was the president of the temple. Susan attended the defendant\u2019s temple and participated regularly in temple activities. On August 14, 1974, Susan celebrated her sixteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Around September, 1974, Susan and Doug moved into the apartment of Carol and Larry DeGregory, two other members of ISKCON N.E.\u2019s temple. Evidence indicated that Larry was the temple\u2019s treasurer. In November, 1974, after moving to another apartment, the two couples requested permission from the temple\u2019s president, Adi Kesava, to move into the defendant\u2019s temple. Adi Kesava told Susan that she could live in the temple only with her mother\u2019s permission, and only if Susan would adhere to the Krishna practices of a vegetarian diet, no illicit sex, no intoxicants, no gambling, and regular participation in temple activity. Susan agreed to these conditions and arranged for Adi Kesava to speak with Mary Murphy who, on certain conditions, consented to Susan\u2019s living in the temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In November, 1974, Susan and Doug moved into ISK-CON N.E.\u2019s temple. Susan slept in the women\u2019s quarters; Doug slept in the men\u2019s quarters. Doug left the temple shortly thereafter, apparently in response to a disagreement with Susan regarding her desire to remain celibate in accordance with Krishna principles. After Doug left the temple, Susan no longer considered herself married to him. During her stay in the temple, Susan participated regularly in chores, rituals, and classes associated with the temple and the practice of Krishna Consciousness. This continued until December, 1974, or January, 1975, when Mary asked Susan to sleep at home on weekends. Susan agreed, but continued to spend most of her time at the temple. Shortly after Susan was formally initiated as a Krishna Consciousness \u201cdevotee\u201d in January or February, 1975, Susan began spending every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>night at Mary\u2019s house, although she continued to spend her days at the temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In April, 1975, Mary discovered a letter written by Susan which alluded to a \u201cplan\u201d by several members of the defendant\u2019s temple to send Susan to West Germany without Mary\u2019s knowledge or permission. At this point, Mary telephoned the Weymouth police department and spoke with Officer Henry Vanasse, who agreed to speak to Susan. Mary telephoned Susan at the temple and asked Susan to come home on the pretext that Mary was ill. When Susan arrived, Mary told her that she could not go back to the temple. A brief struggle ensued, but Mary was able to restrain Susan until Officer Vanasse arrived. He informed Susan that she risked legal action against her if she continued to run away. Mary demanded that Susan sever all ties with the defendant\u2019s temple, to which Susan reluctantly agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Evidence was presented regarding Susan\u2019s emotional condition after her withdrawal from the defendant\u2019s temple. This evidence showed that Susan remained quite angry with her mother for several months, and that Susan expressed a desire to return to the temple. Susan and Mary\u2019s relationship began to improve after approximately six months when Susan decided that she no longer wanted to associate with the temple or its members. Additional evidence was presented which, the plaintiffs claimed, established that Susan\u2019s experience with the defendant caused Susan to experience \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d a low sense of self-esteem, and an inability to maintain a healthy relationship with men.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">On April 19, 1977, Susan and Mary filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging nine counts of tortious activity against (1) ISKCON N.E., (2) ISKCON, a Krishna temple located in California, and (3) A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of Krishna Consciousness in the United States. The plaintiffs sought $2,500,000 as compensation for their alleged injuries. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint, which were referred to a special master. Following the master\u2019s report, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to substitute a Krishna temple in New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>for the California temple, to delete one of the nine causes of action, and to lower the damages sought to $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In April, 1985, the California temple moved to adopt the master\u2019s report and to dismiss the California temple from the case. This motion was allowed. The court also allowed a motion to dismiss the complaint against A.C, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. In addition, the court dismissed the complaint against the New York temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">ISKCON N.E. moved for summary judgment as to each count in the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. After a hearing, the judge granted summary judgment for the defendant on Susan\u2019s claim of false imprisonment, Susan\u2019s claim of fraud on the part of ISKCON N.E., and Mary\u2019s claim of seduction. The case proceeded to trial on May 11, 1987, on the following counts: (1) Susan\u2019s claim that ISKCON N.E. failed in its duty to provide adequately for her welfare while she was under its care; (2) Susan\u2019s claim that ISKCON N.E. aided and abetted Doug Hewer in committing assault and battery on her by way of nonconsensual sexual intercourse; (3) Susan\u2019s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) Mary\u2019s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) Susan\u2019s claim of intentional interference with the Murphy family structure; and (6) Mary\u2019s claim of intentional interference with the Murphy family structure. The judge limited the defendant\u2019s potential liability to its actions for the period between ISKCON N.E.\u2019s incorporation and Susan\u2019s departure from the temple. Following the plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of evidence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on all counts. The court dismissed Susan\u2019s claim of intentional interference with the Murphy family structure, but otherwise denied the motion. The defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">On June 16, 1987, the jury found for the plaintiffs on all remaining counts. The jury awarded Susan $210,000 for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, and $30,000 for ISKCON N.E.\u2019s failure to provide for her welfare, $10,000 of which was attributable to ISKCON N.E.\u2019s failure to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tect her from assault and battery by third persons. Mary received $350,000 for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, and $20,000 for the intentional interference with her parental rights. The defendant\u2019s motions for new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied. The defendant filed a notice of appeal. We took the case on our own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">2. <em>The free exercise of religious </em>rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ISKCON N.E. claims that the jury\u2019s verdicts must be struck down as a violation of both State and Federal guarantees of the free exercise of religion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of its argument, the defendant points to the fact that the plaintiffs presented substantial and detailed evidence regarding ISKCON N.E.\u2019s religion. The defendant claims that the introduction of this evidence allowed the jury to punish ISKCON N.E. for the content of its unorthodox religious beliefs through the imposition of tort liability, thereby depriving ISKCON N.E. of its constitutional right to practice freely its religion. In the unique circumstances of this case, we agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In considering ISKCON N.E.\u2019s free exercise claim, we recognize our duty to conduct an independent review of the record of the trial below. \u201c[I]n cases raising First Amendment issues [the United States Supreme Court has] repeatedly held that an appellate court has an obligation to \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression\u2019.\u201d <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984), quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 284-286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>(1964). See <em>Gaudiya Vaishnava Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>900 F.2d 1369, 1373 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cWe conduct an independent review of the record to be sure that \u2018the speech in question actually falls within the protected category,\u2019 and to determine whether the constitutional factors have properly been applied\u201d). Furthermore, in examining the record below, we recognize that, \u201cwhere a jury\u2019s general verdict <em>may </em>have rested upon grounds improper for First Amendment reasons, a reviewing court will not pause to speculate whether the jury\u2019s verdict was actually reached on other, and permissible, grounds\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Founding Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 F.2d 1146, 1164 (D.C. Cir.) (per curiam), cert, denied, 396 U.S. 963 (1969). See <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 113 (1969); <em>Stromberg </em>v. <em>California, </em>283 U.S. 359, 367-368 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d The courts of both the United States and this Commonwealth are required to ensure that individuals or organizations are not unjustly deprived of their right to exercise freely their religious beliefs. See, e.g., <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296 (1,940) (breach of the peace conviction of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness overturned as a violation of First Amendment free exercise clause); <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 724 (1985) (civil rights and contract claims by lesbian employee against the First Church of Christ, Scientist dismissed as a violation of First Amendment free exercise clause). We have recognized previously that the imposition of tort liability for conduct that is allegedly connected to religious belief, such as is involved in the present case, presents a sufficient potential deprivation of religious freedom to warrant constitutional scrutiny. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 74, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985). See also <em>Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Ass\u2019n for Unification of World Christianity, </em>46 Cal. 3d 1092, 1114 (1988), cert, denied, 490 U.S. 1084 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Freedom of religion, however, while occupying a \u201cpreferred position ... in the pantheon of constitutional rights,\u201d <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, supra </em>at 724, is not absolute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nissenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 575, 581 (1989). Both this court and the United States Supreme Court have recognized that the concept of the free exercise of religion involves both belief and activity, and, while the freedom to believe particular religious principles is absolute and may not lawfully be infringed, the freedom to act in response to religious beliefs does not enjoy the same immunity. See <em>Employment Div., Dept, of Human Resources </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872 (1990); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 374-377, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 970 (1982). \u201c[The First] Amendment embraces two concepts, \u2014 freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.\u201d <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra </em>at 303-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The constitutional difficulty with the basis of the jury\u2019s verdicts against ISKCON N.E. lies not in any perceived infringement of the defendant\u2019s right to engage in religiously motivated activity, but rather in the risk of infringement of ISKCON N.E.\u2019s right to believe freely in the principles of Krishna Consciousness. This potential for infringement arose when the trial judge allowed in evidence, as the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, certain passages from the scriptural texts of the Krishna Consciousness religion. See <em>Founding Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1164 (\u201cwhere a jury\u2019s general verdict <em>may </em>have rested upon grounds improper for First Amendment reasons, a reviewing court will not pause to speculate whether the jury\u2019s verdict was actually reached on other, and permissible, grounds\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Susan was permitted to read scriptural passages aloud to the jury and to testify as to what she had learned at the temple regarding this material. Of particular concern is Susan\u2019s testimony regarding scriptural text which pertained to the role of women and of family in the Krishna Consciousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>religion. In regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the defendant refers to sections of the trial transcript in which Susan testified that she learned, in reference to particular scriptural passages, that: (1) \u201cwomen are inferior to men\u201d; (2) \u201cthe female form is the form of evil\u201d; and (3) \u201cone should be very careful to cover the body so that men are not attracted to [women].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant also claims that this testimony formed the basis of the opinion of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert psychiatric witness that Susan suffered from \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder\u201d from her \u201cexperience in the Hare Krishna movement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of intentional interference with parental rights, the defendant points to Susan\u2019s testimony that she learned from particular scriptural passages and prayers that: (1) the earthly family was a perversion of the Krishna f\u00e1mily; (2) the earthly family was \u201cinconvenient\u201d and \u201cnonexistent\u201d; (3) \u201cin the span of eternity, [her] life was nothing, and that [her] relationships with [her] family and friends were nothing only if [she] could make them Krishna conscious\u201d; and (4) \u201cour families in this life are not our real families . . . [t]hey are just an entanglement in the material world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The defendant also points to the fact that Susan was allowed to read to the jury a scriptural passage, which she had been told to believe literally, about an incarnation of Krishna coming to Earth to kill violently a parent opposed to his child\u2019s participation in the Krishna religion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>claims that the plaintiffs utilized this testimony to support their claim that ISKCON N.E. had intentionally sought to separate Susan from her mother. The defendant argues that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and intentional interference with parental rights found their basis in the content of the teachings of ISKCON N.E.\u2019s religion, the litigation of these claims allowed the jury to penalize ISKCON N.E. for its adherence to unpopular religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">The plaintiffs do not deny that Susan\u2019s testimony allowed the jury to consider the content of the defendant\u2019s religious scriptures. Indeed, in their brief to this court, the plaintiffs note that \u201c[sjome of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages flow from the religious beliefs and practices to which Susan Murphy was exposed while she was a member of the Defendant\u2019s religious community.\u201d The plaintiffs suggest, however, that Susan\u2019s claim is not based on the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs per se, but rather on ISKCON N.E.\u2019s actions of teaching those beliefs to Susan. This religious activity, they argue, unlike religious belief, may be regulated through tort liability without violating the defendant\u2019s right to the free exercise of its religion. See, e.g., <em>Alberts </em>v. Devine, 395 Mass. 59, 74, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985) (First Amendment free exercise clause does not bar imposition of tort liability for religiously motivated activity which amounts to a breach of physician-patient confidentiality).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">As we have already noted, religiously motivated activity is not categorically immunized from tort liability by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. However, we are of the view that the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to characterize the disputed testimony as relating to the defendant\u2019s religious activity rather than its religious belief is unpersuasive. The essence of what occurred in the trial is that the plaintiffs were allowed to suggest to the jury extensively that exposure to the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs was sufficient to cause tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tious emotional damage and to separate Susan from her mother. Our conclusion in this regard is supported by the words of the judge who, in allowing the disputed scriptural testimony, instructed the jury that \u201c[this testimony is] being placed before you for you to determine whether or not such information was brought to [Susan\u2019s] attention and how if at all it affected her or caused her to act, or not to act, or [whether] other persons were [caused] to act in certain ways.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In his closing argument to the jury the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that \u201cSusan was subjected at an early age to destructive teachings, teachings that were destructive to her personality, to her psyche, and Doctors Zinberg and Norberg and Carroll (the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses) testified to this, and she suffers from it today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\u201cFreedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men. ... It embraces the right to maintain theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to followers of the orthodox faiths. Heresy trials are foreign to our Constitution.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944). In recognition of our nation\u2019s commitment to freedom of religious. belief, it has become axiomatic that \u201c[c]ourts cannot question the verity of religious doctrines or beliefs.\u201d <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 722 (1985). \u201cMen may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, supra </em>at 86. Yet, in the present case, the defendant has been required to do what the First Amendment has forbidden; it has been forced to attempt to prove to a jury that the substance of its religious beliefs is worthy of respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Inherent in the claim that exposure to ISKCON N.E.\u2019s religious beliefs causes tortious emotional damage is the notion that the disputed beliefs are fundamentally flawed and inconsistent with a proper notion of human development. While this issue may be the subject of a theological or academic debate, it has no place in the courts of this Commonwealth. In a similar manner, the issue whether the Krishna Consciousness religion adheres to an appropriate vision of the family is not for the courts to decide. The defendant cannot be forced to choose between censoring its religious scriptures to remove material which may be offensive to contemporary society and paying tort damages for the privilege of maintaining unpopular religious beliefs. \u201cIntangible or emotional harms cannot ordinarily serve as a basis for maintaining a tort cause of action against a church for its practices \u2014 or against its members. . . . Offense to someone\u2019s sensibilities resulting from religious conduct is simply not actionable in tort. . . . Without society\u2019s tolerance of offenses to sensibility, the protection of religious differences mandated by the first amendment would be meaningless.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc\u2019y of N.Y., Inc., </em>819 F.2d 875, 883 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 484 U.S. 926 (1987). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, supra </em>at 725 (requiring defendants to pay damages to maintain their religious beliefs would substantially burden the defendants\u2019 right to free exercise of religion). \u201cTolerance of the unorthodox and unpopular is the bellwether of a society\u2019s spiritual strength. A community sufficiently confident of its moral and political underpinnings trusts its members to employ reasoned and considered judgment in evaluating novel theories that seek to explain the meaning and purpose of life. The coercive mechanisms of restraint, violence, and suppression are not required to confront strange ideologies and unfamiliar rituals, however obnoxious they may be. This freedom to explore diverse political and religious doctrines, derived from the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, permits our citizens to follow the dictates of conscience. By fostering this voluntarism, our nation is strengthened, for the people respect a gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ernment that treats its charges as free-willed, discerning moral beings. Our republic prides itself on the enormous diversity of religious and political beliefs which have been able to find acceptance and toleration on our shores.\u201d <em>International Soc\u2019y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>650 F.2d 430, 432 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the fact that ISKCON N.E. exposed Susan to the disputed teachings while she was a minor should persuade this court to deny the defendant\u2019s free exercise claim. In <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 167-170 (1944), the United States Supreme Court recognized that a State has greater leeway under the First Amendment to infringe on religious activity involving children than it does on religious activity which involves only adults. In upholding the enforcement of a Massachusetts child labor law which prevented proselytizing activity by children of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s authority over children\u2019s activities is broader than over like actions of adults. . . . What may be wholly permissible for adults .. . may not be so for children . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168-169.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">While we agree with the plaintiffs that Susan\u2019s minority is of constitutional significance, we are not persuaded that her age alleviates the free exercise concerns raised by the jury\u2019s evaluation of the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs. The fact that Susan was a minor when she was involved with the defendant may lessen the degree of constitutional protection which ISKCON N.E. has against a claim of an intentional tort based on religiously motivated activity. However, the nature of the challenge to the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs posed by the disputed scriptural testimony in the present case embroils the court in an assessment of the propriety of those beliefs regardless of the age of the plaintiffs. This court may not engage in such deliberations. See <em>Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Ass\u2019n for the Unification of World Christianity, </em>46 Cal. 3d 1092, 1120 (1988), cert, denied, 490 U.S. 1084 (1989) (court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>not consider threats of divine retribution as basis for claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Additionally, by allowing the jury inappropriately to consider constitutionally protected religious beliefs in determining the defendant\u2019s liability, the judge also exacerbated the problem by erroneously instructing the jury regarding the extent of the free exercise protections afforded by the First Amendment. The judge instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is not protected by the umbrella of the First Amendment. The tort of intentional interference with parental custody is not protected by the shield of the First Amendment.\u201d This instruction does not accurately reflect applicable constitutional law and may have invited the jury to ignore the defendant\u2019s free exercise rights in determining ISKCON N.E.\u2019s tort liability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Both this court and other courts have recognized that the free exercise protection provided by the First Amendment is not automatically withheld from activity which constitutes an intentional tort. The decision whether the free exercise clause bars a particular tort action is not necessarily determined by the presence of tortious activity but by other factors such as the nature of the evidence which must be presented to support such a claim, or the effect that liability for a successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>claim would have on free exercise rights. In <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, supra, </em>for example, this court held that, due to the nature of the evidence on which the plaintiff intended to support her claims, which included the intentional infliction of emotional distress, the free exercise clause of the First Amendment required that summary judgment be granted for the defendant religious organization. \u201c[Ljitigation [of the plaintiff\u2019s claims] would involve the court in a review of an essentially ecclesiastical procedure .... That is impermissible under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Other courts have extended free exercise protection to bar recovery for intentionally tortious activity. In <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Watchtower Bible </em>&amp; <em>Tract Soc\u2019y of N.Y., Inc., supra </em>at 879-883, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the First Amendment free exercise clause provided a complete defense to claims of outrageous conduct, defamation, invasion of privacy, and fraud. The court noted that free exercise concerns barred recovery despite the \u201creal and not insubstantial\u201d harms suffered by the plaintiff at the hands of the defendant religious organization. <em>Id. </em>at 883. And in <em>Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Ass\u2019n for Unification of World Christianity, supra </em>at 1120, the Supreme Court of California held that claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress are barred by the First Amendment to the extent they are based on protected religious speech. See also <em>Van Schaick </em>v. <em>Church of Scientology of Cal., Inc., </em>535 F. Supp. 1125, 1142 (D. Mass. 1982) (noting that if essential element of plaintiff\u2019s fraud claim rests on alleged falsity of constitutionally protected religious statements the tort claim must fail); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Catholic Diocese of Great Falls, </em>224 Mont. 113, 118 (1986) (tort of bad faith in employment barred by the free exercise clauses of United States and Montana Constitutions). See generally Annot., Liability of Religious Association for Damages for Intentionally Tortious Conduct in Recruitment, Indoctrination, or Related Activity, 40 A.L.R.4th 1062 (1985); Esbeck, Tort Claims Against Churches and Ecclesiastical Officers: The First Amendment Considerations, 89 W. Va. L. Rev. 1 (1986). The judge\u2019s instructions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>present case, to disregard the requirements of the First Amendment regarding liability for intentionally tortious activity, were error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The trial judge should have allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts on Mary\u2019s and Susan\u2019s claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Those claims could not stand in the absence of testimony regarding ISKCON N.E.\u2019s religious beliefs. On retrial, damages alleged by Susan and Mary based on allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress may be considered to the extent that such damages are an element of the claims of physical and sexual abuse of Susan. Mary\u2019s claim of intentional interference with parental rights, discussed <em>infra, </em>also may be considered on retrial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">3. <em>Issues on retrial. </em>We are constrained from answering definitively the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the claims of breach of a duty of care and vicarious liability due to the difficulty in separating out consideration of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected religious beliefs from conditionally protected religious activity and from conduct outside the scope of constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We remand those claims without further discussion. We address the defendant\u2019s contention that the tort of intentional interference with parental rights is not recognized in this Commonwealth, <em>infra, </em>and remand that claim for retrial as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">\u201cThe common law has traditionally recognized a parent\u2019s interest in freedom from tortious conduct harming his relationship with his child,\u201d <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 512 (1980), and the parent \u201cmay be compensated therefor when there is interference with the normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 303, 311 (1988) (Liacos, J., dissenting on other grounds).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The tortious conduct referred to in <em>Ferriter </em>and <em>Norman </em>includes the abduction, enticement, and harboring and secreting of minor children from their parents, \u00f3r in other words, the intentional interference with parental interests or rights. The elements of these causes of action are well established. Abduction is the physical taking of a minor child from the parent having legal custody. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Nickerson, 9 </em>Allen 478 (1864). An action for enticement will lie where one, through an \u201cactive and wrongful effort\u201d and knowing that the parent does not consent, induces a child to leave the parent\u2019s home. <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>6 Cush. 249, 250-251 (1850).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> One \u201charbors\u201d a minor child by inducing or encouraging a child, who is away from the parent without the parent\u2019s consent, to remain away from the parent. See <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, </em>7 Allen 118 (1863). Liability for harboring a child will not be found, however, unless the actor knows or has reason to know that the child is away from the parent without the parent\u2019s consent. See W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 124, at 925 (5th ed. 1984). Implicit in each action is the requirement that the child be physically absent from the home for a continuous period of time. To allow recovery for interference with parental interests without physical absence of the minor child from the home would be to allow an action for alienation of affections, for which recovery cannot be had. See <em>Ronan </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>351 Mass. 700 (1966).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 700 (1977) encompasses all of the actions described above: \u201cOne who, with knowledge that the parent does not consent, abducts or otherwise compels or induces a minor child to leave a parent legally entitled to its custody or not to return to the parent after it has [ ] left him, is subject to liability to the parent.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Jurisdictions recognizing the tort of intentional interference with parental rights as such define it in accord with Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 700, and the case law of those jurisdictions is consistent with the case law of this Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Surina </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>168 Cal. App. 3d 539 (1985) (interference with parental rights based on \u00a7 700 for abduction and enticement); <em>D &amp; D Fuller CATV Const., Inc. </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>780 P.2d 520 (Colo. 1989) (recognizing tort of interference with parent-child relationship as set forth in \u00a7 700); <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Engel, </em>124 N.H. 213 (1983) (liability for aiding and abetting intentional interference with custodial parent\u2019s rights based on State constitution and \u00a7 700). But see <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>460 N.W.2d 39 (Minn. 1990) (in context of custody dispute, court refused to recognize tort as not in best interest of child). We therefore acknowledge the tort of intentional interference with the parent-child relationship as a contemporary expression encompassing actions for abduction, enticement, harboring, and secreting of a minor child from the parent having legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">One crucial element of the tort of intentional interference with the parent-child relationship is the lack of parental consent to the child\u2019s absence from the home. A jury should Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>sider, among other things, what actions and events led to the child\u2019s absence from the home, and what actions the parent took to return the child to the home, including the degree of effort or persistence exerted by the parent in obtaining legal assistance. In addition, the jury should consider what actions, if any, the defendant may have taken to obtain the parent\u2019s consent, either in good faith, or through fraud or duress. Of course, if consent is obtained by fraud or duress, there is no consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The early interference actions permitted recovery for damages based primarily on the parent\u2019s loss of the child\u2019s services, although <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, supra </em>at 122, recognized damages for loss of society as well, and was cited in <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 307, as an early example of cases allowing recovery for loss of a child\u2019s consortium due to the defendant\u2019s intentional acts. We have had no occasion to address these particular tort actions in light of the move away from the loss of services as the primary basis for recovery for intentional acts which harm familial relations. See <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 154-161 (1973) (tracing evolution of spousal claims from loss of services to loss of consortium).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court has come to recognize, however, that the actual basis of recovery for intentional tortious acts which interfere with a parent-child relationship is the loss of filial consortium. See <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, supra </em>at 510-512. In addition to compensation for loss of filial consortium and services, a parent may obtain damages for the cost of recovering the child, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Nickerson, supra </em>at 481,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as well as for \u201cmental suffering\u201d or emotional distress which results from the interference. <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, supra </em>at 119, 122. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 700 comment g. See also <em>Surina </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>Lucey, supra </em>at 544. But see <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Engel, supra </em>at 217 (intentional infliction of emotional distress treated as separate cause of action).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">4. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. </em>In light of our decision to vacate the jury\u2019s verdicts, it becomes necessary to address the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. The plaintiffs claim that: (1) the judge erred in instructing the jury that the defendant could not be held liable for the allegedly tortious activity of certain individuals and groups which occurred before ISKCON N.E.\u2019s incorporation; (2) the judge improperly applied the applicable statute of limitations to Mary\u2019s claims; and (3) regardless of ISKCON N.E.\u2019s connection to any individual or group engaged in allegedly tortious preincorporation activity, the defendant must be held liable for all of the damage suffered by the plaintiffs because their injury cannot be apportioned. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">a. <em>ISKCON N.E.\u2019s liability for preincorporation activity. </em>As we have already noted, the defendant filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint which were referred to a special master on June 16, 1978. The special master issued a report which recommended, in part, that ISKCON N.E. not be held liable for claims arising prior to its incorporation. On February 10, 1986, the defendant moved to adopt this section of the master\u2019s report. After hearing, the court allowed this motion on February 27, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">On May 1, 1986, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to charge ISKCON N.E. with liability for activity preceding its incorporation. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant, in both its preincorporation and corporate form, had acted in concert with other practitioners of Krishna Consciousness to inflict tortious emotional injury on the plaintiffs. The judge denied the motion on August 7, 1986, based on his findings of undue delay on the part of the plaintiffs, undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>prejudice to the defendant, and the legal futility of the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment. The judge later allowed the plaintiffs to introduce evidence of preincorporation activity for the limited purposes of providing background information for the jury and, if necessary, for assessing damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The decision to grant a motion to amend a complaint, while generally \u201cfreely given when justice so requires\u201d, Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), lies within the broad discretion of a trial judge. <em>Cappuccio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of </em>Spencer, 398 Mass. 304, 314 (1986). This court has previously noted that a judge who, as in the present case, denies a motion to amend due to undue delay or undue prejudice is acting within his discretion. <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 291-292 (1977). On appeal, the plaintiffs, who fail to mention that their motion was denied on grounds of undue delay and prejudice, provide us with no reason to believe that the judge abused his discretion. The plaintiffs have limited their argument to the strength of their legal claim that the defendant should be held liable for allegedly tortious preincorporation activity. Even assuming that the plaintiffs are correct in their claim that the defendant legally could be held responsible for the preincorporation activity, the judge acted well within his discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on the grounds of undue delay and prejudice. See <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 291-292. The plaintiffs were not entitled to advance to the jury their claim that ISKCON N.E. is liable for the allegedly tortious preincorporation activity of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">b. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>The judge ruled that the applicable statute of limitations prevented Mary from basing any part of her claims on allegedly tortious activity occurring before April 19, 1974. In their brief to this court, the plaintiffs concede that if we rule against the plaintiffs on their ability to hold the defendant liable for preincorporation activity, Mary\u2019s statute of limitations claim becomes irrelevant because ISKCON N.E. did not become directly involved with Mary until after April 19, 1974. In light of our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>in section 4(a) of this opinion, therefore, we need not consider the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 statute of limitations argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">c. <em>Apportionment of plaintiffs\u2019 injury. </em>At trial, the plaintiffs claimed that the tortious activity for which the defendant was found liable was a continuation of the tortious activity of other Krishna Consciousness practitioners which began prior to ISKCON N.E.\u2019s incorporation. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the injuries they suffered were the indivisible product of both this preincorporation activity and the defendant\u2019s postincorporation activity. The plaintiffs argue that, regardless of the defendant\u2019s connection to any preincorporation tortfeasors, ISKCON N.E. should be held liable for all the damages claimed by the plaintiffs because the plaintiffs have suffered \u201cone massive injury\u201d which cannot be apportioned between preincorporation and postincorporation activity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\u201cDamages may be apportioned among two or more causes if there is a reasonable basis for doing so.\u201d <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 497 (1983). See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 433A (1965) (\u201c[djamages for harm are to be apportioned among two or more causes where (a) there are distinct harms, or (b) there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm\u201d). The judge\u2019s decision to apportion damages according to the date of the defendant\u2019s incorporation appears to us to have been eminently reasonable. Furthermore, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the fact that the jury may have had some difficulty in calculating the exact extent of the intangible emotional harm caused by postincorporation, rather than preincorporation, activity does not render the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries indivisible. \u201cThere will be obvious difficulties of proof as to the apportionment of certain elements of damages, such as physical and mental suffering and medical expenses, but such difficulties are not insuperable, and it is better to attempt some rough division than to hold one defendant for the wound inflicted by the other.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 52, at 345 (5th ed. 1984). See Restatement (Second) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>of Torts \u00a7 433A, at 435 (\u201c[t]here may be difficulty in the apportionment of some elements of damages, such as the pain and suffering resulting from the two wounds, or the medical expenses, but this does not mean that one defendant must be liable for the distinct harm inflicted by the other\u201d). The limitation on the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery from the defendant was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 claims were tried by allowing the jury impermissibly to consider the propriety of constitutionally protected religious beliefs. On the counts of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the judgments are vacated and judgment is to enter for the defendant. The remaining claims are remanded for retrial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In light of our disposition of the various claims of error, and our order for retrial of some of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we do not reach the issue of limitation of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The religious status of Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON N.E. was not at issue in the trial below.

Because we conclude that the presentation of the scriptural testimony we have de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>scribed above was sufficient to endanger the defendant\u2019s free exercise rights, we need not address the effect of this other evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">In a sidebar conference regarding the form in which the scriptural text could be presented to the jury, the judge stated that, \u201c[i]f [Susan] would like to testify as to certain passages that were taught to her, which she recalls, and which will later be testified to as bearing upon emotional distress, or psychological impact, or psychological damage, then they are admissible as being relevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Our conclusion on this point also is influenced by the fact that the religious scriptures were taught to Susan at regularly scheduled temple meetings. \u201c[It is not] in the competence of courts under our constitutional scheme to approve, disapprove, classify, regulate, or in any manner control sermons delivered at religious meetings.\u201d <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the defendant failed to object properly to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury and therefore must be considered to have waived any objection in that regard.
