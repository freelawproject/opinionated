Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981), concerning G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47, Sixth (6) (1988 ed.). That statute precludes an insurance company from insuring \u201cany person against legal liability for causing injury, other than bodily injury, by his deliberate or intentional crime or wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>A jury sitting in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts found that the plaintiff (Andover Newton) had wilfully violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq. (1988). The case was considered on appeal in <em>Linn </em>v. <em>Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., </em>874 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989), where liability for the discharge of a sixty-two year old tenured professor was upheld. The trial judge had instructed the jury that an entity acts \u201cwillfully if it knows its conduct was prohibited by federal law or if it acts in reckless disregard as to whether its conduct is prohibited by federal law.\u201d The jury was not asked to, and did not, indicate whether its finding of wilfulness was based on one or the other, or perhaps even both, of the theories on which it could have found wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Thereafter, Andover Newton brought an action in the same court seeking a determination, among other things, that its insurer, the defendant Continental Casualty Company (Continental), is obliged to indemnify it for the loss occasioned by its violation of the ADEA. A District Court judge, who had been the trial judge in the underlying action, ruled that because of the statute (cl. Sixth [6]) Continental was not obliged to indemnify Andover Newton for the loss arising from its violation of the ADEA. There is no suggestion that Continental\u2019s policy of insurance did not purport by its terms to cover Andover Newton\u2019s ADEA liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Andover Newton appealed from an order that allowed Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Andover Newton\u2019s claim for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit certified a single question to this court: \u201cDoes a finding of willfulness under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), if based on a finding of \u2018reckless disregard as to whether [defendant\u2019s] conduct is prohibited by federal law,\u2019 constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u2018deliberate or intentional. . . wrongdoing\u2019 such as to preclude indemnification by an insurer under the public policy of Massachusetts as codified at Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, \u00a7 47 Sixth (b)?\u201d The answer to the question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Only one opinion of this court (and none of the Appeals Court) has construed cl. Sixth (b), and that opinion provides only limited assistance in answering the certified question. In <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 218, 225-226 (1962), an insurer sought unsuccessfully to rely on cl. Sixth (6) to avoid any obligation to indemnify an insured against property damage arising from trespass committed by mistake. The insured contractor had allegedly cut down trees outside the area of a taking and without the authorization of the landowner. This court said that, if the contractor cut the trees by mistake, cl. Sixth (6) did not forbid an insurer from providing coverage against any loss incurred. A trespass by mistake was not a \u201cdeliberate or intentional crime or wrongdoing\u201d within the meaning of cl. Sixth (6). <em>Id. </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Here we deal with conduct that may not have been a deliberate or intentional, and thus knowing, violation of Federal law. The conduct in this case, although a violation of law, may have been undertaken with reckless disregard as to whether it was unlawful. The discharging of a tenured professor was intentional. The cutting of the trees in the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>case was intentional. The fact that a wrongful act was committed intentionally, however, does not alone bar coverage. That bar arises only if an intentionally committed, wrongful act was also done deliberately or intentionally, in the sense that the actor knew that the act was wrongful. Therefore, although reckless disregard as to the lawfulness of one\u2019s conduct may be wilful conduct for the purposes of the ADEA, and for other purposes (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 401 [1944]), it is not conduct known by the actor to be unlawful and, therefore, is not deliberate or intentional wrongdoing. Indifferent or reckless wrongdoing is not deliberate or intentional wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 202-203 (1947), the court considered the question whether a recklessly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>flicted injury causing death could be an injury caused by accident. As a matter of public policy, any provision for indemnification against liability due to an intentional wrong was said to be void. <em>Id. </em>at 203. The <em>Sheehan </em>case concerned events that occurred before cl. Sixth (b) was amended to add the bar to coverage now stated in it, and thus the court could not rely on the easy answer that in all circumstances cl. Sixth (b) exempts from that bar, and therefore allows, coverage for deliberate or intentional wrongdoing causing bodily injury. The court held that harm due to reckless conduct would fall within an injury \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and that insuring for liability from such conduct would not violate public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 205. In its certification to this court, the Court of Appeals commented that the <em>Sheehan </em>opinion \u201csuggests that Massachusetts may recognize a difference for purposes of insurance coverage between deliberate and reckless conduct, despite the fact that the two may be legally equivalent for other purposes.\u201d Clause Sixth <em>(b) </em>recognizes such a distinction, as did the <em>Sheehan </em>opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The answer to the certified question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The insurance policy did provide, however, that the loss insured against did not cover \u201cmatters which shall be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy shall be construed.\u201d An insurer may, of course, resolve uncertainties in the scope of cl. Sixth <em>(b) </em>by defining its own coverage exclusion in its insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The certified question assumes, we think correctly, that cl. Sixth (\u00bf&gt;) codifies the entire public policy of the Commonwealth that would bear on the insurability of losses caused by a reckless disregard of the lawfulness of conduct, and that, therefore, the common law developed before cl. Sixth <em>(b) </em>was amended to express its public policy view has no continuing significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
