On March 18, 1976, the defendant filed a motion for new trial which was denied by the trial judge and not appealed. On February 23, 1978, this court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction, and, after plenary review, concluded that there was no basis for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453 (1978). On August 10, 1987, the defendant filed a second motion for new trial. On January 17, 1989, a judge of the Superior Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court. We vacate the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The evidence that supported the defendant\u2019s convictions is set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 454-457, and need not be repeated here. The defendant\u2019s second motion for new trial made reference to the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584 (1985). In that decision, this court announced a new rule of law by stating that \u201cwhere proof of a crime requires proof of a specific criminal intent and there is evidence tending to show that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or some other drug at the time of the crime, the judge should instruct the jury, if requested, that they may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the crime in deciding whether the Commonwealth has proved that specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, supra </em>at 593. The defendant argued that the judge\u2019s instructions on the issue of intoxication, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 461-462 n.4, while a correct statement of the law in 1976, effectively foreclosed the jury from considering evidence of his intoxication with respect to his capacity to form the requisite specific intent necessary to prove aggravated burglary which was the predicate felony for his prosecution under the doctrine of felony-murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant contended that the rule in the <em>Henson </em>case should be applied retroactively to his case on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>408 Mass. 245 (1990), this court held that the standard for retroactive application of a new rule to a case on collateral review, as announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296, 300, 303 (1990), did not require retroactive application of the <em>Henson </em>rule because that rule was not \u201ccentral to an accurate determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 248. We repeated this principle and applied it in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, ante </em>45 (1991). The decisions in these cases are fully dispositive of the defendant\u2019s various contentions in this case. The defendant is not entitled to retroactive application of the <em>Henson </em>rule to his 1976 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The order granting the defendant\u2019s second motion for new trial is vacated. An order is to be entered denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> The Commonwealth tried the defendant on alternate theories that he was guilty of murder in the first degree because of deliberate premeditation or because a homicide had occurred during the commission of a serious felony. The jury\u2019s verdict did not indicate which theory of murder they relied upon in concluding that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
