Yolanda Munoz, a thirty-eight year old woman, lives in Dedham with her husband, Ernesto Munoz, and their minor son, Ernesto, Jr. Ernesto\u2019s father, who is over seventy-five years old, also lives in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Ms. Munoz has a history of stomach ulcers. Approximately ten years ago, she underwent surgery for a bleeding ulcer. On April 11, 1989, Ms. Munoz vomited blood and collapsed in her home. During the week before she collapsed, Ms. Munoz had taken two aspirin every four hours to alleviate a pain in her arm. The aspirin apparently made her ulcer bleed. Ernesto took his wife to the Norwood Hospital emergency room. Physicians at Norwood Hospital gave Ms. Munoz medication which stopped the bleeding. Ms. Munoz was then admitted to the hospital as an inpatient. During the evening, her hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells to whole blood) was 17%. A normal hematocrit level for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>adult woman is approximately 42 %. Ms. Munoz was placed under the care of Dr. Joseph L. Perrotto. It was his medical opinion that the patient had a 50% probability of hemorrhaging again. If Ms. Munoz started to bleed, Dr. Perrotto believed that she would in all probability die unless she received a blood transfusion. Ms. Munoz, however, refused to consent to a blood transfusion in the event of a new hemorrhage.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Ms. Munoz and her husband were baptized as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses over sixteen years ago. They are both members of the Jamaica Plain Kingdom Hall of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Ms. Munoz attends three religious meetings every week. A principal tenet of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses religion is a belief, based on interpretations of the Bible, that the act of receiving blood or blood products precludes an individual resurrection and everlasting life after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Norwood Hospital has a written policy regarding patients who refuse to consent to the administration of blood or blood products. According to this policy, if the patient arrives at the hospital in need of emergency medical treatment and there is no time to investigate the patient\u2019s circumstances or competence to make decisions regarding treatment, the blood transfusion will be performed if necessary to save the patient\u2019s life. If the patient, in a nonemergency situation, refuses to consent to a blood transfusion, and the patient is a competent adult, not pregnant, and does not have minor children, the hospital will accede to the patient\u2019s refusal. If the patient, in a nonemergency situation, refuses to consent to a blood transfusion, and the patient is a minor, an incompetent adult, pregnant, or a competent adult with minor children, the hospital\u2019s policy is to seek judicial determination of the rights and responsibilities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The patient in this case, while no longer in an emergency situation once her ulcer stopped bleeding, has a minor child. The hospital sought a court order; on April 12, the hospital filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment in the Norfolk Division of the Probate and Family Court pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>c. 231A (1988 ed.). The hospital requested that Ms. Munoz be required to accept blood transfusions which her attending physician believed to be reasonably necessary to save her life. On that same day, the judge granted a temporary restraining order authorizing the hospital to \u201cadminister transfusions of blood or blood products in the event that [the patient] hemorrhages to the extent that her life is severely threatened by loss of blood in the opinion of her attending physicians.\u201d The court also appointed Mr. Jonathan Brant to serve as guardian ad litem for five year old Ernesto, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On April 13, the judge held a full evidentiary hearing. Dr. Perrotto stated in an unchallenged affidavit that, if Ms. Munoz were to begin bleeding again, she would have an excellent chance of recovering if she received a blood transfusion. If she started to bleed, however, and did not receive a blood transfusion, she would probably die. In addition, Dr. Perrotto stated that there was no alternative course of medical treatment capable of saving the patient\u2019s life. Ernesto Munoz and James Joslin, Ms. Munoz\u2019s brother-in-law, testified at the hearing in favor of allowing Ms. Munoz to refuse the blood transfusion. The guardian ad litem\u2019s report, which recommended that the hospital\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment be denied, was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On April 14, the judge granted the declaratory judgment authorizing blood transfusions which were \u201creasonably necessary to save [the patient\u2019s] life.\u201d The judgment also absolved the hospital and its agents from any civil or criminal liability, except for negligence or malpractice, which might arise from a blood transfusion. On May 11, 1989, the judge issued a detailed opinion explaining his reasons for granting the declaratory judgment. The judge found the patient competent; she understood the nature of her illness, and the potential serious consequences of her decision, including the risk of imminent death if her bleeding resumed and blood transfusions were not administered. While recognizing that a competent adult may usually refuse medical treatment, the judge stated that the hospital could administer the blood transfusions because, if they did not and Ms. Munoz subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>quently died, Ernesto, Jr., would be \u201cabandoned.\u201d The judge concluded that the State\u2019s interest in protecting the well-being of Ernesto, Jr., outweighed Ms. Munoz\u2019s right to refuse the medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In order further to understand the judge\u2019s reasoning, we need to discuss his factual findings in more detail. Ernesto works sixteen hours a day Monday through Friday and seven hours on Saturday driving his own commercial truck. Ms. Munoz works at a beauty salon from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. three days a week. Ernesto, Jr., is enrolled in a day-care center Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. The judge found that Ms. Munoz was the \u201cprincipal homemaker and principal caretaker of Ernesto, Jr.\u201d The judge also found that, while Ernesto\u2019s father was available to assist in caring for Ernesto, Jr., his assistance would be inadequate because of his advanced age, his inability to speak English, his unemployment, his lack of a driver\u2019s license, and because he had not, in the past, played a significant role in caring for his grandson. In addition, the judge found, that while Sonia and James Joslin, Ernesto\u2019s sister and brother-in-law, expressed a willingness to help Ernesto take care of the child in the event that Ms. Munoz died, the family had not formulated a concrete plan for the care and support of Ernesto, Jr. The judge concluded that Ms. Munoz\u2019s death \u201cwould be likely to cause an emotional abandonment of Ernesto, Jr., which would more probably than not be detrimental to his best interests.\u201d The judge ruled that \u201c[t]he State, as parens patriae, will not allow a parent to abandon a child, and so it should not allow this most ultimate of voluntary abandonments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Ms. Munoz argues that the judge erred because she has a right, as a competent adult, to refuse life-saving medical treatment, and the State\u2019s interests do not override that right. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\"><em>Mootness. </em>Ms. Munoz\u2019s ulcer did not hemorrhage after the entry of the judgment. She was released from the hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>tal without receiving a blood transfusion. The hospital argues that the case is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We agree that the case is moot. There is no evidence in the record that Ms. Munoz\u2019s ulcer problems will recur, and, even if they do, there is no evidence that she intends to return to Norwood Hospital. The general rule is that courts ordinarily will not decide moot questions. There are, however, exceptions to the general rule. We have answered moot questions \u201cwhere the issue was one of public importance, where it was fully argued on both sides, where the question was certain, or at least very likely, to arise again in similar factual circumstances, and especially where appellate review could not be obtained before the recurring question would again be moot.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984) .</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The instant case meets all the exceptions to the general rule. Whether a competent individual may refuse medical treatment is unquestionably an issue of public importance. In this case, the issue has been fully argued by both sides and is capable of repetition while evading review. See <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 156, 159-160 (1985) . Cases such as this one often arise in emergency situations; patients, physicians, and trial judges must make difficult decisions in very limited periods of time. By the time the cases reach the appellate courts, the issue is usually moot because the patients have either died or left the hospital without the need for further medical treatment. Due to the importance of the issue, and because of its proclivity to repeat itself while evading review, we proceed to address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We are asked to decide when a competent individual may refuse medical treatment which is necessary to save that individual\u2019s life. In <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc, </em>398 Mass. 417 (1986), and in <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728 (1977), we were asked to decide the rights of incompetent patients to refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>medical treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In both cases we found it necessary to determine the rights of competent individuals to refuse medical treatment before we discussed the rights of incompetent patients. <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 429-432. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 736-739.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In both cases we balanced an individual\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment against the State\u2019s interests in having the medical treatment imposed on the individual. <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 432. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">1. <em>The right to refuse treatment. </em>This court has recognized the right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. We have declared that individuals have a common law right to determine for themselves whether to allow a physical invasion of their bodies. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 430; <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982); <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 738-739. See also G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB (statutory right of privacy). We have stated that \u201ca person has a strong interest in being free from nonconsensual invasion of his bodily integrity.\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 739. Individuals also have a penumbral constitutional right of privacy to reject medical treatment. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113 (1973); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 (1965); <em>Brophy, supra', Saikewicz, supra </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The right to bodily integrity has been developed further through the doctrine of informed consent, which this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>recognized in <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, supra. </em>Under the doctrine, a physician has the duty to disclose to a competent adult \u201csufficient information to enable the patient to make an informed judgment whether to give or withhold consent to a medical or surgical procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154-155. It is for the individual to decide whether a particular medical treatment is in the individual\u2019s best interests. As a result, \u201c[t]he law protects [a person\u2019s] right to make her own decision to accept or reject treatment, whether that decision is wise or unwise.\u201d <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Candura, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 383 (1978). See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 430-431.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There is no doubt, therefore, that Ms. Munoz has a right to refuse the blood transfusion. Initially, it is for her to decide, after having been informed by the medical personnel of the risks involved in not accepting the blood transfusion, whether to consent to the medical treatment. The fact that the treatment involves life-saving procedures does not undermine Ms. Munoz\u2019s rights to bodily integrity and privacy, except to the extent that the right must then be balanced against the State\u2019s interests. See <em>Brophy, supra; Saikewicz, supra; Matter of Conroy, </em>98 N.J. 321, 348 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Ms. Munoz argues that, in addition to her rights to bodily integrity and privacy, she has a right secured by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to object to the administration of blood or blood products because to consent to the blood transfusions would violate one of the principal tenets of her Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses faith. Some courts have recognized a free exercise right on the part of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to refuse blood transfusions. See <em>In re Estate of Brooks, </em>32 Ill. 2d 361 (1965); <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Brown, </em>478 So. 2d 1033 (Miss. 1985). We do not think it is necessary, however, to decide whether Ms. Munoz has a free exercise right to refuse the administration of blood or blood products, since we have already held that she has a common law and constitutional privacy right to refuse a blood transfusion. Also, we need not decide whether a patient\u2019s right is strengthened because the objection to the medical treatment is based on religious principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>2. <em>The State's interests. </em>The right to refuse medical treatment in life-threatening situations is not absolute. Brophy, <em>supra </em>at 432. <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 261-262 (1979). We have recognized four countervailing interests: (1) the preservation of life; (2) the prevention of suicide; (3) the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession; and (4) the protection of innocent third parties. <em>Brophy, supra. Saikewicz, supra </em>at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The judge determined that the patient did not want to die. Declining potentially life-saving treatment may not be viewed properly as an attempt to commit suicide. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 743 n.ll. <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 350-351. See Byrn, Compulsory Lifesaving Treatment for the Competent Adult, 44 Fordham L. Rev. 1, 16-17 (1975). Therefore, it is clear that the second interest listed above does not apply in this case. We proceed to discuss the other three interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">a. <em>The preservation of life. </em>The State has an interest in preserving life, especially in a case such as the present one where the patient\u2019s affliction is curable. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 433; <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 741-742. The State\u2019s interest in preserving life has \u201ctwo separate but related concerns: an interest in preserving the life of the particular patient, and an interest in preserving the sanctity of all life.\u201d <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 349. As to the former, the State\u2019s concern is weakened when the decision maker (the individual who refuses to consent to the treatment) is also the patient \u201cbecause the life that the state is seeking to protect in such a situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>is the life of the same person who has competently decided to forgo the medical intervention; it is not some other actual or potential life that cannot adequately protect itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In cases where a competent adult refuses medical treatment for herself, the State\u2019s interest in preserving the particular patient\u2019s life will not override the individual\u2019s decision. See <em>Fosmire </em>v. Nicoleau, 75 N.Y.2d 218, 227 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The second concept within the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life is the more abstract notion of protecting the sanctity of life. In determining whether this concept applies, we must keep in mind that the right to privacy is an \u201cexpression of the sanctity of individual free choice and self-determination as fundamental constituents of life. The value of life as so perceived is lessened not by a decision to refuse treatment, but by the failure to allow a competent human being the right of choice.\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 742. \u201cThe duty of the State to preserve life must encompass a recognition of an individual\u2019s right to avoid circumstances in which the individual [herself] would feel that efforts to sustain life demean or degrade [her] humanity.\u201d <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 434. See <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 350. See also <em>Public Health Trust of Dade County </em>v. <em>Wons, </em>541 So. 2d 96, 100 (Fla. 1989) (Ehrlich, C.J., concurring specially); Cantor, A Patient\u2019s Decision to Decline Life-Saving Medical Treatment: Bodily Integrity Versus the Preservation of Life, 26 Rutgers L. Rev. 228, 243-245, 263 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">In this case, the patient, a fully competent adult, determined for herself that she could not consent to the administration of blood or blood products because to do so would violate a sacred religious belief. The patient decided that she would rather risk death than accept the blood transfusion. We can assume that, for this patient, death without receiving a blood transfusion is preferable to life after receiving the transfusion. The quality and integrity of this patient\u2019s life after a blood transfusion would be diminished in her view. Therefore, we conclude that the State\u2019s interest in protecting the sanctity of life must give way to the patient\u2019s decision to forgo treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>b. <em>Ethical integrity of the medical profession. </em>The State has an interest in maintaining the ethical integrity of the medical profession by giving hospitals and their staffs a full opportunity to assist those in their care. <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 755 (1978). <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 743. However, we have stated that \u201cso long as we decline to force the hospital to participate . . . there is no violation of the integrity of the medical profession.\u201d <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439. We have recognized that medical ethics do not require that a patient\u2019s life be preserved in all circumstances. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439-440; <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 743-744. Last, the ethical integrity of the profession is not threatened by allowing competent patients to decide for themselves whether a particular medical treatment is in their best interests. <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 352. \u201c[I]f the doctrines of informed consent and right of privacy have as their foundations the right to bodily integrity . . . and control of one\u2019s own fate, then those rights are superior to the institutional considerations [of hospitals and their medical staffs]\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 744.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the circumstances of this case, the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the ethical integrity of the profession does not outweigh the patient\u2019s right to refuse blood transfusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">c. <em>Protection of third parties. </em>The final, and in this case the most compelling, State interest is the protection of the patient\u2019s minor child. The State as parens patriae has an interest in protecting the well-being of children. See <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166-167 (1944). The issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>whether a competent adult can be prevented from exercising her right to refuse life-saving medical treatment because of the individual\u2019s duties to her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Florida State courts recently have addressed this issue. See <em>Wons </em>v. <em>Public Health Trust of Dade County, </em>500 So. 2d 679 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987), affd, 541 So. 2d 96 (Fla. 1989). The patient in <em>Wons </em>was a thirty-eight year old woman, mother of two minor children, who suffered from dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The patient\u2019s physicians informed her that she required treatment in the form of blood transfusions. The patient, however, refused to consent to the transfusions because of her beliefs as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. It was the physicians\u2019 medical opinion that, if the patient did not consent to the blood transfusions, she would probably die. The trial judge granted an order authorizing the transfusion, but a Florida District Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the State\u2019s interest in protecting the patient\u2019s children did not override the patient\u2019s right to refuse the medical treatment because the patient\u2019s possible death would not result in the abandonment of her two children. <em>Wons </em>v. <em>Public Health Trust of Dade County, </em>500 So. 2d at 688. As the court pointed out, the testimony showed that the patient came from a tightly knit family, all practicing Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and all of whom supported her decision to refuse the blood transfusion. <em>Id. </em>The court also pointed out that the patient\u2019s husband and mother were willing to take care of the children in the event that the patient died. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that \u201cthere is no showing of an abandonment of minor children, and, consequently, [the patient\u2019s] constitutional right to refuse a blood transfusion is not overridden under the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In <em>Fosmire </em>v. <em>Nicoleau, </em>75 N.Y.2d 218 (1990), the New York Court of Appeals apparently has held that the State\u2019s interest in protecting minor children will never be allowed to override the right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. The court explained that \u201cat common law the patient\u2019s right to decide the course of his or her own medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>treatment was not conditioned on the patient [\u2019s] being without minor children or dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-230.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We need only state that we agree with the reasoning of the Florida court, and hold that, in the absence of any compelling evidence that the child will be abandoned, the State\u2019s interest in protecting the well-being of children does not outweigh the right of a fully competent adult to refuse medical treatment. Our review of the record in this case reveals no such compelling evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The evidence shows that Ernesto Munoz supported his wife\u2019s decision not to consent to the blood transfusion. There is no evidence in the record that Ernesto was unwilling to take care of the child in the event that Ms. Munoz died.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>We note that the father has the financial resources to take care of the child and to make sure that the child\u2019s material needs are satisfied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also note that Ernesto\u2019s sister and brother-in-law supported Ms. Munoz\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>cisi\u00f3n, and were willing to assist Ernesto in taking care of the child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">There can also be no doubt that, if Ms. Munoz had died, the entire family, including the young child, would have suffered a great loss. However, the State does not have an interest in maintaining a two-parent household in the absence of compelling evidence that the child will be abandoned if he is left under the care of a one-parent household.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe parens patriae doctrine invoked herein cannot, we think, measure increments of love; it cannot mandate a two-parent, rather than a one-parent, family; it is solely concerned with seeing that minor children are cared for and are not abandoned.\u201d <em>Wons </em>v. <em>Public Health Trust of Dade </em>County, 500 So. 2d at 688. In these circumstances the State\u2019s interest in protecting the welfare of the patient\u2019s child does not outweigh her right to refuse the blood transfusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The patient had the right to refuse to consent to the blood transfusion even though she would have in all probability died if she had started to hemorrhage. The State\u2019s interests in preserving the patient\u2019s life, in maintaining the ethical integrity of the profession, and in protecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the well-being of the patient\u2019s child, did not override the patient\u2019s right to refuse life-saving medical treatment. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and a new judgment declaring the rights of the parties, consistent with this opinion, is to be entered in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In <em>Brophy, supra, </em>the patient was in a persistent vegetative state. The patient\u2019s family wished to remove a gastronomy tube which provided the patient with nutrition and hydration. <em>Id. </em>at 421-428. In <em>Saikewicz, supra, </em>the patient was a severely mentally retarded sixty-seven year old man who had leukemia. The patient\u2019s guardian ad litem recommended that the patient not be provided with chemotherapy treatment.

The court refused to reach the constitutional issues since it held that the patient had a common law and statutory right to decline the blood transfusion. <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Justice O\u2019Connor (joined by Justices Nolan and Lynch) concurs, based solely on Ms. Munoz\u2019s religious argument. The separate opinion states that <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417 (1986), and the instant case endorse suicide. <em>Post </em>at 132. We reject this claim. Competent adults have the right to decide for themselves whether to refuse medical treatment. This principle was reaffirmed by the concurring Justice when he wrote for the court: \u201cEvery competent adult has a right \u2018to forego treatment, or even cure, if it entails what for him are intolerable consequences or risks however unwise his sense of values may be in the eyes of the medical profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982), quoting <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Vesey, </em>110 R.I. 606, 624 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In <em>Brophy, </em>we stated the obvious point that the law does not permit suicide. <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 434 n.29. We also stated that \u201cdeclining life-sustaining medical treatment may not properly be viewed as an attempt to commit suicide. Refusing medical intervention merely allows the disease to take its natural course; if death were eventually to occur, it would be the result, primarily, of the underlying disease, and not the result of a self-inflicted injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, quoting <em>Matter of Conroy, </em>98 N.J. 321, 350-351 (1985). \u201cSuicide is the termination of one\u2019s own life by act or omission with the <em>specific intention </em>to do so\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 450 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The judge in the instant case found that Ms. Munoz \u201cdoes not wish to die.\u201d It is difficult to understand how the court\u2019s decision endorses suicide in the absence of any evidence that Ms. Munoz wanted to die. There is a clear distinction between respecting the right of individuals to decide for themselves whether to refuse medical treatment and endorsing the idea that it is acceptable for individuals to take their own lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The suggestion that Ms. Munoz\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment arises from, and depends on, her particular religious beliefs is troubling. See <em>post </em>at 132 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cI subscribe to the result reached by the court only because I believe that Munoz indeed has a right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>which ought to be recognized and respected, to risk death, if she deems that necessary, to preserve her immortal soul\u201d). The right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment and to be free from nonconsensual invasion of his or her bodily integrity, <em>supra </em>at 122-124, exists irrespective of that individual\u2019s religious beliefs. The application of a rule which would allow a patient to refuse life-saving medical treatment depending on the presence (or absence) of particular religious beliefs (such as, for example, the belief in the immortality of the soul and everlasting life after death), would necessarily involve making a judgment as to which religious beliefs deserve protection; such a judgment, when made by courts, would not only be impractical but also dangerous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The New Jersey Supreme Court has stated that \u201ceven if doctors were exhorted to attempt to cure or sustain their patients under all circumstances, that moral and professional imperative, at least in cases of patients who were clearly competent, presumably would not require doctors to go beyond advising the patient of the risks of foregoing treatment and urging the patient to accept the medical intervention. ... If the patient rejected the doctor\u2019s advice, the onus of that decision would rest on the patient, not the doctor. Indeed, if the patient\u2019s right to informed consent is to have any meaning at all, it must be accorded respect even when it conflicts with the advice of the doctor or the values of the medical profession as a whole.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 352-353.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The case most often cited in support of the proposition that the State\u2019s interest in protecting the well-being of the patient\u2019s children outweighs the patient\u2019s right to refuse life-saving treatment is <em>Application of the President &amp; Directors of Georgetown College, Inc., </em>331 F.2d 1000 (D.C. Cir), cert, denied, 377 U.S. 978 (1964). In that case, however, unlike the case before us, the patient was not competent to decide for herself whether to consent to the blood transfusion. The court stated that the patient was as \u201clittle able competently to decide for herself as any child would be. Under the circumstances, it may well be the duty of a court ... to assume the responsibility of guardianship for her, as for a child, at least to the extent of authorizing treatment to save her life\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id </em>at 1008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">A commentator\u2019s criticism of <em>Application of the President &amp; Directors of Georgetown College, Inc., supra, </em>is relevant: \u201c[T]he refusal of [the patient\u2019s] husband to authorize the transfusion indicates that he acceded to her wishes even though they might result in leaving the child motherless. It would not seem that one parent should be found guilty of child abandonment in a situation where the other parent has agreed to her leaving and, presumably, to provide for the child alone.\u201d Case Comment, Constitutional Law \u2014 Transfusions Ordered for Dying Woman over Religious Objections, 113 U. Pa. L. Rev. 290, 294 (1964). See <em>Matter of Farrell, </em>108 N.J. 335, 352-353 (1987) (mother\u2019s right to refuse treatment upheld where \u201cfather\u2019s capacity to care for [the children] in her absence is unquestioned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">According to the judge\u2019s findings, Ernesto earns approximately $1,800 a week or $93,600 a year, driving his own commercial truck. Ms. Munoz earns approximately $5,200 a year working part-time in a beauty salon. The couple pays $900 a month in mortgage payments and $1,192 a month to pay for a loan taken out when they purchased the truck. If Ms. Munoz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>were to die, Ernesto would receive $50,000 in life insurance proceeds, which is approximately the unpaid balance on the truck loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The judge, while stating that the sister and the brother-in-law had the good intentions of helping in the care of the child, concluded that no \u201cconcrete plan has been formulated for the care and support of Ernesto, Jr.\u201d The evidentiary hearing, however, was held only twenty-four hours after the hospital requested the declaratory judgment. It is not surprising, therefore, that the family had not formulated a \u201cconcrete plan.\u201d We think it is sufficient that, at the time the evidentiary hearing was held, there were family members who supported the patient\u2019s decision to forgo the medical treatment, and who were willing to assist in taking care of the child in the event that the patient died.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The judge found that, if Ms. Munoz died, the child would \u201csuffer an emotional abandonment or void.\u201d The judge concluded that the State \u201cshould not allow this most ultimate of voluntary abandonments.\u201d Every child who loses a mother, however, suffers emotionally. Emotional suffering by a child is not sufficient, by itself, to override the rights of a competent adult to refuse medical treatment, at least in cases where there is evidence that the father and other members of the family are willing to take care of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b147-6\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3t\">(concurring, with whom Nolan and Lynch, JJ., join). I agree that the judgment should be reversed and that the Probate and Family Court should enter a new judgment declaring that, in the event of a new hemorrhage, Yolanda Munoz (Munoz) has a right to refuse blood transfusions, and that that right must be respected by medical personnel and all others. Critical to my thinking, however, unlike the thinking of the court, is that Munoz\u2019s withholding of consent to transfusion is based on her belief that her acceptance of transfusions might preclude her from resurrection and everlasting life after death. That is the sole reason that Munoz would risk death rather than accept blood from another. Munoz, the judge found, does not want to die. Those facts lead me to agree with the result reached by the court. However, I cannot subscribe to an opinion that endorses, as I believe this opinion does, a right to assisted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417 (1986), the case on which the court primarily relies, the trial judge found that, if Brophy had been competent, he would have chosen to decline the provision of food and water through a gastrointestinal tube, not because that procedure would be ineffective in prolonging his life and not because the procedure would be painful or humiliating, but because, given the circumstances, Brophy would rather be dead than alive. In that context, this court held that Brophy\u2019s interest in self-determination was greater than the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life. Three dissenting Justices, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>me, characterized the court\u2019s decision as an unacceptable endorsement of suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In this case, the court takes pains t\u00f3 say that its decision is not influenced by the fact that Munoz\u2019s refusal to accept transfusions is grounded on religious belief or concern about salvation. Rather, relying largely on the <em>Brophy </em>case, the court concludes that Munoz\u2019s right of self-determination, without reference to her concern about the hereafter or any other motive, is superior to any countervailing State interest. In the absence of a necessity to protect innocent third parties, a necessity which I agree is not present in this case, the court concludes that, \u201c[i]n cases where a competent adult refuses medical treatment for herself, the State\u2019s interest in preserving the particular patient\u2019s life will not override the individual\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 126. That is to say, as the court said in <em>Brophy, </em>that, apart from possible countervailing interests of innocent third parties, a competent adult, and presumably an incompetent adult pursuant to substituted judgment, may reject any and every form of life-prolonging assistance for any reason whatsoever including disenchantment with life, and that that choice takes precedence over the State\u2019s interest both in preserving the individual\u2019s life and in promoting the sanctity of all human life. I write separately to disassociate myself from any such thesis. I subscribe to the result reached by the court only because I believe that Munoz indeed has a right, which ought to be recognized and respected, to risk death, if she deems that necessary, to preserve her immortal soul.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The court responds in footnote 5 to my concurring opinion. Footnote 5, too, deserves a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">As I have stated, in <em>Brophy </em>the trial judge found that Brophy\u2019s primary purpose in declining food and water would have been to end his life. Brophy\u2019s specific intention, then, attributed to him by a process of substituted judgment, was to terminate his life by the act or omission for which the court\u2019s approval was sought and given. The court was bound by the trial judge\u2019s findings. The court endorsed Brophy\u2019s suicide and the conduct of those who assisted it despite the court\u2019s contrary claim in <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 434 n.29 and again here that it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The court points to my statement as the author of the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in which I quoted with approval from the case of <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Vesey, </em>110 R.I. 606, 624 (1972), as follows: \u201cEvery competent adult has a right \u2018to forego treatment, or even cure, if it entails what for him are intolerable consequences or risks however unwise his sense of values may be in the eyes of the medical profession.\u2019 \u201d As any fair reading of <em>Harnish </em>would disclose, and as I was careful to say in my separate opinion in <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 450, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s explicit recognition of an individual\u2019s right to be free of nonconsensual invasion of his bodily integrity in <em>Harnish </em>... in no sense implied recognition of a right to commit suicide.\u201d In <em>Harnish, </em>the concern to which the quoted statement was addressed was a patient\u2019s right to adequate information about risks and potential benefits to enable her to make an intelligent decision about whether to undergo elective surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The court states, \u201cIt is difficult to understand how the court\u2019s decision endorses suicide in the absence of any evidence that Ms. Munoz wanted to die.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 124 n.5. There should be no difficulty. It is clear from the court\u2019s opinion that the court is not influenced in the slightest by the absence of evidence that Munoz wanted to die. If there were such evidence, the court\u2019s result would be no different. The court makes clear that Munoz\u2019s right to forgo blood transfusions was absolute, and that her purpose was exclusively her business and was irrelevant to the court\u2019s holding. In similar fashion, the judge\u2019s finding in the <em>Brophy </em>case that Brophy\u2019s primary objective would have been to end his life did not deter the court from holding that removal of the feeding tube was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The court characterizes as \u201ctroubling\u201d a perceived suggestion in my concurring opinion \u201cthat Ms. Munoz\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment arises from, and depends on, her particular religious beliefs.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 124 n.5. The court\u2019s perception is entirely unwarranted, as is its concern that my \u201csuggestion\u201d would require courts to decide which religious beliefs deserve protection. My concurring opinion says no such thing explicitly or implicitly. The obvious message delivered by the concurring opinion is that the State\u2019s interest in preserving individual human lives and in promoting the sanctity of all human life must take precedence over an individual\u2019s desire to terminate his or her life, whether by commission or omission, but the State\u2019s interests must give way to the choice of an individual, whether grounded in one religion or another or without reference to religion, as to how best to live.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
