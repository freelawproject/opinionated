After an evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court judge who presided at trial denied the motion. The Appeals Court reversed, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 417 (1990), and we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We summarize the evidence at trial. The defendant and the complainant were employees of the Motorola Corporation. On August 19, 1987, following an employee meeting, a group of Motorola employees, including the defendant and the complainant, went to the cocktail lounge of a local hotel. Sometime after midnight, the defendant and the complainant left the lounge and walked together toward their respective cars in the hotel parking lot. Their stories diverge at this point. The complainant testified that the defendant forced her into the back seat of his car and raped her. The defendant testified that the complainant willingly entered his automobile and engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The complainant testified that she finally broke away from the defendant and drove home. She then called her husband, who was on business in California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that day, she called a Motorola personnel manager, Collette Wiggins, and said that she wanted to file a sexual harassment claim against the defendant. She told Wiggins that the defendant had forcibly fondled her, but that she had escaped. After this conversation, James Kelly, a Motorola vice president, called the complainant. The complainant repeated essentially the same story that she had related to Wiggins. That afternoon, the complainant called a friend, Pat Noguera, and reported that she had been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The following day, the complainant met with both Wiggins and Kelly and reported that, in fact, she had been raped. The same day, the complainant also reported to the police that she had been raped. Noguera and the police officer with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>whom the complainant spoke testified as fresh complaint witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to physical evidence, the complainant\u2019s panty hose (which had a run in the crotch) were admitted, as were photographs of bruises on the complainant\u2019s legs that she testified resulted from the defendant kneeling on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The defendant\u2019s case included his own testimony that intercourse had been consensual. The defendant also adduced the testimony of six other witnesses (co-workers and a waitress from the hotel lounge) that tended to impeach various aspects of the complainant\u2019s testimony. The defendant\u2019s wife testified in corroboration of certain aspects of the defendant\u2019s testimony. In addition to cross-examining the complainant vigorously about, among other things, her failure to cry for help at the time of the assault and the difficulty that the defendant would have had in forcing the complainant into the car,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defense counsel also filed requests for jury instructions that were favorable to his case on the issue of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We next summarize posttrial events. After the jury found the defendant guilty, the defendant (represented by new counsel) moved for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. A full evidentiary hearing was conducted, and brought out the following additional facts. Wiggins and Kelly testified, as described above, that the complainant initially claimed that she had been indecently touched, but then (on the following day) claimed that she had been raped. Kelly also testified that he twice spoke to the defendant after the complainant\u2019s initial report, but before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>her report of actual rape. He described the conversations in the following exchange set forth below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both Wiggins and Kelly testified that defendant\u2019s trial counsel never interviewed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified to the following effect. During pretrial preparation of the case, he and the defendant discussed possible trial strategy on several occasions. Defense counsel initially considered producing no evidence, thus sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ply requiring the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant wanted to testify, however, so counsel discussed this option with him. Defense counsel concluded that the defendant appeared credible and would make a good witness before the jury. From this point, counsel and defendant discussed the two possible approaches to defense of the cases: a denial that intercourse had occurred, or an admission that it had occurred but that it had been consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Before deciding to pursue consent, defense counsel discussed with the defendant the drawbacks of basing the defendant\u2019s case on denial. It was defense counsel\u2019s opinion that this contention would not succeed because the defendant had admitted to Kelly and Wiggins that he had intercourse with the complainant. Moreover, in the early morning hours after the incident, the defendant was seen at the Motorola offices (where he had gone after the incident so that his wife would not know that he had been with another woman). Defense counsel asked the defendant how his denial of intercourse could be reconciled with his presence at the office at a hour when he ordinarily would not be expected to be there. The defendant was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Eventually, after lengthy discussion, consent was agreed on as the main defense. Evidence then was prepared by defense counsel to support this contention. Several trips were made to the hotel to search for witnesses to corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony. In addition to gathering evidence, defense counsel filed several pretrial motions, including motions for a bill of particulars, for discovery and inspection, for an examination of a motor vehicle, for production of the complainant\u2019s clothing, and for a ruling on the admissibility of statements made by the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Regarding the testimony of Wiggins and Kelly, although defense counsel knew (from speaking with the defendant and through discovery materials provided by the prosecution) that the complainant had changed the story that she originally gave Wiggins and Kelly, he deliberately decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>against calling either of them to testify. Defense counsel did so because he had been told by the defendant that, when he first spoke with Kelly, the defendant \u201cvehemently\u201d denied that he had anything to do with the victim on the night of the incident, but that, during the second conversation with Kelly, he reversed himself and admitted to intercourse. Defense counsel did not want the jury to learn of this contradiction. As to Wiggins (among other things), counsel was concerned about her repeating the victim\u2019s report of rape essentially as a third fresh complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Based on this testimony, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In his detailed order and memorandum (reproduced in pertinent part in the margin), the trial judge reasoned that there had been no significant breach by the defense counsel of his duty, and, even if such a breach could be assumed, no tangible harm to the defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The defendant argues here that the judge erred in denying the motion for a new trial because defense counsel had provided ineffective assistance when he: (1) failed to interview Wiggins and Kelly, and to call them as witnesses; and (2) failed to inform the trial judge of the substance of the complainant\u2019s original conversations with her husband, with Wiggins, and with Kelly, when the judge was considering the admissibility of the fresh complaint testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">For the defendant to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must conclude, first, that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and, second, that the defendant\u2019s case was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct such that the conduct \u201chas likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977) (requiring showing \u201cthat better work might have accomplished something material for the defense\u201d). In cases where tactical or strategic decisions of the defendant\u2019s counsel are at issue, we conduct our review with some deference to avoid characterizing as unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). See also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>466 U.S. 668, 689-690 (1984). Rather than merely unreasonable, we require that challenged tactical judgments must be \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). In applying this standard in this case, we have the benefit of a detailed memorandum from the trial judge. \u201cWe [will] accept [his] subsidiary findings as final if warranted by the evidence and we [will] pay substantial deference to his ultimate conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 181 (1987). We consider the defendant\u2019s arguments in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">1. <em>The failure to interview and call as witnesses Wiggins and Kelly. </em>Here, we consider together what actually are two separate alleged shortcomings in defense counsel\u2019s performance: the failure to interview Wiggins and Kelly and the failure to elicit the testimony of Wiggins and Kelly at trial. We do so because, as the Appeals Court recognized (see 28 Mass App. Ct at 421), even if it was unreasonable not to interview the two witnesses, the failure to interview them is of no import if it was not also ineffective for counsel to fail to call either of them as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">a. <em>Conduct of defense counsel. </em>Counsel decided not to use the testimony of Wiggins at trial for fear that her testimony would essentially represent a reprise of the fresh complaint testimony offered by two other witnesses. Wiggins\u2019 testimony unavoidably would have involved repetition of the complainant\u2019s report of rape. It was a legitimate goal of defense counsel to reduce the number of witnesses testifying to reports of rape by the complainant; therefore, the tactical decision not to call her to testify was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Defense counsel decided not to offer Kelly\u2019s testimony because he did not want the jury to learn that the defendant had told Kelly what amounted to two different stories. Because the defendant\u2019s credibility before the jury was critical to the success of his defense, this also was a reasonable tactical decision. Defense counsel was justifiably concerned that the jury not be exposed to evidence supporting the inference that the defendant had contradicted himself in describing what had happened between him and the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The defendant argues that, in fact, Kelly\u2019s testimony would not have revealed that the defendant had contradicted himself, because the defendant\u2019s original denial was only of sexual harassment, and his subsequent admission was only of consensual intercourse. Thus, the defendant contends, if defense counsel had interviewed Kelly, he would have discovered this, and could have benefited from Kelly\u2019s testimony without being harmed by the revelation of waffling by the defendant. This argument is unpersuasive. Defense counsel was relying on his client\u2019s description of the conversations with Kelly in deciding whether to use Kelly\u2019s testimony. The defendant described for counsel two conversations: the first amounting to a denial; the second amounting to an admission. Thus, the defendant in effect told defense counsel that he had contradicted himself in responding to a serious charge. The fact of that contradiction was plausibly suggestive of a guilty conscience, as well as of actual guilt. Common sense dictates that a defendant\u2019s description of events underlying a criminal charge should be considered reliable in circumstances like this. To hold otherwise is to require both that defense attorneys assume that their clients cannot or will not assist in their own defenses, and that they investigate and confirm virtually every statement that a client makes, no matter how apparently or circumstantially accurate. Beyond being impractical, such a requirement is contrary to earlier statements on this point. See, e.g., <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 691; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Decoster, </em>624 F.2d 196, 209-210 (D.C. Cir. 1979) <em>(S.C. </em>598 F.2d 311, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 944 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The testimony of both Wiggins and Kelly would have been problematic for the defendant for another important reason. Both witnesses would testify that, although aspects of the complainant\u2019s story had changed, she consistently reported that the defendant had forced himself upon her \u2014 that is, forcibly fondled her, as in the first report, and forcibly raped her, as in the second report. If believed, the complainant\u2019s unwavering allegations of force obviously would have directly rebutted the defendant\u2019s consent defense. In considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>whether to use such testimony, defense counsel reasonably could project that a jury might forgive the complainant her hesitancy in claiming rape, but would not forget that she never abandoned her charge that the defendant dealt with her violently. In sum, defense counsel could anticipate that calling the witnesses would expose the general inconsistency in the defendant\u2019s position and highlight the general consistency in the complainant\u2019s testimony. In these circumstances, we are reluctant to second guess defense counsel\u2019s considered judgment as to the value of the testimony. See 2 W.R. LaFave, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11.10 at 47 (1990 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">(b) <em>Prejudice. </em>Even if we were to find that defense counsel\u2019s conduct in not interviewing or calling to testify Wiggins and Kelly fell below that to be expected of the ordinary fallible lawyer, we would conclude that there was no resulting prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case. Had defense counsel presented the testimony of Wiggins, he would have been able to argue that the complainant had changed her story and that these variations suggested questionable credibility. On the other hand, as noted above, Wiggins would have been an additional witness essentially testifying to a third fresh complaint, and she would also have testified that the complainant never deviated from her report that the defendant had forcibly assaulted her. Had defense counsel presented the testimony of Kelly, he could have benefited from a second witness describing the complainant\u2019s varying story. However, again as noted above, the jury would have learned that the defendant himself had given Kelly inconsistent reports about the incident, and that the complainant consistently reported to Kelly that the defendant forcibly assaulted her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The fact that Kelly\u2019s memory of the conversations with the defendant differed somewhat from what defense counsel understood the substance of those conversations to be does not persuade us that the failure to offer the testimony of these witnesses prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case. This is so because, fundamentally, the conversations as Kelly remembered them paralleled counsel\u2019s understanding of the conversations. A comparison of the two versions of the conversations is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The defendant told counsel that, when Kelly called, the defendant vehemently denied having had anything to do with the complainant on the night in question. Later, however, the defendant called Kelly back and admitted to consensual intercourse. For his part, Kelly testified that the defendant at first was \u201cshock[ed]\u201d by the allegations; the defendant\u2019s first response to Kelly was a denial (\u201cNo. Oh, no. No way.\u201d); and the defendant later called Kelly back and admitted that \u201cindeed\u201d (i.e., as in \u201ccontrary to what was said earlier\u201d) there had been \u201ca situation ... that involved two consenting adults. . . .\u201d Thus, Kelly\u2019s description of the conversations matched that given by the defendant to counsel on the following essential points: Kelly called the defendant and leveled a charge; the defendant denied the charge; the defendant then called back and made an admission that appropriately should have been made during the first conversation. Therefore, if counsel had called Kelly to testify, the jury would have heard a description of events that basically matched the version given counsel by the defendant and that evidenced on the part of the defendant at best a sense of guilt over his relations with the complainant, and at worst a capacity for untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The testimony of Wiggins and Kelly had a tendency to impeach in part the complainant\u2019s description of events. On balance, however, any benefits that the defendant would have realized from this testimony could not have risen to the level of a \u201csubstantial ground of defence\u201d because they would have been largely offset by the harm that other aspects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>testimony would have done to his case. The absence of the testimony therefore was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">2. <em>The failure to inform the judge of the complainant\u2019s initial conversations with her husband, Wiggins, and Kelly when he was evaluating the fresh complaint evidence. </em>Here, we need not undertake an extended analysis of conduct and prejudice. The judge ruled that, even if defense counsel had brought the substance of the complainant\u2019s initial conversations with Wiggins and Kelly to his attention when he was considering the admissibility of the fresh complaint testimony, he nevertheless would have admitted the testimony. Therefore, although it would have been better if counsel had fully informed the judge, even assuming that counsel\u2019s failure to do so was manifestly unreasonable, the outcome of the case was in no way affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In this case, defense counsel made difficult strategic choices based on discussion with the defendant, and after reasonable consideration of the law and the facts relating to the plausible options. Defense counsel also conducted an investigation, filed numerous pretrial motions, and vigorously represented the defendant through trial. This is not a case where defense counsel took questionable unilateral action, was excessively sloppy, gave away the defense, failed to acquaint the defendant with the main theory of his own case, or otherwise seriously bumbled a critical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel was reasonably competent is supported by the evidence. Unlike this court, the trial judge had the opportunity to observe and evaluate all of the witnesses at trial, as well as defense counsel, Wiggins, and Kelly. We will not disturb his judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Because of the marital disqualification, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, neither the complainant nor her husband was permitted to testify to the content of this conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The defendant objected to the admission of this testimony on freshness grounds. The judge overruled these objections, but did so not knowing (because defense counsel did not inform him) that, prior to speaking to either of the two fresh complaint witnesses, the complainant had told her husband, Wiggins, and Kelly that she had been sexually harassed, but had averted rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Defense counsel effectively cross-examined the prosecution\u2019s other witnesses as well. For example, he elicited from the forensic chemist (who examined the complainant\u2019s panty hose) the opinion that the run in the crotch of the panty hose did not indicate tearing or excessive force. Defense counsel also brought out inconsistencies between the police officer\u2019s testimony at trial and before the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Q. \u201cNow, on August 20, 1987, do you recall what time it was that you first spoke to Edward White?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">A. \u201cMid-afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Q. \u201cAnd, at that time, did you call him or did he call you?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">A. \u201cI called him.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Q. \u201cNow, do you recall, sir, the substance of the conversation that you had with the defendant on that afternoon?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">A. \u201cYes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Q. \u201cAnd what was that?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">A. \u201cI called him and I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but, essentially, reported to him that there was a sexual harassment charge against him by [the complainant].</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">Q. \u201cAnd, at that time, sir, did he indicate to you that nothing of a sexual nature had occurred between the two?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">A. \u201cNo.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">Q. \u201cDo you recall what he said during that conversation?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">A. \u201cI recall, I\u2019m not certain I have it verbatim, but I\u2019ve gone over it many times in my mind.

As the defendant\u2019s later statements to [Kelly] and his trial testimony place him inside his car having consensual intercourse with [the complainant], her initial statements are of limited impeachment value as they do not corroborate the defendant\u2019s version. They would have been of much more significance corroborating a defense that nothing happened. [Counsel] testified that he did not call Mr. [Kelly] because there was the real danger that he would have been asked on cross-examination about the defendant\u2019s initial denials to him. ... As to Wiggins, [counsel] was fearful that she would have disclosed that the defendant has been terminated by Motorola and that the complainant was still an employee, and the jury would have inferred that Motorola believed the complainant and not the defendant. The choice not to call [Kelly] seems to be a reasoned tactical choice by counsel. The decision as to Wiggins is not as clear because counsel could have moved in limine to ascertain whether or not the [information he was concerned about was admissible]. Nevertheless, this failure does not, in and of itself, amount to a significant error and it is most unlikely that it would have made a difference in the outcome of the case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u201cThe Failure of Counsel to Disclose the Substance of the [Complainant\u2019s Initial] Statements to the Court \u2014 At trial Defense Counsel objected to the admission as fresh complaint of the statement to Ms. Noguera given the same day and about 16 hours after the events. ... To assist the Court in making its determination of \u2018freshness,\u2019 it would have been preferable if either or both counsel had focused on the specifics of the disclosures to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Wiggins and [Kelly]. In retrospect, it would have made little difference and the Court still would have admitted [the complainant\u2019s] statement to Noguera as fresh complaint. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u201cAssuming, without deciding, that defense counsel erred by neither interviewing nor calling [Kelly] and Wiggins, the defendant has failed in its burden to show that these decisions had a discernible effect on the outcome of the case.... Had [Kelly] testified, the jury would have learned that the defendant had admitted to intercourse, thus counsel would have been hard-pressed to create a reasonable doubt as to whether intercourse occurred.... Defendant\u2019s trial counsel made a tactical decision after weighing the likely benefits and liabilities of two witnesses. If the jury had found a reasonable doubt, counsel would have been credited with a strategy which kept out potentially damaging evidence. A verdict to the contrary naturally calls into question all tactical decisions. The defendant has failed to show that counsel\u2019s decisions were unreasonable, deficient, and incompetent to the extent that representation fell below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">It is doubtful that, if Wiggins\u2019 and Kelly\u2019s names had appeared on the defendant\u2019s pretrial witness list, the complainant would not have had an explanation for the shifting of her story. Obviously, a plausible explanation by the complainant as to why she waited to tell Wiggins and Kelly that she had been raped would have greatly reduced the impeachment value of their testimony, without diminishing the capacity of the testimony to damage the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We see nothing in the jury instruction complained of by the defendant\u2019s new counsel that would create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM5\">(dissenting, with whom Liacos, C.J., joins). I cannot agree with this court\u2019s ruling that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to interview Wiggins and Kelly and not to call them as impeachment witnesses was neither \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d nor prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a thorough and tightly reasoned opinion, the Appeals Court held that counsel\u2019s decision was not supported by any sound trial strategy and that in fact the defendant had demonstrated that his case was prejudiced thereby. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>28 Mass.

This analysis, though logically precise, fails to take into account the probative value of different aspects of Wiggins\u2019s possible testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">While Wiggins may have repeated the complainant\u2019s allegation, such testimony would merely have been cumulative of the fresh complaint testimony of others and would be only slightly significant as corroboration. On the other hand, Wiggins could also have testified that the complainant initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>alleged only sexual harassment and stated that she had escaped the defendant\u2019s advances. This testimony was potentially devastating to the prosecution\u2019s case, which was built largely on the credibility of the complainant. Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s lawyer chose to ignore this evidence (not even telephoning Wiggins to confirm her version of the event), and relied instead on much less compelling impeachment evidence, such as the complainant\u2019s failure to scream.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In essence, the asserted rationalization for this decision is that counsel feared that the complainant\u2019s allegation of rape, even though its repetition was redundant, would ring in the jurors\u2019 ears longer than the complainant\u2019s initial denial that the rape had occurred, which the jury never heard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This calculation of the risks and rewards inherent in calling Wiggins to the stand is indefensible, the deference owed to tactical decisions of defense counsel notwithstanding. In light of the potential impact of Wiggins\u2019s powerful impeachment testimony in a case where the prosecution relied almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant (producing no compelling physical evidence and no corroborating testimony apart from the fresh complaint witnesses), counsel\u2019s omission was manifestly unreasonable. That counsel had a \u201clegitimate goal\u201d in deciding not to call Wiggins to testify (to wit, minimizing the number of times the jury heard the complainant\u2019s allegation of rape) does not, without more, justify his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The defense attorney\u2019s decision not to offer Kelly\u2019s testimony, though it involves a greater number of variables, is also unjustifiable. The court again rides to the lawyer\u2019s rescue, however, by failing to weigh the potential costs and benefits of the omitted testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The court states that counsel reasonably decided not to interview Kelly or call him to testify because he did not want the jury to learn that the defendant \u201chad told Kelly what amounted to two different stories.\u201d In reaching this decision, the court concludes, counsel properly relied on the defendant\u2019s statement to counsel that, in two telephone conversations with Kelly, the defendant first denied any sexual contact with the complainant and then admitted to consensual sexual intercourse with her. <em>Ante </em>at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Concededly, a defense attorney is entitled to rely on his client\u2019s description of the events underlying a criminal charge. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691 (1984). When a lawyer subsequently gains information that supplements his client\u2019s version of events, however, common sense dictates that the reasonableness of his tactical decisions be judged based upon all the evidence in his possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, counsel learned through discovery that the complainant, too, had changed her story, at first telling Kelly that she had escaped the defendant\u2019s advances and alleging only sexual harassment by the defendant. Thus, the issue is not simply whether it was reasonable for counsel to rely on his client\u2019s description of the conversations with Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Rather, the issue is the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s calculation that, on balance, the damage to the defendant\u2019s case would outweigh the damage to the prosecution\u2019s case if it were revealed that both the defendant and the complainant had changed their stories. Given the considerable potential of Kelly\u2019s testimony to create reasonable doubt by calling into question the complainant\u2019s credibility, I conclude that counsel\u2019s determination was manifestly unreasonable. Counsel\u2019s decision not to interview Kelly, therefore, was also manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Furthermore, as the court recognizes, had counsel interviewed Kelly, he would have discovered that Kelly\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>mony would not have suggested that the defendant had contradicted himself. Instead Kelly would have testified that the defendant first denied only a charge of sexual harassment and later admitted only having consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant. See <em>ante </em>at 269 n.4. Both statements are entirely consistent with the defense\u2019s theory of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As the preceding discussion suggests, I disagree with the court\u2019s estimation of the impeachment value of Kelly\u2019s and Wiggins\u2019s possible testimony concerning the complainant\u2019s changing her story. The court concludes that this testimony would be problematic for two reasons. First, according to the court, the complainant\u2019s inconsistent allegations (first that the defendant forcibly fondled her, and then that he raped her) would both rebut the defendant\u2019s consent theory. <em>Ante </em>at 274. Since the jury had already heard the complainant\u2019s version of a violent rape, the incremental value of her initial, lesser allegation as rebuttal would be negligible. Second, the court concludes that defense counsel could reasonably predict that a jury would not forget that the complainant \u201cnever abandoned her charge that the defendant dealt with her violently.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 274-275. This conclusion overlooks an essential difference between the complainant\u2019s first and second allegations: the defendant was only on trial for one of them. That is, even if the jury remembered that the complainant consistently alleged that the defendant \u201cdealt with her violently,\u201d that allegation does not amount to rape. Therefore the omitted testimony would have raised doubts about the complainant\u2019s credibility as to the ultimate question \u2014 whether the defendant raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In short, the testimony that defense counsel chose to omit was less damaging to the defendant\u2019s case than the court suggests and was the most compelling impeachment evidence available. Of course a reviewing court should examine the tactical or strategic decisions of the defendant\u2019s lawyer with some deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rondeau, 378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). Under the facts of this case, however, where the balance of risks and rewards so favored calling Kelly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Wiggins to testify, I conclude that the decision not to use their testimony was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">2. <em>Prejudice. </em>The court concludes that the omission of Kelly\u2019s and Wiggins\u2019s testimony did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s case because the drawbacks of such testimony would have offset the advantages. Again, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The omitted testimony was the most potent impeachment evidence available to the defendant. Like most evidence, it was imperfect (from the defendant\u2019s perspective): by calling Kelly and Wiggins to the stand, defense counsel risked admitting redundant fresh complaint testimony and testimony that the complainant consistently alleged at least that the defendant forcibly assaulted her. The first point, however, would have added nothing of substance to the evidence the jury heard, and the second would not have restored the complainant\u2019s credibility. The evidence th\u00e1t the complainant had changed her story, by contrast, would directly and substantially affect the complainant\u2019s credibility, which was at the heart of the prosecution\u2019s case. Therefore, on balance Kelly\u2019s and Wiggins\u2019s testimony would clearly have favored the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The court states that Kelly\u2019s testimony in particular would have been damaging to the defense because Kelly\u2019s recollection of the conversations with the defendant \u201cfundamentally\u201d paralleled the defendant\u2019s recollection. The record does not support this conclusion. The defense attorney testified, \u201c[The defendant] originally . . . told me that when he spoke to James Kelly . . ., he initially and vehemently denied that he had anything to do with [the complainant] on that occasion, that night.\u201d However, Kelly testified that in their initial telephone conversations the defendant never denied that something \u201cof a sexual nature\u201d occurred between the defendant and the complainant. Instead, Kelly stated, the defendant denied only a charge of sexual harassment and subsequently admitted only to consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant. See <em>ante </em>at 269 n.4. These statements are entirely consistent with the consent defense. The court\u2019s characterization of Kelly\u2019s testimony as describing simply a denial fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>lowed by an admission is at best superficial and at worst misleading. In fact, Kelly\u2019s testimony does not support the inferences of guilt or dishonesty that the court draws from it. See <em>ante </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">It is impossible, of course, to conclude with absolute certainty how the testimony of Wiggins and Kelly would have influenced the jury\u2019s decision, if at all. However, the case against the defendant rested squarely on the testimony \u2014 and thus the credibility \u2014 of the complainant. The defense lawyer chose nevertheless to omit potent testimony impeaching the complainant\u2019s credibility, and the defendant was subsequently convicted essentially on the complainant\u2019s word. Under the unique circumstances of this case, I find it impossible to conclude that the defendant has not met his burden of showing that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In sum, I conclude that defense counsel\u2019s decision neither to interview Kelly and Wiggins nor to call them to testify was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d and was prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case. Therefore I do not agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant has failed to establish the elements of ineffective assistance of counsel. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">I agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s\u2019 failure to inform the judge of the complainant\u2019s initial conversations with her husband, Wiggins, and Kelly when the judge was considering the admissibility of fresh complaint evidence was not prejudicial, and therefore did not constitute ineffective assistance. See section 2, <em>ante </em>at 277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Counsel also asserted that he did not call Wiggins to testify because he was afraid she would reveal that Motorola had fired the defendant but not the complainant, suggesting that the company believed her and not him. As the Appeals Court recognized, however, this evidence was entirely irrelevant and could have been excluded by a motion in limine. 28 Mass. App. Ct. 417, 423 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Obviously, this statement does not imply that defense lawyers may not rely on their client\u2019s statements, so that they must \u201cinvestigate and confirm virtually every statement that a client makes, no matter how apparently or circumstantially accurate,\u201d as the majority suggests. <em>Ante </em>at 274.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
