The question now presented is what character of estates in these parcels of land passed to named devisees under the wills of William D. Robinson and his wife, Lelia S. Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Appellants, Frank M. Robinson, and his sons, David Robinson and Richard Robinson, asserted that under the wills Frank M. Robinson was entitled to a life estate in the property, and David and Richard Robinson own a vested remainder in fee. From a decree adverse to these claims, which held that David and Richard Robinson acquired no interest in the property under either will, and that Frank M. Robinson, as a devisee, and Frank M. Caldwell, Willa Snow Clarke, Rhoda Ellen Regal, E. Raymond Hall, and Estus Hayden Epling, as the heirs at law of Lelia S. Robinson, owned the property in fee, we granted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">By deed of March 19, 1935, Leo Hayes conveyed Lots 4 and 5, Section 1, Parrish Court, Covington, Virginia, to William D. Robinson and Lelia S. Robinson, his wife, jointly. William D. and Lelia S. Robinson did not dispose of their interests in this property during their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">In October, 1951, William D. Robinson died, leaving no descendants, but survived by his wife Lelia S. Robinson, a nephew, Frank M. Robinson, and the latter\u2019s two sons, David Robinson and Richard Robinson, all mentioned in his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The only pertinent paragraph of William D. Robinson\u2019s will follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">\u201cTHIRD: I give all my Real Estate to my wife and at her death it is to go to F. M. Robinson [Frank M. Robinson] and at his death to his 2 boys David Robinson and Richard Robinson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">Lelia S. Robinson died September 11, 1955, owning the one-half interest in the lots conveyed to her by the deed and such interest as she acquired under the third paragraph of her husband\u2019s will. She left no descendants, and her heirs at law are her brother, Frank M. Caldwell, and four nieces and nephews, Willa Snow Clarke, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Rhoda Ellen Regal, E. Raymond Hall, Estus Hayden Epling, children of Ora Orman Epling, deceased sister of testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The sole pertinent paragraph of Lelia S. Robinson\u2019s will follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201c2. I give my half of Lot 4 and 5 and house to Frank M. Robinson and at his death goes to his two sons, David Robinson and Richard Robinson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Nothing in William D. Robinson\u2019s will granted power to Lelia S. Robinson or Frank M. Robinson, the first takers, to dispose of the devised real estate, and no grant of such power to Frank M. Robinson, the first taker, is found in Lelia S. Robinson\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In his opinion the chancellor expressed the view that it was the intent of William D. Robinson to leave his widow, Lelia S. Robinson, a fife estate in all his real estate, and upon her death a life estate to Frank M. Robinson, with remainder to David and Richard Robinson. He, however, concluded and held that testator had by the language he used, actually devised a fee simple to Lelia S. Robinson, the first taker, and that the limitations over, \u201cand at her death it is to go to F. M. Robinson and at his death to his 2 boys * * David and Richard, were repugnant to the devise of the fee to his widow and void. He likewise concluded and held that the devise by Lelia S. Robinson of \u201cmy half of Lot 4 and 5 and house to Frank M. Robinson\u201d, the first taker, vested in him a fee simple, and the limitation over, \u201cand at his death goes to his 2 sons,\u201d David and Richard, was repugnant to the devise of the fee to Frank M. Robinson and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The decree which carried into effect the chancellor\u2019s opinion adjudged that William D. Robinson devised all his real estate which included his interest in Lots 4 and 5 to his widow, Lelia S. Robinson, in fee, thus vesting in her full ownership in the two parcels of land. It likewise determined and decreed that by Lelia S. Robinson\u2019s will, she devised a one-half interest in the lots to Frank M. Robinson in fee and died intestate as to the other one-half interest, which passed to her heirs, Frank M. Caldwell, her brother, and Willa Snow Clarke, Rhoda Ellen Regal, E. Raymond Hall, and Estus Hayden Epling, children of her deceased sister in the proportions fixed by the statute of descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\u201cThe devises in the wills to the first takers are general devises and use no words indicative of intent to give more than a life estate. At common law such a general devise to the first taker created only a life estate.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201cBut unless the intent appears upon the face of the devise to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>more than a life estate, the common law rule applies to devises as to conveyances, and nothing but an estate for life passes. * # *\u201d Minor on Real Property (2ded), \u00a7 150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Section 55-11, Code 1950, has, however, changed this common law rule, and such a general devise now conveys the fee simple \u201cunless a contrary intention shall appear by the will, conveyance, or grant.\u201d It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cWhen any real estate is conveyed, devised or granted to any person without any words of limitation such devise, conveyance or grant shall be construed to pass the fee simple or other whole estate or interest which the testator or grantor had power to dispose of in such real estate, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will, conveyance or grant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In this case there is no power of disposal in the first takers. It is only when there is such power that a life estate must be <em>express. </em>Section 55-7, Code 1950; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hoak, </em>184 Va. 821, 36 S. E. 2d 567; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>175 Va. 471, 9 S. E. 2d 447; <em>Clarkson </em>v. <em>Bliley, </em>185 Va. 82, 38 S. E. 2d 22. In all other situations a valid life estate may be created by implication as well as by explicit words.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Appellants rely upon \u00a7 55-11 and assert that the intention not to convey a fee simple estate to the first takers is made apparent in the respective wills by use of the words, \u201cat her death\u201d and \u201cat his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>89 Va. 916, 14 S. E. 916, the court was required to determine what estate testator\u2019s children, the first takers, acquired under the following devise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201cI give to my children by her, and their descendants at their death, the remainder of my property * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">In deciding that testator\u2019s children took only a life estate, the court, in the course of its opinion, observed that it appeared in various places in the will that testator considered the words, \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cdescendants\u201d, as equivalent and synonymous words, and then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201c * * * We think it is too plain for doubt that the testator intended, by the language of the devise, to give to his said infant children, Ashlin and Anthony Robinson, an estate for life, each, in the said remainder of his property, with remainder to the children of the said infant devisees. The words \u2018at their death\u2019 are, as restraining words, fully equivalent to the words \u2018for life,\u2019 and they show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>clearly the intention of the testator to limit the estate given to the infants to an estate for life. Any other construction would render the words \u2018at their death\u2019 inoperative, insensible, and unmeaning.\u201d At page 918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">No public policy, statute, or canon of property is involved which would override the intent of testator or testatrix as it appears from the language- used. The intent of each, though it be unartfully or inaptly expressed, must be given efFect in construing the devises. 20 M. J., Wills, \u00a7 77, p. 243. If, from the language used, it appears that they intended to devise only life estates to the first takers, then no repugnacy can arise from, a limitation over to designated remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201cBut before there is any repugnancy, it must appear from the will that a fee simple was in fact given to the first taker.\u201d <em>Crisman </em>v. Swanson, 193 Va. 247, 249, 68 S. E. 2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Though neither will devises an express life estate, yet the respective wills clearly disclose that the testator and testatrix intended to and did by the limiting phrases that they employed create mere life estates in the first takers with vested remainders in David and Richard Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">It appears from an exhibit and suggestion of counsel at bar that Frank M. Robinson died pending this appeal and Ruby Jean Robinson, duly appointed administratrix of his estate, has been substituted as a party appellant in his stead. It follows that Frank M. Robinson\u2019s life estate in the lots has now terminated, and David Robinson and Richard Robinson, who were the owners of vested remainders, now own the lots in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The decree of the trial court will be reversed and the cause remanded for the entry of a decree not in conflict with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
