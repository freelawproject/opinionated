Willcox Dunn, alleging the publication by defendants, Fred A. Haycox, Alb\u00edn R. Mailhes, and The Beach Publishing Corporation, of common law libel and insulting words under our statute. (Virginia Code, 1950, \u00a7 8-630.) The action is based on two publications appearing in the \u201cVirginia Beach Sun-News,\u201d one on November 24, 1955, and the other on December 8, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Dunn is the editor and publisher of a weekly newspaper called \u201cPrincess Anne Free Press,\u201d published at Virginia Beach, in Princess Anne County, Virginia. Mailhes is vice-president, general manager, and editor of the \u201cVirginia Beach Sun-News,\u201d also a weekly newspaper, published by The Beach Publishing Corporation, at Virginia Beach. Fred A. Haycox, Richard B. Kellam, and Mailhes own all of the stock of the corporation. The directors are those three shareholders and Sidney S. Kellam. Both newspapers are circulated in the City of Norfolk, Virginia, and the surrounding territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The defendants filed grounds of defense and amended grounds of defense, asserting the truth of the publications complained of, alleging they were made in self-defense, and denying malice. They charged that the plaintiff, as editor and publisher of the \u201cPrincess Anne Free Press,\u201d constituted himself the spokesman of a political faction in Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach, opposed to the group holding office in said County and City, for the purpose of increasing the circulation of his newspaper, and with intent to deceive its readers. They listed a number of the issues of plaintiff\u2019s paper containing statements reflecting on the character and integrity of the defendants, their friends and associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The trial, by jury, resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Dunn, for $65,000, which the court reduced to $30,000, over the objection of the plaintiff, and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The trial of the case consumed six days, and the record consists of more than six hundred typewritten pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The defendants assign error to the admission in evidence of a part of the record of the proceedings in an action instituted by Vito Morlino against The Free Press, Incorporated, and J. Willcox Dunn, in the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County and subsequently transferred to the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk; to the action of the court in granting Instructions P-1 and P-5 requested by the plaintiff; to the refusal of the court to grant Instruction D-3 as offered by defendants; to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict and order a new trial; to the action of the court in reducing the amount of the verdict instead of setting it aside, and to the amount of damages as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The plaintiff assigns cross-error to the action of the court in reducing the award of the jury and refusing to enter judgment upon the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In view of the conclusion which we have reached, it is only necessary for us to consider defendants\u2019 assignments of error relating to the admission of evidence, and to the court\u2019s action in granting and refusing instructions. In connection therewith, we shall recite and refer to only so much of the evidence as is necessary to present a picture of the situation which brought on the controversy between the parties, and is related to the above assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In 1952, Dunn began publication of the \u201cPrincess Anne Free Press,\u201d and started a vigorous crusade to correct what he termed \u201ccorruption\u201d in connection with the administration of public office in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach. He charged, from time to time, that the majority of the officeholders of those communities were guilty of malfeasance and misfeasance in office and of association with criminals and racketeers; and that they and the defendants were guilty of corrupt and improper motives. He branded defendants as members of the \u201cKellam Machine,\u201d and charged that members of that group had infiltrated every organization in Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach, social, civic, religious and political, and had given loyalty to the \u201cKellam Machine\u201d above loyalty to their communities, their clubs or societies. He directed his attacks largely against Floyd E. Kellam, Judge of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County, Sidney S. Kellam, a brother of Judge Kellam and a business and political leader of that County, other members of the Kellam family, and their friends and associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In the November 17, 1955, issue of the \u201cPrincess Anne Free Press,\u201d there was spread across the entire front of the first page a headline, in bold letters, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cEX-FUGITIVE SPOT FERGUSON GUNS IN SIDNEY KELLAM BLIND.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Immediately following, in large type, appeared the following three lines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cELUSIVE RACKETEER SHOOTS IN \u2018KELLAM PARTY\u2019 GROUP;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">RIDES IN \u2018EROSION\u2019 JEEP.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">Underneath this statement then appeared the following:'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">\u201cCity Sergeant Halstead \u2018Spots\u2019 Ducking Pal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">\u201cWith that fantastic twist for which Princess Anne is becoming noted, the notorious racketeer and Kellam Machine politician, Spot Ferguson, shot ducks on November 8' from a blind licensed by Sidney S.

D. \u2018Spot\u2019 Ferguson as a result of an article published last week in the Princess \u25a0 Anne Free Press, a newspaper in which J. Willcox Dunn is listed as publisher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">\u201cThe controversial newspaper story stated that Ferguson had hunted ducks in a blind at Back Bay licensed by Sidney S. Kellam, local business executive and recognized political leader in Princess Anne County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">\u201cFerguson made a statement to the Sun-News in which he stated that he had never in his life been in Sidney Kellam\u2019s duck blind and that he had never sought permission to hunt from the blind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">\u201cThe article also stated that City Sergeant H. E. Halstead had accompanied Ferguson on the ducking party to the celebrated blind and that the affair was a \u2018Kellam party.\u2019 This prompted a statement from City Sergeant Halstead this week which brands the newspaper story as a \u2018deliberate lie\u2019 and further points up the \u2018caliber of man Dunn is.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">\u201cBoth statements this week point out the gross falseness of the Free Press story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-16\">\u201cFerguson\u2019s statement follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-17\">\u201c \u2018Willie Dunn is a fugitive from the truth.

This is a deliberate lie. On the date of November 8th General Hugh Harris and myself used this blind through the courtesy of R. R. McChesney. \u201cSpot\u201d Ferguson has never been in this blind to my knowledge. He certainly has never been in it with me. While I am sure the people are familiar with the caliber of man Dunn is I feel compelled to point out what a deliberate lie this is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201c \u2018I may not agree with Ferguson\u2019s philosophy of a livelihood, but man for man I think it is generally conceded that Ferguson is a better man than Willie Dunn.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">In the issue of December 1, 1955, the \u201cFree Press,\u201d in a headline across the front page, Dunn replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cSUN-NEWS MUST RETRACT DUNN STORY OR FACE LIBEL SUIT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">Underneath appears the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">\u201cFREE PRESS ADAMANT;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">WON\u2019T TOLERATE HEDGING;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">BACK UP OR GET READY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Then in two columns, entitled \u201cDuck Blind Affair,\u201d were repeated the statements made in the November 17 issue of \u201cFree Press\u201d and in an adjoining column the statement of the \u201cSun-News\u201d of November 24,1955, above set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">In the right-hand column of the \u201cFree Press,\u201d this statement was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-16\">\u201cThe Virginia Beach Sun-News in its next issue must unequivocally and completely retract the story which appeared in its November 24, 1955 edition banner-lined \u2018Dunn A Fugitive From Truth\u2019-Ferguson or face a libel suit. The Free Press and its publisher J.

Kellam, brother of Floyd E. Kellam Circuit Court Judge of Princess Anne County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cThe Sun-News story of the following week appears beside that of the Free Press.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the December 8, 1955, issue of the \u201cVirginia Beach Sun-News,\u201d the second publication complained of, there appears on page 4, next to the editorial column, under the heading, \u201cAround the Cracker Barrel,\u201d the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cLast week Old Willie Dunn, in his usual attempt to sell his newspaper, headlined the fact that the Sun-News must retract a story concerning the \u2018duck blind episode\u2019 or face a libel suit. The original story of the duck blind was published by Willie and the Sun-News feels the duck blind episode was resolved when \u2018Spot\u2019 Ferguson said: \u2018Willie Dunn is a fugitive from the truth.\u2019 The Sun-News is inclined to believe Ferguson ahead of Willie and his newspaper since both Willie and his paper have survived thus far on lies. Willie stated that the Sun-News must \u2018back up or get ready.\u2019 Since we don\u2019t back up we must be ready.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The written, signed statements of Ferguson and H. E. Halstead, City Sergeant of Virginia Beach, referred to in the \u201cSun-News\u201d of November 24, were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In addition, a number of issues of the \u201cFree Press\u201d dating from January 8, 1954, to February 19, 1956, containing statements charging corruption and improper motives on the part of the officeholders of Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach, supporters of the \u201cKellam Machine,\u201d including the defendants, were introduced in evidence. In the issue of January 7, 1954, the defendant, Haycox, was referred to as a \u201crobber baron,\u201d and in its issue of November 18, 1954, as dominated by machine politics. In the last mentioned issue the defendant, Mailhes, was said to be \u201cthe general manager of the machine dominated newspaper,\u201d that is, the \u201cSun-News,\u201d and other persons, including friends, associates and members of the Kellam family and supporters of the so-called \u201cKellam Machine\u201d were described as being \u201calways ready to stand up and be counted\u2014sometimes apparently more than once.\u201d In its issue of February 9, 1956, it published an editorial headed, \u201cKellam Machine Blacks Out Justice at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Virginia Beach.\u201d Under this statement, it attacked certain proceedings in the Police Court of Virginia Beach as like unto the courts of \u201cCommunist Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy,\u201d and charged that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and ex-Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, and the brother of the Circuit Court Judge of Princess Anne, an attorney, teamed up to pull through a so-called trial without regard to law and justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In its issue of July 21, 1955, referring to the \u201cKellam Machine\u2019s\u201d victory in the July 12 primary, \u201cas surprising,\u201d it was stated that irregularities were practiced at Virginia Beach precincts, and that \u201cshenanigans\u201d went on around the ballot box aided by \u201cshock troops\u201d and \u201cracketeers\u201d associated with the \u201cKellam Machine.\u201d There were also included statements of threats and physical attacks upon Dunn, and charges made that the trial of his alleged attacker was held in an irregular and improper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The record is replete with extraneous matter, with objections to the admission of evidence, and with repeated objections by counsel for each of the parties to the admission of testimony and exhibits. It is clear from the record, as the trial judge stated during the course of the proceeding, that \u201cThe whole case from beginning to end is political.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">It appeared that in his opening statement to the jury in this case, one of counsel for defendants said: \u201cThe jury will want to know why this law suit was brought in the City of Norfolk and not in Princess Anne County, where the parties reside and are known.\u201d No further reference was made to this question by counsel for the defendants until the closing argument, when this was said: \u201cThe plaintiff did not see fit to bring this case in Princess Anne County where everybody knew him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The first reference to this subject in the testimony occurred when counsel for the plaintiff said: \u201cMr. Parker made a remark about your bringing this law suit in Norfolk. Why did you bring it here?\u201d The answer was: \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea that I could get a fair trial in Princess Anne County.\u201d On cross-examination of Dunn, no reference was made to this question; and it was not until Dunn was recalled and reexamined that the following question was asked by his own counsel: \u201cNow, Mr. Dunn, I understood you to say to Judge Parker that you felt confident that you could not obtain a fair trial in Princess Anne County. Is that correct?\u201d The answer was: \u201cThat is right, or words to that effect.\u201d The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>does not show that counsel for defendants, referred to as \u201cJudge Parker,\u201d asked such a question. After the above answer, counsel for plaintiff offered in evidence a transcript from the record of the proceedings in the case of Morlino against Dunn and \u201cThe Free Press, Incorporated,\u201d tried in the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk. Defendants promptly objected on the ground that the motion and affidavit were purely self-serving declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Then followed considerable argument before the court. Heath, counsel for Dunn, argued that \u201cJudge Parker has gone into it. I want to show why it is true.\u201d Heath then asked the witness, \u201cHave you formerly said to the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County it is impossible for you to have a fair trial in that County?\u201d Dunn replied: \u201cI have.\u201d Parker then renewed his objection to the introduction of a written paper and in response to his objection the court said to Heath: \u201cHe has answered the question. You could, if you saw fit, say why he said that, but that is a self-serving paper you have in your hand.\u201d Nevertheless, counsel for plaintiff persistently argued that the court should permit the introduction of the document and counsel for the defendants continued to object. Then Heath again offered the motion and affidavit, and thereupon the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cMr. Heath: I offer this motion, sir, which has come from the Clerk\u2019s Office across the way with the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cThe Court: He has testified as to the fact that the Judge, upon that motion, transferred it to another Court. What do you want to put that in for? If there was any doubt there it would be different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cMr. Heath: I want this jury to know Mr. Dunn has offered to prove in that County the reasons why he can\u2019t get a fair trial, and I want him to have the opportunity for the jury to know what he said in that motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cThe Court: The witness testified that the Judge did transfer it, and I suppose it was disposed of in that Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cMr. Heath: I want to read this to the jury, what he stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cThe Court: It is a record of the Court of Law and Chancery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cMr. Heath: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cMr. Parker: It is an effort to sling more mud which this plaintiff has been slinging during the time he has published the paper. It emanates from him, and he wants to lift himself by his own boot straps by offering the document.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The court then said: \u201cThe fact that you opened the door as to his bringing it here in this Court and all of that has no place in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u201cThe basis of this controversy is an action for libel as to statements published, that the statements published were libel <em>per se, </em>and you have other defenses. To tell us about another Judge has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Heath replied: \u201cJudge Parker opened the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Later on the court said, with reference to Dunn\u2019s statement of his reason <em>for not </em>bringing the case in Princess Anne, and in response to the above statement of Heath, that \u201cIt is opened, and closed by his giving his reasons why. Why do you want something like that put in evidence?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Counsel for plaintiff continued his efforts to put the motion and affidavit in evidence, on the theory that since the document came from a court of record, it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Thereupon the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cMr. Heath: Judge Parker asserted that this is an effort to spread or sling mud. It is an effort to let the jury know he has been before the Court like a man and told him these are the reasons why he cannot get a fair trial in Princess Anne County, \u2018You are head of the organization and picked the Jury Commissioners,\u2019 and to show the jury he is not up here to evade anything, but he has faced the Judge of the Court and offered to prove why he could not get a fair trial in Princess Anne County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have a copy of the order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">\u201cMr. Heath: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">\u201cThe Court: If it is based on his written motion it can be put in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">\u201cMr. Heath: I apologize for being excited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">\u201cThe Court: This says that \u2018The Judge of this Court, not desiring to preside at the trial of this case, doth transfer same to the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk, Virginia, and directs the Clerk of this Court to deliver the papers to the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk.\u2019 There is nothing in that that he acted on this petition. If he was acting on a written motion, it should be entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">\u201cMr. Heath: I assure you this was the only motion before the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">\u201cMr. Kellam: The Judge, on his own motion, may transfer any case to another Court, and the order so shows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cThe Court: If he acted on a motion it should be before the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Defendants objected on the ground that it \u201cis a self-serving declaration and its sole purpose is to inflame and prejudice the jury, and has nothing to do with the issue in this case,\u201d and noted an exception to the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The transcript in question, consisting of a motion, an affidavit, and the court orders thereon from an action originally instituted in the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County, and subsequently transferred to the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk, in which Vito Morlino was plaintiff and The Free Press, Incorporated, and J. Willcox Dunn were defendants, was then read to the jury, in form and language as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cThe defendants and each of them move this honorable court that this action be transferred from this court to another court of the Commonwealth of Virginia having jurisdiction to hear and determine it, upon the ground that the defendants and neither of them can obtain and have a fair and impartial trial by jury in this court. And for grounds in support of this, their motion, the defendants allege as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201c1. There exists and has long existed in the County of Princess Anne and in the City of Virginia Beach a political combination, commonly called the Kellam Machine or Kellam Organization led by Floyd E.

In so doing, he has from time to time and in many issues of the \u2018Princess Anne Free Press\u2019 strongly assailed the said Floyd E. Kellam, Sidney S. Kellam, Clarence E.

FENTRESS, Clerk By (S) R. H. WEST, Deputy Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Plaintiff contends, in support of the court\u2019s ruling, that defendants\u2019 counsel, in his opening statement, before the evidence was heard, made an attack upon Dunn by imputing that Dunn had such a widespread bad repute among the citizens of his home county that his testimony would not be accepted by a jury in that county, that doubts were cast upon the truth of Dunn\u2019s statements, and that since the motion and affidavit were a part of the record of a court proceeding, they were admissible as evidence of the prior consistent statements of the witness, Dunn, who had been sought to be impeached by the imputation of misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">None of the defendants in the present case had any connection with the action instituted by Morlino against Dunn and his newspaper in the County of Princess Anne and subsequently transferred to the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk. There was no issue in the pleadings in this case as to why Dunn brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>it in the City of Norfolk. He had the right to institute it in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties. His answer to the question, why he brought it in the City of Norfolk, and not in Princess Anne County, was full, direct and responsive. The motion and affidavit consist of a summary of the charges of corruption, malfeasance and misfeasance, which Dunn had published from time to time concerning the defendants, the officeholders of Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach, their friends and associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Whether or not Dunn could get a fair trial in Princess Anne County in the case instituted by Morlino against him, or in this case instituted by him against the defendants, was not in issue in the present case, and had no part or connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The motion and affidavit were plainly self-serving declarations. They pictured Dunn as a zealous crusader striving to protect the public from misdeeds and corruption alleged to have been committed by the so-called \u201cKellam Machine,\u201d and as one earnestly engaged in an effort to obtain and preserve justice, law and order. The affidavit charged that the Kellam organization was engaged in illegal actions and unlawful machinations, and was being supported by persons under its complete- domination and control. The transcript, with the orders of the court included, might well have influenced the jury in the present case to believe that the Court of Law and Chancery had found that the charges made in the affidavit had been established as true in a court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It is conceded that the affidavit formed no part of the <em>res gestae. </em>It is insisted, however, that counsel for defendants \u201copened the door\u201d to its admission by the imputation of misrepresentation by Dunn. The contention is without merit. After plaintiff had fully disposed of the question why he brought the case in the City of Norfolk, it was his counsel who subsequently opened the subject and not the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">There were no imputations in the statements or questions by defendants\u2019 counsel that Dunn had made prior inconsistent statements or misrepresentations as to whether or not he could get a fair trial in Princess Anne County. There were no charges or imputations that he had made different statements about the defendants at any former time. There was no effort to contradict or impeach the witness, or to show a misrepresentation of his attitude or views towards defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In 7 Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence, Evidence, Sec. 255, page 632, is the following apt summary of the rule adopted in Virginia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><em>uSelf-Serving </em>Declarations.\u2014It may be stated generally that a party\u2019s declarations are not admissible as evidence in his own favor unless they form a part of the <em>res gestae. </em>But to come within the terms and operation of the general rule stated above, the declarations must accompany and explain an act done, which is a fact in issue, or is relevant to the issue. Accordingly, it has been held that the declarations of a party in his own favor ought not to be received as evidence, though it is a part of the <em>res gestae </em>of a collateral fact introduced in the case, merely to contradict a witness on the other side, but which fact is in no way otherwise connected with the material inquiry involved in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cSelf-serving declarations made by one party in the absence of the other, should not be admitted in evidence; and if such declarations inadvertently creep into the evidence before the jury, they should be stricken out on motion, and the jury told to disregard them.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In 20 Am. Jur., Evidence, \u00a7 458, pages 404, 405, this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cTestimony may be inadmissible as hearsay, notwithstanding it is the declaration of the witness upon the stand. Thus, a self-serving declaration, offered at the trial for the purpose of fortifying the witness\u2019s own testimony, is inadmissible. Prior statements of a witness are not admissible in corroboration of his testimony, at least until an attack has been made on his credibility.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">See also for further application of the doctrine: <em>Scott and Boyd </em>v. Shelor, 28 <em>Gratt. </em>(69 Va.) 891, 896, <em>Repass </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>99 Va. 508, 39 S. E. 160; <em>Mopsikov </em>v. <em>Cook, 122 </em>Va. 579, 95 S. E. 426; <em>Crowson </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>164 Va. 82, 178 S. E. 898; and <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>194 Va. 179, 187, 72 S. E. 2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The admission of the record from the Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Norfolk was reversible error. The motion and affidavit constituted self-serving declarations in an issue not involved in or connected with the inquiry in this proceeding. They presented to the iury statements calculated to prejudice them against the defendants, and which may have readily affected the finding of the jury, both as to the liability of the defendants and the amount of assessment of damages against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Defendants objected to Instructions P-1 and P-5 on the ground that there was no actual malice shown by the evidence, and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>further ground that Instruction P-5 disregarded the defense of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Without reciting the evidence relating to malice, in view of the fact that the case must be remanded for a new trial, we think that the words used, under the circumstances recited, were sufficient to submit to the jury the question whether or not defendants were actuated by actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Instruction P-5 deals only with one aspect of the case, that is, whether, upon the failure of the defendants to sustain their plea of truth they were further shown to have been actuated by actual malice; whereas, defendants also relied upon the privilege of self-defense in the protection of their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Paraphrasing the language of <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>84 Va. 884, 886, 6 S. E. 474, the question for the jury was not solely whether the language used was true, or whether defendants had reasonable ground to believe it to be true, but whether in point of fact they honestly believed it to be true, and published it without malice, in fair self-defense, or in the reasonable protection of their own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Instruction D-3, as requested by defendants, was first granted by the court and later refused. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201cThe Court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff caused to be published charges of disreputable conduct by any of the defendants, or any other person, or characterized them in such a manner as to bring them into disrepute by publishing derogatory statements concerning them, then the persons so charged are entitled to defend themselves against the charges made against them, and any publication so made in self-defense, if made <em>bona fide </em>and without malice, is privileged, because made in the performance of a moral duty. It is true that one insult cannot be set off against another, yet if a man is attacked in a newspaper, he may reply; and if his reply is not unnecessarily defamatory of his assailant, and is honestly made in self-defense, it will be privileged, and no recovery may be had based thereon. The Court further instructs the jury that it is the duty of the Court to determine whether or not the occasion is privileged, and it is the duty of the jury to determine whether or not the privilege has been abused. The Court instructs you that in the instant case the facts establish that the occasion is a privileged one and that in order to establish that the privilege has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>been abused the burden rests upon the plaintiff to establish abuse of privilege by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">In <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>Elmore, </em>152 Va. 312, 325, 326, 147 S. E. 275, we stated: \u201cThe general rule, which has been repeatedly stated by this court, is that it is the court\u2019s duty to determine as a matter of law whether the occasion is privileged, while the question of whether or not the defendant was actuated by malice, and has abused the occasion and exceeded his privilege are questions of fact for the jury. (Citing cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u201cThere can be no doubt whatever as to this rule. It has been so correctly stated in the cases cited and many others. The case, however, illustrates a qualification of that rule. Generally, all the facts in connection with the actual publication of the libelous language are apparent. This was true in the precedents we have cited. Occasionally, however, cases arise in which, because of sharp and substantial conflicts in the testimony as to the facts upon which the claim or privilege rests, the question as to whether the particular occasion was privileged becomes a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d The instruction is correct from a legal standpoint; but it is calculated to mislead the average layman, such as a juror, because of its failure to define what constitutes an abuse of privilege. It is true that actual malice to the extent defined in Instruction P-5 constituted an abuse of privilege; but, as we have stated, that instruction deals only with one aspect of the case, and there was no other instruction which defined the privilege of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The case does not come within the exception mentioned in <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>Elmore, </em>supra. There are no \u201csharp and substantial conflicts in the testimony as to the facts upon which the claim or privilege rests.\u201d On the other hand, the facts and circumstances surrounding the publications of the defendants appear to be without dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The question of privilege was one for the court, and the question of the use which the defendants made of their privilege, that is, whether thev acted maliciously or not, was a question for the jury to decide. 12 M. J. Libel and Slander, \u00a7 23, pages 72 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>83 Va. 106, 1 S. E. 803, beginning on page 117 of 83 Va., this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201cThe reported cases on the subject of privileged communications are very numerous, and they show that while the law as to such communications is well settled, its application to particular cases is often attended with difficulty. They also show that the law in this par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ticular was formerly more restricted than at present, the rule having been gradually extended, on the ground that it is to the interest of society that correct information should be obtained as to the character and standing of persons with whom others have business or social relations; so that it is now settled, as laid down by Baron Parke in the leading case of <em>Toogood </em>v. <em>Spyring, </em>1 C. M. &amp; R. 181, that a communication honestly made in the performance of a social duty, is no less privileged than one made in self-defense, or in the protection of one\u2019s own interest. And a communication made under such circumstances, and without malice, is protected, notwithstanding its imputations be false, or founded upon the most erroneous information. (Citing a large number of cases.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u201cAccording to these principles, while it is true that one insult cannot be set off against another, <em>(Bourland </em>v. <em>Eidson </em>8 Gratt. 27,) yet if a man is attacked in a newspaper, he may reply; and if his reply is not unnecessarily defamatory of his assailant, and is honestly made in self-defense, it will be privileged. The rule, deducible from the authorities, is expressed by a modern text-writer as follows: \u2018Every man has a right to defend his character against false aspersion. It may be said that this is one of the duties that he owes to himself and to his family. Therefore, communications made in fair self-defense are privileged. If I am attacked in a newspaper, I may write to that paper to rebut the charges, and I may at the same time retort upon my assailant, when such retort is a necessary part of my defense, or fairly arises out of the charges he has made against me.\u2019 Odgers, Lib. and Sland. 228.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The judgment in the above case having been reversed and remanded came on again to be heard on a writ of error to the second judgment of the trial court. <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>84 Va. 884, 6 S. E. 474. The second judgment was reversed for failure of the trial court to instruct the jury in conformity with the general principles laid down in the first appeal as applicable to the case. There the court said that one \u201chonestly defending his character against false aspersion, his communication, if within the limits of the occasion, is protected, because made in the performance of a moral duty.\u201d 84 Va., page 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Portland News Pub. Co., </em>152 Or. 225, 232, 53 P. 2d 529, 103 A. L. R. 470, the principle involved is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cThe' law seems to be well settled that when one is attacked by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>defamatory matter published in the press one may resort to the same methods to reply to or rebut the charges made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Then quoting from Newell, Slander and Libel, 4th Ed., Sec. 429, page 45 6, this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201c \u2018Every man has a right to defend his character against false aspersion. It is one of the duties which he owes to himself and to his family. Therefore, communications made in fair self-defense are privileged. If a person is attacked in a newspaper, he may write to the paper to rebut the charges, and may at the same time retort upon his assailant, where such retort is a necessary part of his defense or fairly arises out of the charges he has made. A man who commences a newspaper war cannot subsequently come to the court as plaintiff to complain that he has had the worst of the fray. But in rebutting an accusation the party should not state what he knows at the time to be untrue, or intrude unnecessarily into the private life or character of his assailant. The privilege extends only to such retorts as are fairly an answer to the attacks.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Fall River Herald News Pub. Co., </em>306 Mass. 488, 28 N. E. 2d 729, 132 A. L. R. 927, the court held that one who is defamed is privileged in branding, in good faith, the defamatory statements as false and calumnious; and if his motives are impugned may comment upon the motives of his defamer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u201cOne attacked by a slander or libel has a right to defend himself, but he has no right to turn his defence into a slanderous or libelous attack, unless it clearly appears that such attack was necessary for his justification.\u201d <em>Borley </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>181 Mass. 246, 247, 63 N. E. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u201cStatements made in an honest endeavor to vindicate one\u2019s character or to protect one\u2019s interests are usually regarded as qualifiedly privileged, even though they are false, if they are made in good faith and without malice. Thus, it seems to be definitely settled that when one person assails another in the public press, the latter is entitled to make reply therein, and so long as the reply does not exceed the occasion, he cannot be held responsible for any resultant injury.\u201d 33 Am. Jur., Libel and Slander, \u00a7 134, page 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u201cThe law justifies a man in repelling a defamatory charge by a denial or by an explanation, and, if he answers the charge in good faith, and what he publishes is fairly an answer, and is published for the purpose of repelling the charge and not with malice, it is privileged.\u201d 53 C.
