Camp III, and Sandie Egley, and Chief Assessor Kevin J. McIlwain (collectively, the County) appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (trial court) that determined that the County's base-year method of property valuation violated the Uniformity Clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Consolidated County Assessment Law (Assessment Law)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and mandated the County to complete a countywide reassessment by 2020. The County asks whether the trial court erred by refusing to exclude objected-to expert testimony and in determining that Taxpayers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were entitled to relief despite the fact that they did not introduce any evidence that they have suffered a specific harm to their particular properties. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2015, Taxpayers filed a complaint in mandamus to compel the County to perform a countywide reassessment pursuant to Section 8801(b)(1)(i) of the Assessment Law, 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8801(b)(1)(i). Taxpayers alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the last countywide assessment was in 1982, and that the County has been applying insufficient and outdated methods for valuing properties, which are grossly inequitable and non-uniform. According to Taxpayers, the 1982 base year was so long ago that the values are not logically related to the present; all new construction since 1982 is assessed at the 1982 values; and the County's assessment of properties at 50% of their market value is not uniform throughout the County. Taxpayers further asserted that the County's base-year system does not have a method to equalize the assessed values of property that have been subject to assessment appeals and the assessments of properties to their predetermined ratios. They alleged that the base-year system effectively freezes some assessments at their predetermined ratios yet permits properties subject to recent reassessment appeals to be valued at 100% of their current market values with the mandatory application of the common level ratio. Based on the foregoing, Taxpayers averred that the County was in violation of the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Assessment Law. Taxpayers requested the trial court to order the County to exercise its authority to undertake a countywide reassessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the County and Intervenors\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed preliminary objections, which the trial court denied. The County and Intervenors filed answers to the complaint. Thereafter, Taxpayers served the County\n   with requests for admissions to which the County responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court held a nonjury trial, during the course of which Taxpayers offered the testimony of expert witnesses, Joseph Nardone and Robert Denne, and their reports. Nardone testified that he was on the team that conducted the last countywide reassessment in Beaver County in 1982, which is still the base year used in assessing property. Nardone testified that he assembled a four-man team, including himself, Denne, Daniel Anderson and Michael Suley, to analyze and proffer an opinion regarding the uniformity of the County's system of property tax assessment. Nardone served as a project manager. Anderson extracted data from the County's Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) system. Suley compiled sales data from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), more specifically, the West Penn Multi-list. Thereafter, Denne performed calculations on the data compiled by Anderson and Suley. Based on this data, Denne opined that the County has a coefficient of dispersion (COD) of 34.5% and that the system of tax assessment employed by the County was not uniform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The County and Intervenors objected to Denne's conclusions arguing that they were hearsay because neither Anderson nor Suley testified, and that a proper foundation for Denne's testimony had not been laid. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 160a-61a. However, the trial court overruled their objections, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The [County] and the Interveners [sic] all had received the report [of Denne] in advance, they knew the identity of those individuals who collect[ed] the data, and if there's a witness that's not going to be here, then that witness's absence is not only attributed to the [Taxpayers], it's going to be attributed to any available party who [sic] could've called that witness to the stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   R.R. at 161a. The trial court stated it would entertain motions to continue the hearing so that the County could bring in the necessary witnesses, which the County declined. R.R. at 171a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of the hearing, the County and Intervenors each moved for a nonsuit, pursuant to Pa. R.C.P. No. 230.1, on the basis that: Taxpayers did not lay a proper foundation for Denne's testimony; Taxpayers did not introduce any evidence relating to their specific properties; and, mandamus relief is not available. The trial court denied their motions. Ultimately, on December 28, 2017, the trial court issued a 28-page opinion and order declaring that the base-year method of valuation employed by Beaver County violates the Uniformity Clause and the Assessment Law because it does not reflect, uniformly and accurately, the proper assessed values of the 96,000 tax parcels in the County. The trial court directed the County to conduct a countywide reassessment by June 15, 2020. From this decision, the County filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the County contends that the trial court erred by admitting Denne's testimony over lack of proper foundation and hearsay objections. In addition, it asserts that the trial court erred by determining that Taxpayers were entitled to relief despite the fact that they did not introduce any evidence that they have suffered a specific harm to their particular\n   properties as a result of the County not doing a countywide reassessment since 1982.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The County claims that the trial court erred by admitting Denne's testimony into evidence over the objections of the County and Intervenors because the facts upon which Denne relied were not articulated or made part of the record. Pursuant to Rule 705 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, the salient facts relied upon as the basis of the expert opinion must be in the record so that the factfinder may evaluate the opinion. Rule 705 differs from the federal rules of evidence, which do not require the expert to disclose facts upon which an opinion is based prior to expressing the opinion. Instead, the cross-examiner bears the burden of probing the basis of the opinion. Such is not the case under Pennsylvania's evidentiary rules. Here, Denne performed calculations on sales data provided by Suley. However, Taxpayers did not present the testimony of Suley or offer the sales data relied upon by Denne. Moreover, Nardone and Denne both testified that Suley did not merely report sales data, but \"weeded out all non 'arms-length transactions' \" prior to delivering the data to Denne. Appellants' Brief at 11. The County asserts that it is unclear which sales were excluded or how the data was compiled or manipulated. In overruling their objections, the trial court inferred that if the County wanted the facts upon which Denne's opinions were based to be made part of the record, the County could have subpoenaed witnesses,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Anderson and Suley, to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 171a. However, it was not the County's burden under Pennsylvania's Rules of Evidence to probe the basis of the expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 705 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence states: \"if an expert states an opinion the expert must state the facts or data upon which the opinion is based.\" Pa.R.E. 705. The Comment to Rule 705 provides that the rule differs significantly from its federal counterpart, F.R.E. 705, which does not require an expert witness to disclose the facts upon which an opinion is based prior to expressing the opinion; instead the cross-examiner bears the burden of probing the basis for the opinion. Pa.R.E. 705, Comment. Pennsylvania does not follow the Federal Rule.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kozak v.

Pa.R.E. 703, Comment. However,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It does not include the third sentence of the Federal Rule that provides that the facts and data that are the bases for the\n   expert's opinion are not admissible unless their probative value substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect. This is inconsistent with Pennsylvania law which requires that facts and data that are the bases for the expert's opinion must be disclosed to the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Pa.R.E.] 705.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Pa.R.E.] 703 requires that the facts or data upon which an expert witness bases an opinion be \"of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field ...\" Whether the facts or data satisfy this requirement is a preliminary question to be determined by the trial court under [Pa.R.E.] 104(a). ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   When an expert testifies about the underlying facts and data that support the expert's opinion and the evidence would be otherwise inadmissible, the trial judge upon request must, or on the judge's own initiative may, instruct the jury to consider the facts and data only to explain the basis for the expert's opinion, and not as substantive evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   An expert witness cannot be a mere conduit for the opinion of another.

R.R. at 154a-55a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nardone testified that he assembled a team with the objective of gathering information about sale prices and assessment values in order to evaluate, under the IAAO standards, uniformity in assessment. R.R. at 117a. Nardone tasked Anderson to extract both assessment and sales data from the County's CAMA system. However, Nardone testified that the sales data from the County's system was outdated and unavailable so the sales data was obtained from the MLS. R.R. at 129a-33a, 146a. According to Nardone, the accepted practice of obtaining data from the MLS was customary, if not preferred, and within the IAAO standards. R.R. at 133a, 146a. Nardone discussed the challenges the team faced with data retrieval and explained in detail how the team matched the parcel identification numbers from the MLS sales data to the parcel identification numbers in the County's assessment data. R.R. at 135a-37a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nardone further testified that Suley extracted the sales data from the MLS. R.R. at 118a, 142a. According to Nardone, Suley utilized \"valid arm's length sales transactions\" from the MLS to correlate with the master file of County records prepared by Anderson. R.R. at 142a; Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 19a. Denne testified that Suley pulled actual sales transactions rather than houses simply listed for sale. R.R. at 198a, 201a. Denne testified that, while the MLS is not foolproof, he based his opinion on over 4,500 records. R.R. at 198a, 201a. Denne reviewed sales records from 2014 through 2017, explaining that the \"the more sales you have, ... the more reliability you have in the statistics your [sic] calculating as they may apply to the population.\" R.R. at 202a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Denne admitted that he refined the sales data from 6,500 properties to 4,500 properties because some of the data could not be matched to the County records. R.R. at 201a. Denne testified he adhered to \"the trimming rules that are recited in the report and promulgated by [the] IAAO in terms of discarding sales that fall outside the bounds of 1 1/2 interquartile ranges from the median ratio.\" R.R. at 202a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Upon review, Taxpayers disclosed the facts upon which Denne based his opinion. Taxpayers established that the MLS was an accepted resource of sales data sanctioned by the IAAO to assist assessment experts in formulating opinions. Although some of the testimony was based on hearsay evidence, such was permissible under Rule 104 in the context of ruling on the admissibility of Denne's opinions. The County offers no basis upon which to conclude that the data gathered and relied upon by Denne was unreliable. Although Suley and Anderson, the team members tasked with gathering sales and assessment data, did not testify, Nardone and Denne testified regarding the contents of the data assembled that formed the bases of Denne's expert opinion. The County was in possession of the reports prepared by both Nardone and Denne (S.R.R. at 15a-46a), and fully aware of the data relied upon, yet chose not to subpoena Suley or Anderson to testify or present any evidence to refute the testimony of Denne. In\n   response to the County's evidentiary objections, the trial court afforded the County the opportunity to continue the hearing to call additional witnesses, which it declined. R.R. at 171a. Thus, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by admitting Denne's testimony over the County's and Intervenors' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Nonsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, the County claims that the trial court erred by denying the County's motions for nonsuit where Taxpayers failed to introduce any evidence of a harm or damage personal to them. According to the County, the taxpayer is only entitled to relief under the Uniformity Clause if it can show its property is assessed at a higher percentage of fair market value than other properties. Such was not shown here. In fact, Taxpayers' expert admitted he did not know if any of Taxpayers' properties were part of the data he analyzed in forming his conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Uniformity Clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides \"all taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.\" Pa.
