(\"Mother\") to her children, K.R., born in November 2010, and E.R., born in March 2012 (the \"Children\"), pursuant to Sections 2511(a)(2), (5) and (8), and (b) of the Adoption Act (\"Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon docket review, this Court ordered these matters would be considered by this Court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .

For the reasons set forth below, we now affirm the termination orders of the orphans' court, and conclude that the orphans' court did not commit a reversible error on the representation issues raised by Mother for the first time in these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts and procedural history underlying this case are undisputed and supported by the record. CYF initially became involved with the family in 2009 after Mother's release from Allegheny County Jail where she spent time on various criminal charges. Mother was twenty-one years old at that time and addicted to heroin. The Children's biological father J.R. (\"Father\") was incarcerated. N.T. Trial, 3/24/17, at 7-8. After Mother's release, CYF received a report that the Children's older stepsibling, who is not a subject of this appeal, had a black eye and a yeast infection. CYF provided Mother in-home services, concrete goods, random urine screens, and referrals for Pennsylvania Organization for Women in Early Recovery (\"POWER\"), SHORES,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and mental health services.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 8. CYF's involvement with the family lasted until February 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CYF next became involved with the family on March 22, 2013 after receiving reports of drug and alcohol abuse and medical neglect of E.R. and the Children's older stepsibling. Specifically, E.R. was born with a birth defect wherein his \"intestines [were] outside of his stomach[,]\" resulting in the absence of a belly button.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9, 14-15. E.R. had not been receiving the necessary medical care for this condition.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9. CYF accepted the family for services, and maintained contact with the parents until June 2013.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   From June 2013 until October 2013, and again from November 2013 until September 2014, CYF was unable to locate the family.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   When CYF located the family, Mother informed them of their homelessness and admitted to actively abusing drugs, including heroin. Father admitted to using Suboxone, but indicated he was amenable to drug and alcohol treatment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10. Upon locating the family in September 2014, CYF maintained continuous contact with them until April 2015. During this time, CYF provided the family in-home services through Holy Family and Family Resources, transportation for the parents, concrete goods, referred them for housing assistance, DART, and Alliance for Infants.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2015, CYF attempted to obtain an emergency custody authorization (\"ECA\") because of \"continued substance abuse,\" and \"continued substance abuse in front of [the Children's older stepsibling].\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11. Moreover, the home \"had needles present and the children were viewing substance abuse.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The juvenile court denied CYF's request for ECA for the Children.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thereafter, CYF \"continued to monitor the family,\" \"supported [M]other to obtain another POWER assessment,\" and conducted frequent home visits.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CYF's implementation of drug and alcohol treatment services was unsuccessful. In particular, CYF received reports that the Children's stepsibling was supervising them, and that the parents were abusing\n   Suboxone without a prescription.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 12-13. As a result, CYF prepared a safety plan pursuant to which the Children's maternal aunt, with whom the family was residing at the time, would support them and supervise their interaction with Mother and Father.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 13. The maternal aunt, however, did not comply with the safety plan.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   CYF \"had indications that [the] parents were continuing to use substances.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Mother was asked to take a random urine screen, the results of which revealed that she was positive for THC and cocaine.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Father refused to take the drug screen.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Based on the foregoing, CYF requested another ECA on June 19, 2015, which the juvenile court granted.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   On the same date, the juvenile court issued orders appointing KidsVoice as the Children's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (\"GAL\") \"to represent the legal interests and best interests of [the Children] in connection with any proceedings related to dependency, including any proceeding before a hearing officer, administrative hearings and reviews.\" Juvenile Court Orders, 6/19/15. At the time the Children were removed from the house and taken into custody, they were dirty, underweight and behind on their immunizations. N.T. Trial, 3/24/17, at 14. Additionally, E.R. \"appeared to have a burn mark on his head.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Children were placed temporarily with D.S., who was not a relative.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following a shelter hearing, the juvenile court transferred the Children's legal and physical custody to CYF and the Children remained in the care of D.S.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 15-16. On June 25, 2015, CYF filed dependency petitions, which the juvenile court granted on September 23, 2015. In so doing, the juvenile court adjudicated the Children dependent because of parental drug use, medical neglect, improper supervision and housing instability. The juvenile court directed Mother to seek drug and alcohol treatment, obtain appropriate housing, and take random urine screens. The permanent placement goal for the Children was to \"return to parent or guardian.\" Orders of Adjudication, 9/23/15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since April 2015, Mother has been enrolled in various maintenance programs to treat her drug addiction. From April 2015 until June 2015, Mother received treatment at Hutton Health.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 26. In July 2015, Mother enrolled in a program at Turning Point to seek treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. N.T. Trial, 3/24/17, at 16-17, 26. She, however, left the program without completing it.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 18. From April 2015 until March 24, 2017, Mother was scheduled for forty-one weekly random urine screens, but attended only nine.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Since December 2015, Mother has attended the Alliance Medical Services Methadone maintenance program.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 27, 29. In October 2016, Mother informed a CYF caseworker that \"she would test positive for opiates, but that she did have a prescription.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 30. In February 2017, Mother was convicted of possession of a controlled substance for an incident that occurred in September 2016.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although CYF provided Mother information for Allegheny Link, a referral to Urban League, and other assistance, she failed to obtain stable housing.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 34. As of March 2017, Mother was residing with her mother.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   CYF maintained regular contact with Mother, except for October and December 2015, when she \"relapsed on heroin.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother also had a history of mental health problems, specifically, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\").\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   To address the mental health concerns, Mother was referred to Mercy Behavioral Health (\"Mercy\").\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 35-36. Mother cancelled two intake appointments at Mercy, on August 22, 2016\n   and September 13, 2016.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 36. She, however, enrolled at Mercy on January 2017, when she attended four sessions there.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Prior to treatment at Mercy, Mother received services for mental health at Staunton Clinic and Crossroads.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 35-36. Additionally, in the summer of 2016, Mother was instructed to participate in a parenting program at the Three Rivers Adoption Council.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 38-39. She, however, failed to complete it because she was discharged from the program, in part, because of her irregular attendance.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 39, 68, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Starting in April 2015, Mother was permitted to have supervised visits with the Children weekly.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 41. In June 2016, Mother's visitation rights were increased to twice weekly.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Even though CYF provided Mother increased visitation with the Children per week, she failed to avail herself of that opportunity.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 67. In fact, of the seventy scheduled visits with the Children since June 2015, Mother attended only thirty-five.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 42. CYF was unaware of Mother's whereabouts from October to December 2015.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 67-68. On December 6, 2016, CYF petitioned the orphans' court to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights to the Children under Section 2511(a)(2), (5) and (8), and (b) of the Act. KidsVoice continued to represent the Children as their GAL in the termination proceedings. On March 24, 2017, the orphans' court held a hearing on CYF's involuntary termination petitions, at which CYF presented the testimony of two witnesses. CYF first called Athena Wight to the stand, who testified that CYF employed her as a caseworker and had assigned her to the instant case. N.T. Trial, 3/24/17, at 5-6. In pertinent part, Ms. Wight testified that Mother\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   has issues staying on track, following directives, maintaining appointments. She can be argumentative. She can be uncooperative. She becomes highly emotional when discussing her family plan goals, as to alleviate the circumstances of the [C]hildren's placement. She has difficulty remembering to be on time for appointments and to follow up with caseworker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 37. Describing the Children's interaction with Mother, Ms. Wight testified that, in the summer of 2016, they would \"speak to [M]other,\" but \"often\" referred to her using her first name.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 43. Ms. Wight further testified that the Children \"called their foster mother at that point mommy in front of [Mother]. They don't become upset when it is time to leave. Mother will prompt them to engage with her and they will, but they don't get upset when it is time to leave.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Describing K.R., Ms. Wight remarked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [K.R.] is shy and quiet sometimes. At the beginning of the case she had difficulty even speaking. She couldn't spell her own name. She displayed a lot of sexual acting out behaviors, like humping things that were inappropriate objects. She also would eat objects that weren't food. When she was fed, she would eat so much that she would get sick. Now, there hasn't been any sexual acting out behavior since her most recent placement. She grooms herself very well. She talks more. She feels comfortable to share her thoughts and feelings with her current foster parents and she doesn't fight with her brother, which was a really big issue as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 49. Ms. Wight testified that K.R. was enrolled at a therapeutic program for children at Matilda Theiss.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 49-50. Next, describing E.R., Ms. Wight stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [E.R.] became really anxious. He would have a lot of stomach issues. He got a lot of motion sickness. Some of that was related to his medical issues, but it was also related to anxiety. He would refuse\n   to get in the car for visits sometimes or just in general. He fought with his sister a lot. He would sometimes bang his head. He became angry and aggressive. Now, he does have some anger still, but he is in a place where he feels comfortable and safe. They have a plan for him in school, so that he can take breaks and relax. He also is participating in therapy with Matilda Theiss. He knows that he will be fed and clothed in the home that he is in now and that is the one thing he punctuated that he wanted to have. He is happier. He talks a whole lot more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 50. Ms. Wight testified that the Children were with a new foster family since December 2016, even though they initially were placed with D.S.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 51. The new foster family was described as \"an adoptive resource.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Since being placed in the care of the new foster family, according to Ms. Wight,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   the [C]hildren aren't fighting, which they were fighting still in the previous placement. [E.R.] was acting out. He cut the cord on the previous caregiver's alarm system. They would attempt to hit each other, knock things over, especially [E.R.]. They were having night terrors ongoing. They are not having any nighttime terrors at all. They sleep in their beds and they don't wake up. They also report to me that they enjoy the fact that the house is clean. [K.R.] most recently stated that she wants to be adopted. She said to me that she knows that she came out of [Mother's] belly, but she wishes that she came out of [foster mom's]. [E.R.] calls his foster father dad. He doesn't refer to [Father]. He hasn't spoken to me about [Father] in some time. I have spoken with the [C]hildren about what kind of home life they would like and they tell me - most notably, [K.R.] told me that she wants to be in a place where she is fed and clothed and bathed regularly. That is all occurring in that home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 52-53. Ms. Wight opined that Mother continues to be unable to meet the essential needs of the Children.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 55. Moreover, Ms. Wight also opined that Mother is unable to remedy the conditions that \"caused [her] incapacity, any abuse, neglect or refusal to parent the [C]hildren.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Mother's] continued inability to sustain mental health treatment, the ongoing criminal activity, the inability to find appropriate housing, to schedule appointments to ensure that her needs are met, and to maintain contact to even come to her visitation and to confirm it continues to be an issue, and her continued non-compliance with the random urine screens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CYF next presented the testimony of Dr. Neil Rosenblum, a licensed clinical psychiatrist at Allegheny Forensic Associates, who evaluated Mother and the Children several times since 2016. Dr. Rosenblum testified that he conducted two individual evaluations of Mother, one in June 2016 and the other in March 2017.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 81. Discussing the difference between the two evaluations, Dr. Rosenblum opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Well, I have to say that not a great deal has changed. When I first met with [M]other, she was living with her mother in McKees Rocks to the best of my knowledge. That was in June of 2016. And when I conducted my more recent evaluation with her this month, March 7, 2017, she was still living with her mother. She was still involved with a new boyfriend by the name of Zach, who she's been involved with now for approximately two years on and off, give or take rather.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   She was in methadone treatment at the time of the initial evaluation and was still in methadone treatment at the time of the second evaluation. Mother does have a long-standing and acknowledged history of substance abuse problems that started initially as a late teenager using marijuana and she indicates that she was introduced to opioids when she started a relationship with [Father] in her early twenties, I believe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   She acknowledges that use of initially pain pills and then later heroin became a long-standing problem that she has struggled with throughout her adult life. She would typically go off of the heroin when she got pregnant. I don't believe either [K.R.] or [E.R.] were born drug-exposed, but sometimes she would take Subutex, buy it on the street, which is typically the opioid blocker that is used for pregnant women or would sometimes use Suboxone, which is a variation of the same. But she acknowledges that it has been very challenging for her to remain drug free. She has been attending methadone [sic] at the Alliance program, I believe for over a year or possibly a little bit longer than that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Mother] also does have a very acknowledged history of mental health problems. She was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and actually continues to display signs of inattention and restlessness and difficulty concentrating. She has also been diagnosed with a mood disorder, a form of bipolar disorder, with mood swings and some symptoms of hypomania such as racing thoughts and rapid speech. She has a lot of sleep difficulties, which is also characteristic of that disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   And she has been prescribed psychotropic medication in different programs, but has had difficulty staying in programs. I believe she was kicked out of Staunton Clinic for missing appointments. She was asked to leave the Crossroads counseling program because she was non-compliant with the Adderall and tried to get a larger prescription or forge a prescription, something of that nature. Then, she did more recently discontinue her last mental health treatment within the past year at Mercy ..., because she felt that she didn't like the medications that they were prescribing for her and they wouldn't prescribe the stimulant medication, Adderall, because of her problems in regulating that in the past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Mother] is a young woman who has struggled with self-esteem problems throughout her life. She has difficulty with her personal identity, with feeling good about herself. She certainly carries a lot of guilt about what she has put herself and her children through over the years. And she recognizes that she has made a lot of bad decisions and used poor judgment. She has largely been dependent on men, primarily [Father]. She got involved with him when he was married. She indicated that when his wife found out, she forced her to have an abortion, but later did go on to have two children with him. But he would go to jail and she'd sometimes feel abandoned. Then, broke off with him about two years ago around the time the [C]hildren were removed. Again, now, is in another relationship with someone who I believe is in recovery. I have not met her current paramour. She's also had a loving relationship with her mother and actually grew up with her mother, according to [Mother], abusing drugs at times.

The orphans' court found that Mother's failure to give priority to parenting and to provide a stable, secure environment for the Children has caused the Children to remain in care.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209640\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/956/999/#p1008\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at # 33.

As more fully discussed,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , K.R. and E.R. have been thriving with their foster family, their behavioral problems have become less pronounced, and their needs are being met.

The orphans' court did not abuse its discretion or err as a matter of law by so finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We now address whether the orphans' court committed an abuse of discretion or error of law by concluding CYS met its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Mother's parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare of the Children under Section 2511(b). Section 2511(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The court in terminating the rights of a parent shall give primary consideration to the developmental, physical and emotional needs and welfare of the child. The rights of a parent shall not be terminated solely on the basis of environmental factors such as inadequate housing, furnishings, income, clothing and medical care if found to be beyond the control of the parent. With respect to any petition filed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (6), or (8), the court shall not consider any efforts by the parent to remedy the conditions described therein which are first initiated subsequent to the giving of notice of the filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   23 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2511(b). Moreover, we have held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Section 2511(b)\"focuses on whether termination of parental rights would best serve the developmental, physical, and emotional needs and welfare of the child.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of J.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7288972\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/991/321/#p324\">\n    991 A.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (Pa. Super. 2010). As this Court has explained, \" Section 2511(b) does not explicitly require a bonding analysis and the term 'bond' is not defined in the Adoption Act.

The foster family is providing the Children a support system and meeting their emotional, physical, and psychological needs. The Children's behavioral problems have improved since they have been in the care of the foster family. Testimony at the hearing further established that the Children have bonded with the foster family, and do not look to Mother to provide for their needs. While Dr. Rosenblum testified that the Children would benefit from some contact with Mother, and the Children have some lingering affection for Mother, there was overwhelming testimony that it is in the Children's best interests to terminate Mother's parental rights. Thus, we find that the orphans' court did not abuse its discretion when it terminated Mother's parental rights pursuant to Section 2511(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We now address Mother's final issue that was the basis for this Court to consider these matters for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   consideration; whether in these TPR proceedings, the orphans' court abused its discretion when it failed to appoint legal counsel for the Children under Section 2313(a) of the Act. Section 2313(a) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Child.-\n   </strong>\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   appoint counsel to represent the child in an involuntary termination proceeding when the proceeding is being contested by one or both of the parents. The court may appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem to represent any child who has not reached the age of 18 years and is subject to any other proceeding under this part whenever it is in the best interests of the child.

With respect to appointment of counsel, our review of the record reveals the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On June 19, 2015, the juvenile court entered separate orders appointing KidsVoice as guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (\"GAL\") in dependency proceedings for K.R. and E.R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its orders provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   KidsVoice is hereby appointed Guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (GAL) for the above-named minor child (Child), to represent the legal interests and best interests of Child in connection with any proceedings related to dependency, including any proceeding before a hearing officer, administrative hearings and reviews.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   If the grounds for dependency DO NOT fall within paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4) or (10) of the definition of Dependent Child in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6302, KidsVoice is appointed as attorney for child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Juvenile Court Orders, 6/19/15, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the juvenile court entered orders of adjudication and disposition finding, by clear and convincing evidence, the Children dependent pursuant to the Pennsylvania Juvenile Act at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6302. Almost one year later, on September 15, 2016, the juvenile court entered orders granting motions to schedule hearings on requests by CYF for goal changes and TPR hearings. Goal change and termination proceedings began on March 24, 2017. At that time, KidsVoice, through its counsel, indicated that it was appearing as guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   for the Children. N.T. Trial, 3/24/17, at 2-3. During the course of cross-examination, counsel for KidsVoice indicated that she was the \"attorney\" for the Children.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 101. At the conclusion of the termination proceedings, counsel for KidsVoice indicated that the Children expressed their wish to be adopted by their foster care family, or as the younger child indicated, \"their forever home,\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 112-13, and agreed that CYS met its burden to terminate parental rights by clear and convincing evidence. The orphans' court docket does not indicate that the court ever entered a separate order appointing counsel for Children for the goal change and termination proceedings. In fact, the record is silent in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Since we conclude that our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   controls the representation issues raised by Mother's appeals, we proceed first to discuss that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , CYF sought in July 2015 an emergency custody authorization to remove children, T.S. and E.S., from their mother's care, as it believed it no longer could ensure the safety of the children in mother's care. At that time, T.S. and E.S. were approximately 2 and 1 years old, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The children were adjudicated dependent and placed with foster parents. For the placement and permanency review period that followed, the court appointed KidsVoice to represent the Children's best and legal interests in compliance with Section 6311 of the Juvenile Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late 2016, CYS filed a petition to terminate mother's parental rights. CYF and mother were represented by counsel, and as reflected on the hearing transcript and TPR docket sheet, the children were represented by counsel from KidsVoice. The orders appointing KidsVoice to represent the children in the dependency proceedings stated it was to represent their legal and best interests, and it was undisputed that the dual function carried over into the termination proceedings. The children therefore, had continuity of representation between dependency and termination proceedings. However, no independent counsel represented\n   solely the children's legal interests in the termination proceedings. Upon conclusion of the termination proceedings on February 3, 2017, the court terminated mother's parental rights to both children. Mother appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   While mother's appeal in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was pending in this Court, our Supreme Court decided\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on March 28, 2017. In her appellate brief, mother claimed for the first time that children should have been represented by appointed counsel separate from the GAL at the termination proceeding. She argued the failure to do so was structural error and her failure to raise the issue previously should be excused because our Supreme Court had not yet ruled in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at the time of the February 3, 2017 hearing. Both CYS and the GAL maintained mother waived this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Before reaching the merits of mother's representation claim, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court addressed whether the issue of the children's right to counsel under Section 2313(a) was waivable. The Court first noted that while the failure to appoint counsel implicates structural error, that does not in itself resolve the waiver question. Structural error means only that no harmless-error analysis is relevant.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    192 A.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statutory right to counsel under Section 2313(a) belongs to the child, not the parent. The issue was non-waivable as there was no attorney representing\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   the children's legal interests who could have raised their rights in the trial court, and the children plainly could not have done so themselves.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   As important, the Court also concluded that the failure of\n   <em>\n    any party\n   </em>\n   , including mother, to affirmatively request separate counsel for the children cannot constitute waiver.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court next addressed whether an attorney-GAL may represent a child's best and legal interests simultaneously in a termination proceeding, or whether the failure to appoint separate counsel to represent a child's legal interests constitutes error. At the outset of its decision, the Court summarized those points upon which a majority of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   agreed: (a) in a TPR proceeding, the first sentence of Section 2313(a) requires a common pleas court to appoint an attorney to represent the child's legal interests,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the child's preferred outcome; (b) where there is a conflict between a child's legal and best interests, an attorney-GAL, who advocates for the child's best interests, cannot simultaneously represent the child's legal interests; and (c) in such a circumstance, the failure to appoint a separate attorney to represent the child's legal interests constitutes structural error not subject to a harmless-error analysis.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    192 A.3d at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then expressly reaffirmed what four Justices in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   agreed upon; where a child's legal and best interests do not diverge in a termination proceeding, an attorney-GAL representing a child's best interests can also fulfill the role of the attorney appointed under Section 2313(a) to represent the child's legal interests.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     T.S.\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    192 A.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Building further upon its analysis, the Court then concluded that where a child's legal interests are not ascertainable during termination proceedings, such as when a child is of a very young age and unable to express a preference, no conflict can exist for an attorney-GAL appointed under Section 2313(a) to represent simultaneously the child's legal and best interests.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    at 1090, 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a matter of logic, there can be no conflict between an attorney's duty to advance a subjective preference on a child's part that is incapable of ascertainment, and an attorney's concurrent obligation to advocate for a child's best interests, as counsel understands\n   them to be.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore, affirmed this Court's order that concluded the common pleas court did not err in failing to appoint separate counsel to represent the legal interests of the children, T.S. and E.S., who both, due to age, were not able to express their preference in connection to the TPR proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Returning now to the present consolidated appeals, we initially note similarity in several facts to those in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Both cases present instances where the common pleas court appointed an attorney-GAL to represent the children's best and legal interests in dependency proceedings. That dual representation carried over into TPR proceedings without the issuance of a separate appointment order under Section 2313(a). Both cases also present circumstances where mothers raised the issue of representation for the first time on appeal. Factually, the cases are distinguishable in that the children in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   were not capable of expressing their preference due to their young age, whereas here, at the time of TPR proceedings, K.R. and E.R. were approximately 10 and 5 years old, respectively, and were able to express their preferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Based upon our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and its clarification and reaffirmation of principles agreed upon by a majority of Justices in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , we are able to come to the following conclusions with respect to these consolidated appeals. First, Mother did not waive the issue of whether the orphans' court erred in appointment of counsel for Children in these TPR proceeding by raising the issue for the first time on appeal. This issue is non-waivable.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     T.S.\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n    192 A.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Mother, as well as any other party, can raise the non-waivable issue of the Children's legal representation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499914,12499915\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/1080/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Third, under the circumstances of these appeals, the orphans' court did not commit reversible error by not entering a separate order appointing counsel under Section 2313(a) for the Children's legal interests. We come to this latter conclusion because the Children were able to express their preferences to counsel, counsel expressed those preferences, as well as the Children's best interests to the orphans' court, and there was no conflict in these positions. Although the orphans' court did not enter a separate order of counsel appointment for the TPR proceedings, we conclude this was not reversible error, as the Children's legal interests were adequately represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In closing, we too would like to echo our Supreme Court's view that it would be a better practice for a court to place an order on the record formalizing a GAL's role in termination proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     T.S.\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   192 A.3d at n.19. As appointment of counsel to represent a child's legal interests is mandatory under Section 2313(a), clarifying a GAL's role in TPR proceedings ensures that simultaneous representation of a child's legal and best interests is properly considered. When counsel possesses information that gives rise to a conflict that may be detrimental to a child's legal interests, counsel should move the court for appointment of a separate counsel. Doing so is consistent with counsel's ethical obligations under our rules governing the attorney/client relationship.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7, Conflict of Interest: Current Clients. When a child has a preferred outcome that is ascertainable, counsel representing a child's legal interests, after appropriate consultation with the child, should place on the record the child's preferred outcome.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     T.M.L.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496227\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/184/585/#p591\">\n    184 A.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (Pa. Super. 2018). Where a court appoints an attorney, but the attorney never attempts to ascertain the child's position and advocates solely for the child's best interests, the child has been deprived impermissibly of his or\n   her statutory right to counsel serving his legal interests.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496227\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/184/585/#p591\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278585,12278587,12316973,12316966\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/172/\">\n    161 A.3d at 174, 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
