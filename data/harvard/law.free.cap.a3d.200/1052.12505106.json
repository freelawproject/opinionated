In the order, the Trial Court ruled that Appellants may not consider the presence of an outdoor advertising sign on a property when determining its fair market value for the purposes of a real estate tax assessment. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the Trial Court's order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal requires that we interpret the exclusion from taxation for outdoor advertising signs and their support structures that is set forth in Section 8811(b)(4) of the Consolidated County Assessment Law (CCAL), 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8811(b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CCAL governs the assessment of real estate taxes for counties of the Second Class A, including Delaware County, and counties of the Third through Eighth Class. 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8801(b)(1). Section 8811 is divided into two subsections that define what property is to be assessed and taxed and what forms of property are to be omitted from an assessment. Subsection (a) of Section 8811 establishes that real estate is a subject of taxation, which includes \"land, lots of ground, ground rents,\" and buildings situated on the real estate. 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8811(a). Subsection (b), on the other hand, sets forth several \"exceptions\" from taxation for specific kinds of property, including signs and sign structures; machinery, tools, appliances and equipment in a mill, mine, manufactory or industrial establishment; silos and other structures related to the storage of animal feed and structures related to the storage of animal waste or composting; amusement park rides; wind turbine generators and related wind energy appliances and equipment; and high tunnels. 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8811(b). The exclusion for signs and sign structures appears in paragraph (b)(4) of Section 8811, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   No sign or sign structure primarily used to support or display a sign shall be\n   assessed as real property by a county for purposes of the taxation of real property by the county or a political subdivision located within the county or by a municipality located within the county authorized to assess real property for purposes of taxation, regardless of whether the sign or sign structure has become affixed to the real estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8811(b)(4). This exclusion has not previously been addressed in the appellate court decisions of this Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The underlying actions in the Trial Court consist of 26 appeals of real estate tax assessment determinations by the Delaware County Board of Assessment Appeals (Delaware County Board) and the City of Chester Board of Revision of Taxes and Appeals (City of Chester Board) concerning assessments for the 2015 and 2016 tax years for properties contained within either the Chester-Upland School District or the Chichester School District. Each of the 26 properties at issue in these appeals (subject properties) contains an outdoor advertising sign. Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the Trial Court consolidated the 26 appeals to consider the common threshold legal issue of \"whether a taxing authority can use the presence of an outdoor advertising sign to increase the real property tax basis\" of the property. (Trial Court Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, Reproduced Record (R.R.) 13a; Trial Court Orders dated April 4, 2016, January 17, 2017 and April 7, 2017, R.R. 24a-27a, 74a-81a.) Appellants argued before the Trial Court that the assessments of the 26 subject properties should be increased in order to account for revenue that the property owners realized through ground leases or grants of easements to outdoor advertising companies that erected and operated a billboard on the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its April 27, 2017 order, the Trial Court ruled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a taxing authority may NOT use the presence or existence of an outdoor advertising sign thereon to increase a property's real estate tax basis or assessment based upon a claim of increased fair market value determined by the cost, income, comparable sales and/or any other valuation approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (R.R. 120a.) In the order, the Trial Court also affirmed the decisions in the 22 assessment appeals where Appellants' requests to increase the assessment had been rejected by the Delaware County Board, and reversed the 2 Delaware County Board and 2 City of Chester Board decisions that had ruled in favor of Appellants and reassessed the properties. (R.R. 120a-124a.) In its later opinion in support of the order, the Trial Court concluded that the exclusion from taxation for signs and their support structures in Section 8811(b)(4) of the CCAL, 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8811(b)(4), prevented the existence of an outdoor advertising sign on a property from being considered in any manner to raise that property's real estate tax basis. The Trial Court stated that, contrary to Appellants' arguments, the taxation of land, lots and ground rents pursuant to Section 8811(a) does not override the General Assembly's clear exclusion for signs and sign structures set forth in Section 8811(b)(4). (July 18, 2017 Trial Court Opinion at 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 10, 2017, the Trial Court issued an order amending its April 27, 2017 order to include the statement specified in Section 702(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 702(b), to allow an interlocutory appeal by permission. (R.R. 130a.) Appellants filed a joint notice of appeal of the Trial Court's April 27, 2017 order as amended by the May 10, 2017 order, and later filed separate petitions for permission\n   to appeal the Trial Court orders. On July 6, 2017, this Court entered an order granting the petitions for permission to appeal, stating the question to be considered by the Court on appeal as \"Whether a property's fair market value for assessment purposes may include revenue generated from billboard leases, rents or easements?\" On July 20, 2017, this Court entered an order consolidating the three appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In their appeals, Appellants acknowledge that a billboard and the structure that supports it are not to be considered as part of an assessment of property pursuant to Section 8811(b)(4). Nevertheless, Appellants argue that the sign-and-sign-structure exclusion does not preclude assessment of the land on which a billboard sits and the consideration of income derived from a lease of that land for the purpose of erecting and operating a billboard. Rather, Appellants assert that Section 8811(b)(4) clearly and unambiguously only exempts the signs and sign structures and does not exempt the land underneath the signs. Appellants argue that the Trial Court's order denying any use of the \"presence\" of billboards on the subject properties in arriving at an assessment negates any consideration of the revenues that a property owner could realize through a ground lease or grant of an easement to an outdoor advertising operator. Thus, according to Appellants, the Trial Court's order not only denies the existence of the physical billboard, but also denies any consideration of the effect of a billboard lease on the fair market value of the property. Appellants contend that the order accordingly conflicts with precedent concerning assessments under the CCAL, which requires consideration of all of a property's potential uses and the property's ability to generate income, including revenues derived from long-term leases on the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the CCAL, the starting point for determining the valuation of real property for tax assessment purposes is that the property must be assessed at its \"actual value.\"\n   <em>\n    Harley-Davidson Motor Co. v.

Section 8811(b)(4) unambiguously states that a taxing authority must not treat the value of a sign or its support structure as part of the real property subject to taxation in the assessment of the property. As our Supreme Court has explained with respect to the machinery exclusion of Section 8811(b)(1), the purpose of the exclusions is to move into a separate class of non-taxable property what would have been classified as taxable real estate under Section 8811(a) absent the exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Jones and Laughlin Tax Assessment Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1303596\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/405/421/\">\n    405 Pa. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856\">\n    175 A.2d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (1961).

In addition, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Tech One Associates\n   </em>\n   , the appraiser must consider the \"economic reality\" of a long-term lease on a property that provides revenue to the property owner where appropriate.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209403,7311820\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/53/685/\">\n    53 A.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 8811(b)(4), like the other exclusions of that subsection, plainly requires by its text only that the physical billboard sign and the structure that supports the signs be excluded from the valuation, but this provision does not have any effect on a taxing authority's valuation of the land and other non-excluded or non-exempt taxable real estate situated on that land. Nor does the Section 8811(b)(4) exclusion\n   alter the traditional methods of valuation set forth in the CCAL or the foundational principles of valuation set forth in our caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Taxpayers\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   argue that the Trial Court's interpretation of Section 8811(b)(4) was proper because factoring in the amount of rent paid by billboard operators to property owners pursuant to leases or easements into a property's fair market value would value the property to the specific property owner based on its current use, in violation of the \"value-in-use\" concept described in\n   <em>\n    Schaeffer Brewing\n   </em>\n   and decisions of this Court. Taxpayers argue that Appellants' proposed method of valuation that would account for revenue earned by the property owner from leases or easements for billboards would be an improper \"value-in-use\" valuation that would reflect the value of the business activity conducted on the subject properties, which is entirely derived from the excluded non-taxable sign and sign structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, Taxpayers argue that Appellants' proposed methods of valuation would indirectly value the billboards themselves in violation of the Section 8811(b)(4) exclusion. Taxpayers find support for this argument in our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Schaeffer Brewing\n   </em>\n   where the Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The machinery and equipment exclusion clearly evidences a legislative intent and public policy to promote a favorable business climate in Pennsylvania by providing tax relief for Pennsylvania industries. In view of this public policy consideration, it is not sufficient only to exclude machinery and equipment from direct inclusion in the assessable real estate valuation. To give the exclusion proper effect, the assessed value of industrial real estate must not, in any way, reflect consideration of the value of the machinery and equipment. Otherwise, a subtle-but no less real-assessment of machinery and equipment will result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1833021\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/530/451/\">\n    610 A.2d at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Taxpayers argue that, as in\n   <em>\n    Schaeffer Brewing\n   </em>\n   , the amount of rent paid here by billboard operators to the property owners pursuant to leases or easements necessarily \"reflect consideration\" of the billboards and that taxing the rent that is paid by the operators will operate as \"a subtle-but no less real-assessment\" on the billboards themselves, which is contrary to Section 8811(b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Taxpayers raise valid concerns that must be accounted for in any valuation of property on which a billboard sits. We agree that an appraiser must not indirectly value an existing billboard on a property by, for example, considering the revenue generated from the number of advertisements that are placed on that billboard in a given year. However, in this appeal we are only called upon to address the question of whether the revenue that a property owner receives pursuant to a lease or easement for the purpose of erecting a billboard may be considered in a fair market value property assessment. Thus, we conclude only that a property's suitability to a billboard use and income earned by the property owner from the rental of the property to a billboard operator are not excluded from a fair market valuation by Section 8811(b)(4) and that the property\n   should be valued consistent with the general principles of valuation described above. Issues concerning the valuation of any of the individual subject properties are not presently before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Taxpayers contend that Section 8811(b) must be interpreted in favor of property owners and against an extension of the property that is subject to assessment because exclusions from taxation are to be strictly construed against the taxing authority with doubts resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford Central School District v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2473592\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/585/131/\">\n    585 Pa. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2473592,8997635\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/888/616/\">\n    888 A.2d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the doctrine of strict construction of a statute in favor of a party applies only where there is reasonable doubt regarding the meaning of the provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tech One Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209403,7311820\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/53/685/\">\n    53 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   696 ;\n   <em>\n    BFC Hardwoods, Inc. v.

Here, there is no doubt that the text of Section 8811(b)(4) applies only to exclude the valuation of an advertising sign or its sign structure and does not otherwise prohibit the valuation of land according to the CCAL and applicable caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Trial Court's April 27, 2017 order was in error.
