The Attorney General denied their request on the basis that it is a county's duty, under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117, to defend and indemnify its police officers in such matters. The Appellate Division affirmed that decision.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n   We agree with the Appellate Division and thus affirm its judgment. Under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 and N.J.S.A. 59:10-4, the Legislature has provided that each county -- not the Attorney General -- is responsible for defending and potentially indemnifying its police officers.

In 2006, Emmanuel Mervilus was arrested and charged with first-degree robbery, contrary to N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1 ; aggravated assault, contrary to N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b) ; and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, contrary to N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(d). Mervilus, who maintained his innocence, agreed to take a polygraph examination and stipulated to its admissibility at trial.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lieutenant Kaminskas administered Mervilus's polygraph examination. At trial, Lieutenant Kaminskas testified that he frequently administered polygraph examinations on behalf of the Union County Prosecutor's Office (UCPO) because it did not employ a polygraphist. At the time Lieutenant Kaminskas administered Mervilus's polygraph examination, Daniel Vaniska was Chief of the Union County Police Department.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lieutenant Kaminskas testified at Mervilus's trial as the State's polygraph expert. He testified that polygraph tests differentiate reactions of persons who are \"telling the truth\" and those who are \"lying\" and thus innocent or guilty. He testified that polygraph examinations are \"not just a lie detector [but] also a truth indicator.\" He further testified that in his opinion Mervilus \"wasn't telling the truth.\" A jury convicted Mervilus of first-degree robbery and aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Appellate Division reversed his convictions and remanded the matter for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As is relevant here, Mervilus's complaint asserted claims for wrongful prosecution and conviction under federal and state statutes and the common law. The complaint alleged that the State's use of a polygraph examination and Lieutenant Kaminskas's testimony were contributing causes to his wrongful conviction and prosecution.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lieutenant Kaminskas, Chief Vaniska, and the Union County prosecutors requested that the Attorney General defend and indemnify them pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   . The Attorney General agreed to defend and indemnify the county prosecutors but not Lieutenant Kaminskas or Chief Vaniska. The Attorney General noted that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   requires it to defend and indemnify county prosecutors in appropriate circumstances but does not extend to county police officers. In addition, the Attorney General asserted that N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 requires each county to defend its police officers. Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska appealed the Attorney General's decision.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Appellate Division agreed with the Attorney General's reasoning and affirmed. The panel determined first that N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 requires counties to defend their police officers. The appellate panel then considered N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 to -6 and concluded that the Attorney General's duty to defend, as established in those statutes, applies only to \"active and former 'state employees.' \" Finally, the panel reasoned that the \"narrow exception\n   established in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ... applies only to county prosecutors and their employees.\" The Appellate Division found it inappropriate to extend\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   to cover county police officers because that extension would, in the Appellate Division's view, \"create an unnecessary conflict between N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 and N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 to -6.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">\n   We granted the officers' petition for certification,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460920,12492098,12492099,12460919\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/557/\">\n    231 N.J. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492097,12492098,12492099,12460918,12460919,12460920\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/128/\">\n    177 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), and granted amicus curiae status to the County of Hudson, the New Jersey Association of Counties, and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office (MCPO).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska contend they are entitled to defense and indemnification by the Attorney General based on \"the same theory of\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   \" because they, like the members of the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office (SCPO) in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , were \"non-state employees who were acting as an 'arm of the State.' \" The officers argue that Lieutenant Kaminskas's actions in this case \"did not arise of and were not incidental to his employment\" with the county police department, but were instead undertaken for the UCPO. Stressing that they acted \"for the sole benefit and at the exclusive direction of the UCPO\" in all matters connected to this case, the officers assert that fairness and justice require that they \"be given the same protection granted to the UCPO's employees.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n   The officers add that the Appellate Division's approach is unduly rigid given that the Attorney General would be required to defend and indemnify employees of the prosecutor's office if those employees had performed the same functions that Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska performed during Mervilus's criminal trial. According to the officers, the mere fact that the UCPO called upon Lieutenant Kaminskas to \"fill a void within the [UCPO]\" by performing those duties rather than have someone on\n   the UCPO payroll administer and testify about the polygraph test should not make a difference as to defense and indemnification. The officers point to the inclusion of \"servants\" of the State in the Tort Claims Act's definition of \"employee\" in support of their argument that the Act's defense and indemnification provisions can extend to them under the circumstances of this case. And the officers contend that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   requires a context-specific analysis that extends beyond the employer-employee relationship to look at the function performed by the individuals involved.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Attorney General urges us to affirm the Appellate Division's judgment and stresses that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   does not apply to county police officers because\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   specifically addressed the defense and indemnification of county prosecutors and the employees of the county prosecutor's office. According to the Attorney General, the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   Court reached its holding \"that county prosecutors and their employees should be defended and indemnified by the State to the extent\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   engage in investigation and enforcement of the criminal\n   laws\" based on two considerations: first, the Attorney General maintains supervisory control over the county prosecutors; and second, county \"prosecutor's office employees [are] not guaranteed defense and indemnification from the county.\" Unlike employees of the county prosecutor's office, the Attorney General contends, county police officers, by statute, remain under their employing county's control at all times, and N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 provides that the county that employs a particular officer must defend that officer from certain legal actions. Interpreting N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 and N.J.S.A. 59:1-3 to cover county police officers would, in the Attorney General's view, conflict with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n   Amici curiae the County of Hudson and the New Jersey Association of Counties (together, the Counties) argue that the Attorney\n   General is required to defend and indemnify Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   because they worked for the State during Mervilus's criminal trial. The Counties contend that when county police officers work under the prosecutor's supervision, they are not supervised by the county and should thus receive defense and indemnification from the Attorney General, not the county. According to the Counties, requiring the county to defend and indemnify a police officer who works under the control of the prosecutor's office is unjust and may discourage counties from allowing their officers to work under the control of the prosecutor's office.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office (MCPO), as amicus curiae, agrees that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , the Attorney General should be required to defend and indemnify county police officers who work for the prosecutor's office. The MCPO expresses concern that the Appellate Division's decision will prevent prosecutors from presenting the testimony of county police officers during criminal trials.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-32\">\n   We review de novo an agency's interpretation of a statute and legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Lavezzi v.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1, \"the Attorney General shall, upon a request of an employee or former\n   employee of the State, provide for the defense of any action brought against such State employee or former State employee on account of an act or omission in the scope of his employment.\" The Attorney General may refuse to defend an action that falls within section 59:10A-1 only if the Attorney General \"determines that\" (a) \"the act or omission was not within the scope of employment,\" (b) \"the act or the failure to act was because of actual fraud, willful misconduct or actual malice,\" or (c) \"the defense of the action or proceedings by the Attorney General would create a conflict of interest between the State and the employee or former employee.\" N.J.S.A. 59:10A-2. When the Attorney General is required to defend a State employee under that statute, then \"the State shall provide indemnification for the State employee.\" N.J.S.A. 59:10-1. The Tort Claims Act defines an employee as \"an officer, employee, or servant, whether or not compensated or part-time, who is authorized to perform any act or service,\" but \"the term [employee] does not include an independent contractor.\" N.J.S.A. 59:1-3.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition to those provisions pertinent to State employees, the Tort Claims Act addresses the indemnification of other public servants. N.J.S.A. 59:10-4 empowers \"[l]ocal public entities ... to indemnify local public employees consistent with the provisions of this act,\" and specifies that\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [a] local public entity may indemnify an employee of the local public entity for exemplary or punitive damages resulting from the employee's civil violation of\n   State or federal law if, in the opinion of the governing body of the local public entity, the acts committed by the employee upon which the damages are based did not constitute actual fraud, actual malice, willful misconduct or an intentional wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Tort Claims Act uses permissive language as to the indemnification of employees of local public entities, the Act elsewhere creates an affirmative duty to defend county police officers under certain circumstances. As relevant here, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 provides that\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [w]henever a member or officer of a county police, or county park police, department or force is a defendant in any action or legal proceeding arising out of or incidental to the performance of his duties, the governing body of the county, or county park commission, as the case may be, shall provide said member or officer with necessary means for the defense of such action or proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   The parties and amici disagree about whether N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117's imposition of a duty of defense upon the county of employment should govern here, or whether the State should defend and indemnify the officers to the extent that they acted to further a State prosecution.

But that argument ignores a statute that explicitly governs the defense of county police officers in actions such as this one. N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117's language is clear and unambiguous -- and it applies here: Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska are \"defendant[s]\" in the underlying civil action, and that action \"aris[es] out of ... the performance of [their] duties.\" Accordingly, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-117 mandates that the \"governing body of\" Union County defend Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska in the underlying civil action. Union County is therefore responsible for indemnifying Lieutenant Kaminskas and Chief Vaniska pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:10-4.
