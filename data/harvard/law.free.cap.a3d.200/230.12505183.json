Appellant asks this court to reverse all of his convictions, contending that the trial court reversibly erred by employing a husher during the voir dire of prospective jurors, in admitting a photo array containing mugshots even though identity of the shooter was not an issue, in not intervening when the prosecutor made certain remarks during the government's closing argument, and in giving a jury instruction on provocation. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The charges against appellant were based on an incident that occurred in the early morning hours of February 2, 2014, outside of Look Lounge, near the intersection of 20th and K Street, N.W. Johnny Campbell testified that he was leaving the Look Lounge nightclub around 2:40 a.m. on that morning with his friends Jeremy Paige and \"Rob\" and was turning right to walk to his car when he ran into Areka Mitchell, with whom he had gone to high school. Campbell greeted Mitchell, and Mitchell introduced appellant to Campbell as her fianc\u00e9. Campbell testified that appellant then said in an \"angry\" voice, \"Who the fuck are you?\" and \"something like\" \"What are you all, like school buddies or study buddies?\" Campbell and appellant were \"in each other's face,\" and appellant then struck Campbell in the face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Campbell testified that he hit appellant back and they began fighting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant was on the ground when Campbell \"felt a blow to [his] head,\" which \"stunned [him],\" and then felt a second blow to his head, which \"shook [him] up\" and \"made [him] get up off of [appellant].\" Campbell then heard appellant say either \"I'm going to get my shit\" or \"[w]here's my shit,\" words that Campbell understood to mean that appellant was \"going to get [his] gun.\" Campbell also heard Mitchell say, \"[h]e's getting ready to bust your ass,\" which Campbell understood to mean that he was \"about to get shot.\" Campbell testified that he ran diagonally across 20th Street, eventually turning left onto L Street. As he was running across 20th Street, he heard gun shots, causing him to \"r[u]n even faster,\" and he saw \"[appellant] with [his] car door open ... [and] fire coming from the gun\" in appellant's hand. At some point, Campbell became aware of \"a hole in [his] back\" and that he \"couldn't lift [his] arm up.\" He eventually ran into a nearby Exxon station where an ambulance was called and took him to a hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paige, Campbell's friend since childhood, testified that he and Campbell were walking to Campbell's car when appellant called out to Campbell and got \"in [Campbell's] face.\" Paige testified that appellant pushed Campbell in the chest, that Campbell responded by hitting appellant in the face, and that the two men \"got to grappling with each other.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant then fell over a planter, and Campbell \"punch[ed] [appellant] against [appellant's] car.\" That was when Mitchell began hitting Campbell in the back of his head with her high-heeled shoe. After this, appellant and Campbell both got up and the fight continued in the middle of 20th Street, at which time Paige was \"trying to guide [Mitchell]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   from hitting [Campbell] in the back of the head.\" Paige testified that Campbell then \"caught [appellant] with two or three good shots,\" and appellant fell to the ground. Campbell went directly \"across the street from [appellant's] car,\" and Mitchell \"followed [Campbell], screaming.\" Paige \"thought the fight was over,\" but then saw appellant, who had a gun in his hand, \"reach[ ] in[to] the back seat\" of his car (which the testimony indicated was parked on 20th Street between K and L Street), \"load[ ] the magazine into the gun,\" and \"start[ ] shooting.\" Paige testified that \"it seemed like [appellant shot] probably seven to eight bullets\" but that \"[i]t could be more.\" Paige testified that no one was physically hitting appellant at the point when appellant started shooting and that there was no one near appellant who was a physical threat to appellant at that time. Paige denied hitting, punching, or kicking appellant or otherwise participating in the fight and testified that none of the friends who had been with him and Campbell at the club was participating or even standing around during the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") Officer James Burgess, who was with the MPD Crime Scene Investigations Division, collected evidence from the scene of the shooting, including nine cartridge casings, one bullet fragment, and two bullets. The cartridge casings were all found on 20th Street. Officer Burgess testified that one of the bullets was found inside a newspaper box on L Street, near the corner of 20th and L Street, and that the other bullet was found a little further west on L Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Daniel Barrett, a firearms and toolmark examiner with the Department of Forensic Science, testified that all nine cartridge casings were the same caliber and from the same manufacturer and had the same caliber and manufacturer as casings recovered from inside a semiautomatic firearm found in appellant's residence. Mr. Barrett further testified that \"shell casing[s] ... eject to [the shooter's] right side\" and \"bounce when [they] hit[ ] the cement.\" Looking at Government Exhibit 40, which depicted where the shell casings were found on 20th Street, Mr. Barrett testified that the locations were \"indicative of [the shooter] being off to the left and walking in a straight line,\" up 20th Street toward L Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Bruce Abell, the trauma surgeon who attended to Campbell on the morning of the incident, testified that Campbell presented with abrasions to his lip and face, swelling that was \"consistent with someone being punched,\" and \"a small laceration\" on his scalp, which was \"consistent with hitting something or being hit by something.\" Dr. Abell further testified that a bullet pierced and then left Campbell's body and that there was a wound in his left shoulder and on his back. Dr. Abell could not tell which of the wounds was an entrance wound and which was an exit wound. He opined, however, that the wounds were consistent with Campbell's \"facing away from the shooter, but to an angle\" and were \"not consistent with [Campbell's] facing a shooter.\" Dr. Abell also noted that \"with short range gunshots, ... you can actually see some changes on the skin at the entrance wound, ... [i.e.,] stippling,\" which Dr. Abell did not see on Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. William Bruchey, an expert in firearms examination, ballistics, and crime scene reconstruction, testified in the defense's case that there is a \"randomness to the shell casing pattern\" of a semiautomatic pistol. Based on where the shell casings were found on 20th Street, Dr. Bruchey opined that the shooter was \"relatively stationary\" rather than walking. Asked on cross-examination how he accounted for\n   the bullet \"recovered further left on L Street,\" Dr. Bruchey said that a newsstand when hit by a bullet \"can make [the bullet] take a left turn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant testified that after leaving Look Lounge on the early morning in question, he went to retrieve his car, with the intent of pulling it in front of the club to pick up his fianc\u00e9e, Mitchell. The valet parking obstructed appellant from doing this, so he turned right onto 20th Street and found an open parking spot immediately upon turning. After parking, he reached into his glove compartment and retrieved his loaded gun and put it on his hip \"for protection\" because he had been shot about two months previously after leaving a club. The bullet from that shooting had gone through his arm and into his chest and remained lodged there at the time of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant testified that he went to the front of the club and found Mitchell and was walking back to his car with her when they encountered a group of three guys who \"were being loud[and] belligerent.\" One was Campbell, and appellant testified that Campbell \"grabbed [Mitchell] by the hips and pulled her close\" and, when Mitchell \"pushed his hand off her,\" \"kept on approaching, [and being] aggressive toward her.\" Appellant then grabbed Campbell's shoulders, and turned him around, and the two of them \"had verbal words.\" During this time, appellant testified, Mitchell was pulling appellant away \"because she ... didn't want the argument to escalate\" and walking towards the car. When appellant reached the driver-side door but before he could get into the car, Campbell \"ran up\" and punched him in the face. Campbell and appellant started fighting, and Paige \"ran over and ... started ... swinging at [appellant],\" \"hitting [him] on top of [his] head,\" and it became \"like a moving brawl.\" Appellant testified that he heard Rob say \"move back, let me stab him.\" Appellant then \"pushed off as hard as [he] could\" from the two others and reached for his gun and \"pulled the trigger[ ] as fast as [he] could,\" afraid that one of the men would try to take the gun from him. Appellant testified that he was concerned about \"what would happen to ... [the] bullet in [his] chest\" if he was hit the wrong way, that his intent was \"to just get them off of me\" and \"stop them from jumping me,\" and that it was not his intent to kill Campbell. Appellant told the jury that he was \"disoriented from getting hit\" in the head and could not \"see straight\" because he had blood in his face and eyes, but stopped shooting after he \"started to come to and started to see clearly\" and noticed that \"the threat wasn't there\" and the other men were not in front of him. Appellant acknowledged that he fired nine shots but said that he did not think he hit anyone and therefore just returned home after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The jury received a verdict form that instructed jurors to consider whether appellant was guilty of the lesser-included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon (firearm) if they acquitted appellant of the AWIKWA (firearm) charge. The jury found appellant not guilty of AWIKWA (automobile), assault with a dangerous weapon (automobile), and AAWA (automobile). This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We turn first to the issue appellant raised for the first time in a supplemental brief, which this court granted him leave to file. In seeking permission from the court to file the supplemental brief, counsel explained that it had come to her attention that she \"failed to raise a preserved issue of constitutional importance in [a]ppellant's opening brief: the denial of [appellant's] right to a public trial during jury selection,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   an issue that counsel said was \"essential to raise ... on appeal in order to provide effective assistance to [appellant].\" The government did not oppose appellant's motion to file a supplemental brief, but asserts in a footnote to its supplemental opposition brief that the court could treat the claim raised in the supplemental brief as waived, as this court typically does with arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief or during oral argument. Given counsel's commendable candor and the importance of effective assistance of counsel, we elect to consider the \"public-trial\" issue raised in the supplemental brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record shows that the court posed\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions to prospective jurors in open court and, thereafter, questioned individual jurors about their responses at the bench, with the husher turned on to prevent everyone except the court, the attorneys, appellant, and the court reporter from hearing the exchanges that followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the court described the procedure, it entailed \"doing the examination up at the bench and leaving seats in the back of the courtroom for the public and authorizing access to the proceedings as appropriate or where requests are made.\" Appellant's contention in his supplemental brief is that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a public trial by conducting individual-juror\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   at the bench with the husher turned on, an arrangement that prevented the public from hearing the exchanges that occurred. Appellant asserts that the trial court failed to make the findings required by\n   <em>\n    Waller v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    467 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (\"[T]he party seeking to close the [courtroom] must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant asserts that in the absence of such findings, use of the husher to preclude the public from hearing the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   exchanges at the bench was structural error, entitling him to reversal of his convictions without a required showing of prejudice or harm (and, accordingly, appellant has not attempted to show prejudice from use of the husher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In raising the public-trial issue in the trial court, appellant asserted that there was no \"compelling interest to exclude the public\" and that conducting the jury selection process \"with the husher on albeit with ... seats in the back of the courtroom open ... to people to sit in on a husher,\" i.e., \"where the matters can be seen but not heard,\" was \"not consistent with what the Constitution envisioned as being an open trial.\" The trial judge acknowledged that the public and the press \"have a right to participate\" and a \"right to get every syllable of th[e] conversations\" that occur at the bench during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , a right the court reasoned, however, \"can get effectuated in different ways.\" In denying appellant's request to proceed without the husher, the trial judge cited his concern about \"the candor of prospective jurors,\" which he said was \"[b]ased on 20 years of being a trial lawyer and more\n   than 10 years of being a [j]udge.\" The judge explained that it was his \"experience and belief that [potential jurors] are less forthcoming in response especially to sensitive questions when they don't have, at least, the cover of the husher and being up at the bench.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... public trial ....\" U.S. Const. amend.

We note also that use of the husher avoids the partial closure of the courtroom entailed in the process that appellant's trial counsel told the court had recently been utilized by another judge and that counsel appeared to endorse for use in this case: allowing the public to be in the courtroom as \"the jurors [a]re sent in through the back to answer questions\" from the witness stand \"with the other jurors outside of the courtroom.\" That procedure would have precluded other prospective jurors from seeing the proceedings at the bench during the questioning of their individual co-venire members.

The photo array, with Campbell's initials written near a circle around appellant's face, was published to the jury.

The government introduced into evidence and published to the jury the \"list of faces that [the police] showed [Paige].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, appellant renews his at-trial objection to the trial court's decision to \"admit[ ] and allow[ ] the prosecution to publish to the jury photo arrays containing [appellant's] mugshot.\" Appellant argues that the photo arrays did not satisfy the three-part test this court has adopted for admissibility. We conclude that any error in admission of the photo arrays was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"For admission of 'mug shot type' photographs at trial: 1) [t]he government must have a demonstrable need to introduce the photographs; and 2) [t]he photographs themselves, if shown to the jury, must not imply that the defendant has a prior criminal record; and 3) [t]he manner of introduction at trial must be such that it does not draw particular attention to the source or implications of the photographs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

Appellant argues the government did not have \"a demonstrable need to introduce the photographs\" because \"identification was not in issue\": appellant admitted that he was the shooter, and his trial counsel signaled in her opening statement that appellant's defense to the AWIKWA charge was self-defense. The government retorts that it carried the \"burden to prove appellant committed the charged offenses through admissible evidence\" and that Campbell's and Paige's immediate ability to identify appellant \"was significant evidence supporting their credibility as witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We think appellant has the better of the argument about whether there was a demonstrable need to introduce the photo arrays. Campbell told the jury that he circled on the photo array (Government Ex. 7) the photo of \"the defendant who shot me\" and said at the time, \"That's definitely him. I am never going to forget someone that shot me.\" Similarly, Paige\n   told the jury that upon identifying appellant on the photo array (Government Ex. 10), he made the statements, \"That's the guy.

In addition, it is significant that the mugshot serial numbers, the mugshot.com caption, and the caption \"line up with serial numbers\" were removed from the photo-array sheet published to the jury. Further, the detective who prepared the photo arrays shown to Campbell and Paige made no mention of the source of the photos in the array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But even if the jurors could discern that the photos were mugshots, they also knew from the parties' stipulation regarding the \"certificate of non[-]registration of a firearm in Washington, D.C. for [appellant]\" (which the trial court instructed was \"undisputed evidence\"), and from the trial court's instructions on the elements of the charged offenses of UF and UA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   that appellant did not dispute that he acted in violation of District of Columbia law by bringing an unregistered firearm and ammunition\n   into the District. Despite learning that appellant had broken the law in that way, the jury acquitted him of the charged AWIKWA (car) offense, a verdict we take as evidence that jurors were able to weigh whether the evidence supported conviction notwithstanding the undisputed information they had about appellant's non-compliance with the District's gun laws, which went beyond what an arrest mugshot implies. For that reason, we conclude that introduction of the photo arrays into evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellant asserts that the prosecutor \"seriously misstated the law\" during his rebuttal closing argument when, after reminding the jury of appellant's testimony that \"he was worried ... that the people supposedly beating him up could get his gun,\" went on to remark that appellant had \"brought the gun to the neighborhood,\" and then told the jury that \"a person can't claim self-defense[ ] if they put themselves in the position to ca[u]se the trouble.\" In addition, appellant highlights that after the court overruled defense counsel's objection to the prosecutor's language, the prosecutor continued his rebuttal by \"listing, among the reasons [why appellant] did not act in self-defense, the fact that [appellant] brought that gun there to begin with.\" Appellant argues that through the foregoing remarks, the prosecutor effectively told the jury that it should find that appellant \"forfeited his right to self-defense simply by choosing ... to carry a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"When evaluating a claim of improper prosecutorial argument, we first determine whether or not the challenged argument was improper.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Reviewing the prosecutor's remarks as a whole, we are persuaded by the government's argument.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11564473\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/348/#p353\">\n    739 A.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (D.C. 1999) (\"A criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements must be viewed in context.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Although in isolation, the remarks appellant highlights may have conveyed the erroneous message about which appellant complains, in his additional remarks, the prosecutor focused on the principle that there is no \"right to use excessive force\" and then made statements from which we think the jury would have understood that use of the gun in a non-excessive way would have been permissible in self-defense if appellant had perceived that he was in danger. The prosecutor completed his theme by saying: \"He brought that\n   gun there. He didn't fire a warning shot. He didn't brandish it.\" The prosecutor's references to firing a warning shot and merely brandishing the gun were acknowledgments that although appellant was not entitled to use excessive force, he might have been entitled to use the gun in those non-lethal ways to protect himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, it was undisputed from the outset that appellant brought the gun to the scene, and, at various junctures, the jury learned that this did not preclude a finding that appellant acted in self-defense. For example, during defense counsel's opening statement, she told the jury that they would hear that appellant pulled his gun out from his waistband when he was terrified that two men were going to kill him, and then told the jury that appellant, like everyone, has \"the right to use reasonable force in self-defense.\" The prosecutor objected and the court had a conference with counsel at the bench, but after the conference had concluded, defense counsel continued her opening statement by saying that \"every citizen has a right to self-defense ... when that person actually believes he ... is in imminent danger of serious bodily harm, and when there are reasonable grounds for that belief.\" When the prosecutor objected again, the trial court overruled his objection in open court. We think this exchange would have conveyed to the jury that self-defense was not out of the case just because appellant brought a gun to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court's instructions to the jury lead us to the same conclusion. The court told the jury that the defense theory regarding the charge of AWIKWA (firearm) charge was that \"it was reasonable for [appellant] to believe he was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death\" and that he \"used the degree of force reasonably necessary to defend himself.\" Thereafter, the trial court gave the jury a lengthy self-defense instruction that included the statement that \"[i]f Jonathan Blades actually and reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, and that deadly force was necessary to repel such danger, then he may use deadly force in self-defense.\" The trial court also specifically told the jury that \"[s]elf-defense is a defense to the charge[ ] of [AWIKWA] Firearm.\" The court's instructions thus conveyed to the jury that appellant's possession of a firearm did not preclude his claim of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, even if we assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the prosecutor's comments did imply that appellant had forfeited his right to self-defense by bringing a gun to the scene, we would still conclude that appellant did not suffer \" 'substantial prejudice' from the prosecutor's improper comments\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9024543\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/867/222/#p225\">\n    867 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   226 ). We note first that the jury had ample basis for rejecting appellant's claim that his actions were in self-defense. The evidence showed that appellant shot his gun nine times; that Campbell, who appellant claims was his assailant, was shot not while facing appellant, but in his back or angled shoulder; and that one of the bullets landed around the corner from the location where appellant testified he began firing his gun. There was also evidence (the absence of stippling) that permitted the jury to infer that Campbell had not been shot when he was in close proximity to appellant's gun. In total, the government's evidence suggested that appellant was shooting at and pursuing targets who were running away from him rather than placing him in imminent danger of bodily harm. Indeed, it seems likely, notwithstanding the competing expert testimony about where the shooter might have been standing when the shots were fired, that the jury would have found the photographic evidence of where the casings came to rest - in a line\n   going up 20th Street toward L Street - and the testimony about the bullet found around the corner on L Street to be strong evidence that appellant was pursuing Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, the jury, which was given an option of convicting appellant of the lesser-included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon (firearm) (\"ADW (firearm)\"), convicted appellant of AWIKWA (firearm).

Under appellant's account, what happened immediately afterwards was that Mitchell pulled appellant away \"because she ... didn't\n   want the argument to escalate,\" appellant and Mitchell walked towards appellant's car, and appellant attempted to get into the car - i.e., actions by which appellant signaled his withdrawal from the conflict.

I also agree with her conclusion that, although the government showed no demonstrable need to introduce the photo arrays, any error in their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That is partly for the reasons stated by Judge Thompson,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 242-43, but also because I believe that, rather than any inference of prior arrest implied by the photo arrays, it was the strong inconsistency between appellant's defense of self-defense and the evidence that produced the guilty verdicts. The shell-casing evidence, among other things, was at odds with appellant's story that immediately fearing for his personal safety he took out his gun and repeatedly fired at Johnny Campbell in an impromptu act of self-defense. Nine expended shell-casings were found lying in roughly a straight line extending twenty feet and more along 20th Street. According to firearms examination expert Barrett, this pattern showed that the shooter was walking and firing along the line where the casings fell. That evidence was consistent with Campbell's account, corroborated by eyewitness Page, that after an exchange of punches appellant withdrew to his car, retrieved a handgun or ammunition for it, then turned and fired multiple shots at Campbell, each requiring a separate trigger-squeeze, as Campbell ran from the scene. Additional evidence summarized by Judge Thompson also confirms that \"appellant was shooting at and pursuing targets who were running away from him\" and thus not \"placing him in imminent danger of bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 244.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The hardest issue in this appeal is the prosecutor's repeated erroneous suggestion in rebuttal argument that appellant had forfeited self-defense by the act of bringing \"the gun to the fistfight\" or \"to the neighborhood.\" Although the trial judge appeared to recognize this error later, he overruled appellant's contemporaneous objection to it and, in instructing the jury on provocation (\"[o]ne who deliberately puts himself in a position where he has reason to believe that his presence will provoke trouble cannot claim self-defense\"), gave arguable support to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, like Judge Thompson, I am confident the jury did not reject self-defense because of appellant's having \"brought the gun downtown,\" but instead because of his excessive use of force in the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"I will give you the first nine reasons why this was not a case of self-defense,\" the prosecutor began rebuttal argument: \"Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam ... the defendant standing there at the top of that block, walking forward, shooting as he goes....\" As stated above, the combined ballistics evidence and testimony of Campbell and Paige strongly favored this scenario of appellant retreating to his car for a gun or ammunition and then firing repeatedly at Campbell when any threat of harm from Campbell or his friends had largely dissipated. The eyewitness and ballistics testimony, the opening statements and closing arguments of the parties, and the jury instructions all focused primarily on this issue of whether, in firing the gun, appellant had used force he actually and reasonably believed necessary to avert immediate harm to his person. While the prosecutor tried to score extra points by erroneously relying on appellant's possession of the gun from the start, I am convinced that this ultimately did not distract the jury from evaluating appellant's actual use of the gun and convicting him based on evidence redolent of excessive force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Appellant testified that before the fighting began, Rob left \"to get the car for another buddy that was inside\" and thus was not on the scene.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Campbell also testified that shortly after the shooting ceased, he saw appellant's car coming at him and was hit and \"rolled off the car.\" Appellant was found not guilty of the charges related to this allegation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Paige agreed that Campbell threw the first punch.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \"A 'husher' is a mechanical, white noise device intended to foster the confidentiality of conversations at the bench (in this case, to protect the privacy of prospective jurors).\"\n    <em>\n     Barrows v.

Much like in the present case, the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   expressed generalized concerns about the candor of prospective jurors in justifying the decision to deny access to the questionnaires.

Every case the majority cites is a case in which the approved-of alternative was tailored to the case based on a finding of compelling need grounded in the specific circumstances, as opposed to the husher procedure in this case, which was employed as a matter of longstanding practice based on generalized concerns and without individualized findings about a case-specific privacy interest at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Each of the other obstructed-view cases on which the majority relies holds exactly that: that the use of a screen to prevent the public from seeing a particular witness was not a violation of the right to a public trial because the court employing this method satisfactorily jumped through the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   hoops.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These courts' exacting adherence to\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   's stringent test underscores the distinction between their particularized scrutiny and the routine employment of the husher in Superior Court voir dire proceedings and shows why the jury selection procedure in this case violated Mr. Blades's public trial right. Whether these sorts of restrictions on jurors' ability to see or hear certain court proceedings are called closures or alternatives, they only become reasonable-and constitutional-by surviving the test designed to confine them to the most exceptional circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Given the strong presumption of openness, the majority's effort to distinguish cases that could more naturally be cited in support of Mr. Blades's argument in this case is perplexing.

According to my colleagues, for example,\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   does not support reversal in this case (1) because it did not address the specific issue in the present case-namely, \"whether the press had a right to listen contemporaneously to oral\n   <em>\n    voir-dire\n   </em>\n   questioning of individual\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   jurors,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 241 n.10, and (2) because it involved access only to the questionnaires completed by\n   <em>\n    empaneled\n   </em>\n   jurors. These are both true, but are not good reasons to treat the use of the husher differently. My colleagues in the majority also recognize the potential relevance of the court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   that the trial court \"had no problem keeping oral\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   open to the public,\" which seems to suggest that voir dire was conducted openly in that case and that the court recognized the importance of that openness. But the majority downplays the significance of this statement because the court did not specifically say whether a husher was used in\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   . Aside from the unlikelihood that the Washington Post would have failed to challenge any procedure that prevented its reporters from hearing the voir dire in that case, if the trial court had utilized a husher at voir dire, the judge probably would not have said at a hearing that \"the press\n   <em>\n    had heard\n   </em>\n   all the individual questioning of prospective jurors,\"\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300334\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/37/879/\">\n    37 A.3d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation in the appellate opinion and emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300334\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/37/879/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300334\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/37/879/\">\n    at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring, in the course of a discussion about jury candor, to \"keeping oral\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   open to the public\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the end, the idea that the right to public trial is not violated by a practice that keeps the public from hearing what is going on during jury selection cannot be squared with the values the Supreme Court has said the public trial right serves.

Mr. Blades counters that the court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   was unnecessary to its decision that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to inform Mr. Copeland of his right to be present at the bench during the voir dire of jurors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Blades also argues that to the extent\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   did resolve the question in this case, that holding was inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaires\n   </em>\n   and we are required to follow the earlier decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

The court's decision today exacerbates and prolongs the uncertainty caused by this tension between\n   <em>\n    Jury Questionnaire\n   </em>\n   's holding (that the preclusion of media access to jury questionnaires in a criminal trial based on generalized concerns alone violates the public's right to be present at jury selection) and the language in\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   , now reinforced by this court (that a practice that precludes all members of the public from hearing\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in a criminal case does not violate a defendant's right to public trial, even when the trial court imposes the practice without making individualized findings justifying the closure and without satisfying the other requirements of\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   ). The majority does not give us a unifying principle for understanding what types of closures are subject to the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   test and what types are not. The significance of the public trial right and the importance of maintaining uniformity among our cases and consistency with Supreme Court precedent may therefore make this case a good candidate for en banc consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although I would reverse the judgment of the Superior Court in this case based on the violation of the public trial right, I also take issue with some aspects of my colleagues' resolution of the remaining issues in this case-particularly their harmless error analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In my concurring colleague's view, \"[t]he hardest issue in this appeal\" is the trial court's error in overruling Mr. Blades's objection to the prosecutor's statements in closing argument.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 247. Judge Farrell and I are in agreement that \"the prosecutor's repeated ... suggestion in rebuttal argument that appellant had forfeited self-defense by the act of bringing 'the gun to the fistfight' or 'to the neighborhood' \" was \"erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 247-48. Unlike my colleagues, however, I am not confident the misstatements were harmless, particularly given that, as Judge Farrell also notes in his concurrence, the trial court's provocation instruction \"gave arguable support\" to the prosecutor's misleading arguments by asserting that a defendant \"cannot claim self-defense\" if he puts himself in a position to provoke trouble.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 247-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   My colleagues nevertheless think the prosecutor's misstatements could not have caused the jury to convict on improper grounds because the government's evidence, particularly the physical evidence, all but compelled the jury to reject Mr. Blades's self-defense claim by demonstrating his \"excessive use of force\" when he\n   fired off nine shots while walking toward Mr. Campbell. Judge Farrell quotes the prosecutor's dramatic reenactment, in closing argument, of Mr. Blades \"walking forward, shooting as he goes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 248. The majority likewise highlights the government's evidence \"that appellant was shooting at and pursuing targets who were running away from him[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 244. And to be sure, this is what the government's firearm examination expert surmised when he looked at a photograph showing where the expended shell casings landed. The expert's testimony is good evidence as far as it goes. The problem with making it the centerpiece of the majority's determination of harmless error, however, is that the overall evidence of the walking-shooter scenario is weak, there is evidence of a self-defense counter-narrative that the jury could have credited, and the record does not feature the kind of evidentiary lopsidedness that might assure us that the prosecutor's misstatements could not have played a role in the jury's verdict because no juror could have maintained any doubt that the government had disproved self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   There are several reasons the ballistics evidence is inadequate footing for my colleagues' conclusion that the jurors could not possibly have been distracted by the prosecutor's misstatements and followed their false lead to conviction. As an initial matter, the expert's pattern-recognition testimony was the only evidence of a walking-shooter scenario, and none of the actual witnesses to the shooting described anything like this. Contrary to Judge Farrell's view that \"the combined ballistics evidence and testimony of Campbell and Paige strongly favored this scenario,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 248, Mr. Campbell testified that he saw Mr. Blades shooting \"with the car door open,\" while Mr. Paige said Mr. Blades shot in a \"standing up-straight position\" \"in the middle of the street.\" Neither eyewitness described Mr. Blades as walking while shooting, and their accounts contradicted each other. Some of these discrepancies were minor and some were more consequential,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but it is fair to say the walking-shooter narrative that was so critical to the government's effort to disprove self-defense was not so airtight as to warrant my colleagues' faith in the harmlessness of the prosecutor's misstatements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Apart from its lack of support from the other evidence, the government's expert's testimony also had its own vulnerabilities. The expert acknowledged that his moving-shooter\n   conclusion was \"based on generalities\" and that he formed his opinion just that morning, shortly before taking the stand, after being shown for the very first time the photograph depicting the shell casings' location. He acknowledged that he had not actually visited the scene and was not aware of the slope of the street where the casings were found. The expert admitted that \"[m]any, many variables\" can affect where casings land and that they can bounce up to 21 feet and they can roll. Though he had not consulted any studies or reference books before reaching his conclusion that the shooter in this case was moving while shooting, during his testimony he recalled one comprehensive study that concluded there could be as much as 75 percent error in shell casing pattern recognition. The question is not whether the expert's walking-shooter opinion was relevant, or whether it supported the government's theory of the case. It was and it did. The question is whether it was so strong as to overwhelm the potential appeal, for any juror, of Mr. Blades's self-defense claim, and thus renders harmless the prosecutor's erroneous suggestion that Mr. Blades had relinquished his right to claim self-defense by bringing a gun to the neighborhood. It was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   My colleagues' certainty about the power of the government's physical evidence is even less justified when one considers that the defense had a firearm expert too-one who, unlike the government's expert, had visited the scene, taken measurements at the scene, and reviewed the police reports before forming his opinion that the pattern of shell casings supported a scenario involving a stationary shooter. Mr. Blades followed his expert's testimony with his own account of the incident and his take on the multiple gunshots and on Mr. Campbell's proximity: he testified that he committed the shooting in self-defense and that he fired his gun blindly after being struck in the head and upon threat of being stabbed, just trying to get the men away from him. Mr. Blades was undoubtedly an interested witness with an incentive to avoid being convicted, and the prosecutor's cross-examination gave the jury additional reasons to question his testimony as well. For its part, the government had its own problems with the credibility of its main witnesses, and acknowledged in its brief that the jury may have had reasons to doubt some of the testimony of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Paige. Most significantly, the jurors did not believe that Mr. Blades had tried to run Mr. Campbell over with his car, and their acquittal of Mr. Blades on the vehicular assault counts suggests they would have viewed the entirety of Mr. Campbell's testimony with some degree of skepticism. All of this is to say that the record in this case is not conducive to a finding of harmless error that is dependent upon the relative strength of the government's case-particularly where the error in question went to the central question whether Mr. Blades shot Mr. Campbell in self-defense and where it was the government's burden to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As to the admission of the mugshots in this case, although the majority states that it is not \"definitively deciding\" that the government had \"no reason to show identification\" at trial, it also concludes-and in his concurrence, Judge Farrell agrees-that Mr. Blades \"has the better of the argument about whether there was a demonstrable need to introduce the photo arrays.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 241. We are in apparent agreement, then, that the government had no reason to introduce Mr. Blades's actual mugshot in a case where defense counsel admitted in opening statement that Mr. Blades was the shooter (in self-defense) and where the government presented \"more than sufficient testimony regarding positive photographic identification\" from its two eyewitnesses, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Paige.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Judge Farrell's focus, in concurrence, is again upon \"the strong inconsistency\" between Mr. Blades's defense theory and the physical evidence.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 247. The government likewise argues in its brief that it was \"the obvious inconsistency of appellant's testimony with the physical evidence, and not any vague inference of prior arrest supposedly implied by the arrays, that produced the verdicts.\" But Mr. Blades's testimony was not inconsistent with the physical evidence-it was inconsistent with the government's expert's opinion of the physical evidence. The government concedes that Mr. Blades's testimony was consistent with the defense expert's opinion of the physical evidence, but dismisses the expert's testimony because \"his analysis suffered from two flaws\"-namely, that he used a different gun at a different location when conducting a test for comparison purposes and that he made a \"self-contradictory claim\" about the randomness of how expended casings land and the ability to see a pattern. These \"flaws\" were grounds for impeachment, not the absolute repudiation of Mr. Blades's theory of self-defense. As in (\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Blades's account of the shooting \"was not a wholly unlikely possibility,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7971549\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/382/1/\">\n    382 A.2d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the jury could well have believed it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   I see no grounds in this record for rejecting the possibility that the combination\n   of Mr. Blades's testimony and the defense expert's analysis could have created a doubt in the mind of at least one juror, particularly where it was the government's burden to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for the harmlessness analysis in the majority opinion, while I agree with my colleagues that the \"unnecessary publication to District of Columbia juries of photo arrays of African-American men also poses a danger of fostering unconscious bias,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 242 n.11, the majority's grounds for nonetheless finding the admission of the mugshot of the African-American defendant in this case harmless beyond a reasonable doubt do not assure me that the jury in this case did not \"consider [Mr. Blades's] bad character in deciding whether to convict [him] of the charged crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7294029\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/983/1029/#p1034\">\n    983 A.2d at 1034, 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). At the outset, that the men photographed were not in prison garb, that someone removed the mugshot serial numbers, and that the detective who created the arrays did not call them \"mugshots\" mean little when, as the majority acknowledges, the \"unsmiling expressions\" on the faces of the men pictured in the photo array still make the photos look like mugshots. See\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 242. And the array still bore indications that it had been altered, in the rough edge that was left when \"mugshot.com\" was removed and in the mark at the top hiding the reference to serial numbers. In any event, as this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the exceptional circumstances in which cleaned-up mugshots might be deemed admissible are limited to those circumstances in which the government proves a demonstrable need.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7971549\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/382/1/\">\n    382 A.2d at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I also cannot agree that the introduction of the mugshot was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt on the ground that the jury had already learned from the evidence at trial that Mr. Blades actually broke the law by bringing an unregistered firearm and ammunition into the district. According to Judge Thompson, the jury's acquittal on the car-related assault showed that the jury could weigh the evidence unaffected by knowledge that Mr. Blades was a lawbreaker.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 242-43. On this point I align with Judge Farrell, who states in his concurrence that we should not \"draw speculative inferences\" from these acquittals. See\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 247 n.1. But in any event, given how many states have far less restrictive gun laws than the District's and how some have no registration requirements at all, I am not as confident as Judge Thompson that Mr. Blades's possession of a gun contrary to the laws of the District \"went beyond what an arrest mugshot implies.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the use of mug shots was not harmless where the complainant's account of a violent attack was not corroborated by physical evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7971549\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/382/1/\">\n    382 A.2d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, my colleagues are confident, albeit for different reasons, that the inference of prior arrest from the admission of the mugshot did not cause the jury to reject Mr. Blades's self-defense claim. But this is a case where the parties presented competing expert testimony supporting their respective accounts of how things happened, where there were strengths and weaknesses to both versions but no glaring lopsidedness or foregone conclusions, where the defendant had a motive to lie but presented a viable story of self-defense consistent with the defense expert's testimony, where the jury discredited the complainant's testimony about a separate incident after the shooting, and where the government's witnesses were neither united nor concretely helpful in corroborating the government's ballistics expert. Under these circumstances, the jury \"might well have been influenced because of the improper, indirect proof of\n   [Mr. Blades's] criminal past.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7294029\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/983/1029/#p1034\">\n    983 A.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This case raises an important question about the constitutionality of a practice frequently used in our trial court. Ultimately, I believe my colleagues' decision to uphold a practice that allowed the public to see, but not hear, the jury selection in Mr. Blades's criminal trial runs afoul of the applicable case law on the right to public trial.

The government's indication that \"the expended casings were found lying almost in a straight line\" is also different from the photograph of the casings' locations, which shows five casings in a line, two several feet off to the left of the line and two several feet off to the right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
