The neighbor lived on the same floor as Vurimindi in Hoopskirt Factory Lofts, a condominium\n   building in Philadelphia. The case was referred to the Philadelphia Municipal Court's arbitration program under Philadelphia Municipal Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 850. Following arbitration of the case, the municipal court judge issued two stay-away orders against Vurimindi.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Vurimindi continued to ignore the stay-away orders, the police arrested him on February 4, 2012, on new disorderly conduct charges involving the same victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 13, 2012, the Commonwealth amended the charges, and the case was assigned a Common Pleas number, CP 51-CR-0008022-2012. The new charges included one count of disorderly conduct and two charges of stalking, one for the same victim as the earlier case, and another stalking charge for a second victim, another female neighbor who also lived on his floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court articulated the specific facts of Vurimindi's stalking in a detailed opinion. Trial Court Opinion, filed September 17, 2017, at 3-10. The full factual history is not necessary for purposes of our disposition. Notably, Vurimindi's egregious and bizarre behavior forced his first victim to install a panic-button alarm system that connected directly to the local police and to consider hiring a body guard.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 5. That victim completed her residency for medical school, found employment out of state and relocated.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7. Vurimindi's actions forced the other victim to sell her condominium and move twice to get away from Vurimindi.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10. Both women were terrified of Vurimindi.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although he was arrested in 2012 for the charges relevant to this case, the trial on these charges was delayed for nearly two years, pending multiple Mental Health Competency Evaluations which were conducted from February 2012 through July 2013. For many months, the court-appointed psychologist determined Vurimindi was not competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ultimately, Vurimindi submitted his own expert report that he was competent, and he waived his right to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 7, 2014, the court held a one-day bench trial on the 2012 charges. The trial court convicted Vurimindi on two counts of stalking (M1) and one count of disorderly conduct (M3). On April 24, 2014, the trial court sentenced Vurimindi to two and one-half to five years of incarceration, followed by five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vurimindi filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   post-sentence motion, dated April 25, 2014, which was received on May 1, 2014, but incorrectly docketed as\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   correspondence. No action was taken on this motion. The next day, on April 26, 2104, Vurimindi filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   PCRA petition. On May 14, 2014, he requested counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2016, Attorney David Rubenstein was appointed to represent Vurimindi in his PCRA action. On May 7, 2016,\n   Attorney Rubenstein filed an amended PCRA Petition and supporting brief on Vurimindi's behalf, seeking among other relief, reinstatement of Vurimindi's direct appeal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 12, 2016, Vurimindi requested that Attorney Rubenstein be removed as his counsel because counsel refused to raise the 484 issues Vurimindi wished to raise in his PCRA Petition. Attorney Rubenstein also requested permission to withdraw as counsel, citing Vurimindi's request for his removal and his threats to sue him in civil court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court conducted a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grazier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing on September 1, 2016, and granted Vurimindi's request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   with his PCRA Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The PCRA court also scheduled a hearing on Vurimindi's PCRA Petition for February 23, 2017. Vurimindi filed a 500-page memorandum of law in support of his PCRA Petition dated January 25, 2017. Then, on February 20, 2017, he filed a 289-page supplemental memorandum of law in support of the same PCRA Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The PCRA hearing occurred on May 2, 2017 and June 27, 2017. At the request of the trial judge, the District Attorney prepared a letter prior to the second day of the hearing. The letter explained the procedural oversight regarding the docketing of Vurimindi's original post-sentence motion, and requested the PCRA court to reinstate Vurimindi's direct appeal rights. On June 27, 2017, the PCRA court ordered that Vurimindi's post-sentence motions be deemed denied by operation of law and reinstated his direct appeal rights. The PCRA court specifically determined that this case was not appropriate for unitary review and directed Mr. Vurimindi\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to raise any issues concerning the ineffectiveness assistance of counsel in his direct appeal. T.C.O., 9/19/17, at 15. The court discussed the appeal process with Vurimindi at this hearing and specifically warned him against filing too many issues on appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Vurimindi timely filed his Notice of Appeal and a Rule 1925(b) statement on July 25, 2017. In this 53-page statement, he raised over 290 issues: 132 numbered issues with multiple sub-issues. He also filed several motions requesting to represent himself in this direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court held a second\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grazier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hearing on August 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After granting Vurimindi's request to represent himself, that\n   same day, the court directed him to file a new\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     concise\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   statement of errors complained of on appeal in accordance with Rule 1925(b)(1) within\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     thirty (30) days\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although he was told to reduce the number of errors he complained of in his original statement and to narrow the issues for meaningful appellate review, on September 6, 2017, Vurimindi instead filed a supplemental concise statement that added 8 additional issues to the 53-page statement he filed on July 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We note that Vurimindi has filed so many motions, requests and briefs with the trial court that the record for this one-day waiver trial consists of nearly 3,400 total pages. These documents include the lengthy documents previously mentioned, together with Vurimindi's repetitive requests to add what he deemed to be \"exculpatory evidence\" to the record\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to correct what he perceived were mistakes in the trial transcripts, in addition to several petitions for adverse orders, motions to recuse the trial court, motions to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and many letters he sent to the judge, which were docketed as\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vurimindi also requested transcripts from each and every time he appeared in court or presented a motion; he believed this was necessary for the record on appeal to be complete. It is unknown whether a \"transcript\" of every proceeding exists. Typically, transcripts are not available or necessary for arguments, but rather, are a means of preserving sworn testimony at hearings. It appears no transcript of the sentencing hearing on April 24, 2017 was submitted with the trial court record to this Court. However, based on the procedural defects of Vurimindi's 1925(b) statement and his appellate brief, the missing transcripts are unnecessary for appellate review in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After receiving Vurimindi's second 1925(b) statement on September 6, 2017, the trial court issued its Opinion on September 19, 2017. The trial court concluded that Vurimindi submitted his voluminous 1925(b) statement \"in bad faith to circumvent the court system\" and recommended that \"his issues be waived and his appeal quashed.\" T.C.O., 9/19/17, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Apparently concerned about the possibility of his appeal being dismissed,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the trial court issued its opinion, Vurimindi filed a motion to amend his 1925 (b) statement on September 25, 2017, followed by an amended 1925(b) statement on September 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Amended Statement was not considered by the trial court. Shortly thereafter, Vurimindi began filing numerous lengthy motions with this Court,\n   including a 59-page motion for a new trial (10/3/17) and a 31-page motion for reconsideration of the trial judge's recommendation to quash the appeal (10/20/17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After several requests for more time, Vurimindi ultimately filed his first appellate brief with this Court in April 2018. His first brief was over 300 pages. Upon a motion of the Commonwealth, this Court struck the brief as non-conforming, and gave Vurimindi a second chance to file a brief that conformed to Chapter 21 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. Despite being told to narrow his issues, Vurimindi's second brief, filed on July 30, 2018, was still over 140 pages. It contained 32 pages of citations; it listed nearly 400 cases and 100 statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his brief, Vurimindi attacked everything he could possibly think of that in any way related to this case. He challenged his competency and ability to waive his right to a jury trial. See Appellant's Brief, at 21-25. He attacked the judges associated with his case.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10-16, 25-38. He attacked the district attorney.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 38-51. He attacked the process at the Municipal Court and the Court of Common Pleas.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 52-58. He repeatedly attacked his trial counsel (6 different lawyers), despite being told his case was not appropriate for unitary review (i.e. his ineffective assistance of counsel claims had to wait for collateral review under the Post-Conviction Relief Act).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 8-10, 58-63. He attacked the statutes under which he was convicted as being unconstitutional.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 63-79. He attacked the verdict.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 79-92. He attacked his sentence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 92-100. Finally, he attacked this Court's ability to make a meaningful review of his case.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 100-108.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After he received the Commonwealth's Brief, which requested that his appeal be dismissed for failure to follow the Rules of Appellate Procedure, Vurimindi filed a 32-page Reply Brief on September 18, 2018, with an additional 100 pages of exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his Reply Brief, Vurimindi admitted his initial appellate brief contained over 51 individual issues, but claimed all the issues are necessary for this Court to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 24, 2018, this case was assigned to this panel for decision. Since that time, Vurimindi has filed more than 10 applications for relief seeking, among other things, to introduce additional evidence into the record and to compel the filing of transcripts from over 35 court appearances at the trial court. As soon as we rule on one of his \"emergency\" applications, Vurimindi files another request asking us to reconsider our previous ruling. His actions have made meaningful appellate review impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As such, we begin our analysis of this case with the trial court's observation that Vurimindi's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status does not relieve him of his duty to follow the Rules of Appellate Procedure. T.C.O., 9/19/17, at 10 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jiricko v. Geico Ins.

To the contrary, any person choosing to represent himself in a legal proceeding must, to a reasonable extent, assume that his lack of expertise and legal training will be his undoing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ullman\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291527\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/995/1207/#p1211\">\n    995 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1211-1212 (Pa. Super. 2010). Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants must comply with the procedural rules set forth in the Pennsylvania Rules of Court; if there are considerable defects, we will be unable to perform appellate review.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The trial court and the Commonwealth maintain that Vurimindi has waived all issues on appeal. The fact the Vurimindi filed a timely 1925(b) statement does not automatically equate with issue preservation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jiricko,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8395042\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/947/206/\">\n    947 A.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As our discussion\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   reveals, the Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement must be sufficiently \"concise\" and \"coherent\" such that the trial court judge may be able to identify the issues to be raised on appeal, and the circumstances must not suggest the existence of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We previously held that a Rule 1925(b) statement is a crucial component of the appellate process because it allows the trial court to identify and focus on those issues the party plans to raise on appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Riley v.
