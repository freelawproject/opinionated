On October 29, 2013, a jury convicted Appellant of multiple counts of conspiracy, burglary, and other related offenses, in connection with four properties in Rush Township. The trial evidence showed how Appellant and his cohorts, Stephanie Keck and Kerry Frank, chose four properties, which appeared to be uninhabited and in the process of renovations or otherwise under construction, to strip them of tools, copper pipes, wiring, and other items to sell for money or drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Specifically, the Commonwealth presented testimony from,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Keck and Mr. Frank, who both received negotiated plea deals in exchange for their testimony. They testified that Appellant had the idea to burglarize the homes because he knew no one was living in them. Ms. Keck and Mr. Frank explained how Appellant deactivated the brake lights on Ms. Keck's vehicle before the burglaries so no one would see them approaching the houses. Ms. Keck was the \"look out\" and Mr. Frank was the \"muscleman.\" Ms. Keck said they wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, and Appellant told her to keep the butts of any cigarettes she smoked during the burglaries so there would be no DNA left on the properties. After the burglaries, Appellant and Ms. Keck went to a scrap yard to sell the copper pipes, wiring, and other materials they had harvested. Appellant retained fifty percent of all money received; Ms. Keck and Mr. Frank split the remainder. Appellant, Ms. Keck, and Mr. Frank also stole tools from one property, which they sold\n   for drugs. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T. Trial, 10/28/13, at 139-241).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The two police officers, who interviewed Appellant about the crimes, testified that Appellant admitted his involvement in the burglaries. Sergeant Frederick described Appellant as \"almost boastful\" about his role in the offenses. He told the officers that Ms. Keck and Mr. Frank chose the properties to burglarize because they knew which ones were vacant from their respective jobs as a newspaper deliverywoman and trash collector. Appellant also said they wore gloves to avoid detection. During Sergeant Frederick's testimony, the Commonwealth introduced a written statement Appellant had given to police. Sergeant Frederick read aloud the relevant portions of Appellant's handwritten statement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I'm not certain of prior activity Kerry Frank or Stephanie Keck were involved [with]. Sometime within the last year, Frank and Keck approached me because Frank saw a few houses that were vacant and had the idea of entering them and removing/selling copper and/or wires. Frank knew the homes were vacant because he would remove trash from the surrounding areas and took notice to the ones that were not occupied. Keck delivered newspapers in a wide area around the...rural county areas and often knew where there were homes for sale [or] vacation[.] These houses were in Rush Township. I was asked to help them with these jobs in exchange for a cut of the profits. Houses were typically checked by\n   <strong>\n    me\n   </strong>\n   prior to entering to make sure no one was currently occupying the property. Typically after the metals were harvested, either Frank or Keck would deliver [it] to the scrap facility. I did attend the process on more than a few occasions in Pottsville and a facility near Allentown. [O]n at least two occasions in Rush Township[, I was] summoned by Keck to a house to help harvest. One was on Main Street and the other was on 309. [A p]roperty on Fairview Street produced copper, ...rods and wire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 260-61) (emphasis added for later discussion). Both police officers conceded on cross-examination that Appellant's written statement gave less detail than the officers' testimony about what Appellant had actually said during the interview. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 241-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant testified in his own defense and denied any involvement in the burglaries. Appellant maintained Ms. Keck had approached him about the burglaries, but Appellant refused to participate. Appellant claimed Ms. Keck summoned him to the properties on two occasions, under false pretenses. On the one occasion when Appellant went to the location Ms. Keck described and discovered Ms. Keck and Mr. Frank in the midst of a burglary, Appellant said he yelled at Ms. Keck for burglarizing a home situated so close to his own home. Appellant admitted he had helped Ms. Keck unload some of the stolen property at a scrap yard following one of the burglaries because she was pregnant and could not lift the materials. Appellant insisted he did not admit his involvement in the burglaries to police at any time and denied implicating himself in his written statement. Importantly, Appellant disputed the portion of Sergeant Frederick's recitation of Appellant's written statement stating: \"Houses were typically checked by\n   <strong>\n    me\n   </strong>\n   prior to entering to make sure no one was currently occupying the property.\" Appellant claimed the word \"me,\" as Sergeant Frederick read it, actually says \"one.\" Appellant submitted his trial testimony was consistent with his written statement concerning his lack of participation in the burglaries. (N.T. Trial, 10/29/13, at 287-330).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following jury instructions, counsel for both parties brought to the court's attention the dispute regarding Appellant's handwritten statement, specifically over whether the statement said \"me\" or \"one.\" Counsel agreed the jury should view the statement to resolve the dispute. Appellant's written statement in its entirety included some references to events unrelated to the crimes at issue. The parties agreed to redact the statement so the jury could view only the portion of the statement Sergeant Frederick had read during his examination, which was relevant to the charges at issue. The court ruled the redacted statement could go out with the jury during deliberations. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 367-68). During defense counsel's closing statement, counsel told the jury it would have an opportunity to review the disputed word in Appellant's written statement to confirm Appellant did not admit any role in the burglaries. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 378-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury convicted Appellant of two counts of conspiracy and four counts each of burglary, criminal trespass, receiving stolen property, criminal mischief, and theft. The court sentenced Appellant on December 6, 2013, to an aggregate term of 40-132 months' imprisonment plus two years' probation. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on January 26, 2015.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On March 26, 2015, Appellant filed a petition for leave to seek allowance of appeal with the Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court denied on April 24, 2015. Therefore, Appellant's judgment of sentence became final on February 25, 2015, upon expiration of the 30-days permitted to file a petition for allowance of appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Appellant alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) the trial court erred by failing to hold a hearing to pursue whether Appellant wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at trial, where Appellant initially indicated he wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   but later changed his mind; and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a hearing on this issue; (2) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek an instruction that the jury could not consider testimony from one accomplice as \"corroborating evidence\" of testimony from another accomplice; and (3) trial counsel was ineffective for agreeing to send Appellant's written statement out with the jury during deliberations. Appellant requested appointment of counsel to litigate his PCRA claims. On March 1, 2016, the court granted Appellant\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   (\"IFP\") status and appointed PCRA counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Commonwealth filed a response to Appellant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   PCRA petition on March 30, 2016. Significantly, PCRA counsel did not file an amended petition on Appellant's behalf or seek to withdraw pursuant to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Turner\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1811648\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/518/491/\">\n    518 Pa. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1811648\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/518/491/\">\n    544 A.2d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On April 1, 2016, the court issued notice of its intent to dismiss Appellant's petition without a hearing per Pa.R.Crim.P. 907.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 8, 2016, Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"Motion for Expedited Disposition.\" Appellant explained he had sent numerous\n   letters to PCRA counsel, but PCRA counsel did not reply. Appellant indicated PCRA counsel did not seek to withdraw under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Turner\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   /\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Finley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Appellant expressed his belief that PCRA counsel had abandoned Appellant. Due to PCRA counsel's abandonment, Appellant said he was forced to assume control over his case to preserve his rights, and chose to ask the court to rule on his petition in an expeditious manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PCRA court took no action regarding Appellant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion raising claims of PCRA counsel's abandonment. Instead, the court simply denied PCRA relief on January 5, 2017. Appellant timely filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   notice of appeal on January 12, 2017. The next day, the court ordered Appellant to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellant timely filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 1925(b) statement on January 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Identifying Appellant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status on appeal, on January 30, 2017, this Court remanded for a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grazier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing to determine if Appellant wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   on appeal or with PCRA counsel, who was still counsel of record. After conducting a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grazier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hearing, the PCRA court relieved PCRA counsel and permitted Appellant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The original three-judge panel disagreed over disposition of this case. Given the disparate dispositions, this Court granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   certification on November 29, 2017, and directed the PCRA court to appoint new counsel. On December 1, 2017, the PCRA court appointed new counsel. Appointed counsel filed a petition to withdraw on December 18, 2017, stating Appellant wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion that day confirming his intent to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . On December 22, 2017, this Court issued an order directing Appellant to notify this Court if he wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and informing Appellant the case would be submitted on the briefs if he planned to proceed without counsel. Appellant filed his express intent to continue\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   on January 16, 2018. Counsel filed a certification with this Court on January 19, 2018, reiterating Appellant's plan to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . On January 23, 2018, this Court granted counsel's petition to withdraw and permitted Appellant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in this\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellant raises the following issues in this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   IS THE TRIAL COURT REQUIRED TO HOLD A HEARING FOLLOWING A DEFENDANT'S UNEQUIVOCAL ASSERTION OF HIS RIGHT TO CONDUCT HIS OWN DEFENSE; IS COUNSEL OBLIGATED TO ADVOCATE TO THE COURT FOR THAT DEFENDANT TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT, AND DID THE PCRA COURT ERR BY DENYING A HEARING TO DETERMINE THIS QUESTION?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   DOES A PCRA COURT ERR IN DECLINING TO HOLD A HEARING WHEN IT IS CLEAR ON THE RECORD THAT A PROPER LIMITING INSTRUCTION WAS NOT GIVEN AT A DEFENDANT'S TRIAL AND IS COUNSEL INEFFECTIVE FOR NOT SEEKING THIS INSTRUCTION WHERE THE FACTS OF THE CASE CALL FOR IT, OR FOR NOT OBJECTING TO ITS EXCLUSION BY THE COURT?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   IS A PCRA COURT REQUIRED TO FIND COUNSEL INEFFECTIVE FOR AN EXPRESS VIOLATION OF A PENNSYLVANIA RULE OF COURT, SPECIFICALLY PA.R.CRIM.P. 646, IN LINE WITH\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     COMMONWEALTH V.

Appellant asserts the trial court failed to conduct a hearing to uncover Appellant's reasons for wanting to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and whether his intended waiver of counsel was valid. Appellant insists he did not \"previously litigate\" this claim for purposes of the PCRA because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to rule on the merits of this issue. Even if the claim of trial court error was previously litigated, Appellant contends trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advocate for Appellant's right to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and secure a hearing on Appellant's request. Appellant maintains trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to withdraw his representation and advance Appellant's right to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Appellant claims he suffered prejudice because he was denied the opportunity to present a defense of his own choosing.

This Court considered the issue on the merits and denied relief, explaining Appellant's claim was disingenuous where Appellant appeared for a hearing on his petition to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and informed the court he had changed his mind and wanted counsel to continue representing Appellant. Because the Superior Court is the highest court in which Appellant was entitled to review\n   <strong>\n    as a matter of right\n   </strong>\n   , and he obtained merits review on his current claim of trial court error, Appellant's underlying issue has been \"previously litigated\" for purposes of the PCRA.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9544(a)(2).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724(a) (explaining final orders of Superior Court may be reviewed by Supreme Court upon allowance of appeal by any two justices of Court upon petition of any party to matter; if petition is granted, Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction); 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5105(b) (stating there shall be no right of appeal from Superior Court to Supreme Court under this section or otherwise).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Regarding Appellant's related but distinct claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, which is properly before us,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see Tedford, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the record shows Appellant filed a pre-trial petition for leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , dated July 23, 2013 and filed August 7, 2013. The court forwarded the motion to counsel per Pa.R.Crim.P. 576. On August 15, 2013, counsel filed a motion to withdraw based on Appellant's request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at trial. The court held a pre-trial conference the next day. At the conference, counsel informed the court Appellant had filed a petition to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   but had since changed his mind and wanted counsel to continue representing him. The court specifically asked Appellant if he wanted to represent himself; Appellant responded: \"Currently, no.\" (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T. Pre-Trial Conference, 8/16/13, at 3). Thus, the record belies Appellant's claim that counsel failed to advocate for Appellant's right to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . To the contrary, counsel filed a motion to withdraw based on Appellant's initial request but\n   <strong>\n    Appellant\n   </strong>\n   subsequently changed his mind and decided to continue with counsel's representation. Under these circumstances, where Appellant's request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   was not \"clear and unequivocal,\" the court had no obligation to conduct a colloquy.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Davido, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

Nevertheless, Appellant asserts the court failed to give a second limiting jury instruction that accomplice testimony cannot be used to corroborate accomplice testimony. Appellant claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request this jury instruction and/or object to its exclusion. Appellant insists the court's jury instruction\n   related to accomplice testimony departed from the suggested standard instruction, which directs the jurors to consider each accomplice's testimony separately and not to consider the testimony of one accomplice as supporting the testimony of the other accomplice. Appellant maintains counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to request the suggested standard instruction on accomplice testimony. Appellant suggests he suffered prejudice because in the absence of the proper jury instruction, the jurors might have improperly considered testimony from Ms. Keck as corroborating the testimony of Mr. Frank or vice versa. Appellant concludes trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek the proper accomplice jury instruction, and this Court must reverse the order denying PCRA relief and grant Appellant a new trial.

A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if he or she has the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the crime and (1) either solicits the other person to commit it or (2) aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing the crime. Put simply, an accomplice is a person who knowingly and voluntarily cooperates with or aids another person in committing an offense and those two witnesses certainly would fall within that definition and so when a Commonwealth witness is an accomplice, his or her testimony has to be judged by special precautionary\n   rules. Experience shows that an accomplice, when caught, may often try to place the blame falsely in the hopes of obtaining favorable treatment for...some corrupt or wicked motive. On the other hand, an accomplice may be a perfectly truthful witness. The special rules that I will give you are meant to help you distinguish between truthful and false accomplice testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Now, as I said, in view of the evidence that was presented, Stephanie Keck and Kerry Frank's criminal involvement in these matters do classify them as accomplices in the crimes charged and so these special rules apply to their testimony. These are, first, you should consider the testimony of accomplices with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source. Second, you should examine the testimony of accomplices closely and accept it only with care and caution.\n   <strong>\n    And third, you should consider whether the testimony of an accomplice is supported in whole or in part by other evidence. Accomplice testimony is more dependable if supported by independent evidence.\n   </strong>\n   However, even if there was no independent supporting evidence, you may still find the defendant guilty solely on the basis of the accomplices' testimony if, after using the special rules I just told you about, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accomplices testified truthfully and that the defendant is guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (N.T., 10/29/13, at 338-40) (emphasis added).

Appellant asserts counsel's actions violated Pa.R.Crim.P. 646, which expressly forbids the jury to have a copy of a defendant's confession during deliberations. Appellant contends trial counsel was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ineffective on this ground. Appellant acknowledges this Court's disposition in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Penrose, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , which considered whether trial counsel had a reasonable basis in permitting a defendant's confession to go out with the jury.

Appellant suggests any violation of Rule 646 constitutes reversible error and automatic grounds for a new trial. Appellant submits that permitting a jury to hold a defendant's confession during deliberations\n   is inherently prejudicial because the jurors will most likely place undue emphasis on the confession, instead of relying on their collective recollection of the trial testimony and evidence. Appellant concludes trial counsel was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ineffective for allowing the \"confession\" to go out with the jury during deliberations, and this Court must reverse the order denying PCRA relief and grant Appellant a new trial.

Therefore, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Penrose\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court held the appellant had failed to meet the second prong of the ineffectiveness of counsel test, where trial counsel had a reasonable basis for his action.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Penrose, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the later case of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Young, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , this Court considered on\n   <strong>\n    direct appeal\n   </strong>\n   whether the trial court had committed reversible error in allowing the defendant's confession to go out with the jury during deliberations and whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the Rule 1114 (now Rule 646 ) violation. Notably, the trial court\n   <strong>\n    declared\n   </strong>\n   it had erred in sending the confession out with the jury and asked the Superior Court to remand for a new trial.

It was [Appellant's] [c]ounsel who wanted the written statement to be considered by the [j]ury because he argued at length that it was [exculpatory]. Moreover, [Appellant's] [c]ounsel and the Assistant District Attorney both conferred with the [c]ourt prior to closing arguments and agreed that portions of the statement had to be redacted (at [Appellant's] insistence).

First, the Majority properly expresses no opinion on the cognizability under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) of Appellant's claim that the trial court should have held a hearing on his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Although I harbor doubt that such a claim is cognizable under the PCRA, the Majority appropriately does not address cognizability, as neither the Commonwealth nor the PCRA court addresses that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, an additional factor supports the Court's decision not to vacate and remand for the appointment of new PCRA counsel.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Majority Opinion, at 1021-22 n. 4.
