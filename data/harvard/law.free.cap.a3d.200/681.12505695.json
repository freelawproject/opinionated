The defendant, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (commissioner), suspended the operator's license of the plaintiff, Angel Huang Do, for ninety days following a hearing at which the hearing officer relied on such a report, which consisted of an A-44 form,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a four page police investigation report, and the results of the plaintiff's breath analysis tests. The plaintiff appealed\n   to the Superior Court from the decision of the commissioner, claiming, inter alia, that this report, which had been admitted into evidence by the hearing officer as a single exhibit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was unreliable, even\n   though it complied with \u00a7 14-227b(c), due to certain inconsistencies and errors contained therein. The plaintiff asserted, therefore, that the hearing officer had abused his discretion by admitting the exhibit into evidence. The trial court rejected the plaintiff's claim but remanded the case to the hearing officer for an articulation of the type of vehicle the plaintiff was driving at the time of her arrest. The plaintiff appealed from the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court which, in a two to one decision, reversed, concluding that the inconsistencies and errors in the exhibit rendered it so unreliable that its admission violated principles of fundamental fairness.

We granted the commissioner's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly determined that principles of fundamental fairness required the preclusion of the exhibit as unreliable even though it complied with \u00a7 14-227b(c).

On April 24, 2014, at approximately midnight, desk personnel notified State Trooper Troy M. Biggs that a 911 caller had described a white Mercedes-Benz\n   driving erratically on Route 63 near Round Hill Road in the town of Bethany. Shortly thereafter, Biggs spotted the Mercedes-Benz traveling northbound on Route 63 and proceeded to follow it. After Biggs observed the vehicle swerving and crossing the center line, he activated his emergency lights and pulled the driver over. Biggs identified the plaintiff as the driver of the vehicle from her Connecticut motor vehicle operator's license. While questioning the plaintiff, Biggs detected a strong odor of alcohol on her breath and inside the car. The plaintiff also admitted to having consumed two alcoholic beverages prior to leaving her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the basis of this information, Biggs asked the plaintiff to exit the vehicle and to perform three standardized field sobriety tests, all of which the plaintiff failed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At 12:30 a.m., Biggs placed the plaintiff under arrest for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and transported her to the Bethany state police barracks, where she was advised of her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights. She then agreed to submit to two breath analysis tests, the results of which indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.1184 and 0.1186 percent, respectively. The plaintiff subsequently was formally charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of General Statutes (Supp. 2014) \u00a7 14-227a (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 26, 2014, in accordance with \u00a7 14-227b(c), Biggs transmitted a copy of the exhibit, which, as we previously indicated, consisted of an A-44 form, a four page police investigation report, and the results of the plaintiff's breath analysis tests, to the department. Each page of the exhibit was subscribed and sworn to electronically by Biggs under penalty of false statement. Biggs' supervising officer, Ryan M. Hennessey, administered an oath to Biggs and signed the exhibit as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 14, 2014, the commissioner notified the plaintiff that her license was being suspended for a period of ninety days. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b(e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff availed herself of her right to contest the suspension at a hearing before an administrative hearing officer designated by the commissioner. Under \u00a7 14-227b(g),\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   such hearings are strictly \"limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of\n   intoxicating liquor or any drug or both; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person ... submit to [a] test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, [which] ... indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\" If the hearing officer finds affirmatively on all four issues, the\n   hearing officer must uphold the commissioner's suspension of the person's license. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to the hearing, the commissioner notified the plaintiff that the exhibit would be offered in evidence pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b(c). At the hearing, the plaintiff objected to the admission of the exhibit on the ground that it was unreliable due to the following internal discrepancies: (1) the A-44 form states that, at the time of her arrest, the plaintiff was driving a 2007 Audi A4 with Massachusetts license plates whereas the investigation report states that the plaintiff was driving a 2006 Mercedes-Benz S28 with Connecticut license plates; (2) after Biggs had subscribed and sworn to the information contained in the A-44 form, Biggs' supervising officer, Hennessey, altered the first page of that form by crossing out \"04/23/2014\" as the date of the incident and writing in \"04/24/14\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) Hennessy also crossed out the name \"Helt, David\" as a person who witnessed the plaintiff's refusal to perform a breath analysis test; and (4) page two of the investigation report, in the prearrest screening section, states that the plaintiff informed Biggs that she was wearing contact lenses whereas the summary of the plaintiff's horizontal gaze nystagmus test results in the same report states that the plaintiff performed that test \"with and without her glasses on.\" On the basis of these alleged discrepancies, the plaintiff\n   argued that the exhibit did not meet the admissibility requirements of \u00a7 14-227b(c) because it could not be determined from the exhibit which vehicle the plaintiff was driving on the night of the incident and because the exhibit was not properly subscribed and sworn to because of the alterations made by Hennessey. In response, the department argued that the discrepancies identified by the plaintiff were mere scrivener's errors that went solely to the weight to be ascribed to the exhibit and not to its admissibility. The hearing officer agreed with the department and admitted the exhibit. The hearing officer advised the plaintiff, however, that he would take into account her arguments regarding the several errors and discrepancies in the exhibit in deciding whether the commissioner had satisfied each of the four requirements specified in \u00a7 14-227b(g) for suspending the plaintiff's operator's license. The plaintiff did not testify or otherwise present any evidence at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 30, 2014, the hearing officer issued the following findings: (1) \"The police officer had probable cause to arrest the [plaintiff] for a violation specified in [\u00a7] 14-227b of the ... General Statutes\"; (2) \"[t]he [plaintiff] was placed under arrest\"; (3) \"[t]he [plaintiff] submitted to the test or analysis and the results indicated a [blood alcohol content] of .08 [percent] or more\"; and (4) \"[the plaintiff] was operating the motor vehicle.\" Consistent with these findings, the commissioner ordered the suspension of the plaintiff's license for a period of ninety days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter filed a petition for reconsideration in which she argued that the hearing officer could not properly have found affirmatively on the fourth issue-namely, that the plaintiff was operating the motor vehicle-because the exhibit indicated that the plaintiff was driving two different vehicles at the time of the incident. The plaintiff further argued that the A-44\n   form was inadmissible due to the alterations that Hennessey had made to it after Biggs had subscribed and sworn to the information contained therein. The\n   commissioner denied the petition for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff appealed from the commissioner's decision to the Superior Court, claiming that the hearing officer had abused his discretion in admitting the exhibit into evidence and that, even if the exhibit had been properly admitted, there was insufficient evidence to support the hearing officer's findings. The trial court rejected the plaintiff's claims, concluding that the exhibit was properly admitted because it complied with the requirements of \u00a7 14-227b(c) and, furthermore, that the contents of the exhibit supported the hearing officer's findings. Specifically, the trial court stated: \"In this case, the A-44 [form] contains the April 26, 2014 electronic sworn signature under penalty of false statement of [Biggs] as the arresting officer. The signature box refers to the report itself and any attachments thereto. The attached investigation report contains the April 26, 2014 electronic sworn signature of [Biggs] as the investigator. These reports thus comply with the statute and provided sufficient reliability to justify their admission at the license suspension hearing in this case. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b(c) (the [c]ommissioner ... may accept a police report under this subsection that is prepared and transmitted as an electronic record, including electronic signature or signatures).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"That reliability is not negated by the plaintiff's claims of discrepancies in the date of arrest and the identity of the motor vehicle that the plaintiff drove. The plaintiff\n   raised both these claims before the hearing officer, thus giving the hearing officer an opportunity to consider them and exercise his discretion concerning the admissibility of the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Under the applicable abuse of discretion standard, no abuse of discretion occurred here.... There is no dispute that the motor vehicle stop took place shortly after midnight on April 24, 2014. Page one of the A-44 [form] shows a typewritten but crossed out notation of the incident date as 04/23/2014. In handwriting, the date of 04/24/14 is added with initials that the commissioner concedes are those of ... Hennessey, who ... administered the oath but was not the sworn, arresting officer. The [exhibit], therefore, does contain this amount of unsworn information, which was improper. However, pages one and two of the A-44 [form] contain four references to the arrest and breath tests taking place in the early morning hours of 04/24/2014. The investigation report then makes six references to the incident and investigation taking place on April 24. Under these circumstances, the hearing officer could reasonably have concluded that the initial notation of 04/23/2014 was a scrivener's error due to fact that the arrest took place shortly after midnight and that this error did not negate the overall reliability of the [exhibit].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The same is true of the discrepancy with regard to the motor vehicle in question. Page one of the A-44 [form] lists the motor vehicle as a 2007 Audi with a Massachusetts registration. In the Property section of the investigation report, however, the motor vehicle is identified as a white 2006 Mercedes-Benz with Connecticut registration 344-ZBO. [Likewise] [t]he narrative [portion] of the [investigation] report states: A 911 caller described the vehicle as a white Mercedes-Benz bearing CT registration\n   344-ZBO. I observed this vehicle traveling northbound .... I activated my overhead emergency\n   strobe lights, sirens and wig-wag headlights. The vehicle pulled over .... I never lost sight of the vehicle from my initial observation to the stop. Although the [exhibit] thus contain[s] conflicting evidence concerning the motor vehicle that the plaintiff operated, that conflict does not negate the overall reliability of the [exhibit], which otherwise meets the statutory and regulatory criteria. Rather, the conflict simply creates a fact or credibility issue for the hearing officer to resolve.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Because the trial court also concluded, however, that the exhibit was ambiguous as to which vehicle the plaintiff was driving on the morning in question, the court remanded the case to the hearing officer for an articulation concerning that factual issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court incorrectly had determined that the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in admitting the exhibit into evidence.\n   <em>\n    Do\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    164 Conn.

In support of this contention, the plaintiff argued, as she had before the trial court, that the discrepancies and errors contained in the exhibit rendered it unreliable and, therefore, inadmissible despite its compliance with \u00a7 14-227b(c). See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    id., at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff also argued, for the first time, that the exhibit likely contained information copied and pasted from the arrest report of another person.

The Appellate Court reasoned, however, that neither it nor this court \"has ever held that technical compliance with [ \u00a7 14-227b ] (c) must always result in the admission of an A-44 form. Although an A-44 form may technically comply with subsection (c), the information contained in the four corners of the document may still lead the hearing officer to conclude that the document is otherwise unreliable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    Id., at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Because the reliability of the A-44 form is of the utmost importance, there may be instances in which an A-44 form contains so many significant internal discrepancies and errors that it is rendered unreliable, at least in the absence of testimony by the arresting officer or other evidence that supports its reliability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    Id., at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Appellate Court's view, Biggs' report was one such instance.

Furthermore, portions of the exhibit have been altered and initialed by an unknown person [namely, RH], and it is unclear whether this person had [personal] knowledge of the incident and swore under oath to the accuracy of the alterations.

The statements that the plaintiff wore contact lenses and that the plaintiff participated in field sobriety tests with and without her glasses also cannot be dismissed as mere scrivener's errors. Additionally, the notation that 'Helt, David' witnessed the plaintiff's refusal to submit to chemical alcohol testing is not a\n   scrivener's error because the department admits that the plaintiff consented to the Breathalyzer test.

In his view, the significant number of factual commonalities between the A-44 form and the attached investigation report, combined with the large and undisputed portion of the exhibit that clearly described the plaintiff and her actions on the night in question, rendered the exhibit sufficiently reliable for use at the hearing.

The investigation report states in relevant part: \"On 04-24-14 at approximately 0018 [hours], I was informed ... that there was a vehicle operating erratically traveling northbound on Route 63 in the area of Round Hill Road in Bethany. A 911 caller described the vehicle as a white Mercedes Benz bearing [Connecticut] registration 344-ZBO. I observed this vehicle traveling northbound, failing to maintain its proper lane, at the intersection of Route 63 and Munson, swerving over the solid double yellow line onto the southbound side of the roadway. I activated my overhead emergency strobe lights, sirens and wig-wag headlights. The vehicle pulled over onto the shoulder at the intersection of Route 63 and Litchfield Turnpike in Bethany. I never lost sight of the vehicle from my initial observation to the stop. [Another] [t]rooper ... arrived on [the] scene to assist [me]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Upon approaching the vehicle ... I observed [an] Asian female seated in the operator's position with the vehicle engine at an idle. The operator, later identified by her [Connecticut] operator's license ... as [the plaintiff] ... was asked for her license, registration\n   and proof of insurance.... I then asked the [plaintiff] where she was coming from to which she stated, 'Milford.' I asked the [plaintiff] where in Milford ... she [was] coming from to which she stated '[m]y house.' I asked the [plaintiff] where she was going to which she [responded] that she was on her way to her boyfriend's house in Bethany. I then asked the [plaintiff] if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages to which she stated '[y]es.' She went on to explain that she had [consumed] a [v]odka and [t]onic and a glass of [s]angria. It should be noted that I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the [plaintiff's] breath as well as the driver's side compartment of the vehicle. I observed that the [plaintiff's] eyes were bloodshot and [glassy]. The [plaintiff] appeared to have difficulty locating [her] ...

[The plaintiff] was then asked if she had any physical injuries and/or disabilities that would prevent her from performing the tests, to which she replied, '[n]o.' [The plaintiff then] stated she was wearing contact lenses ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The investigation report then details the plaintiff's substandard performance on the three field sobriety tests. It also describes her arrest and subsequent transport to the state police barracks, where she was administered her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and read the requisite implied consent advisory. The investigation report further provides that the plaintiff was allowed to call an attorney and that, after speaking with him, she submitted to two breath analysis tests, which indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.1184 and 0.1186, respectively. The investigation report also notes that \"a [video] cassette tape of the [s]tandardized field [s]obriety [t]ests and\n   the [plaintiff's] arrest was removed from the [video recorder] in [Biggs'] assigned vehicle and entered into evidence.... The video portion of the arrest [was] functioning throughout this investigation.\" Finally, the investigation report concludes by providing that the plaintiff was issued a summons to appear on May 8, 2014, at 9:30 a.m. in New Haven Superior Court, that she was released on a $500 nonsurety bond, that her operator's license was revoked in accordance with \u00a7 14-227b(c), and that she was picked up by a friend at 2 a.m. As Judge Bear also noted, the plaintiff did not dispute any of these facts at the administrative hearing;\n   see\n   <em>\n    Do\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    164 Conn.

Indeed, one of them-that the plaintiff performed the horizontal gaze nystagmus test with and without her glasses on even though she told Biggs prior to taking the test that she was wearing contact lenses-does not strike us as a discrepancy at all. The plaintiff could have told Biggs that she was wearing contacts but then removed them to perform the test, believing she would do better on the test without them. In light of her level of intoxication, the plaintiff also could have simply forgotten that she was not wearing her contact lenses when she told Biggs differently, which Biggs then noted in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The other three discrepancies on the A-44 form, an electronic document that contains a series of questions the arresting officer answers by filling in the blank next to the question, also do not warrant exclusion of the\n   exhibit because none of them implicates the four findings prescribed by \u00a7 14-227b(g).

It bears emphasis, moreover, as Judge Bear noted; see\n   <em>\n    Do\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    164 Conn.

Indeed, two of the discrepancies are actually corrections. As we previously indicated, after administering the oath to Biggs, Hennessey crossed out \"04/23/2014\" as the date of the incident and wrote in \"04/24/14.\" He also crossed out \"Helt, David\" as the name of a person who witnessed the plaintiff's refusal to submit to a breath analysis test. We agree with Judge Bear that the hearing officer reasonably could have concluded that the original notations\n   of \"04/23/2014\" and \"Helt, David\" were errors that Hennessey detected and corrected prior to transmitting the report to the department. See\n   <em>\n    Do\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 644 and n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Bear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting). Such a conclusion is warranted because it is undisputed that the plaintiff\n   submitted to two breath analysis tests, the results of which were entered into evidence at the hearing. It is also undisputed that the incident occurred shortly after midnight on April 24, 2014, not on April 23, 2014. Indeed, as the trial court noted, the correct date of April 24, 2014, is mentioned ten different times in the exhibit-four times in the A-44 form and six times in the investigation report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As for the single reference to a 2007 Audi, we also agree with Judge Bear that the hearing officer reasonably could have concluded that the plaintiff was driving the white Mercedes-Benz based on the narrative set forth in the investigation report, which indicates that both Biggs and the 911 caller observed a white Mercedes-Benz driving erratically on Route 63 and that Biggs, upon approaching this vehicle, identified the plaintiff as the driver on the basis of her Connecticut operator's license. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    id., at 645-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Bear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting). It does appear to us, however, as the Appellate Court itself surmised, that Biggs inadvertently transcribed information from another person's arrest report when completing the plaintiff's A-44 form and that, although Hennessey caught two of the mistakes resulting therefrom before the three submissions were transmitted to the department, one was not so identified. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    id., at 622-23, 629-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    138 A.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That would explain why \"04/23/2014\" and the name \"Helt, David\" are crossed out whereas the reference to the 2007 Audi is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As the commissioner argues, however, \u00a7 14-227b(g) requires only a showing that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for operating\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   motor vehicle; it does not expressly require information\n   regarding the type of vehicle that was being driven. As we previously stated, under \u00a7 14-227b(g)(4), the hearing officer must determine whether the plaintiff was operating \"the motor vehicle.\" In this subdivision, \"the motor vehicle\" refers to the vehicle referenced in subdivision (1) of \u00a7 14-227b(g), which asks whether the police officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for operating \"\n   <em>\n    a motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ....\" (Emphasis added.) As we explained, there is ample evidence in the record to support the hearing officer's finding that, on the night in question, the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Indeed, the plaintiff has not challenged the hearing officer's finding that Biggs had probable cause to arrest her for that offense. An affirmative finding on the first statutory issue necessarily results in an affirmative finding on the fourth statutory issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We note, moreover, our disagreement with the Appellate Court that, \"because the plaintiff objected to the admission of the exhibit and casted significant doubt [on] its reliability, the burden was on the department to offer additional evidence to prove the reliability of the exhibit,\" and that \"[p]lacing this burden on the department is consistent with [this] [c]ourt's holding in\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kozlowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507151\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/172/263/#p267\">\n    172 Conn. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20A.2d%20207\">\n    374 A.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), that although hearsay evidence is generally admissible in administrative hearings, hearsay evidence must be sufficiently reliable to be admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Do.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484979\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/359/#p618\">\n    164 Conn.

Second, even if the\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   factors\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   applicable, this court stated in\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   that, \"[i]f hearsay evidence is insufficiently trustworthy to be considered 'substantial evidence' and it is the only evidence probative of the plaintiff's culpability, its use to support the agency decision would be prejudicial to the plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    absent a showing\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    that the appellant knew it would be used and failed to ask the commissioner to subpoena the declarants.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kozlowski\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507151\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/172/263/#p267\">\n    172 Conn. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20A.2d%20207\">\n    374 A.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, it is\n   undisputed that the plaintiff was informed prior to her hearing that the exhibit would be entered into evidence, but she failed to avail herself of her right to subpoena Biggs or any other witness to challenge the accuracy of the information contained in the exhibit. See Regs., Conn.
