Conwell (\"Conwell\"), Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 14, 1999. On July 24, 2017, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\"Petitioner\" or \"Bar Counsel\"), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-721,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Conwell related to his representation of Julie D. Brewington, Gino A. DeSerio, and Dennis Olsen. The Petition alleged that Conwell violated the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\"Rule\"): 1.1 (Competence),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.2 (Scope of Representation and\n   Allocation of Authority between Client and Lawyer),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.3 (Diligence),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.4 (Communication),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.5 (Fees),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.16 (Declining\n   or Terminating Representation),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   3.3 (Candor toward Tribunal),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   3.4 (Fairness to\n   Opposing Party and Counsel),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary\n   Matters),\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 8.4 (Misconduct).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In an Order dated July 25, 2017, we referred the matter to Judge Donna M. Schaeffer of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for a hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-727.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent was served with the Petition for Disciplinary\n   or Remedial Action, our Order, and the Writ of Summons on August 28, 2017, and he filed a timely response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Judge Schaeffer held hearings on the matter on March 5 and 6, 2018. During the hearings, Bar Counsel amended the Petition and withdrew her allegations of violations of Rules 3.3 and 8.1 with regard to Conwell's representation of Scott Olsen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the Petition, Respondent's Answer, exhibits, witness testimony and arguments of counsel, Judge Schaeffer issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. With respect to his representation of Julie Brewington, Judge Schaeffer concluded that Conwell violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4(a) and (d), but not Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.16. With respect to his representation of Gino DeSerio, Judge Schaeffer concluded that Conwell violated Rules 1.1, 1.5, 3.3(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4), and 8.4(a) and (d), but not Rule 1.4. With respect to\n   his representation of Dennis Olsen, Judge Schaeffer concluded that Conwell violated Rules 3.1, 3.4(c), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Court \"has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\"\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

As to the hearing judge's conclusions of law, when violations have been sustained and exceptions have been filed, our consideration is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . Maryland Rule 19-741(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neither Bar Counsel nor Conwell filed exceptions to the hearing judge's factual findings. Accordingly, we treat those\n   findings as established, Maryland Rule 19-741(b)(2)(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and paraphrase them for brevity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Representation of Julie Brewington\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime in the spring of 2013, Julie Brewington filed a complaint with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") against her former employer. In the summer of 2014, Ms. Brewington retained Conwell to represent her in the EEOC matter, because he represented that he practiced employment law. Around August 7, 2014, Ms. Brewington signed a retainer agreement with Conwell and gave him a check for $2,500.00. The retainer agreement provided that Conwell would file a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (\"Maryland Commission\") and represent her before that agency, in addition to the EEOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The scope of Conwell's employment, as set forth in the findings of fact, derived from the retainer agreement and described by Ms. Brewington at the hearing was that, Conwell\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[would] provide legal advice and representation\" in relation to Ms. Brewington's employment dispute and rights with [employer]. Respondent's retainer agreement with Ms. Brewington provided for representation in relation to an anticipated Maryland Commission on Civil Rights [ ] action he proposed filing because, as Respondent testified, \"I would not want to rely on a client's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filing ... I would come in and ordinarily file a new complaint. I normally file that with the [Maryland Commission].\" The retainer agreement ... indicated \"[t]his is a first stage fixed fee representation agreement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the time Conwell was retained, Ms. Brewington did not know the status of her prior\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filing with the EEOC. Describing the EEOC as a \"black hole,\" Ms. Brewington communicated to Conwell that \"a year and a half\" had elapsed since her filing and that she was concerned that she may have missed certain deadlines. In response, Conwell informed Ms.\n   Brewington that, \"[i]f you filed with the EEOC, you should just wait. They are a slow government organization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon further investigation, Conwell learned that, \"due to the passage of time before he had been hired,\" he would not be able to \"file anything on new allegations with\" the Maryland Commission or EEOC. He communicated to Ms. Brewington that they would need to rely on what she had filed, and based on his \"knowledge of employment law,\" concluded that the statute of limitations had expired with regard to filing with the Maryland Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Schaeffer also found, in part, that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Respondent exchanged emails with Ms. Brewington during the representation in which he provided her legal advice about the significance of the [statutory filing deadlines] and provided her with legal advice explaining that because this time period had passed they needed to rely upon what she had previously filed. In sum, during the course of representing Ms. Brewington, Respondent and Ms. Brewington exchanged emails in which Respondent sought information from Ms. Brewington and provided her with legal advice. According to Ms. Brewington, \"there were hundreds of emails\" between her and the Respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Bar Counsel contended that Conwell failed to enter his appearance on behalf of Ms. Brewington with the EEOC, Judge Schaeffer was unable to find that \"to be the case by clear and convincing evidence.\" In so finding, Judge Schaeffer relied on an email correspondence between Conwell and Ms. Brewington in which he sent the entry of appearance to her for signature and email correspondence between Conwell and the EEOC, in which the EEOC referred to Ms. Brewington as Conwell's \"client.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judge Schaeffer further found that Conwell \"advanced\" Ms. Brewington's \"causes and claims in some respects.\" For example, Judge Schaeffer found that he \"analyzed the facts and reached a legal conclusion\" regarding whether Ms. Brewington could file new, or amend previous, complaints with either the EEOC or Maryland Commission. She further found that\n   Conwell informed Ms. Brewington of her legal rights and \"advised her that her EEOC claim was still viable, that it had not been dismissed and that there was no deadline preventing that claim from proceeding.\" Judge Schaeffer also detailed other steps Conwell took in the early period of his representation of Ms. Brewington, such as exchanging emails with individuals from\n   the EEOC, communicating with the EEOC supervisor, and questioning Ms. Brewington's former employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Judge Schaeffer also found, however, \"that after the initial few months of representing Ms. Brewington, [Conwell's] work on the case became sporadic and his communications with his client erratic.\" Ms. Brewington testified that she began to feel neglected in her representation due to Conwell's inconsistent replies to her emails and lack of certainty when asked on the phone about the status of her case. Further, on May 31, 2015, June 3, 2015, and August 10, 2015, Ms. Brewington requested that Conwell send her a copy of the letter he purportedly drafted to send to opposing counsel, but she never received a copy of it; Judge Schaeffer, in fact, found there was \"no evidence that the Respondent ever drafted such a letter.\" Judge Schaeffer also found that Conwell had not communicated with opposing counsel until a year into his representation of Ms. Brewington. While there may have been lapses in communication, Judge Schaeffer, nevertheless, ultimately concluded that it was not proven that these lapses caused Ms. Brewington to \"miss any deadlines or lose any legal rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Brewington ultimately terminated the representation. She sent Conwell a certified letter, dated August 10, 2015, informing him, but the letter was later returned to Ms. Brewington, as Conwell never signed for it. Twice, on August 20 and 25, 2015, respectively, Ms. Brewington emailed Conwell informing him of her intent to terminate the representation. In each communication, Ms. Brewington requested a refund of the retainer fee she had paid Conwell. Conwell, however, refused and also failed to provide Ms. Brewington an accounting or a copy of her client file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 14, 2015, Ms. Brewington filed a complaint with Bar Counsel. Judge Schaeffer found that Conwell failed to respond to Bar Counsel's request for a copy of Ms. Brewington's client file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Representation of Gino and Gina DeSerio\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to Conwell's representation of the DeSerios, Judge Schaeffer, by clear and convincing evidence, made the following factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 24, 2014, Gino DeSerio, and his sister, Gina DeSerio, retained Conwell to represent Mr. DeSerio in an action to modify a preexisting Child Custody Order between Mr. DeSerio and his child's mother, a Florida resident. On July 24, 2014, the DeSerios met with Conwell and entered into a retainer agreement. The agreement stated that Conwell would charge an hourly rate of $375.00 and that the DeSerios would pay a $2,500.00 retainer fee, so that Conwell would represent Mr. DeSerio in his child custody battle. In return, Conwell would \"send [the DeSerios] periodic invoices setting forth the amount of the fees.\" The retainer agreement further specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In the event that a dispute arises regarding services (included but not limited to malpractice), fees or costs, you will notify our firm within thirty (30) days after the dispute arises. Should the dispute not be resolved, you agree to submit any such disputes to binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator in the City of Annapolis, Maryland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 28, 2014, August 26, 2014, August 27, 2014, and September 13, 2014, Conwell submitted a series of filings on Mr. DeSerio's behalf with the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Those filings included: an Emergency Petition to Modify and Change Custody of Minor Child and Motion to Shorten Time; a Motion for Partial Summary\n   Judgment Re: Petition to Modify and Change Custody of Minor Child and a Request for a Hearing; a Line Re: Docket Entry Describing a Petition for Contempt and [ ]Objections to the Master's Report and Recommendation; Petitioner's Notification of Withdrawal of \"Emergency\" and Expedited Relief Motions; and a Line Re: Petitioner's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n   Judge Schaeffer, however, found that these filings \"were not supported by fact or law and failed to advance Mr. DeSerio's case.\" She further found that the trial judge in the original case, in ruling on each filing, concluded that the issues presented therein were either not ripe or otherwise not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In September 2014, Ms. DeSerio received an invoice from Conwell reflecting an outstanding balance of $11,560.00. Judge Schaeffer found the \"majority of the fees charged by Respondent were unreasonable, as the services he performed had little to no value and failed to advance Mr. DeSerio's case in any way whatsoever.\" Judge Schaeffer further found that, as evidenced by this invoice, Conwell had \"failed to timely communicate with the DeSerio[s] regarding the status of their retainer and escalating fees.\" Conwell and the DeSerios, however, subsequently, agreed that the DeSerios \"would make monthly payments of $500 toward the outstanding balance[,]\" of which they made three of between September 26, 2014 and November 26, 2014, resulting in an amount paid of $1,500 plus the retainer fee. Eventually, communication between Conwell and the DeSerios deteriorated, and their legal relationship was eventually terminated. Upon retaining new counsel, the DeSerios \"obtained a modification of the custody order\" in Mr. DeSerio's favor \"within six months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 20, 2015, Conwell filed a breach of contract action in the District Court of Anne Arundel County against the DeSerios, alleging that they owed him $11,110.00 in unpaid attorney's fees. On May 3, 2015, the DeSerios filed a complaint with Bar Counsel. Subsequently, on May 19, 2015, Conwell requested a jury trial in his collection case against the DeSerios, but his request was denied, because his claim did not exceed $15,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Conwell then filed an amended complaint on May 29, 2015, again in the District Court, requesting a jury trial for the second time. The complaint was accompanied with an invoice detailing \"his fees and costs associated with collection efforts against\" the DeSerios. The alleged amount owed on the invoice was $16,533.50, thus exceeding the $15,000 threshold for requesting a jury trial. On October 17, 2016, Conwell's complaint against the DeSerios was consensually dismissed, and Conwell refunded the DeSerios the $4,000 they had paid him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In further deciphering this chain of events, Judge Schaeffer, finding a \"review of the May 29, 2015 Invoice helpful[,]\" explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [a]s previously stated, the May 29, 2015 Invoice indicated that as of March 20, 2015, the filing date of his Verified Complaint, the Respondent had billed 7.3 hours on his collection efforts against the DeSerios, not the 4.3 hours alleged in the Respondent's Verified Complaint or his Verified Complaint (First Amended) filed on April 14, 2015. According to\n   the May 29, 2015 Invoice, as of April 14, 2015 (the filing date of his Verified Complaint (First Amended) ) Respondent had actually billed 11.4 hours on his collection efforts against the DeSerios.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Thus, Respondent billed 7.1 hours between the filing of Respondent's original Verified Complaint and the First Amended Complaint. In total, the May 29, 2015 Invoice reflected that Respondent's firm billed 45 hours ($16,553.50) for the collection efforts on an $11,110.00 debt.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ultimately, Judge Schaeffer found the numbers reflected in Conwell's invoice for 45 hours to be \"greatly inflated and unreasonable.\" She concluded her findings, as to the representation of the DeSerios, stating\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [i]f Respondent was as busy as he advised Ms. Brewington he was on April 9, 2015, he and his staff would likely not have had forty-five hours to expend on an $11,110.00 collection case. This court further finds that Respondent inflated the May 29\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Invoice in an attempt to increase the amount in controversy to meet the requirements of a jury trial prayer, to recover unreasonable and unnecessary attorney's fees and/or to gain negotiating leverage in collecting the alleged underlying debt under the terms of the retainer agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Representation of Dennis Olsen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In October 2011, Dennis Olsen retained Conwell to represent him in some real estate matters. Mr. Olsen, upon conclusion of those real estate matters, retained Conwell to represent him in a divorce proceeding against his wife; Mr. Olsen and his wife later reconciled, however, and voluntarily dismissed the divorce complaint. Following \"the conclusion of these two representations,\" Conwell posited that Mr. Olsen \"owed [him] an outstanding balance of approximately $37,580.00 for legal services.\" Conwell filed an attorney's lien for that amount \"on and against any settlement, judgment or award, and against [Mr. Olsen's] marital property in the [divorce matter.]\" On November 4, 2014, however, Mr. Olsen filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following day, Conwell informed Mr. Olsen of the attorney's lien he had recently filed against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Olsen filed a list of creditors holding \"unsecured nonpriority claims in his bankruptcy case[,]\" listing Conwell \"as a debtor with a claim of $35,000.\" In turn, Conwell filed a Proof of Claim in the Bankruptcy Court, claiming Mr. Olsen owed\n   his firm a secured debt of $51,329.50. He additionally filed two motions in Maryland Circuit Court in \"an attempt to enforce his attorney's lien.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 8, 2015, the Circuit Court denied Conwell's motions to enforce the liens. On January 7, 2016, as a result, Conwell filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Special Appeals.\n   Having previously closed Mr. Olsen's bankruptcy matter, the Bankruptcy Court, in 2016, reopened his case \"for the purpose of allowing [Mr. Olsen] to file a Motion for Contempt and Sanctions against [Conwell] for Violation of the Automatic Stay and Discharge Injunction.\" Conwell received notice of the motion. On April 6, 2016, Mr. Olsen filed a \"Motion for Order to Show Cause Why Scott Conwell, Esq. Should Not be Held in Contempt for Violation of the Discharge Injunction in the Bankruptcy Court.\" Conwell received notice of the motion through the Bankruptcy Court's electronic filing system.

Conwell excepts to all of Judge Schaeffer's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Conwell first excepts to Judge Schaeffer's conclusion that he violated Rule 3.1 when he failed \"to dismiss his appeal filed in the Court of Special Appeals after receiving notice of the Bankruptcy Court's Order.\" Judge Schaeffer had found, however, that after receiving the Bankruptcy Court order instructing him to cease and desist, Conwell requested an extension of time to file a brief with the Court of Special Appeals, which \"directly contravened the Bankruptcy Court's Order.\" As she found, Conwell \"lacked a basis to continue the appeal and should have dismissed it\" after receiving the cease-and-desist and contempt orders from the Bankruptcy Court regarding his enforcement action for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Conwell, however, contends that he did not violate Rule 3.1, which prohibits an attorney from bringing a proceeding or asserting an issue, \"unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous,\" because he was under no obligation to affirmatively move to dismiss his appeal, as the rule only \"involves prohibitions on lawyers bringing or defending 'meritorious claims or contentions.' \" In support of this position, Conwell argues that neither the language nor case law of the rule establishes any affirmative duty to act in order to avoid a Rule 3.1 violation.

Conwell, as Judge Schaeffer found, had an obligation to respond to the Bankruptcy Court because he purposely availed himself of the privileges of that court and failed to openly refute that any obligation existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Conwell contends he did not violate Rule 3.4(c), because the Show Cause Order did not create an obligation for him to appear in the Bankruptcy Court, but simply served to provide him an opportunity to be heard and present evidence, if he had any, which he alleges he did not. Conwell, additionally, avers that the case law surrounding Rule 3.4 stands for the proposition that violations occur when an attorney fails to act on behalf of a client, whereas he was a creditor, not an attorney, here. Conwell further contends that had the Show Cause Order created a Rule 3.4(c) obligation, the Bankruptcy Court would have found him in violation of it or would have compelled his appearance via body attachment, subpoena, warrant, or otherwise. Conwell next posits that even if he is incorrect and the Show Cause Order did create a Rule 3.4\n   obligation, a violation would, nonetheless, not exist, because the rule requires that an attorney \"knowingly\" disobey an obligation to appear, and he operated under the belief that, based on his understanding of the federal court's procedure, no obligation existed. Conwell, lastly, avers that the circuit court failed to properly consider his evidence that the Show Cause Order did not create a Rule 3.4 obligation, instead, the hearing judge \"only addressed questions concerning service of process.\" Conwell's contentions are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Rule 3.4(c) prohibits an attorney from \"knowingly disobey[ing] an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation existed.\" In\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

We, however, having overruled Conwell's exceptions, agree with judge Schaeffer that Conwell violated Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d) in his representation of Mr. Olsen.

Conwell changed his first invoice to the DeSerios from $11,110 to $16,553.50 between filing his original Verified Complaint and the First Amended Verified Complaint.
