Attorney Jess T. Schwidde was appointed as trustee \"to inventory the files of the respondent, and to take action as seems indicated to protect the interests of ... respondent's clients.\" Administrative Order 9, Rule 24. On September 7, 2018, the trustee filed a confidential final report outlining respondent's refusal to cooperate in his efforts. On September 12, 2018, this Court ordered respondent to comply with the trustee's May 7, 2018 Demand Letter within fourteen days and warned her that failure to comply might result in the initiation of contempt proceedings and/or the imposition of other sanctions. This order was personally served on respondent. On October 1, 2018, the trustee filed notice with this Court that respondent had not complied with his Demand Letter. The Court thus scheduled a show-cause hearing to allow respondent the opportunity to show cause why she should not be held in contempt of the Court's September 12, 2018 order. This order was also personally served on respondent.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     \u00b6 2. The Court held a show-cause hearing on October 18, 2018. Respondent did not appear. The Court finds respondent in contempt of its September 12, 2018 order. The existence of the Court's order and respondent's obligations under it are clear and demonstrated from the record.
