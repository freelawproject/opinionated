In a small claims matter filed by Leighton against McGaw, the District Court (Lincoln,\n   <em>\n    Stitham, J.\n   </em>\n   ) found that McGaw was negligent and awarded Leighton just over $3,900 in damages and costs. No appeal was filed and the judgment was paid. Ring then filed a complaint in the Superior Court asserting that\n   <em>\n    Leighton\n   </em>\n   was negligent and had caused Ring economic harm. Ring appeals from a summary judgment entered by the Superior Court (Penobscot County,\n   <em>\n    A. Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ) in favor of Leighton on Ring's complaint. Ring contends that the court erred in applying the common law doctrine of res judicata to the earlier small claims judgment obtained by Leighton against McGaw and thereby determining that the judgment conclusively resolved the issue of which driver was at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] In this matter of first impression, we conclude that claim preclusion cannot,\n   because of the unique limitations of small claims procedure, operate to bar a subsequent suit brought in District or Superior Court by a person who was not an actual party to the small claims action, but rather was at most in privity with the defendant in the small claims case. Accordingly, we vacate the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] The facts are drawn from the summary judgment record, taken in the light most favorable to Ring as the nonprevailing party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Frye v. MMG Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2044\">\n    2018 ME 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494958\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/158/\">\n    182 A.3d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following the accident between McGaw and Leighton, Leighton filed a small claims action against McGaw in the District Court (Lincoln). Leighton's statement of claim, seeking $3,795.57 in damages plus costs, alleged that McGaw had negligently caused the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] At the hearing on Leighton's claim, Ring's insurer provided McGaw with counsel and a defense; Ring attended and spoke to McGaw and McGaw's counsel. The court found that McGaw was at fault in the accident and entered judgment in favor of Leighton in the full amount that he had requested-$3,795.57, plus $106.30 in costs. The judgment did not make any findings regarding Ring, or McGaw's relationship to Ring. A satisfaction of judgment was filed on November 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] In January 2017, Ring filed a negligence complaint against Leighton in the Superior Court seeking unspecified damages, alleging that Leighton, not McGaw, had been at fault in the accident. Leighton's answer denied the substantive allegations of the complaint and asserted as defenses, inter alia, that Ring's claim was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and bar and merger. Leighton then filed a third-party complaint against McGaw seeking indemnification if he were found to be liable to Ring, asserting that the small claims judgment established McGaw's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] In July 2017, Leighton moved for summary judgment \"based upon the fact that responsibility for [the] accident was previously adjudicated in the Lincoln District Court.\" Ring opposed the motion, arguing that the small claims judgment had no res judicata effect as to him, in part because he was not a party to that action. Following a nontestimonial hearing, the court granted Leighton's motion and entered a summary judgment, concluding that \"the issue of fault for the accident in question has already been determined by a prior final judgment in the 2016 Small Claims proceeding,\" and that \"Ring had a fair opportunity and incentive to litigate the issue in a prior proceeding.\" (Quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that \"collateral estoppel precludes Ring from relitigating the factual issue of who was at fault for the accident[;] ... [t]herefore, Ring cannot establish that Leighton breached a duty to him, and therefore cannot establish all the necessary elements of a prima facie case for negligence.\" Ring appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] In the ordinary case, the claim preclusion prong of the res judicata doctrine \"prohibits relitigation of an entire cause of action between the same parties or their privies, once a valid final judgment has been rendered in an earlier suit on the same cause of action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Pushard v.

However, that said, Leighton made the choice to pursue a small claim solely against McGaw in small claims court. Having sought the benefits of the small claims process, Leighton is subject to the limitations of 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 7485.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Judgment vacated; remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   SAUFLEY, C.J., with whom ALEXANDER, J., joins concurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b625] We reluctantly concur, but we write separately to address the confusion and potential inequities that today's opinion exposes regarding small claims actions. The Court's effort to parse through the thicket of the intersecting statutory provisions of title 14, chapter 738 of the Maine Revised Statutes is laudable. It has, however, disclosed a latent unfairness to Leighton created by the design of the small claims proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b626] The facts are simple enough. Leighton suffered property damage when his car was hit by a car that was driven by McGaw and owned by Ring. Leighton brought suit against McGaw in small claims court. The court adjudicated the issues presented-who was negligent and what were the damages-and Leighton was awarded a judgment of just less than $4,000. Ring was present, aware of, and active in the case. The damages were paid, and Leighton went on with life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b627] Unfortunately, given results of the current statutory small claims process,\n   Leighton now finds himself in Superior Court, this time facing Ring, again to resolve the same dispute adjudicated in the small claims case-who was negligent and what were the damages. The small claims decision will not be admissible in the case, and there is no cap on the damages that Leighton may now be required to pay Ring if a different fact-finder concludes-contrary to the small claims judge's finding-that it was Leighton who was at fault, not McGaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b628] The small claims statutes, in effect for several decades,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   have rarely been challenged in an appellate context, and as a result, the odd circumstance that Leighton finds himself in has not been previously addressed by the Court. We are forced by the language of the statute to agree that the Court has done the best that it can. The Court's holding, however, is cold comfort to Leighton who believed that he had resolved the matter in the small claims proceeding. Moreover, the Court's analysis has exposed additional traps for the unwary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b629] Therefore, while we cannot conclude that claim preclusion applies to small claims actions to bar a subsequent suit brought in the District or Superior Court by a person who was not an actual party to the small claims action, we can say that the unfairness of this situation-the cost of the second suit brought by Ring and the second adjudication of exactly the same action-should encourage the Legislature to review and amend the small claims statutes to avoid further, duplicative adjudication of the same issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b630] Small claims proceedings were created \"for the purpose of providing a simple, speedy and informal court procedure for the resolution of small claims.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 11 (quoting 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 7481 ). By allowing Leighton to be subjected to a complete and unrestricted re-adjudication of the determination of negligence and damages, the statutes' procedures directly conflict with the Legislature's goal regarding small claims actions. We urge a thorough review of the small claims statutes.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Because Ring's argument that 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 7485 (2017) prohibits giving the small claims judgment preclusive effect in the Superior Court \"depends on the legal effect of the ...
