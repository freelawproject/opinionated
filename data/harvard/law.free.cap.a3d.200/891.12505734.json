He argues that the evidence does not support\n   the circuit court's findings that: (1) he had abandoned the child; (2) he had not paid sufficient support; and (3) termination of his parental rights was in the child's best interest. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The record supports the following facts. Approximately one month after the child was born, the father was incarcerated. After the father was released, the child lived with both parents. In February 2009, the mother moved out after an incident of domestic violence. From June 2009 through September 2010, a domestic violence order was in place against the father. In April 2009, the mother filed a parenting petition. The father did not appear at any of the hearings in the parenting case. In December 2009, the mother was granted sole legal and physical custody of H.J. The parenting plan granted the father supervised visitation once a week at his expense, but gave the mother discretion to refuse such visits. The plan stated that the father \"may petition the court for further orders\" at such time that \"he believes that he can be a positive and consistent influence in [the child's] life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The father visited H.J. twice at a visitation center in February and March of 2010. On March 20, 2010, he failed to appear for a scheduled visit. Around this time, he was incarcerated. When he was released in early 2011, he contacted the visitation center requesting to visit H.J. The mother exercised the discretion granted to her by the parenting plan and denied his request. She expressed concern that visitation would be emotionally disruptive to the child because the father's frequent incarcerations would not allow him to become a consistent part of the child's life. The father appears to have done nothing at this time to challenge the mother's decision. The father was re-incarcerated in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, while still incarcerated, the father filed petitions requesting a change to the parenting plan. The court denied the petitions, observing that the father was incarcerated and \"not in a position to exercise his parenting time ... because of his circumstances.\" The court noted that \"[a]t such time as he is released, [the father] can contact the [visitation center], who can then contact [the mother].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The father was released from incarceration in January 2014. He testified at the hearing on the termination of his parental rights that he \"probably\" contacted the visitation center at that time, but did not \"remember exactly.\" He also testified that he did not file any additional petitions with the court seeking visitation because he was \"dealing with these legal issues,\" had limited transportation, and \"had a lot on [his] plate.\" At some point in 2015 the father was re-incarcerated. In early 2016, he was released. Approximately a year later, in February of 2017, he was re-incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October of 2017, the mother filed a petition seeking termination of the father's parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and non-support. At the hearing on the petition, the mother requested that the court terminate the father's parental rights over H.J. so that her husband, who \"has been an active and constant part of [H.J.'s] life since 2010,\" could adopt H.J. She testified that, since July 21, 2009, she has only received $458.70 in child support and that her child support case was closed in 2014. She acknowledged that the father has occasionally sent correspondence to H.J. including \"a bunch of cards in 2010,\" a Toys\"R\"Us gift card, two letters in 2016, and a birthday card in 2017. She testified that she shared these communications with H.J. and has saved them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The father testified that, although he has been in jail for four of the last eight years, he never intended to abandon the\n   child. He also testified that he had \"never been given the opportunity to be a father to [his child] ... and it hasn't been for a lack of trying.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The guardian ad litem (GAL) submitted a final report recommending that the court terminate the father's parental rights. At the hearing, the GAL testified that even though the father may not have desired to abandon\n   the child, there has \"been a substantial period of time since there has been any contact,\" and the father's \"personal actions, his inability to stay out of criminal mischief ... effectuated the abandonment.\" The GAL further testified that termination was in the child's best interest because the mother's husband was the child's \"father figure,\" provided \"day-to-day support and emotional support,\" and wished to adopt H.J. The GAL recognized that the mother had exercised her right to deny visitation in 2011, which prevented the child from having contact with the father on that occasion, but concluded that the lack of a relationship between the child and the father was due to the father's consistent \"renewal of [his] criminal activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its termination order, the court found that the father had abandoned the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-C:5, I. It also concluded that the father failed to provide adequate support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-C:5, II (stating that if \"parents are financially able,\" but \"have substantially and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary subsistence, education or other care,\" then a statutory ground exists to terminate parental rights). The court also determined that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest.

He asserts that \"it was the mother's refusal to permit or facilitate visits or contact that were the major barrier to a relationship between the father and [H.J.].\" He further contends that the trial court erred because it failed to properly consider the \"totality of the evidence,\" and \"events that occurred before, during and after the triggering period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jessie E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2296283\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/137/336/#p342\">\n    137 N.H 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20591\">\n    627 A.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).

The trial court found that the father had not abandoned his child; however, it found that other statutory grounds supported termination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   It then concluded that termination was in the child's best interest because the child \"has no bond with or connection to the father and is apparently unaware of his existence,\" and \"attempting to reintroduce the father into Sophia-Marie's life at this point would be difficult and confusing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 338,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n    77 A.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (brackets omitted). We reversed, observing that \"the father has endeavored to maintain a relationship with Sophia-Marie, and we cannot ignore the fact that to the extent that Sophia-Marie does not know her father, it is, in part, due to the mother's decision not to disclose the father's attempts to contact her or even that he is her father.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the father's efforts to establish a relationship with his child have been minimal. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sophia-Marie H.\n   </em>\n   , the father chose not to contact or visit his child for long periods of time, even when he was not incarcerated. When the father petitioned to modify the parenting plan in 2013, the court concluded that he was \"not in a position to exercise his parenting time\" because he was incarcerated, and instructed the father to contact the visitation center upon his release. The record does not demonstrate that he subsequently contacted the center. Nor has the father ever sought to modify the original parenting plan to lessen the mother's ability to control visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, also unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sophia-Marie H.\n   </em>\n   , the mother's \"interference\" with the father's ability to build a relationship with H.J. has been minimal. Although she denied the father a single visit in 2011, as was allowed by the parenting plan, the mother has not kept the father's identity a secret from the child and she has given the child letters sent from the father. Therefore, the record supports the trial court's conclusion that the lack of a relationship between the father and H.J. is directly attributable to the father's failure to attempt to establish such a relationship, not the mother's purported attempt to thwart it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The father also argues that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights because the \"mother admitted she did not do anything to facilitate a relationship between the father and his [child].\" He cites\n   <em>\n    In re William A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1401774\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/142/598/#p600\">\n    142 N.H. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=705%20A.2d%201196\">\n    705 A.2d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), for the proposition that he should be given additional\n   time and opportunity to build a relationship with his child because there is no evidence to show that termination is necessary to\n   ensure H.J. remains in a stable environment.

The GAL observes that, although H.J. knows that the father occasionally writes or sends gifts, the child has \"no real memory of him or of his direct presence,\" \"8-years have passed since there have been visits,\" and the father has made \"no effort ... to avoid new or ongoing criminal activities.\" On this basis, the GAL concluded that termination was in the child's best interest. The trial court similarly concluded that despite the father's assertions that he loves his child and wants to be a part of H.J.'s life, \"the reality of this situation is that he has led a life over the past eight years full of criminal activity, most of it of a serious nature, which has resulted in numerous incarcerations.\" The trial court reasoned that the father \"seems to accept little to any responsibility for the effect these actions have had on his ability and availability for parenting,\" and observed that \"[i]n the meantime, [H.J.] has moved on ... and has done very well through the efforts of [the child's] mother and [the] stepfather.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Implicit in [RSA chapter 170-C] is the philosophy that whenever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved.\" RSA 170-C:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, for the last eight years - because of his own actions and choices - H.J.'s biological father has not been a part of the child's family life. Instead, as the trial court observed, H.J. is \"happy, living with the only family [the child] knows, cared for by the only parent ... that has ever cared for [H.J.], and [a] stepfather, who now seeks to adopt [H.J.] and give [the child] a greater security in their relationship.\" Based upon this evidence, we conclude that the\n   trial court's ruling that termination is in the child's best interest is supported by the evidence and not plainly erroneous as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sophia-Marie H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048548\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/165/332/#p335\">\n    165 N.H at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%201139\">\n    77 A.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   LYNN, C.J., and HICKS, HANTZ MARCONI, and DONOVAN, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
