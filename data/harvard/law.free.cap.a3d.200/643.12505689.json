He challenges the Board's recommitment order that extended his maximum sentence date based on an out-of-state conviction, asserting the Pennsylvania crime used to discern the recommitment range was more severe. He also argues the Board abused its discretion in denying him credit for his time spent at liberty on parole and inadequately explaining its denial. We vacate the Board's order, and remand to the Board to explain its credit determination sufficiently to enable appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1998, Marshall was sentenced to 11 to 22 years in prison for murder in the third degree and robbery, with a maximum date of January 15, 2019. He obtained release on parole on March 3, 2008. Almost nine years later, as a result of a traffic stop in Delaware, Marshall was charged with multiple crimes related to his possession of 200.49 grams of powder cocaine and 67.94 grams of crack cocaine. Specifically, a court in the State of Delaware, Kent County convicted Marshall for \"DDEAL Tier 4 (F) Cocaine\" under 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752, and it sentenced him to eight years, custody level 5. Certified Record (C.R.) at 17 (Sentence Order, 5/10/17). Delaware then extradited Marshall to serve his sentence in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The new conviction subjected Marshall to a parole revocation hearing. Marshall acknowledged his conviction, and signed a waiver of his right to a hearing. C.R. at 36. The parole revocation hearing report recommended \"taking [his] street time\" because Marshall \"was on parole for Murder and was convicted of felony drug related crimes.\" C.R. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of his out-of-state conviction, the Board recommitted Marshall to serve 24 months as a convicted parole violator (CPV). In determining the appropriate recommitment range, the Board determined that Marshall's Delaware conviction most closely related to the Pennsylvania crime\n   of possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance (cocaine) under Section 13(a)(30) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (Controlled Substance Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.1\">\n    37 Pa. Code \u00a7 75.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.2\">\n    37 Pa. Code \u00a7 75.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the presumptive recommitment range for that new offense is 18 to 24 months. The Board did not award Marshall credit for his time spent at liberty on parole because of his \"felony drug related crimes.\" C.R. at 49. Based on his conviction, the Board recalculated Marshall's maximum sentence date as April 29, 2028.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Through counsel, Marshall filed an administrative appeal of the Board's recommitment order. The Board issued a decision, affirming and explaining the term of recommitment. Because it stated a reason for denying Marshall credit for his time spent at liberty on parole, the Board deemed moot his challenge to its exercise of discretion in its denial of credit. C.R. at 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Marshall filed a timely petition for review to this Court (Petition) seeking an order vacating the Board's decision and remanding to the Board to modify his recommitment using the appropriate range corresponding to his criminal conduct, possession of cocaine. He seeks credit for almost nine years spent at liberty on parole, and a recalculation of his maximum sentence date to reflect that credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marshall asserts the Board violated his due process rights when it did not notify him, at the time he waived his revocation hearing, that a new maximum sentence date was a possible consequence. He challenges the Board's authority to alter his original maximum date beyond his judicially-imposed sentence. He also argues the Board applied an incorrect recommitment range corresponding to a more severe offense. Using the most closely related crime of possession, as opposed to possession with intent to distribute, he maintains the appropriate recommitment range was 3 to 6 months, not 18 to 24 months. In addition, Marshall contends the Board abused its discretion when it denied him credit for time spent at liberty on parole, and he challenges the adequacy and accuracy of its reason for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, we address Marshall's argument that the Board violated his due process rights because it did not notify him, at the time he waived his revocation hearing, that a possible consequence was a new maximum sentence date. The Board responds that Marshall waived this challenge when he did not raise it during the administrative proceedings. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The record shows Marshall did not challenge the adequacy of notice for the revocation hearing in his several-page administrative remedies form. C.R. at 53-60. Significantly, Marshall's counsel filed his administrative appeal. C.R. at 53. On the pre-printed administrative remedies form, counsel checked the box for \"Violation of Constitutional Law (Due process, double jeopardy, etc.).\" C.R. at 53. Other than checking that box, there is no suggestion of this issue for the Board's review. Marshall's failure to raise this issue before the\n   Board results in waiver.\n   <em>\n    Chesson v. Pa.

Cmwlth. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In any event, Marshall cites no authority for the proposition that the Board must provide specific notice as to all possible legal consequences of a parole revocation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Recalculation of Maximum Sentence Date\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, we consider Marshall's contention that in recalculating his maximum sentence date, the Board imposed additional time beyond his judicially-authorized sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a parolee violates the terms and conditions of his parole, the Board may recommit him to serve all or part of the remainder of his original sentence.\n   <em>\n    Yates v.

Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492562\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/179/117/\">\n    179 A.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018) (maximum length of sentence, not maximum date, is controlling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, at the time of his release on parole, Marshall had over 10 years remaining on his original sentence. In recalculating Marshall's maximum sentence date, the Board did no more than require him to serve that sentence.\n   <em>\n    Yates\n   </em>\n   . Thus, to the extent Marshall posits that the Board lacked authority to recalculate his maximum sentence date, he is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Recommitment Range\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Marshall also asserts the Board applied an incorrect recommitment range of 18 to 24 months when the conduct underlying his Delaware conviction most closely related to possession of a controlled substance, a misdemeanor in Pennsylvania, with a presumptive range of 3 to 6 months. He contends the Board erred in analogizing the conduct underlying his Delaware conviction to possession with intent to distribute, which is subject to a 10-year prison term under Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In determining the applicable presumptive recommitment ranges for out-of-state convictions, the Board compares the out-of-state offense to those listed in its regulations. When the list does not include the offense, the Board assesses the criminal conduct to discern the most closely related crime category under Pennsylvania law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.1\">\n    37 Pa.

Further, \"[t]he severity ranking of crimes listed in \u00a7 75.2... is not intended to be exhaustive, and the most closely related crime category in terms of severity and the presumptive range will be followed if the specific crime which resulted in conviction is not contained within the listing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.1\">\n    37 Pa.

C.R. at 17. Although the charges included various crimes under Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code, Marshall's conviction record does not specify a subsection. Premised on this omission, Marshall claims his crime amounted to mere possession of a controlled substance, not possession with intent to deliver as the Board found. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code is captioned \"drug dealing-aggravated possession; class B felony.\" 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752. It consists of five subsections, each of which includes the offense \"possesses a controlled substance,\" in various quantity levels, with or without aggravating factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346084\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/96/556/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Notwithstanding Marshall's contentions, none of these offenses is analogous to mere possession of a controlled substance under Pennsylvania law. Thus, we are unpersuaded by Marshall's argument that Section 13(a)(16) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16), is the most closely related crime. First, that provision pertains to possession of a controlled substance \"by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State Board ...\" without regard to the quantity of the drug.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346084\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/96/556/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, violating that provision is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year under Section 13(b) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(b), for which the presumptive recommitment range is 3 to 6 months. Third, in reviewing other subsections in the same section, Section 13(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), is more analogous to Marshall's conduct in Delaware. Section 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), classifies possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance as a felony punishable by a maximum term of 10 years in prison. Significantly, Marshall's Delaware conviction was also a felony, for which he received an eight-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite that the Sentencing Order does not specify the subsection of Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code, it states the conviction corresponds to a Tier 4 quantity. Notably, subsection 1 sets forth this quantity in the offense; it reads: \"manufactures, delivers, or\n   <em>\n    possesses with intent to manufacture or deliver\n   </em>\n   a controlled substance in a\n   <em>\n    Tier 4 quantity\n   </em>\n   .\" 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752(1) (emphasis added). Therefore, the conduct underlying Marshall's conviction most closely relates to the Pennsylvania crime of possession\n   <em>\n    with intent\n   </em>\n   to deliver under Section 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), as the Board concluded. The Board did not err in utilizing the presumptive range corresponding to that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This Court will not interfere with the Board's discretion as long as the amount of backtime the Board imposed was within the applicable presumptive range.\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2.1), \"unambiguously grants the Board discretion to award credit to a CPV recommitted to serve the remainder of his sentence,\" except when the recommitment involves the reasons in subsections 6138(a)(2.1)(i) and (ii) (including violent and sexual offender crimes), not present here.\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323540,12278111\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/466/\">\n    159 A.3d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Relevant here, in\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held that in not explaining its exercise of discretion with reasons for awarding or denying credit, the Board violated its statutory mandate and denied a parolee's constitutional due process rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court reasoned that the Board satisfies constitutional due process by stating the reasons for exercising its discretion to deny credit for the time a parolee spent at liberty on parole.

Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to registration of sexual offenders).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under this provision, the General Assembly has mandated that a parolee who is recommitted for a felony that is not violent or is not a sexual offense remains eligible for street time unless the Board articulates reasons that a longer period of incarceration is warranted for rehabilitative reasons. The Board cannot take away street time to punish a parolee just because he committed a non-excluded felony while on parole. Courts impose punishment, not the Board. If prior offenses auger in favor of more time in prison, it is up to the sentencing judge to take that into consideration\n   when determining an appropriate sentence on the new felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, under 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2.1), the General Assembly intended the Board to award street time unless there are exceptional circumstances that require the Board to take it away. While those circumstances can include the facts underlying the new felony, those facts have to be weighed against other factors before street time can be taken away. For example, if parole is revoked for felony theft that was committed to obtain drug money, then the Board could take away street time so that there is sufficient time for the parolee to receive drug treatment in prison. However, that may not be a sufficient reason to take the time away if the sentence on the larceny charge is sufficient for the parolee to complete drug treatment. As this example illustrates, each situation is extremely fact specific requiring the Board to go into detail to explain the reasoning behind its decision not to award street time.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233,\n    <em>\n     as\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     amended\n    </em>\n    , 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"Our review of the Board's decision is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether the decision is in accordance with the law, or whether necessary findings are supported by substantial evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Kerak v.
