Jenkins, appeals from the trial court's judgment denying her motion to vacate an arbitration award in a dissolution of marriage matter which, in addition to dissolving the marriage, included orders of alimony and a division of the parties' assets and other financial orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred when it refused to vacate the arbitrator's award because the arbitrator (1) precluded the testimony of an expert witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3), and (2) treated one party more favorably than the other in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2). We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant, Michael A. Jenkins, were married on August 31, 2008. In December, 2013, the plaintiff commenced the present dissolution action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November, 2015, the parties entered into an arbitration agreement (agreement) for the resolution of several issues relating to the dissolution of their marriage. Arbitration proceedings took place before Elaine Gordon (arbitrator) on December 1, 2, and 21, 2015. The parties attended the proceedings with counsel and agreed that they would not have the proceedings recorded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 3, 2016, the arbitrator issued an award and rationale for the award. The plaintiff subsequently filed motions in the Superior Court to vacate the award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After holding a full evidentiary hearing on the plaintiff's two operative motions on March 28, 2016, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Colin, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the plaintiff's motions to vacate the arbitration award. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's claims arise under \" General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a), which sets forth the standard of review governing an application to vacate, correct or modify an arbitration award, [and] provides in relevant part: Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the\n   superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides ... shall make an order vacating the award if it finds [that] ...

Id., at 32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=647%20A.2d%201015\">\n    647 A.2d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that the trial court erred in denying her motion to vacate the arbitration award on the basis of the arbitrator's refusal, in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3), to allow testimony from Carl Mueller, a psychiatrist called by the plaintiff to establish that she was physically and sexually abused by the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in denying her motion because, by precluding Mueller from testifying, the arbitrator \"prejudiced the plaintiff's ability to prove that the defendant ... abused her and was primarily at fault for the breakdown of the marriage.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. Prior to the arbitration proceedings, the plaintiff disclosed Mueller as a potential expert witness. When the defendant deposed Mueller on July 2, 2015, Mueller testified that he had reviewed a letter that the defendant sent to the\n   plaintiff requesting that she set up and record sexual encounters with other individuals, and that the letter was part of the basis of his expert opinion. Although Mueller was asked, in advance of the deposition, to bring \"documents [he] obtained, created,\n   reviewed or relied upon in connection with [the] matter,\" Mueller failed to produce the letter at the deposition because the original was in the plaintiff's possession and he did not have a copy of it. The plaintiff failed to produce the letter at any point prior to the arbitration proceedings, despite her obligation to do so by the terms of the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 2, 2015, the plaintiff called Mueller to testify. When Mueller was called to testify, the plaintiff offered the letter as an exhibit. The defendant then objected to Mueller's testimony on the basis of the plaintiff's failure to disclose the letter prior to the beginning of the proceedings. The arbitrator precluded Mueller's testimony in its entirety because the defendant made numerous requests for the disclosure of the letter, prior to this point, which the plaintiff ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 8, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion with the arbitrator to have Mueller's testimony admitted. The arbitrator treated the motion as a request for reconsideration of the ruling that she had made, and, in a written ruling, denied the motion, stating: \"The plaintiff had the ability to cure the problem of the letter's absence from the file for months. By not producing it and by not complying with the agreement to premark exhibits,\n   the plaintiff consciously created the problem for which she now seeks consideration and relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in denying her motion to vacate on the basis of the arbitrator's preclusion of Mueller's testimony because it was integral in \"ruling on the crucial issue of the causes of the breakdown of the marriage, and in structuring awards ... in the matter.\" Additionally, the plaintiff claims that, even if she wrongfully failed to produce the letter, the preclusion of Mueller's testimony was not an appropriate sanction. The defendant argues that the trial court did not err in denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration award because, under the circumstances, precluding Mueller's testimony was squarely within the arbitrator's authority. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ''[A]rbitrators are accorded substantial discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence.... Indeed, it is within the broad discretion of the arbitrators to decide whether additional evidence is required or would merely prolong the proceeding unnecessarily.... This relaxation of strict evidentiary rules is both necessary and desirable because arbitration is an informal proceeding designed, in part, to avoid the complexities of litigation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    McCann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Environmental Protection\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713440\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/203/#p214\">\n    288 Conn. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=952%20A.2d%2043\">\n    952 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An arbitrator's broad discretion with regard to the admission of evidence, however, is limited by \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[T]his court has stated that \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   does not mandate that every failure or refusal to receive evidence, even relevant evidence, constitutes misconduct.... To establish that an evidentiary ruling, or lack thereof, rises to the level of misconduct prohibited by \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) requires more than a showing that an arbitrator committed an error of law.... Rather, a party challenging an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator refused to receive material evidence must prove that, by virtue of an evidentiary ruling, [she] was in fact deprived of a full and fair hearing before the [arbitrator].... [A]n arbitration hearing is fair if the arbitrator gives each of the parties to the dispute an adequate opportunity to present its evidence and argument....

The trial court first noted that paragraph 17 of the arbitration agreement provided that the arbitrator \"shall control the admission of evidence.\" Furthermore, because the parties agreed not to record the arbitration proceedings, no record of the proceedings was provided to the trial court. In the absence of a record, the trial court considered the length of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrator's rulings, and determined that the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to present her case. We agree with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mueller's opinion regarding the plaintiff's claims of abuse was based, in large part, on interviews Mueller conducted with the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the letter the defendant had written to the plaintiff. Although Mueller was not permitted to testify, the arbitration award and rationale reveal that the plaintiff testified at the arbitration proceedings regarding her claims of abuse. The arbitrator also referenced the contents of the letter in her arbitration rationale, indicating that she considered it in structuring the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff failed to show that Mueller's testimony would have impacted the outcome of the proceedings. The arbitrator stated: \"[I]t is impossible to be persuaded that either party is more at fault for the breakdown of the marriage.\" The plaintiff did not demonstrate how Mueller's testimony would have persuaded the arbitrator that the defendant was more at fault. Indeed, it is unlikely that Mueller's testimony, which likely would have been duplicative of evidence already before\n   the arbitrator, would have negated evidence that indicated the plaintiff contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate on the basis of the arbitrator's refusal to hear Mueller's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in failing to vacate the arbitration award on the basis of\n   the arbitrator's alleged partiality in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff argues that the trial court should have vacated the award because, \"[t]hroughout the arbitration hearings, the [a]rbitrator's behavior directed at the plaintiff was belligerent and aggressive.\" Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the arbitrator \"warned [the plaintiff] that repeated trips [to the bathroom] would not be tolerated,\" \"screamed at the plaintiff,\" and slammed the door to the room where the plaintiff was meeting with her attorney and financial expert, causing ceiling tile debris to fall down from the ceiling onto the plaintiff's head, called the plaintiff a \"fallen Catholic,\" and addressed the defendant's attorney in Hebrew. We conclude that the plaintiff's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. On March 2, 2016, following the arbitrator's entry of an award, the plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the award, in which she argued that the arbitrator was not impartial. On March 28, 2016, the trial court heard testimony on the plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiff testified that during the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator, without knocking, came into a room where she, her financial expert, Cheri Mazza, and her counsel, were meeting privately. Upon entering the room, the arbitrator screamed, and \"slammed the door so hard that she knocked loose a ceiling tile\" that fell on the plaintiff's head. The plaintiff also testified that during the arbitration hearing on December 21, 2015, the arbitrator held a conversation in Hebrew with the defendant's counsel, Eric Broder, and then said to\n   the plaintiff, \"oh, you fallen Catholics, you wouldn't get that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Broder testified that, contrary to the plaintiff's claims that the arbitrator warned her that she would not be permitted to take frequent bathroom breaks, the plaintiff \"constantly needed to take breaks, which were granted by [the arbitrator] throughout whether it was for the bathroom, for lunch or whatever ....\" Broder also testified that he did not speak Hebrew to the arbitrator and that he did not hear the arbitrator address the plaintiff as a \"fallen Catholic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Mazza testified regarding the arbitrator's alleged outburst. Mazza said that she witnessed the arbitrator \"burst into the room\" without knocking and \"slam the door\" on the way out. Mazza also was present when the abitrator returned to the room and \"apologize[d] for the outburst.\" Mazza did not, however, see a ceiling tile fall when the arbitrator slammed the door. Mazza stated: \"I don't believe the entire ceiling tile fell. There was just some debris that she claimed had fallen into her hair.\" After the hearing, and considering the testimony of the plaintiff, Broder, and Mazza, the trial court determined that the plaintiff\n   failed to present sufficient evidence for it to conclude that the arbitrator was not impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ''A party seeking to vacate an arbitration award on the ground of evident partiality has the burden of producing sufficient evidence in support of the claim. An allegation that an arbitrator was biased, if supported by sufficient evidence, may warrant the vacation of the arbitration award.... The burden of proving bias or evident partiality pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2) rests on the party making such a claim, and requires more than a showing of an appearance of bias.... In construing \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2), [our Supreme Court] concluded that evident partiality will be found where a reasonable person\n   would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration. To put it in the vernacular, evident partiality exists where it reasonably looks as though a given arbitrator would tend to favor one of the parties.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Toland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Toland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495132\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/651/#p814\">\n    179 Conn.

The only evidence that the plaintiff produced in support of her claim was her own testimony and that of Mazza. Mazza's testimony, however, only partially corroborated the plaintiff's account of the arbitrator's so-called outburst. The plaintiff failed to present any evidence beyond her own testimony in support of her claims that the arbitrator warned her against taking bathroom breaks, spoke to the defendant's counsel in Hebrew, and called the plaintiff a \"fallen Catholic.\" In\n   <em>\n    Toland\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded that a plaintiff failed to meet her burden to show partiality under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2) when the plaintiff presented evidence from the transcript of the arbitration proceedings that demonstrated that the arbitrator \"expressed some frustration and impatience\" with the plaintiff.
