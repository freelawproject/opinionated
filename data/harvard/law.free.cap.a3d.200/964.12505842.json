We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 4, 1992, Appellant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery, and entered a\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea to one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse - forcible compulsion, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123(a)(1), graded as a felony of the first degree. On December 19, 1992, Appellant received an aggregate sentence of thirteen to twenty-six years incarceration. At the time of his plea, the law did not impose registration obligations upon sexual offenders, as the first version of such laws (hereinafter generally referred to as \"Megan's Law\") was not enacted until 1995.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While Appellant served his sentence, four different versions of Megan's Law were enacted. In brief, our Supreme Court declared portions of the first Megan's Law unconstitutional in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. (Donald) Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"56718\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/557/285/\">\n    557 Pa. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11546868,56718\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/733/593/\">\n    733 A.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). In response, the General Assembly passed the second iteration of these laws, Megan's Law II, effective July 10, 2000. Subsequently, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. (Gomer) Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"588032\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/574/487/\">\n    574 Pa. 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088607\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/832/962/\">\n    832 A.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), our Supreme Court reviewed that statutory scheme and deemed some provisions unconstitutionally punitive. The Legislature again responded, by enacting Megan's Law III, which amended Megan's Law II and went into effect on January 24, 2005. Megan's Law III remained in effect until December 20, 2012, when SORNA became effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June of 2009, Appellant was granted parole, but was not released from confinement until March 8, 2012, due to the unavailability of placement in a specialized Community Corrections Center. As a condition of his release, Appellant was required to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant was required to register \"upon release from incarceration, [or] upon parole[.]\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (former) 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(a)(1) (effective February 21, 2012 to December 19, 2012). As of March of 2012, Megan's Law III required a lifetime registration for persons convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (former) 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2)(i) (lifetime registration for individuals convicted of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , involuntary deviate sexual intercourse) (effective December 20, 2011 to December 19, 2012). Following his release to Communications Corrections Center, Appellant violated his parole conditions by possessing a cell phone, and was reincarcerated as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SORNA incorporates by reference those persons who were required to register under former versions of the law, in addition to persons currently serving a sentence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.12 (defining \"sexually violent offense\" as an offense specified in \u00a7 9799.14 as a Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III offense); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.1411(d) (classifying involuntary deviate sexual intercourse as a Tier III offense). Therefore, at the time Appellant filed this petition, he was required to register under SORNA for life, due either to his obligations under Megan's Law III as carried forward under SORNA, and/or upon his release from incarceration pursuant to SORNA itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having set forth the statutory background, we now address the issues on appeal. On November 28, 2016, Appellant filed a Petition for Writ of\n   <em>\n    Habeas Corpus\n   </em>\n   and Declaratory Relief, seeking an order declaring him exempt from SORNA's provisions. The trial court denied the motion, relying on case law holding that the retroactive application of SORNA was permissible, since the consequences were not punitive.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

However, we have also held that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   does not qualify as an exception to the PCRA's one-year time bar.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Therefore,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   applies retroactively on collateral review only to those persons who could raise the issue in a timely PCRA petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This distinction is outcome determinative. Procedurally, the instant case comes to this Court as a filing outside of the PCRA. However, Appellant's selected designation does not control.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Hence, we must examine whether Appellant's request for relief must be treated as a PCRA petition. The PCRA time limits are jurisdictional, and we therefore cannot address the merits of an untimely petition.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

No other statutory or common law remedy 'for the same purpose' is intended to be available; instead, such remedies are explicitly 'encompassed' within the PCRA.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The instant claim, that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   applies retroactively, is clearly cognizable under the PCRA.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rivera-Figueroa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an attempt to evade the timeliness requirements of the PCRA, Appellant specifically cited the line of cases seeking relief under a contractual theory, such as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947081\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/245/\">\n    86 A.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super. 2014).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   held that such claims fall outside the PCRA as their theory of relief is predicated upon an attack that does not pertain to the criminal sentence itself. We explained that a motion seeking enforcement of a plea bargain is not within the scope of the PCRA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We note that the within petition is not an attack on Appellant's sentence, nor is he alleging that he is innocent of the offenses of which he was convicted. Appellant is not asserting that his conviction or sentence resulted from a violation of the Constitution, ineffective assistance of counsel, an unlawfully-induced plea, obstruction by government officials of his right to appeal, newly-discovered evidence, an illegal sentence, or a lack of jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). In short, we agree with Appellant that his claim does not fall within the scope of the PCRA and should not be reviewed under the standard applicable to the dismissal of PCRA petitions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947081\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/245/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947081\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/245/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947081\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/245/\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   concluded that such petitions were not subject to the PCRA time bar. The claim nonetheless failed on the merits, as Partee had violated the terms of his probation and was therefore not entitled to the benefit of his bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Recently, this Court held in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Fernandez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502626\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/299/\">\n    195 A.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ), that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   has been abrogated by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and therefore offenders may seek restoration of the sexual offender obligations that existed at the time of their plea even if the offender breached their bargain by violating the terms of probation. Here, however, the plea enforcement theory does not apply, as Appellant has no plea bargain to enforce: he entered a\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea prior to the enactment of any sexual offender laws. By definition, the parties could not have contemplated non-registration as a term of the plea. We explained the applicable principles as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   To summarize: (a) where a plea bargain is structured so the defendant will not\n   have to register or report as a sex offender or he will have to register and report for a specific time; and (b) the defendant is not seeking to withdraw his plea but to enforce it, then the \"collateral consequence\" concept attributed generally to sex offender registration requirements does not trump enforcement of the plea bargain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Additionally,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    is a new substantive rule, and the refusal to judicially apply the case retroactively poses its own set of problems.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204237535\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 313 n. 3,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204237535\">\n     2018 WL 4237535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *11 n.3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Finally, I note my belief that retroactive application of\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    may be permissible outside of the PCRA.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    effectively imposes a brand new criminal sentence as a substantive, not procedural, matter. In the ordinary\n    <em>\n     ex post facto\n    </em>\n    case, there is a clearly-defined date from which punishment is imposed: the date the trial judge announces the sentence. Herein, Appellant was not serving any sentence with respect to his sexual offender obligations until our Supreme Court declared that to be so. That fact presents an unusual issue with respect to\n    <em>\n     ex post facto\n    </em>\n    issues, and\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    is largely academic if its holding does not apply retroactively to all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Since this Court disagrees with my position that\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    has been applied retroactively through legislation, I would not foreclose reaching\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Muniz\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <em>\n     via\n    </em>\n    an alternative theory.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See e.g.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v.
