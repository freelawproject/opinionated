We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 16, 2016, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Sergeant Jeffrey Johnston of the Hellertown police department was stopped at a red light on Main Street behind Appellant. When the light turned green, Appellant made a quick right turn onto High Street, \"spinning his tires, causing the rear end of the truck to kick out or fishtail[ into the other lane, and] ... then accelerated very quickly west on High Street.\" N.T., 8/15/2017, at 7, 17. At that point, Sergeant Johnston activated his lights and sirens to conduct a traffic stop. Appellant did not stop. He continued to drive carelessly, including failing to utilize a turn signal. He eventually stopped on Diamond Street and attempted to reverse into a parking space, forcing Sergeant Johnston to reverse his police vehicle to avoid being struck.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant exited the driver's seat and attempted to leave, but Sergeant Johnston instructed Appellant to remain in his vehicle. Sergeant Johnston approached Appellant in the driver's seat, and informed him that he was stopped because of \"the reckless driving of spinning his tires and fishtailing at the intersections of High and Main Street[.]\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9. Appellant's speech was slurred, he was unable to grab his requested paperwork with his fingers, and\n   Sergeant Johnston detected the odor of alcohol from inside the vehicle.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on this interaction, Sergeant Johnston had Appellant perform multiple field sobriety tests, including the walk-and-turn test and one-leg stand test, which Appellant failed. Based upon his entire interaction with Appellant to that point, Sergeant Johnston believed Appellant was under the influence of alcohol to the point that he was incapable of driving safely.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was arrested and transported to the Bethlehem Township DUI Center for further processing. The blood draw procedure was video recorded at the DUI Center, and that recording was presented to the suppression court in connection with Appellant's challenge to the warrantless blood draw. The video was not made part of the certified record on appeal. However, the parties agree\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Appellant was read the revised DL-26B form,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   he signed it, and he agreed to submit to a blood draw, which indicated a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.15.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 19-20, 24.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Appellant's Brief at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant was charged with DUI - general impairment (as a first offense), DUI - high rate of alcohol (as a second offense), and careless driving. Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the traffic stop was unlawful, and any consent to the warrantless blood draw \"was accomplished only after a warning that a failure to consent would result in enhanced criminal penalties if convicted, as set forth in Pennsylvania's DL-26 Implied Consent Form, ... and was therefore not voluntary and knowing.\" Omnibus Pre-Trial Motion, 7/7/2017, at \u00b6 9. A hearing was held where the aforementioned facts were developed. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Sergeant Johnston had probable cause to conduct the traffic stop and Appellant voluntarily consented to a blood draw after being read the DL-26B form.

Because the Commonwealth prevailed before the suppression court, we may consider only the evidence of the Commonwealth and so much of the evidence for the defense as remains uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole. Where the suppression court's factual findings are supported by the record, we are bound by these findings and may reverse only if the court's legal conclusions are erroneous. Where ... the appeal of the determination of the suppression court turns on allegations of legal error, the suppression court's legal conclusions are not binding on an appellate court, whose duty it is to determine if the suppression court properly applied the law to the facts.

On appeal, Appellant contends that this inconsistency between the DL-26B form and the provisions of our DUI statute that were rendered unconstitutional by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , but not statutorily amended until Act 30, required suppression of his blood draw. Appellant's Brief at 19-20. In other words, Appellant argues that because subsection 3804(c) subjected him to enhanced criminal penalties, and subsection 1547(b)(2)(ii) required the police to warn Appellant of such penalties, the blood draw violated\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We recently rejected Appellant's flawed argument and held that PennDOT had the authority to amend the DL-26 form to comport with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   prior to the enactment of Act 30.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Robertson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 186 A.3d at 446. In doing so, we adopted the following well-reasoned analysis of the Commonwealth Court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   It is true, as [Garlick] argues, that the language contained in [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii) was mandatory at the time [the t]rooper requested that [Garlick] submit to a blood test. However, while [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii) then commanded that a warning about enhanced criminal penalties be given, the purpose behind that provision is to make a licensee aware of the consequences of a refusal to take the test so that he can make a knowing and conscious choice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Following\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and as the Superior Court concluded thereafter, a licensee cannot be criminally punished for refusing a police officer's request to test his blood pursuant to the Implied Consent Law. Although, at the time [the t]rooper requested that [Garlick] submit to a blood test, [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii) still required a warning that a licensee would be subject to enhanced criminal penalties under [subs]ection 3804(c) for refusing a test of his blood, [Garlick] could not, as a matter of constitutional law, be subject to such penalties. Stated simply, enhanced criminal penalties were not a consequence of [Garlick]'s refusing the requested blood test. [Garlick]'s argument is, in effect, that because the General Assembly did not immediately amend [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii), [Penn]DOT and the police had to continue to apply [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii). However, the effect of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the Superior Court cases that followed was to render the criminal penalties warned of in [subs]ection 1547(b)(2)(ii) as applied to blood testing unenforceable and to effectively sever that section from the rest of the [Motor] Vehicle Code.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   1 Pa.

During the ensuing vehicle stop, the officer noticed the scent of alcohol on the defendant's breath. Importantly, the officer did not testify that the stop was based on suspicion of DUI. The defendant was convicted of DUI and a motor vehicle code violation, and argued on appeal that the vehicle stop was illegal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This Court noted the distinction between \"the investigative potential of a vehicle stop based on a reasonable suspicion of DUI as compared to other suspected violations of the Motor Vehicle Code.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291306\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/10/1285/#p1291\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1289 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Rather, he stopped Appellant for a Motor Vehicle Code violation: careless driving. Accordingly, a showing of probable cause was necessary to justify the sergeant's stop of Appellant for a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3714(a) (\"Any person who drives a vehicle in careless disregard for the safety of persons or property is guilty of careless driving, a summary offense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In denying Appellant's motion to suppress, the trial court found that Sergeant Johnston had probable cause to believe that Appellant was in violation of subsection 3714(a) of the Motor Vehicle Code based on: (1) \"mak[ing] a quick right turn that caused the rear wheels of his vehicle to kick-out into the opposing lane of traffic[,]\" (2) making a turn without signaling, and (3) \"upon attempting to park the vehicle, [Appellant's] revers[ing] in such a manner that Sergeant Johnston was also required to reverse his vehicle to avoid a collision.\" Order, 9/27/2017, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While pages 28 and 29 are missing from the argument section of Appellant's brief, it appears that part of his argument challenges the trial court's \"consideration of actions that happened after the 'fishtail[.]' \" Appellant's Brief at 27. To the extent that the trial court considered events that occurred after the traffic stop was initiated in determining whether probable cause existed for the traffic stop, the trial court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nevertheless, the trial court's findings before the stop were enough to establish probable cause for the stop. Here, Appellant was subjected to a seizure when Sergeant Johnston activated his lights and sirens to conduct the traffic stop, notwithstanding Appellant's failure to comply immediately.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Therefore, Sergeant Johnston must have possessed probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had occurred prior to activating his lights and sirens. Upon review, we find that Sergeant Johnston's observations of Appellant \"spinning his tires, causing the rear end of the truck to kick out or fishtail[ into the other lane, and] ... then accelerat[ing] very quickly west on High Street[,]\" were sufficient to give the sergeant probable cause to stop Appellant for careless driving.
