On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court erroneously ruled that the parties' agreement does not obligate the defendants to reimburse Konover for legal fees incurred while litigating certain legal actions that had been pending against Konover and KBE at the time the agreement was executed. In the alternative, the plaintiffs claim that, even if the language of the agreement does not require the defendants to reimburse Konover for any legal fees, the trial court should have considered admissions in the defendants' pleadings and other extrinsic evidence, which evinced an understanding between the parties that the defendants were responsible for paying their own legal fees incurred in conjunction with the referenced litigation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. Konover was the sole director and shareholder of KBE. The buyers formed KBE Holdings, Inc., to acquire all of Konover's KBE stock. On March 30, 2007, the buyers and Konover executed the agreement at issue, which set forth the terms for the stock purchase and sale of all of Konover's stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time the agreement was executed, KBE was a defendant in two separate groups of civil actions, which the agreement referred to as the \"Existing Litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   One group of actions, denominated the\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   litigation, arose from personal injuries suffered\n   by several construction workers, employed by a subcontractor of KBE, while building a BJ's Wholesale Club in Willimantic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second\n   group of actions, referred to as the\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   litigation, stemmed from a foreclosure action in Maryland, in which Wells Fargo had obtained a judgment of foreclosure relating to a failed shopping center. In the\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   litigation, both Konover individually, and other entities related to him, had been named as defendants. KBE, however, had not been named as a defendant. After a final judgment was rendered in Maryland against both Konover in his individual capacity, as well as several other entities, the prevailing plaintiffs commenced an action against Konover and several entities owned by him, including KBE, seeking enforcement of the Maryland judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Recognizing the possibility that KBE would need to satisfy potential judgments and would incur substantial legal fees as a result of the existing litigation, Konover and the buyers included indemnification provisions in the stock purchase and sales agreement. Pursuant to \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) of the agreement, Konover promised to indemnify KBE and the buyers for \"Damages\" resulting from \"any judgment\" rendered against KBE or the buyers in the existing litigation. In exchange, Konover was given the exclusive right to manage the existing litigation, and the defendants were required to cooperate with Konover in the defense of the existing litigation. The defendants were obligated, as well, to cooperate with Konover in any counterclaims or new actions brought by Konover against any parties to the existing litigation. These potential actions were referred\n   to as \"Successor Actions\" in the parties' agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 4.4 further provided, however, that Konover was responsible for the cost of any successor actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the course of the existing litigation, the defendants became discontent with Konover's management of the litigation. Also, Konover demanded reimbursement from the defendants for legal fees incurred during the course of defending these matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unable to resolve these disagreements, Konover and the plaintiffs filed a twelve count complaint against the defendants, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract for KBE's refusal to reimburse Konover for legal fees he incurred during the existing litigation. In turn, the defendants filed a counterclaim, alleging, inter alia, that Konover's mismanagement of the litigation constituted a breach of contract and a breach of fiduciary duty owed to them. The defendants also claimed, in response\n   to the complaint, that they were not obligated pursuant to the agreement to reimburse Konover for expenses he\n   incurred in conjunction with the existing litigation. The defendants subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the same basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After briefing and argument, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on all claims pertaining to breach of contract for failure to pay attorney's fees in the existing litigation, ruling that the agreement clearly and unambiguously did not require KBE to reimburse Konover for legal fees incurred during the course of the existing litigation, and only required the defendants to pay legal fees for any future claims brought by the\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs. Specifically, the court ordered: \"Summary judgment is granted on all claims premised on breach of a contract to pay attorneys' fees in the existing litigation in favor of the defendants that moved for summary judgment.... Because all counts of the current complaint are through incorporation by reference premised on the existence of the contract obligation rejected in this opinion, the plaintiffs may have [thirty] days leave to file a new complaint if they believe they can state causes of action without the contract based premise that KBE promised to pay fees in existing litigation.\" The trial court's ruling disposed of all claims made by Konover Development Corporation, Konover and Associates, Inc., Blackboard, LLC, and Ripple, LLC. These entities subsequently filed an appeal as a matter of right. The trial court's ruling did not, however, dispose of all claims made by Konover in the complaint. As a result, Konover sought and was granted permission from the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Moukasher, J.\n   </em>\n   , and this court to appeal, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-4. In a separate motion, this court consolidated the appeals. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the outset, we note the applicable standard of review and legal principles relating to motions for summary judgment. \"Summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted\n   show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The plaintiffs assert that the provisions of the agreement, read in the context of the entire agreement, unambiguously require the defendants to pay for their own legal fees in the existing litigation. As a result, the defendants must reimburse Konover for legal fees that he advanced during the course of the existing litigation. In support of this argument, the plaintiffs urge this court to read \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) of the agreement to exclude KBE's attorney's fees in the existing litigation from Konover's\n   indemnification obligation. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We first set forth the standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis. \"The court's determination as to whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law; our standard of review, therefore, is de novo.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Meridian Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dragone Classic Motorcars, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489484\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/87/#p364\">\n    171 Conn.

These sections state, in relevant part: \"The indemnification for Damages by [Konover] as it relates to the [existing litigation], inclusive, shall be limited to [Konover's] obligation to satisfy any judgment in favor of the named plaintiff against [the defendants] pursuant to such actions, and specifically excludes the cost of [the defendants'] legal fees as well as the costs or expenses incurred by the [defendants] as a result of any further claims brought by the plaintiffs in such actions against [the defendants] ....\" The term \"judgment\" is defined in \u00a7 4.3 (b) (iii) to include \"actual Damages assessed against [the defendants] ... and in every instance, shall expressly exclude and be limited\n   by those matters otherwise specifically set forth above in [\u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) ] ....\" Additionally, the term \"Damages\" is defined in \u00a7 4.6 to include \"fees and reasonable expenses of attorneys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that this language clearly and unambiguously requires the defendants to reimburse Konover for legal fees incurred in conjunction with the existing litigation. It does not. The plaintiffs' construction of \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) requires the use of the language \"as well as\" to serve as a buffer between \"cost of [the defendants'] legal fees\" and \"further claims.\" Put differently, the plaintiffs argue that the phrase \"as well as\" must be construed to exclude the \"cost of [the defendants'] legal fees\" from \"further claims,\" and must instead be attributed to the cost of legal fees for the existing litigation. This interpretation tortures the words of the agreement to conform to the will of the plaintiffs. The words \"as well as\" are commonly used as an inclusive, connecting phrase, rather than a dividing one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, \"as well as\" plainly includes\n   the cost of the defendants' legal fees in the category of expenses specifically excluded from Konover's indemnification obligations for\n   <em>\n    further claims\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the plain language of the contract requires Konover to pay for legal fees incurred during the existing litigation, but the defendants must pay for their own legal fees should further claims be brought against KBE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This reading of \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) is supported when construing the language of the agreement as a whole.\n   Under \u00a7 4.4 of the agreement, Konover had the exclusive authority to manage the existing litigation. Further, he was obligated to satisfy any judgment against the defendants in the existing litigation under \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii). If this court were to accept the plaintiffs' reading of the agreement, and \u00a7\u00a7 4.3 and 4.4 in particular, Konover could effectively use his managerial authority to incur an open ended amount of legal expenses, at the defendants' expense, to defend against a judgment that he alone would be obligated to satisfy. As the trial court aptly observed in rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants: \"There is no way to convert any language limiting what Konover must do into language requiring KBE to do something that would be extraordinary and was not mentioned in the contract: assume an affirmative obligation to pay an unlimited amount of attorneys' fees to defend against claims that ultimately Konover alone might have to pay. Indeed, such an interpretation is not only disconnected from any language in the contract but is made absurd by the contract provision that gives Konover the sole right to manage the litigation-including how much is spent defending it and for how long. With someone else's millions for defense, Konover would have precious little incentive to pay even a penny for tribute regardless [of] whether it would make the cases go away entirely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our courts refuse to \"construe a contract's language in such a way that it would lead to an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stonybrook Gardens Cooperative, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20185\">\n    158 Conn.

In other words, the plaintiffs\n   argue that the words \"cost\" and \"costs\" are synonymous and, thus, cannot both be understood to apply to \"future claims\" without being duplicative. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiffs would have the court interchange the term \"cost\" and \"costs\" in its construction. These words, however, commonly have different meanings. \"We often consult dictionaries in interpreting contracts ... to determine whether the ordinary meanings of the words used therein are plain and unambiguous, or conversely, have varying definitions in common parlance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    NPC Offices, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kowaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20519\">\n    320 Conn. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20A.3d%201144\">\n    131 A.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The word \"cost\" is often defined as the \"amount paid or charged for something.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009). Conversely, the word \"costs\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   commonly refers to \"charges or fees taxed by a court\" or \"expenses of litigation, prosecution, or other legal transaction, [especially] those allowed in favor of one party against the other.\" Id., 398. \"[T]he term costs is a term of art having a limited, well-defined legal meaning as statutory allowances to a prevailing party in a judicial action in order to reimburse him or her for expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending the proceeding.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Yeager\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779262\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/112/#p121\">\n    134 Conn.

Consequently, the ordinary reading of \u00a7 4.3 (b) (i) and (ii) would exclude from Konover's indemnification obligation the cost (sum or amount charged) of KBE's attorney's fees and the costs (statutory allowances of the prevailing party) or expense incurred by KBE as a result of future claims, but not the existing litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted by the trial court, the stock purchase agreement is devoid of any language that imposes an affirmative obligation on the defendants to indemnify Konover for any legal fees incurred during the existing litigation. Rather, the agreement squarely places an affirmative obligation on Konover to indemnify the\n   defendants for any judgment rendered for the named plaintiffs in the existing litigation. We decline to impose such an obligation on the defendants in the absence of any express language in the agreement. \"[A] court cannot import into the agreement a different provision nor can the construction of the agreement be changed to vary the express limitations of its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Deming\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins.

Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly rendered summary judgment in the defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs next claim that even if the agreement is clear and unambiguous, we should look beyond the four corners of the agreement to consider the meaning the parties ascribed to the indemnification provisions of the agreement by their course of conduct. We reject this invitation to error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The following additional facts are pertinent to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants initially took the position in their counterclaim and memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment that KBE was required to pay for its own legal fees in the existing litigation. At oral argument on the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the trial court opined that the agreement was clear and unambiguous, and did not obligate the defendants to indemnify Konover for legal fees incurred during the existing litigation. Consequently, after oral argument, the defendants adopted the trial court's interpretation of the agreement in their supplemental memorandum of law in support of their\n   motion for summary judgment. Conversely, the plaintiffs argued that the trial court's reading of the contract was inconsistent with the intent of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the plaintiffs urge the court to look to the admissions in the defendants' pleadings to discern the parties' understanding of the contract language. In essence, Konover asserts that the defendants should be bound by their judicial admissions and, therefore, they should be prevented from now making a contrary argument. \"Judicial admissions are voluntary and knowing concessions of fact by a party or a party's\n   attorney occurring during judicial proceedings. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Kopacz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Day Kimball Hospital of Windham County, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"210719\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/64/263/#p272\">\n    64 Conn App. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%20862\">\n    779 A.2d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). \"Admissions, whether judicial or evidentiary, are concessions of fact, not concessions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Borrelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Board of Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050417\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/106/266/#p271\">\n    106 Conn.
