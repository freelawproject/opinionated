Grievant was employed as\n   an operator at the City's wastewater treatment facility. (Arbitrator's op. at 2.) He began this employment part-time in April of 2004 and later became full-time in September of 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    2015 Arbitration Opinion and Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Grievant was initially terminated from his employment effective March 17, 2015, based on a poor attendance history, multiple warnings, and three days of consecutive absences beginning on March 14, 2015. (Trial court op., March 16, 2018, at 1-2.) These absences resulted from Grievant's arrest and incarceration on charges of driving under the influence and firearm possession charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Union thereafter filed a grievance on Grievant's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following an arbitration hearing on December 16, 2015, Arbitrator Robert A. Creo issued an opinion and award concluding that the City did not have just cause to terminate Grievant and directing that he be reinstated to his former position with full back pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The City filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award but the trial court denied the same by order dated October 14, 2016, and the City did not file a further appeal. (Trial court op., March 16, 2018, at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2017 Arbitration Opinion and Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 13, 2016, two days before the City filed its petition to vacate the 2015 arbitration award with the trial court, Grievant was arrested and incarcerated on drug charges. (Trial court op., March 16, 2018, at 3.) He had not yet returned to work at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In February of 2016, the City made a position available to Grievant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By letter dated February 24, 2016, the City notified Grievant that his continued absence from work and lack of an acceptable explanation for his absence led to the City's determination to commence an action to again terminate his employment, but the City did afford him the opportunity to respond and offer any information he believed might mitigate the situation or cause the City to reverse its decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By correspondence dated March 9, 2016, the Union responded on Grievant's behalf, advised the City of his incarceration, and noted his inability to return to work at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By letter dated March 21, 2016, the City advised Grievant of his termination effective that date, citing the Union's letter and the reason stated therein as an inadequate excuse for Grievant's absence from his job. (Arbitrator's op. at 2.) Two days later, on March 23, 2016, the Union filed a grievance on Grievant's behalf alleging that Grievant was unjustly terminated in accordance with the just cause provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A new Arbitrator, Marc A. Winters, was appointed and a hearing was ultimately held on June 9, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At this hearing, the City presented the testimony of Connie Cook (Cook), its Human Resources Manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Cook testified that the City could not hold a position open for Grievant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cook also indicated that Grievant himself, not the Union, should have contacted the City and explained his situation, namely his incarceration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cook stated that had Grievant\n   contacted the City himself, the City may have considered not terminating him and allowed him to return to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Grievant testified on his own behalf, stating that he had never taken, sold, or manufactured narcotics prior to the City's filing of its petition to vacate the 2015 arbitration award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grievant explained that subsequent to this filing he became depressed and felt that he had no alternative but to sell drugs to make money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By opinion and award dated June 16, 2017, the Arbitrator granted the grievance. The Arbitrator concluded that the City failed to establish just cause sufficient to warrant Grievant's termination and directed the City to reinstate Grievant to his former position and to make him whole back to January 24, 2017. (Arbitrator's op. at 9.) While emphasizing that Grievant was responsible for his own conduct, the Arbitrator agreed with the Union that the City, by not complying with the 2015 arbitration award, \"severely contributed to Grievant's economic and emotional problems and distress.\" (Arbitrator's op. at 7.) The Arbitrator also noted that the City made no argument that Grievant's incarceration would adversely affect its public image or its operations, nor did it provide evidence as to any type of burden or hardship it would incur in holding Grievant's position open until his release from jail. (Arbitrator's op. at 7-8.) Finally, the Arbitrator characterized the City's decision to terminate Grievant as \"arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable as the reasons given for the termination do not meet the elements of just cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City thereafter filed a petition to vacate the Arbitrator's award with the trial court, arguing that the Arbitrator erred in misapprehending the reason for Grievant's termination as his failure to offer an explanation himself for his absence, rather than its stated reason of unexcused absence from work. The City also argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Arbitrator erred in finding a right to reinstatement after incarceration for a period of 13 months; placing a burden on it to offer evidence or justification as to why it could not hold Grievant's position open for 13 months; and finding that an open-ended incarceration is a valid excuse for absence from work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By opinion and order dated January 19, 2018, the trial court granted the City's petition to vacate and reinstated Grievant's termination. The trial court concluded that the City \"reasonably terminated [Grievant's] employment on March 21, 2016. The City, further, was not obligated to hold Grievant's position open for an extended, indefinite, open-ended period of time.\" (Trial court op., January 19, 2018, at 3.) The trial court noted that the Arbitrator's finding that there was no just cause for Grievant's termination was not supported by the record, emphasizing that Grievant's incarceration and the City's inability to keep the position open indefinitely were \"adequate excuses and do satisfy the requirements of the CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The trial court further explained that \"Grievant's self-imposed problems are directly within the scope and context of Section 901\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and relate to an employee's qualifications, performance,\n   attitude, work habits or personal conduct. In this regard, the Arbitrator failed to apply the 'just cause' definition as contained in the CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Union thereafter filed a notice of appeal with the trial court. In compliance with an order from the trial court dated January 31, 2018, the Union filed a statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure (Pa.R.A.P.). The Union alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the trial court misapplied the essence test in reviewing the Arbitrator's award, substituted its judgment for that of the Arbitrator, ignored critical facts, and erred in concluding that the Arbitrator's finding of an absence of just cause was unsupported by the record. In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court stated that these issues were addressed in its January 19, 2018 opinion and did not need to be addressed further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the Union argues that the trial court erred in vacating the Arbitrator's award. More specifically, the Union argues that the Arbitrator's award was rationally derived from, and drew its essence from, the parties' CBA, and that the trial court exceeded its scope of review by substituting its judgment for that of the Arbitrator. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court recently discussed the extremely deferential standard of review to be applied to labor arbitration awards in\n   <em>\n    Northern Cambria School District v.

As noted above, section 901\n   of the parties' CBA only permits the dismissal of an employee for \"just cause.\" (R.R. at 86a.) This section goes on to define the \"just cause\" necessary for dismissal as relating to an employee's \"qualifications, performance, attitude, work habits or personal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hence, the only question that remained to be decided was whether the Arbitrator's award was rationally derived from the agreement. The trial court concluded that it was not because the Arbitrator added a new provision to the CBA. In this regard, as the City points out in its brief, the Arbitrator essentially added a new, non-negotiated provision into the parties' CBA,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , requiring the City to hold open for an indefinite period of time the position of a Union employee. The trial court noted that Grievant's self-imposed problems, most importantly his incarceration on drug charges, were \"directly within the scope and context of Section 901 and relate to an employee's qualifications, performance, attitude, work habits or personal conduct.\" (Trial court op., January 19, 2018, at 4.) As a result of this incarceration, the Arbitrator and the trial court recognized that Grievant failed to report his absence to the City, which ultimately led to his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court also questioned the Arbitrator's reliance on the City's purported lack of evidence as to why it could not hold open Grievant's position for an extended, indefinite period of time. The trial court noted that the Arbitrator himself recognized testimony from Cook, the City's Human Resources Manager, that the City could not hold a position open for Grievant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitrator's op. at 6. As the record reflects, Grievant remained incarcerated and unavailable to work for a period of approximately 13 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An arbitrator's award cannot be said to draw its essence from a CBA, and consequently does not meet the essence test, where the award violates the express terms of a CBA by changing the language therein or by \"\n   <strong>\n    adding new and additional provisions\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Millcreek Township School District v.

However, there is no provision in the parties' CBA obligating the City to hold a position open and allow a Union employee to return to his position after a lengthy and indefinite absence due to incarceration. As the City states in its brief, \"The Arbitrator essentially added to the CBA a right possessed by a union employee to reinstatement despite the employee's indefinite unavailability.\" (City's Brief at 9.) In other words, the Arbitrator went outside the terms of the CBA to find that an open-ended period of incarceration constituted a valid excuse for an employee's absence. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Millcreek Township School District\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of Beaver Falls\n   </em>\n   , the Arbitrator added a new provision to the CBA, one that was not bargained for or agreed to by the parties.

We held, \"We are aware that we must sustain the arbitrator's award if it is based on anything that can be gleaned as the 'essence' of the bargaining agreement, but this does not include changing the language of the contract or adding new and additional provisions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20A.2d%20863\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20A.2d%20863\">\n     at 865\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
