Other changes were made iu the construction of the weapon by the contractors,, on their own motion, which were important and judicious, and which materially improved it. How much time these changes required djd- not precisely appear; but it.was admitted that they necessarily required two or three months, a part of which resulted from the action of the department, and that the contractors proceeded in good faith and without unnecessary delay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">It was further found that, on or about the 5th of April, 1864, the company exhibited one of the weapons for inspection, and gave notice to the department that the company was then ready to commence delivery, and would deliver the entire six thousand as rapidly as the government could inspect them, and asked that they should be then inspected and received by the department, which was not done then and had not since been done. It was further found that inspection of contract arms was always made at the place of manufacture, and was made of the parts of the arm before they were put together. It was also found that the time consumed by the compauy in filling the contract beyond the time fixed by its terms, to wit, six months, was rendered necessary and indispensable by the changes, alterations, and delays caused solely by and for the interest of the government; and further that the government was aware of the progress of the work, and gave no notice that it should refuse to accept the work if not delivered within the six months. The arms were inspected by a competent person, and found to be according to contract, and were packed in cases and tendered to the government, which refused to receive or pay for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">The six thousand carbines were still at the time of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>suit, brought March 15th, 1870, in the hands of the company, not having been offered for sale, and on the 21st of March, 1871, when the Court .of Claims gave its judgment, were worth, according to the finding of the court, $8 each. Their value or market price at any previous time was not found. . The Court of Claims (by an equally divided court) dismissed the petition, and the manufacturing company appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-4\">\n<em>Mr. G. EL. Williams, Attorney-General, and Mr.'S. F. Phillips, Solicitor-General, in support of that dismissal:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-5\">The contract was to take, not a definite number of carbines, but all that could be furnished within six mouths, whether fifty or five thousand, so that they did not exceed six thousand. In other words, the contract was for the results of the industry of the plaintiff\" on sucli carbines, limited to six months, be the results small or large, so that the carbines did not exceed, in number, six thousand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-6\">The slight changes suggested by the United States would not, apparently, either by their direct or indirect effect, have diminished the percentage of those results to any considerable extent. The case, as made ou.t by the company, leaves the court ignorant of that extent. The company <em>mingled </em>the effect upon the <em>lime </em>of delivery, of the changes required directly or indirectly by the government, with that of those other <em>improvements </em>added of its own' head. \u25a0 This is a sort of <em>voluntary confusion </em>of effects that justified the decree below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-7\">AVe need not say how very important <em>time </em>is in all matters concerning a flagrant war, or how especially important during the year 1863 of the late war. The variation of a performance under which the government in 1863 might reasonably have expected several thousand arms from time to time within six mouths, to one in which it was to receive none for a year, was a variation of capital magnitude.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-8\"><em>Messrs. C. F. Peck and </em>FF. <em>W. McFarland, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b618-9\">Mr. Justice MILLER</author>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">(having recited much as the reporter has given them, the chief points of the findings of the court below) delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\"We think that the statement of this case, as it appears in the main points in the findings of the Court of Claims, is. the best argument in favor of the claimant that can be made. Wo cannot believe there would be any hesitation in holding an individual liable who, after making su.ch a contract as ivas made in this .instance, and requesting such alterations for his own benefit, and Avho, while aware of the increased time necessary, and that the other party was in good faith and Avith reasonable diligence performing the work, should say, \u201cI will not receive or pay for the work done, because it was not done within the time first stipulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">There is no reason why the parties should not modify the contract by a change in the character of the weapon and time of delivery; and if it was Avell known to both that the change in the weapon required a longer time, as the court finds it was, it murt be implied that both parties consented to such an extension of time as Avas necessary or reasonable for the completion of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">. The reply to this is, that the United States did not contract for six thousand carbines, but only for so many as could be made and delivered ivithin the .six'months, and that, nctAvithstaudjng the change ordered in their construction, as none were delivered within that time, they were not bound to take auy afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">But this is a narrow and incomplete view of the contract. It leaves out the claimant\u2019s rights in the matter. The claimant had a right .under the original contract to deliver' six thousand carbines within six months, and have his pay, if he could make so many within that time.- He could have made them all within that time, as found by the court, but for his consent to the request of-tlre government to change for its benefit the structure of the weapon. As before stated, this request implied such an-extension of time as was known to be necessitated by that improvement, and the <em>government </em>must be bound by this reasonable intendment as an individual would have been.. As it is found substantially that the' claimant was ready and offered to deliver within a reasonable time, he is entitled to such damages as he sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>tained by the refusal of the government to receive and pay for the arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">What are those damages ? It is not found that the weapons had at any time a market value or current selling price. It is not found what they were worth or could have been sold for at the time they were offered for delivery and refused. They were not then or at any time sold or offered for sale by the claimant. The only criterion of damage furnished is the finding of the court, that the six thousand carbines are now (at the time of the judgment of the court) in the possession of the company, and of the value of $3 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">As the case stands, we reverse the judgment of the Court \u2022 of Clainls, and remand the case, with directions to render a judgment for the claimant for such damages as they may ascertain that the claimant has sustained by reason of the refusal of the United States to accept and pay for the six thousand carbines.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
