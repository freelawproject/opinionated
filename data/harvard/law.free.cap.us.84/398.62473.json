But if no claimant appeared within that time the officer was directed to advertise the property for sale, giving <em>not less than fifteen days\u2019 notice of sale,, </em>and to deposit the proceeds of sale in the treasury, By the thirteenth section it was enacted that if it should happen that the owner, notwithstanding the publicity given to the transaction, did not know of the seizure aud sale, aud was not guilty of any intentional fraud on the revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, on satisfactory proof of these facts, within three months from the deposit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>money, might remit the forfeiture and restore the proceeds of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The fifteenth section of the act \u2014 the section-on which the dispute in this case turned \u2014 requires the officer, if the property, being of less value than $500, shall be certified on oath by the appraisers, in their belief, to be liable to perish or deteriorate by keeping, or cannot be kept without disproportionate expense, \u201c <em>and when no claim shall have been interposed therefor as hereinbefore provided,\u201d </em>to advertise that he had seized and would sell it, giving not less than <em>one week\u2019s </em>notice of such.seizure and intended sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">This act of 1866 being in force, Stannard, as an officer of the customs for the district of Vermont, on the 14th of January, 1868, seized the <em>horses, </em>harness, and sleigh of one Conway, as being engaged in smuggling goods from Canada. He caused the property to be appraised immediately, and the appraisers finding it worth $191, and no claim being interposed, and the appraisers certifying their belief on oath that it was liable to speedy deterioration by keeping, and that the expense of keeping it would largely reduce the net proceeds of the sale of it, the collector gave public notice on the 15th that he would sell it ou the 29th following, and accordingly did sell it on the said 29th of January; that is to say, without allowing Conway twenty days from the notice of seizure within which to prefer his claim. The ptroceeds were paid into the treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">Hereupon Conway brought trespass <em>de bonis asportaiis, </em>in the court below, for taking and carrying away the horses, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">The collector pleaded the facts as above given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">The plaintiif demurred to the plea, and the opinion of the judges being opposed upon the question whether the plea was a bar to the action, the question was certified for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-11\">\n<em>Mr. L. P. Poland, for the plaintiff, and in support of the demurrer :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-12\">The substantial effect \u00f3f a seizure and sale of property under the .provisions of the act of 18-66., is to deprive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>owner of his property without any judicial determination against him, or against his property, lie may, indeed, within three months, at his own cost and expense, appeal to the clemency or discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but all legal intendments and presumptions are against him; the burden of proof is thrown upon him, to show that his property was not forfeited, or that the.violation of law was unintentional; and even this will not suffice, unless he also prove that he had no knowledge of the seizure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">The proceeding is far more <em>in invitum </em>than those usually so characterized, \u2014 tax sales, or sales on execution, and. the like. The notice by publication is all the notice that the owner of the property is required to have before he is deprived of 1ns property by an official and quasi judicial sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">This mere statement of the statute, and of its severe penal consequences, is enough to show that every requirement of it should be strictly observed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">Now, by the fifteenth section, the owner is expressly given twenty days within which to file his claim and bond, and thus entitle himself to a legal trial before he is deprived of his property. The section enacts that if the appraisers certify that the property is perishable, or cannot be kept without disproportionate expense, \u201c and where no claim shall HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED THEREFOR, AS IS HEREINBEFORE -PROVIDED,\u201d then the officer may proceed to advertise and sell the property, and shall at such time as he thinks reasonable, but not less than one week. These are absolute and indispensable conditions required by the law, before the seizing officer has any -authority to even advertise the property for sale, and so absolutely essential are they for the protection of the owner that they cannot be disregarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">In the present case the defendants utterly disregarded these provisions, and proceeded to advertise the property for sale on the next day after seizing it, without notice to. the plaintiff and without opportunity to assert his claim. The case then is that of an officer who has neglected to perform an act legally required as preliminary to a sale. And for this violation of law \u2014 wanton and flagrant in this case\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>all the authorities, from the <em>Six Carpenters\u2019 </em>Case<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to this time,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> make the defeudaut a trespasser <em>ab initio </em>and\u2019 liable in trespass for the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">But under any circumstances the plea is no bar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>Mr. G.

This construction is \u25a0more plausible than sound. It cannot be adopted, because \u25a0\u2022it is inconsistent with .other positive directions, about which there is no controversy, and would, besides, defeat the manifest purpose that Congress intended to .accomplish by this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">This section is the last of the series concerning the seizure and sale of property worth les.s than $500. The sections which precede it apply to property generally of this limited value, while this affects property of the same value,.but of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>perishable nature. The scheme adopted for the condemnation of property of this.limited value, without a resort to the courts, could not be complete unless it embraced property liable' to deteriorate, as well as that which was not of this character. And of necessity, the provisions for the condemnation of both could not be the same. Perishable property ought to be speedily sold, while property not in this condition could not be injured by delay. The statute recognizes this difference, and provides for it. In the case of property not perishable \u2014 doubtless, supposed to be the kind which would usually come under condemnation \u2014 the first step to be taken is to give notice of the seizure, which is to be continued for three successive weeks. If the owner appears in twenty days from the first publication of this notice, he can put a stop to the summary proceeding. If he does not appear, the property is to be advertised- for sale on notice of not less than fifteen days. And be is turned over to the Secretary of the Treasury for remission of the forfeiture, if he has suffered injustice at the hands of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The requirements concerning the.disposition of perishable property are very different. In the first place, no separate notice of seizure is exacted of the officer, but the notice of seizure is to go out with the notice of sale. This provision shows that it was intended to hasten the sale of this kind of property; and it is clear that this object could not be attained if the officer had to publish a preliminary notice of seizure, wait twenty days for any one interested to prefer a claim, and then advertise and sell. Before all this could be done, the property might become worthless. At any rate, the longer the delay the greater the deterioration; and in recognition of this fact, the officer is authorized to sell property in this predicament in a week, if he thinks proper to do so; while, as we have- seen, he is estopped from selling property not in this condition until the expiration of thirty-five days from the publication of notice of seizure. In the latter case, the owner can have twenty days to file his claim, aud yet the officer can discharge his duty under the law; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the former he-cannot enjoy this privilege and the officer be allowed to exercise his discretion to sell the property after a w'eek\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The two things cannot coexist, nor is Congress chargeable with, such loose legislation, for the condition can be construed so as to harmonize all parts of the section, and thereby secure an effective system for the speedy disposition of property subject to forfeiture, of less value than $500, whether perishable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">It is argued that the words \u201cas hereinbefore provided\u201d control the condition, and-make it broad euough to embrace everything secured on this subject in a previous part of the statute. This result by no means follows. The words, it is true, are general, but they necessarily refer to the manner of making the claim as previously directed, and not to the time within which the claimant of property, not perishable, could interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The twelfth section pointed out the way. in which the party interested had to proceed in order to arrest the sal\u00e9 of his property. He must file his claim with the officer, state the nature of it, and give bond with certain conditions. If these things were done, the summary proceeding was stopped, and the district attorney authorized to proceed to condemn the property in the ordinary mode prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">By the fifteenth section, the owner of perishable property was informed that if he interposed and perfected his claim in the same way, the same consequences would follow. If he did not choose to do this, the officer was directed, without any loss of time, to advertise and sell his property, leaving him, in case of injury, to seek redress at the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">This is the scope and extent of this section. On this theory of construction the plan adopted for the sale of perishable property can be made to work -effectively. On the theory advanced by the plaintiff, it is practically inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">It follows, from these views, that the demurrer to the special plea in bar should have been overruled, and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>therefore, the question certified by the judges below must be</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
