It was clearly shown on the trial that if nuts are stowed in the hold on this voyage they are very liable to be injured by sweat; that it is the almost invariable practice to carry them in the cabin, or cabin state-rooms, and to enter them on the bill of lading as to be thus carried; and that if they are carried in the hold they are sometimes inclosed in water-tight oil casks in order to keep them in proper condition. The packages in this case were all marked \u201c in cabin state-room,\u201d and when they were delivered for shipment receipts were given by the receiving clerk of the vessel, specifying in the margin the marks of the goods, including the direction above quoted. But the bill of lading, which was received by the shippers after the parcels were delivered, omitted any allusion to this direction.. It contracted simply that the goods should be delivered in San Francisco \u201c in good order and condition, dangers of the sea, fire, and collisions excepted.\u201d The goods were placed in the \u2022hold without notice to the shippers, and havingibeen injured on the voyage this libel was filed for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-8\">The,District Court decreed in favor of the libellants; and the Circuit Court having affirmed the decree, this appeal brought the case here for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b676-9\">\n<em>Mr. G. Donohue, for the appellant:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-10\">The only contract that binds the parties, and on which all parties are compelled to rely, is the bill of lading. The contract being in writing, that alone must govern. This was the decision of this court in <em>The </em>Delaware;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the more authoritative since it was made, as the report of the case- shows, after one of the fullest, ablest, -and most learned arguments at the bar, on the other side of the question, which it was possible to make. That case also decided that a \u201c clean \u201d bill of lading, that is to say, a bill which, was silent as to the place of stowage, imports a contract that the goods are to be stowed under deck. But it has never been decided,' nor, .so- far as we know, supposed that- such a bill imports a contract that goods are to be stowed in the cabin, .state-room; a-place not appropriated\u2019 to' the stowage of goods at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">As, therefore,'no particular place was specified for the stowage of the goods, they were sufficiently stowed when they were stowed in the ordinary place \u2014 the place where, according to <em>The Delaware, </em>the bill imported that they should, be stowed, <em>i. </em>a,-anywhere between deck\u2019s in the hold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-6\">The \u201c sweating \u201d was a danger of the sea; an excepted danger, therefore, under the bill of lading.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>Mr. C. M Whitehead, contra :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-8\">1. A clean bill of lading imposes an obligation to store under the deck, This, we agree with the other side in saying, was decided <em>iii-The Delaware. </em>Now the'agreemeut'to store in the cabin is-not an agreement in contradiction to that implied obligation. On the contrary, it is ancillary to.it, and aids it in a point upon which the bill of lading i's silent. A written contract may always be thus aided.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-9\">2. The libellants proved \u201ca custom of-trade\u201d-to store nuts in the cabin, and having shown that nuts stored otherwise would be injured, the master is chargeable with negligence for storing in the hold, whether he gave a bill of lading or not, or whether there was an express agreement or not.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In <em>Blakie </em>v. <em>Stembridge,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an action was brought by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>shipper for damages occasioned by sweat on a voyage from China, by reason of improper stowage. The court held that the question of negligeuce would be governed by the custom of trade, and if the goods were stowed according to the customary way in that particular trade, the vessel would be absolved,' otherwise not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-6\">3. The receiving clerk of the vessel when the nuts were delivered for shipment, gave what amounted to a receipt, that they were to be carried \u201cin cabin state-room.\u201d Given as this receipt was, it must be considered as so far forming part of the bill of lading, that the latter must be read by its light. Contemporaneous written documents are to be construed together.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-7\">Indeed, the court, on trial, could at any time have amended the bill of lading, as was done in <em>Chouteaux </em>v. <em>Leech,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in regard to anything omitted therefrom through a clerical error, and contrary to the understanding of the parties.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-11\"> <em>14 </em>Wallace, 579.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> Bonney v.

The contract of the bill of lading was,'that the goods should be delivered in San Francisco \u201cin good order and condition, dangers of the seas, fire,.and collisions excepted.\u201d The defence is to the effect that \u201csweating\u201d is one of the dangers of the seas. But if the sweating be produced in consequence-of negligent stowage, the claimant is precluded from setting up the defence. If costly mirrors are stowed amongst loose articles of hardware, or if a case inclosing valuable statuary, arjd marked \u201c This side up with care,\u201d is placed upside down amongst a lot of pig-iron, the claimant could hardly contend that he is. protected from responsibility by the clause relating to the dangers of the seas. In this matter, as in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>others, due care and its \u2018opposite, negligence, are relative terms, having respect to the nature of the duty to be performed, the knowledge communicated to the party to be charged, and the prevailing usages of the business. In view of the \u00e1lmost invariable practice as to the stowage of nuts on this voyage, of the well-known fact that if stowed in the hold they are extremely liable to be injuredby sweat, and of the marks and directions on the packages in question in this case, it was culpable negligence in the master of th\u00e9 vessel to stow them in the hold. If he could not stow them as directed, he should, at least, have given notice to the shippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">This view of . the case is sufficient to dispose of it without deciding whether the evidence in reference to .the stowage of nuts established a custom of- the trade ip th.e proper sense of that term, or whether the shipping receipts were-a part, of the contract of affreightment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Decree affirmed with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
