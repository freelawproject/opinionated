This the city did, the railroad company in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>turn giving to it a mortgage on all its road, revenue, and franchises, to secure the payment of the bonds which the city had issued, and the interest which it had bound itself to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">After the passage of the internal revenue laws, the 122d section of which is above quoted, the government claimed payment from the company of a tax of 5 per cent., which the collectors of the Federal revenue alleged that under the plain language of the above-quoted 122d section, the company was bound to withhold from the city and pay to the United States. The company refused so to pay the 5 per cent, to the government, on the ground that the tax was not a tax laid on <em>it, </em>the company, but one laid on their creditor, the city of Baltimore, and that that city, being a municipal corporation, could not have its revenues taxed by the Federal government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-6\">The United States accordingly sued the compauy, in the court below, in assumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\">The first count alleged that the company, by force of the provisions of the mortgage, became bound to pay to the city the interest on the loan, and that the compauy owed for tax on such interest $87,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\">The second count was for $87,000, money had and received.

They insist as a consequence, secondly, that the present is a tax upon the revenues of the city of Baltimore; and, thirdly, that it is not within the power of Congress to tax the income or property of a municipal corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">1. The case of <em>The Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Jackson,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided in 1868, aud <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Railroad </em>Company,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> are authorities in support of the first proposition. In the case first mentioned, Jackson,.an alien non-resident, sought to recover from the railroad company the amount of the tax of 5 per cent, imposed upon the interest of bondholders by the act of 1864, and withheld by the compatiy. A similar tax was imposed by the statutes of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff claimed that as he was an alien non-resident, it was not in the power of Congress, or of that State,, to tax him. The courts of Pennsylvania had sustained the deduction. Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of this court, and in remarking upon the decision of those courts, \u201c that the deduction from the prescribed income of the interest on t\u00edrese railroad bonds, when paid by companies, was regarded as simply a mode of collecting this part of the income tax,\u201d says: \u201cWe concur in this view. It is not important, however, to pursue this argument, as Congress has since, in express terms, by the acts of March 10th and July 13th, 1866, imposed a tax on alien non-resident bondholders. The question will be hereafter not whether the laws embrace the alien non-resident holder, but whether it is competent for Congress to impose it.\u201d In <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Railroad Company </em>it was held that a covenant by the corporation issuing the bond to pay the interest \u201cwithout any deduction to be made for or in respect of any taxes, charges, or assessments,\u201d did not relieve Haight, who was a bondholder, from the - deduction of the 5 per cent, authorized by the 122d section. The court below said that \u201cthe measure of the company\u2019s liability is expressed in the bond as being debt and interest only. It has nothing to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>with the taxes which the government may impose on the plaintiff for the interest payable to him. . . . The plaintiff pays no internal revenue tax on these bonds at his place of residence. It is, therefore, no case of double taxation. The tax should be paid somewhere, and it was to meet investments like this, in banks, railroads, &amp;c., that the 122d section was passed.\u201d This opinion was adopted in this court, Mr. Justice Grier saying: \u201cThe facts in this case are correctly stated, and the law properly decided by the learned judge of the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This is a clear, distinct,.unqualified adjudication, by the unanimous judgment of this court, that the tax imposed by the 122d section is a tax imposed upon the creditor or stockholder therein named; that the tax is not upon the corporation, and that the corporation is made use of as a convenient and effective instrument for collecting'the same. It is a sequence in logical connection with that provision of section 117,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which specifies as the subjects of individual taxation all the earnings' profits, gains, and income from whatever source derived, and whether divided or not, <em>except </em>the amount derived from the sources indicated in the 122d section. Of the incomes specified in section 117 the individual must make specific returns, and be directly taxed thereon. Upon or for the incomes received from the sources mentioned in section 122 no tax is directly imposed upon the owner. That tax is to be returned by, and collected from, the corporation as his agent and instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A tax is understood to be a charge, a pecuniary burden, for the support of government. Of all burdens imposed upon mankind that of grinding taxation is the most cruel. It is not taxation that government should take from one the profits and gains of another. That is taxation which compels one to pay for the support of the government from his own gains and of his own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In the cases we are considering the corporation parts not with a farthing of its bwn property. Whatever sum it pays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to the government is the property of another. Whether the tax is 5 per cent, on the dividend or interest, or whether it be 50 per cent., the corporation is neither richer nor poorer. Whatever it thus pays to the government, it by law withholds from the creditor. If no tax exists, it pays 7 per cent., or whatever be its rate of interest, to its creditor in one unbroken sum. If there be a tax it pays exactly the same sum to its creditor, less 5 per cent, thereof, and this 5 per cent, it pays to the government. The receivers may be two, or the receiver may be one, but the payer pays the same amount in either event. It is no pecuniary burden upon tho corporation, and no taxation of the corporation. The burden falls on the creditor. He is the party taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In the ease before uS this question controls its decision.\u2019 If the tax were upon the railroad, there is no defence. It must be paid. But we hold that the tax imposed by the 122d section is in substance and in law a tax upon the income of the creditor or stockholder, and not a tax upon the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The creditor here is the city of Baltimore, and the question then arises whether this tax can be collected from the revenues of that municipal corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">There is no dispute about the general rules of law applicable to this subject. The power of taxation by the Federal government upon the subjects and in the manner prescribed by the act we are considering, is undoubted. There are, however, certain departments which are excepted from the general power. The right of the States to administer their own affairs through their legislative, executive, and judicial departments, in their own manner through their own agencies, is conceded by the uniform decisions of this court and by the practice of the Federal government from its organization. This carries with it an exemption of those agencies and instruments, from the taxing power of the Federal government. If they may be taxed lightly, they may be taxed heavily; if justly, oppressively. Their operation may be impeded and may be destroyed, if any interference is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mitted. Hence, the beginning of such taxation is not allowed on the one side, is not claimed on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In the \u201c Compendium of Internal Revenue Law,\u2019.\u2019 by Davidge <em>&amp; </em>Kimball, it is said,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c Congress may not tax the revenues of a State,\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and also, \u201c A national bank is not liable under the internal revenue laws to the tax upon dividends due a State on stock owned by the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Again:<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> \u201c The term corporation as used in the acts of Congress touching internal revenue does not include a State, consequently the income of the State of Georgia from the Western and Atlantic railroad, property owned, controlled, and managed by that State, has not been made by law a subject of taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Again, \u201c The term person as used in \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 44 does not include a State. The receipts or_ certificates issued by the State of Alabama are not subject to the tax of 10 per cent, imposed by the act of Congress of March 25th, 1867.\u201d<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The inquiry then arises, what is the nature and character \u25a0of municipal corporations, and what is their connection with \u00a1the government of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">A work on corporations says,<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> that inferior and subordinate communities, <em>imperta in imperio, </em>such as cities and towns, . . . are allowed to assume to themselves some of the duties of tlie .State in a partial or detailed form, but having neither property nor power for the purposes of personal aggrandizement, they can be considered in no other light than as auxiliaries of the government, and as' the secondary deputies and trustees and servants of the people.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2R\">It is said further by the same .authority, the main distinction between public and private corporations is, that over the former the legislature, as guardian of the public inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ests, has the exclusive and unrestrained control; and acting as such, as it may create, so it may modify or destroy, as public exigency requires or recommends, or the public interest will be best subserved. It possesses the right to alter, abolish, or destroy all such institutions, as mere municipal regulations must, from the nature of things, he subject to the absolute control of the government.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c Such institutions (it is added) are auxiliaries of the government in the important business of municipal rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">A municipal corporation like the city of Baltimore, is a representative not only of the State, but is a portion of its governmental power. It is one of its creatures, made\"for a \u25a0specific purpose, to exercise within a limited sphere the powers of the State. The State may withdraw these local powers of government at pleasure, and may, through its legislature or other appointed channels, govern the local territory as it governs the State at large. It may enlarge or contract its powers or destroy its existence. As a portion of the-State in the/exercise of a limited portion of the powers of the State, its revenues, like those of the State, are not subject to taxation. This proposition is very properly admitted by the counsel for the government. In their brief it is said, \u201cWe admit that municipal corporations, acting merely within the scope of their duties as such, are not to be included within general words imposing taxes upon persons or corporations.\u201d In support of this view is cited the proviso to the amendment in 1866, in these words: \u201cProvided that it is the iut\u00e9ut hereby to exempt from liability to taxation such State, countjq town, or other municipal corporation, in the exercise only of functions strictly belonging to them in their ordinary governmental and municipal capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Assuming for the argument that this qualification is well made, let us look at the facts of the' case before us. The city of Baltimore, with a view to its commercial prosperity, was desirous of aiding in the construction of a railroad, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which the commerce and business of the Western States would be brought to that city. For this purpose it was authorized by the legislature to issue its corporate bonds for $5,000,000, on which it was to obtain the money. The proceeds of these bonds, reserving 10 per cent, as a sinkiug fund, were to be paid to the railroad company. To secure the city against loss and to provide for the payment of the interest on the bonds of the city as it should, from time to time mature, and of the principal when payable, the railroad company were to execute a mortgage to the city upon its road and franchises and revenues. All this was done as agreed upon. The interest, secured by this mortgage, has, from time to time, been paid by the railroad company to the city, and it is a tax (under the 122d section before referred to) upon the interest thus paid, that the plaintiff now seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">That the State possessed the power to confer this authority upon the city, we see no reason to doubt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Was it exercised for the benefit of the municipality, that is in the course of its municipal business or duties? In other words, was it acting iu its capacity of an agent of the State, delegated to exercise certain powers for the benefit of the municipality called the city of Baltimore ? Did it act as an auxiliary servant and trustee of the supreme legislative power? The legislature and the authorities of the city of Baltimore decided that the investment of $5,000,000 in aid of the construction of a railroad, which should bring to that city the unbounded harvests of the West, would be a measure for the benefit of the inhabitants of Baltimore and of the-municipality. This vast business was a prize for which the States north of Maryland were cont\u00e9nding. Should it endeavor by the expenditure of this money or this credit to bring this vast business into its own State, and make its commercial metropolis great and prosperous, or should it refuse to.'incur hazard, allow other States to absorb this commerce, and B&lt; ltimore to fall into an inferior position ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>This was a question for the decision of the city under the authority of the State. It was a question to be decided solely with reference to public and municipal interests. The city'had authority to expend its money in opening squares, in widening streets, in deepening rivers, in building common roads or railways. The State could do these things by the direct act of its legislature, or it could empower the city to do them. It could act directly or through the agency of others. It is not a question to be here discussed, whether the action proposed would in the ehd result to the benefit of the city. It might be. wise, or it might prove otherwise. The city was to reap the fruits in the advanced prospei\u2019ity of all its material interests, if successful. If unsuccessful, the city was to bear the load of debt and taxation, which would surely follow. The city had the power given it by the legislature to decide the question. It was within the scope of its municipal powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">This advance of the city bonds was not a donation. It was an investment supposed to be judiciously made and adequately secured. It was' not for- the individual benefit of those managing the business. No one received advantage except as he was a citizen or his property was within the city. It was not a loan for the benefit of the railroad; it was for the benefit of the city solely: That the railroad company was also benefited did not affect the purpose of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">It is said by the counsel for the United States that municipal corporations are those that are created irrespective of those who are associated therein, and that the powers are given and withheld upon grounds which concern the public at large. It is not necessary to discuss the question whether this city is a municipal corporation. If there can exist a municipal corporation, as that expression is generally understood, the cities of this country, like Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New .York, fall within the definition. The power in question was conferred because its exercise concerned the public and to benefit that public. This power could no doubt have been imposed upon the city as a duty, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>exercise directed without the- assent or against the wish of the corporation or its citizens. The State could do it dil\u2019eetly for and on behalf of the city, and without its intervention. The city could act only by authority from the State. The State is itself supreme, and' needs no assent or authority from the city. It is not perceived that the act is less public and municipal in its character than if the State had compelled the city to lay the tax and to make the appropriation of the proceeds to the railroad company. In <em>The Town of Guilford </em>v. <em>The Board of Supervisors of Chenango </em>County,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was held:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">1. That the legislature has power to levy a tax upon the taxable property of a town, and appropriate the same to the payment of a claim made by an individual against the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">2. That it is not a valid objection to the exercise of such power, that the claim to satisfy which the tax is levied is not recoverable by action against the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">3. That it does not alter the case that the claim has been rejected by the voters of the town, when submitted to them at a towu meeting, under an act of the legislature authorizing such submission and declaring that their decision should be final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The action is no less a portion of the sovereign authority, when it is done through the- agency of a town or city corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We admit the proposition of the counsel, that the revenue must be municipal in its nature to entitle it to the exemption claimed. Thus, if an individual should make the city' of Baltimore his agent and trustee to receive funds, and to distribute them in aid of science, literature, or the fine arts, or even for the relief of the destitute and infirm, it is quite possible that such revenues would be subject to taxation. The corporation would therein depart from its municipal character, and assume the position of a private trustee. It would occupy a place which an individual could occupy with equal propriety. It would not in that action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>be \u00e1n auxiliary or servant of the State, but of the individual creating the trust. There is nothing of a governmental character in such a position. It is not necessary, however, to speculate upon hypothetical caees. We are clear in the opinion that the present transaction is within the rauge of the municipal duties of the city, and that the tax cannot be collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Judgment .aeeirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> 7 Wallace, 262.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> 6 Id. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> See this section quoted <em>supra, </em>p. 295.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\"> Page 505; citing Sayles <em>v. </em>Davis, 22 Wisconsin, 229.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b352-11\"> Page 485; citing 12 Opinions of the Attorneys-General, 402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> Page 471; citing State of Georgia <em>v. </em>Atkins, Collector, 8 Internal Revenue Record, 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b352-13\"> 12 Opinions of the Attorneys-General, 176.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u01c1\">\n<p id=\"b352-14\"> Angel &amp; Ames on Corporations, \u00a7 16 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\">\n<p id=\"b352-15\"> 2 Kent, 4th ed. 274, and De Tocqueville Democratie, 1, 64, 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> Angel &amp; Ames on Corporations, \u00a7 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> Gelpeke v.

Such a right is one which may be of great- value to the government in time of war and imminent public danger, and one which the United States ought never to surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Corporations of the kind are vei-y numerous and they may and often do own large amounts of bank stock, bonds, and stocks of railroads, vacant lots and other real estate of great value, and many other species .'of personal property and dioses in action never used or intended to be used as means or instruments for conducting the public affairs of the municipality, and in respect to all such property the right of Congress to pass laws subjecting the same to taxation with the property of the citizens generally is as clear, in my judgment, as it is that the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises is vested by the Constitution in the national legislature.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1lv\">It was decided by this court, in the case of <em>Vidal </em>v. <em>Girard\u2019s </em>Executors,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that the corporation of the city of Philadelphia had the power under its charter totake real and personal estate by deed and also by devise, inasmuch as the English statute which excepted corporations from taking such properties in the former mode was not in force in that State; that where.a corporation has this power it may take and hold property in trust in the same manner and to the same extent as a private person may do, even though the trust is not strictly within the scope of the direct purposes of the charter of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Ten years later this court affirmed that same rule in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>case of <em>The Executors, of McDonogh </em>v. <em>Murdoch</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which gave three millions of dollars to the city of Baltimore and more than a half-million of dollars to the city of New Orleans. Both of those corporations, it was held in that case, were empowered to take the property by devise, as the laws of the respective States do not prohibit such dispositions of property in their favor, affirming the principle that such corporations may take real and personal estate by deed or devise, aud that they hold such property in trust in the same manner and to the same' extent as private persons, and the statistics will show that such corporations have become the grantees or devisees of vast amounts of personal aud real estate, and that many of them still hold aud enjoy the same for the income, rents, and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Apply the rule here suggested to the case before the court and it is clear, whether it be held that the tax was levied upon the municipal corporation or the railroad company, that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Soon after the opinion of the court in the preceding case was delivered, a motion was made by Messrs. <em>Gowen, Biddle, and </em>Cuyler, the counsel of the different railroad companies, in the case of <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Railroad Companies, </em>decided five weeks before it, for a rehearing of that case; the grounds of the motion being the obvious and irreconcilable contradiction between the language in one of the opinions given in the first case (see <em>supra, </em>pp. 302-3, 309), which opinion the learned counsel assumed to be the opinion of the court \u2014 and the opinion of the court in the second case (see <em>supra, </em>pp. 326-7); a contradiction which the counsel exhibited by a juxtaposition of passages in the two opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">And now, April 28th, 1873, the Chief Justice announced the order of the court</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">-r. , . Denying the motion.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>}-</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> The Collector <em>v. </em>Day, 11 Wallace, 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> McCulloch <em>v. </em>Maryland, 4 Wheaton, 434; Louisville <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Duvall, 295; National Bank <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 9 Wallace, 353; Veazie Bank <em>v. </em>Fenno, 8 Id. 533.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AoG5\"> 2 Howard, 127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> 15 Howard, 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\"> No reasons were assigned for the order. The reader will have perceived, probably, that notwithstanding the inconsistency of language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>opinion relied on by counsel in the former case, with that expressing the opinion of the court in the latter,, the <em>judgments of the court </em>in &gt;the two cases are in no way inharmonious. . And the Reporter has already noted in his syllabus of the former ease that th\u00e9 judgment in it was given by a court nearly equally divided, and that the majority of the court who agreed in the judgment did not agree in the grounds of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
