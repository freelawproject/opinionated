An officer who shows that he received a commission from the proper source, and who serves and is recognized as such officer by his superiors until his regiment is mustered out, and who presented himself at the proper time and placo to bo mustered in, and was refused, makes out a <em>prim&amp; facie </em>case for full pay under the joint resolution of Congress of July 26th, 1866, \u201cfor the relief of certain officers of the army.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b429-10\">2. It does not rebut this <em>prim&amp; facie </em>case to prove that the officer who refused to muster him in <em>alleged </em>that he was not entitled to such muster, because the company to which he was assigned as lieutenant was below the minimum in numbers.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b429-12\">3.

And it is not to be supposed that the joint resolution was meant to be applied to a case where the party' could not be mustered in without a violation of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">In addition to this, applying the ordinary rule of interpretation, that general words are to be construed as <em>ejusdem </em>generis, it would seem to be clear that the other causes referred to in the resolution are causes similar in' nature to those particularly mentioned, namely, by reason of being killed in battle, or capture by the enemy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Messrs. N. P. Ghvpman and A. A. Hosmer, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">The reason why Henry was refused pay for his services as lieutenant, was that he had never been mustered into the service as a lieutenant. But he offered himself repeatedly for such muster, and'produced his commission. He came, therefore, within the provisions of the joint resolution, since he entered on the duties of the office and performed the same, and his failure to be mustered in was \u201c without fault. or neglect of his own,\u201d and was from a cause \u201c beyond his control.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-20\"> 14 Stat. at Large, 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b429-21\"> 12 Id. 734.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b431-8\">Mr. Justice MILLEB,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">There is no question but that the claimant\u2019s case comes within the strict letter of the joint resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The counsel for the United States, however, argues that the joint resolution can only have application to the case of an officer duly commissioned and <em>entitled by law to be mustered into service as such, officer,, </em>and that the finding of the court shows that the claimant, was not entitled to be mustered in when he accepted his commission and offered himself for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">This'would raise a very interesting question, and one which might not be easy of decision, if the record in this case fairly presented it. There is undoubtedly strong reason why Congress should have provided full pay for an officer who, holding a commission from the proper source, was given command and actually served as such officer, and had his rank recognized by-' all 'his superiors, though in point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>fact not mustered in as such or entitled to be; and it is certain he would not be entitled to such pay without the enabling act. But we do not find in the record the evidence, or any finding of the court that the claimant was not entitled to be mustered into the service. The finding of the Court of Claims on that subject is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u201cUpon receipt of the commission from the governor of Ohio the claimant presented himself -for muster, as second lieutenant, to the proper mustering officer of his division, but was refused such muster, the mustering officer alleging that Company D, to which the claimant was assigned, was reduced below the minimum number, and that, therefore, he was not entitled to be mustered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Counsel for the government, assuming that what the mustering officer alleged is to be treated here as an established fact, further assumes that that fact brings his case within the language of section twenty of the act of March 3d, 1863, to wit: \u201c That whenever a <em>regiment </em>is reduced below the minimum number allowed by law, no officers shall be appointed in such regiment beyond those necessary for the command of such reduced number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">But the argument is open to more than one fatal objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">1. The claimant having shown that he was regularly commissioned and served as a lieutenant, and.was, without fault of his, refused a muster, so that he comes within the literal terms of the joint resolution; if any fact is relied onto defeat his claim, it should be specifically found and stated by the Court of Claims. This is not done by a finding of that court that the mustering officer <em>alleged </em>that Company I) was reduced below the minimum number. If the fact that the company was below the minimum was important in the case, it should have been found as a fact by the court, and not stated merely as the alleged reason of the officer for refusing to muster in the claimant. The muster-roll of the company was within the control of the government, and would have settled the fact., one way or the other, beyond dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">2. The act relied on by counsel forbids the appointment of officers in a <em>regiment, </em>wheu.it is reduced below the mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>mum number allowed by law, beyond those necessary for the command of such reduced number.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It is quite consistent with a reduction of Company D below the minimum for a company, that the regiment was not below the minimum for a regiment. Indeed, it is unreasonable to suppose that because a single company is reduced below the minimum, that the regiment is for that reason to be so treated, and to have no more officers appointed in it until that company is filled up.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">There is no finding, nor any allegation, in the present case, that the regiment was below the minimum, and, therefore, this act does not apply. Nor are we pointed by coum sel to any law or regulation of the service which fixes what is the minimum of a regiment of volunteer infantry. Nor does the Court of Claims find any facts from which, if we had such a law or regulation before us, we could decide whether this regiment, or, indeed, this company, was in fact below the minimum as established by law at the time the claimant offered himself for muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Under these circumstances, the judgment of the Court of Claims must be</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
