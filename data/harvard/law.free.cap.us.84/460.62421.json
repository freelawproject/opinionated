The case came on to be tried in March, 1870, and therefore while the Patent Act of July 4th, 1836,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which in suits against infringers gives to patentees \u201cthe actual damages sustained\u201d by them, was in force; a similar provision, however, being made in the subsequent Patent Act of July 8th, 1870.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The bill of exceptions showed that the plaintiff gave in evidence that during the term of the patent \u201c the defendants had sold inkstands having hinges that were infringements of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, to the number of seventy-five dozen, and that the royalty which the plaintiff received for the use of his patent was at the rate of \u201d\u00a1$2 per gross.\u201d The testimony being closed, the co'urt instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\">\u201cIf the jury shall find a verdict for the plaintiff under the foregoing instructions, they will award him such sum as they shall find to be required to remunerate him for the loss sustained by the wrongful act of the defendants, and <em>to reimburse him for all such expenditures as have been necessarily incurred by him in order to establish his right.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-9\">To this instruction the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-10\">A verdict.and judgment having been given for the plaintiffin the sum of $500 the defendants brought the ease here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-11\"><em>Mr. R. D. </em>Massey, <em>for the plaintiff in error:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-12\">All the injury proved was that the defendants withheld, royalty to the amount of $12.50. There was no evidence of any \u201cexpenditure\u201d by Nock, and the instruction had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>foundation in the evidence. Its inevitable effect, upon the minds of the jury was to lead them to believe they might lump counsel fees, and such other expenditures as they <em>inferred, </em>and out of them make, a total. The jury followed this evident lead of the court, and returned a verdict for forty tim.es the amount proven.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-6\">\u25a0 <em>Mr. G.

If that test cannot be applied, he will be entitled to an amount which will compensate him for the injury to which he has been subjectecLby the piracy. In arriving at their conclusion, the profit made by the defendant and that lost by the plaintiff' are among the elements which the jury may consider. Where the infringement is confined to a part of the thing sold, the recovery must be limited accordingly. It cannot be as if the entire thing were covered by the patent; or, where that is the case, as if the infringement were as large as the monopoly. Counsel fees cannot be included in the verdict. The plaintiff', must show his damages by evidence. They must not be left to conjecture by the jury. They must be,proved, and not guessed at. . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The instruction under consideration was too broad and too vague.
