It cannot be presumed to have been made without the authority or sanction of the officer having charge of the records; the Commissioner of the General Land Office. It ivas there oi record, and upon the page of the record of the alleged patent, when the commissioner, in 1868, made the exemplified copy of the record offered in evidence below.

He doubtless then had in his possession the patent actually issued to him on the 10th of January, A.D. 1818, and from it himself drew, or the scrivener for him, the deed to Hart. The deed itself supports this conclusion ; it contains internal evidence of the fact. The description of the tract, the recitals of Egerton\u2019s title and consideration for which he obtained a patent, and date of its issue, must have been taken from the patent. The particular quarter-section upon which a bounty land warrant should be located in a military tract was then determined by lot, and not by selection, as at present.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The soldier held no certificate of location. His patent was the only evidence furnished him as to what tract he had become the owner of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">3. <em>The conduct of Egerton\u2019s grantees. </em>It is evident that there wras a mistake in the patent to Egerton, as intended to be issued, or in the deed from him to Hart, and in the mesne conveyances from Hart to Shaw. If the successive deeds followed the pateut, each purchaser inspecting the title-papers of his grantor would have no occasion to question the validity of the title he was about to acquire. When, however, it appeared that an elder patent had been issued to Durney for the <em>southeast </em>-quarter, it behooved the last grantee, tracing title to that tract through Egerton, to examine his title-papers and ascertain and have rectified any mistake occurring therein. To do this required a comparison of deed with prior deed -and with the patent. If a misdescription had occurred in any mesne conveyance, or in the deed from Egerton to Hart, the mistake would have been sought to be corrected by a new deed from Egerton, or a bill in chancery had ho refused to execute one. The conduct of the parties- \u2014 the grantees of Egerton \u2014 shows that no mistake was discovered in the deeds, and no variance in them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the patent. No new deed appears to have been executed or proceedings instituted to correct a mistake in the deeds and make them correspond with the patent. On the contrary, the grantee came to the United States claiming that his deed and the patent to Egerton were conveyances of the <em>southeast </em>quarter of section 18, and that as the tract had been granted by an elder patent to Durney, the government should give the legal representative or assignee of Giles Egerton the right to select another quarter-section in lieu thereof The fact that Durney\u2019s patent for the southeast quarter was older\" than Giles Egertou\u2019s must have been ascertained <em>by an examination of the latter patent itself.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\"><em>4. The act of March 3d, </em>1827. The act, as a reason and justification for its-passage, alleges that the quarter patented to Giles Egerton on the 10th day of January, A.D. 1818, had been previously patented to Durney. The court will not presume that the legislative department declared this to be a fact and gave it. the sanction of a legal enactment without satisfactory proof of its truth. The patent itself, at that time in the possession of Egerton or his grantee, wa\u00e1, doubtless, produced before the committee which exami\u00faed and recommended the passage of the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">The four facts to which we have adverted corroborate each other, and taken together are only reconcilable with the conclusion that no matter what patent should hawe been and was intended to be' issued to Giles Egerton, the patent signed, sealed, and received by him, purported to grant the <em>southeast </em>quarter and not the <em>northeast </em>quarter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">The proof, therefore, shows that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\">II. <em>The legal title to the northeast quarter remained in the United States until the issue of the patent to Leonard.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-10\">The location of Egerton\u2019s bounty warrant upon the land did not convey to him the legal title. It gave him a right to a conveyance, which right he could waive or relinquish.

Egerton, by the deed to Hart of the <em>southeast </em>quarter, and its recitals that his patent granted that tract, and by the successive conveyances-from Hart to Shaw, with the acceptance by the latter of another quarter-section from the United States in lieu of that quarter, became estopped from claiming ^hat his patent granted him the <em>northeast </em>quarter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">A person is always estopped by his own deed, and will not be allowed to aver anything in contradiction of what he has once solemnly and deliberately admitted.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> \u2018Admissions which have been acted upon by other's are conclusive against the party making them, in all cases between him and the party whose conduct he has thus influenced.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">2d.

The recitals in the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1827, and Shaw\u2019s entry of a quarter-section under its provisions, also estop him from questioning the truth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>facts recited in the act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The act.asserts that the quarter patented to Egerton on the 10th day of January, A.D. 1818, had been previously patented to Duruey. The latter\u2019s patent was for the <em>southeast, </em>quarter. Egerton\u2019s patent, therefore, according to the act, granted that quarter. Shaw, Egerton\u2019s remote grantee, availed himself of its provisions; he'must be held to admit its statements. The entry was to be iii \u201clieu of\u201d the quarter patented to Egerton, so that <em>it was a relinquishment by Shaw of whatever quarter that patent granted. </em>The act and the entry would estop Shaw, and all parties whose right or title under the patent Shaw had acquired, from claiming title under the Egerton patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">4th.

To this charge the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The court did not state the ground on which the charge to the jury was based; whether on the ground that the original patent of Giles Egerton was in fact given for the southeast quarter-section, and not for the northeast quarter; or on the \u2022 ground that Egerton and those in privity with him were estopped on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">We will first consider the ground of <em>estoppel, </em>on the supposition that the patent was, or may have been, in fact given for the lot in question, but that the supposed estoppel prevented Egerton, and those in privity with him, from alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ing that fact. What, then, was this 1 estoppel ? Who was bound by-it? and who can set it up?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The supposed estoppel is founded on the deed given by Egerton to Hart, in July, 1819, for a lot described as the. <em>southeast </em>quarter of section 18, and as granted to Egerton by his patent of January 10th, 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Now if the patent thus referred to was, in fact, for the-northeast quarter, there was a mere mistake in the deed' which might have been rectified in equity, or, perhaps, by a reference to the patent itself. But standing as it did, without being reformed, what at most was the estoppel which it created ? and who could have taken advantage of it at that time ? First, Egerton was technically estopped, at law, to deny that his patent covered the southeast quarter, , which the deed, in terms, conveyed; secondly, this estoppel related only to the southeast quarter; thirdly, it existed only as between Egerton on the one side, and Hart on the other, and their respective privies. Thus far, it did not bind the government, nor could the government take advantage of it, being a stranger to the estoppel. It did not impair the title of the government, or of its patentee, to the southeast quarter, assumed to be conveyed; nor did it reinvest the government with the title to the northeast quarter. -If the original patent was in fact for the northeast quarter, the government could not have reclaimed that quarter against its own patent, whatever deed Egerton may have given to a third party for a different lot. And Egerton\u2019s heirs, or his grantees of the northeast quarter, would have stood in bis place. And the defendants in this case, coming into possession of that quarter under a tax sale, are to be regarded in the same light (at least that is the plain tifFs claim) as Egerton himself would be if he were in possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Such was the position of the parties at the giving of the deed to Hart in 1819. Has anything since occurred to change that position, and to divest the title of the lot in question out of Egerton, or his legal assigns, by estoppel? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The assumed title to the southeast quarter conveyed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Hart passed from hand to hand by several mesne conveyances until, in 1827, the then grantee procured the act of Congress, authorizing him to enter another lot in lieu of the southeast quarter, which the act supposes to have been patented to Egerton, but previously patented to James Durney. It is contended that this act and the subsequent entry of another lot in pursuance of it, operated to estop Egerton and his grantees from claiming the northeast quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">But the legal estoppel which affected Egerton aud his grantees, was not changed by that act. And in speaking of the grantees of Egerton, we must distinguish between those claiming under the deed to Hart, which assumed to convey the <em>southeast </em>quarter, and those claiming (as the defendants do) as grantees of the <em>northeast </em>quarter. The former class are those who are entitled to claim the benefit of the estoppel; the latter we are supposing to be bound by the estoppel. The act of Congress was procured in 1827 by the grantee under the deed to Hart, eight years after the date of that deed; and it recites that the. patent was for the southeast quarter. Now it is wrnll settled that recitals in a private act bind none but those who apply for it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The act in question was made for the benefit of the grantee under Hart\u2019s deed. He claimed the southeast quarter, but found that it had been patented to Durney; and he applied for leave to enter another lot. How can his act change or enlarge the estoppel by which Egerton and his grantees of the lot in question were bound before? A person entitled to the benefit of an estoppel may transfer it by transferring the estate, but he cannot change it or enlarge it. Eveiy grantee of the south-, east quarter, through Hart, to the end of time, may estop Egerton and his .assigns from denying that his patent was for the southeast quarter. But the government is not a grantee of that quarter under or through Hart. The government is still, in law, a stranger to the estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">It is supposed that Egerton and his assigns are estopped by the fact that the government was induced to give to Eger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ton\u2019s grantee another lot in consequence of the declaration contained in his deed to Hart. This may be ground for an equitable estoppel, not ..a legal one, and therefore not available in an action of ejectment where the title is in issue. If one person is induced to do an act prejudicial to himself in consequence of the acts or declarations of another, on which he had a light to rely, equity will enjoin the latter from asserting his legal rights against the tenor of such acts or declarations. But, then, the person charged has an opportunity of explaining, and equity will decree according to the justice of the entire case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Had the government, after granting another lot to Egerton\u2019s grantee, in pursuance of the act of Congress, filed a bill agaiust Egerton to prevent him from asserting title to the lot in question, perhaps it would have been a good defence for him to have shown that the discrepancy in his deed was a mere mistake, and that the agents of the government had no right to rely on it, because their own records would have shown that the patent was in fact given for the northeast quarter. But however this may be, the only estoppel arising out of the transaction referred to, which the government could set up, was an equitable and not a legal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Even if it were otherwise, and if the government <em>could, </em>in any aspect of the case, claim the benefit of the legal estoppel, it would be prevented from doing so by its own .patent granted to Egerton. That would present the case of estoppel agaiust estoppel, which Lord Coke says setteth the matter at large.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> No one can set up an estoppel agaiust his own grant. Whoever else, therefore, might set up the estoppel against Egerton\u2019s title to the lot. in question, the government could not do so. Its own .patent would stand in the way. And whatever the government could not do, its subsequent grantees could not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">It is suggested that Egerton\u2019s grantee, who procured the act of Congress and a patent for another lot, represented Egerton, and by his acts bound Egerton in the same manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>as himself.' But this may well be questioned. He could bind himself by his own acts; but he could only bind Egerton to the extent of Egerton\u2019s deed, and the effect of that has been fully considered. Egerton never asked the government for another patent, nor did he authorize his' grantee to do so. The transaction which took place between that grantee and the government was, as to Egerton and his grantees of the lot in question, <em>res inter alios </em>acta.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The conclusion to which we have come on this part of the case is, that there was no estoppel shown by .the evidence which would prevent the defendants from showing the.truth of the case, as to which quarter-section was actually granted, to Giles Egerton by his patent of January 10th, 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">This is, therefore, the next question to be considered. Had the patent itself been exhibited on the trial, i\u00a3 would have ended all controversy on the subject. But it was hot exhibited, and it did not appear what had become of it. An. exemplified copy, however, of the record of it, as it remains' in the archives of the General Land Office, was produced. This showed that the patent was for the northeast quarter of section 18, being.the lot in controversy.' It-was also shown from the same records, that this lot had been duly entered in favor of Egerton, under his military land warrant, on the day of the date of .the patent. It was furth\u00e9r shown, that the southeast quarter of section 18 had three days be-' fore been patented to another person, Durney. This cumulative evidence seems irrefragable to the effect that the patent was in fact given for the-lot in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Against this evidence, we have only, first, the description in the deed from Egerton to Hart, where the word \u201c squtheast\u201d is used instead of \u201c northeast;\u201d secondly, the memorandum in the margin of the record, and thirdly, the recital in the act of Congress. As to the.first, it is a kind of variance which so frequently occurs by mistake of the scrivener (as every surveyor and land lawyer knows), that it .is .scarcely worthy of a moment\u2019s consideration, when opposed to the record of the patent. As to the second \u2014 the memorandum made in the margin of the record \u2014 it is not known when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>was made, except that it must have been after the 19th of May, 1826, the date of the letter referred to in the memorandum itself, which was eight years after the date of the patent; nor is it known who made it, nor on what evidence it was made. Such a memorandum, being no part of the record itself, cannot be received to contradict the record.. It would be a very dangerous precedent to allow it to have that effect. It is not the record of any act of the department, nor of any document entitled'to registry in its archives. It is nothing .but a memorandum of a third person, and hearsay evidence at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As to the recital of the statute, whilst the recitals of public acts are regarded as evidence of the facts recited, it is otherwise, as we have seen, in reference to private acts. They are not evidence except against the parties who procure them.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The statute in question is a mere private act, and cannot be received as evidence, except as against the person who procured it, who was not Egerton, but his remote assignee under the Hart deed. It cau only be used as evidence against the person on whom it acts as an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the charge of the court below was erroneous, and that the judgment must be reversed, with directions to award a</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Venire de novo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\"> Elmondorff <em>v. </em>Carmichael, 3 Littell, 472, 480. 2 Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, 251.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 702, 748, ed. 1866.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> Coke Littleton, 352 b; 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 658 [584].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> 2 Phillips on Evidence, 106, 6th Am. ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
