In an action of ejectment, a letter of the plaintiff\u2019s grantor, written to the ancestor of the defendant, is not competent evidence to show that the ancestor entered'into possession under the license of the plaintiff's grantor, without some evidence that such letter was received or acted on about the time of such entry by the ancestor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-9\">2. A general objection that such letter is a declaration of the grantor of his own rights was sufficient.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-11\">3. If, in the appellate court, the party introducing such a letter relies on any special circumstances as an exception to the rule (as that it was part of the <em>resj/esfce), </em>that circumstance must appear in the bill of exceptions 'or by the record in some other manner. The admission will bo held to be erroneous unless this appears.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-13\">4. There' being no extrinsic evidence that the letter was ever received or acted on by the ancestor, the date found in the letter, though near the time of entry, is not sufficient evidence of that fact to justify its admission. The important fact being its receipt by the defendant\u2019s ancestor, at a particular time, cannot be established by the date found in the letter for the purpose of admitting the letter. The date would thus prove the letter, and the letter prove the date, without evidence that either was true.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-15\">5. When it is argued here that an error in the court below worked no injury to the party complaining, the fact that it worked no injury must be made to appear beyond question. If it is only to he seen by a mere preponderance of evidence, and the error is substantiated, the judgment must be reversed.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-17\">Error to the Supreme Court of tbe District of Columbia.

No one. of these' reasons is the one now urged before the court, to wit, .in effect that the letter was not written at the time when it bears date, andthat it was not received by Hamilton Smith. Is not the objection which was actually taken, to wit, that \u201c there was nothing to show the letter was <em>in response </em>to any letter written by Hamilton Smith, or that Hamilton Smith ever <em>replied </em>to it \u201d an implied admission that he had <em>received </em>it. \"Would any\" such specific, acute, far-fetched, and not very satisfactory objections as those two have been made, if it had been possible to make with truth the.one natural and conclusive objection, that no such letter had ever been really written iu 1845 to Hamilton Smith, or at least that he had never received any such letter? an objection' which would have rendered both these two reasons and indeed'all the others \u2014 no one of the whole seven being sound <em>even </em>if the letter had been inadmissible \u2014 superfluous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-7\">Suppose that I claim a house as owner.

Independently of this, it being necessary that the court should satisfy itself of any ' fact on which the admissibility of -the letter depended,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is to be presumed that proof of such necessary fact was made to the judge trying the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-6\">The letter being thus proved to have been received, the date of the letter, September 10th, 1845, is <em>prim\u00e1. fade </em>evidence of the time when it was written.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Moreover, the letter is part of the <em>res gestee </em>under which Hamilton Smith obtained his possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">Finally, if it was error in the court to admit the letter, it was not such an error as will warrant a reversal in this'case; because the admissions of Hamilton Smith, in his letters of 1856 <em>(supra, </em>pages 633, 634), to the effect that he held under and by permission of John Chandler Smith,- was conclusive against the adversary character of the possession set up as the defence against the admitted record title, and required the jury to find for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\"> Wright v.

Other and more specific grounds of objection were taken, but it is not necessary to mention them here, for it is certainly a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>sound principle of evidence that such a declaration as this, whether oral or in writing, is inadmissible, unless some exception to the general rule be shown. And this disposes of one of the arguments against the validity of the exception, namely, that while seven distinct objections are stated in the bill of exceptions, none of them are sound, though the letter may really have been inadmissible. We are of opinion that the one above mentioned is sufficient, unless the record \u25a0shows some matter which would obviate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u25a0 The objection is supposed to be removed by treating the letter as a part of the transaction by which Hamilton Smith obtained possession of the property, and thus coming withiu the rule of exceptional evidence admitted as part of the <em>res gestee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">But the difficulty is that there is no evidence that the letter <em>was </em>a part of that, transaction. The precise time when Hamilton Smith took possession is not stated, save that it was in 1845, and after the 28th of May. .The date found in the letter itself is relied on to show that it was written about the time possession was taken, and perhaps, if the other essential requisites were proven, the time would be near enough to let it go to the jury. But it is obvious that, as the date is only proved by the letter, the fact that the letter was written and received, must be proved before the date can be used to justify the admission of the letter. Many authorities are cited to show that, while the date found in an instrument may be disputed or disproved by other evidence, it is <em>primd fade </em>to be taken as the true date. All these cases, however, have reference to the case of an instrument which has been admitted in evidence on other and sufficient ground,, and where the true date has become important on some other issue than the admission of the letter. It is a most vicious example of reasoning in a circle, to admit the letter to prove the time w'hen it was written, and assume this to be the real date for the purpose .of admitting the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Another objection is, that there is nothing in the record to show that the letter was delivered to Hamilton Smith, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>was ever in Ills possession or acted upon by him. It is not shown how the plaintiff came into possession of it, or from what source it was produced by his counsel at the time of the trial. It wduld violate nothing found in the record to suppose that the letter was written and delivered to the plaintiff by its supposed author on the same day it was read in evidence. When a party seeks to' justify in a court of review the admission of such <em>ex parte </em>declarations of himself or his vendor, against the objection of the other side, he must show by the record some circumstance which would obviate the manifest soundness of the objection. '</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">It is said, however, that, conceding the letter to have be\u00e9n improperly admitted, there is enough found in the record to show that the verdict was right, if it had been excluded, and, therefore, its admission worked the defendants no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Two letters from Hamilton Smith to his brother are .relied on to show his admission, as late as 1856, that he held under that brother, and acknowledged his superior title. And it must be conceded that they have \u00e1 strong tendency to establish that proposition. \u25a0 But they are not conclusive; and, in the face of the statement that the defendants introduced parol evidence tending to show that Hamilton Smith entered under a parol gift of his father, it is impossible to say the letter worked no prejudice. ' This <em>parol </em>evidence is not given in the bill of exception, and may have been very strong. It is possible, nay, probable, that the jury, balancing between the weight-of the parol evidence on one side and the letters of Hamilton Smith on the oth\u00e9r, may have rested their verdict on this letter, as the best evidence of what really occurred at the time possession was taken. The jury might very well have said that, if this letter was written and received about the time the possession was taken \u2014 written by the man who had title to the land to the party about to enter into possession \u2014 they would presume that the latter entered on the premises under the permission given in the letter, while they might disregard the improvident admissions of a. weak-minded and dependent man made to his brother ten or twelve years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>We repeat tbe doctrine of this court laid down in <em>Deery </em>v. <em>Cray </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that while it is a sound principle that no judgment should be reversed on error when the .error complained of worked <em>no </em>injury to the party against whom the ruling was made, it must appear so clear as to be beyoiid doubt that the error did not and could not have prejudiced the right of the party. The case must be such that this court is not called on to decide upon the preponderance of evidence that the verdict was right, notwithstanding the error complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Other errors are assigned as to the charge of the court,1 but, as no exception was taken to that charge, it cannot be considered; nor do we deem the errors alleged as growing out of the prayers asked and refused likely to occur again, even if they are -fairly presented by the record now.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">For the error in admitting the letter objected to the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">New trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-9\">Mr. Justice DAVIS was absent at the argument.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-14\"> 5 Wallace, 795.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
