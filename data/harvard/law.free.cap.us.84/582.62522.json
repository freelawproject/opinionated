A vessel built in the British Province of Canada, but owned wholty by citizens of the United States, cannot under the Registry Act of 1792 (1 Stat. at Large, 287) be a vessel of the United States; nor can she he a foreign vessel truly and wholly belonging to citizens of Canada or of Great Britain. If, therefore, such a vessel bo engaged in transporting the products of Canada into ports of the United States, she may he forfeited under the act of March 1st, 1817 (8 Stat. at Large, 351), which enacts, under penalty of forfeiture, that \u201cno goods, wares, or merchandise shall be imported into the United States from any foreign port or place, except in vessels of the United States, or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to the citizens or subjects of that country of which the goods are the growth, production, or manufacture.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b606-8\">2.

That after the 30th day of September next, no goods, wares, or merchandise shall be imported into the United States from any foreign port or place, except in vessels of the United States, or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to the citizens or subjects of that country of which the goods are the growth, production, or manufacture; or from which such goods, wares, or merchandise can only be, or most .usually are, first shipped for transportation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201c Provided, <em>nevertheless, </em>That this regulation shall not extend to the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted, and which shall not adopt, a similar regulation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">A subsequent section of the latter act enacts that the vessel and cargo coming into the Uuited States, in violation of those provisions, shall be forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">In this condition of things \u2014 as appeared by the libel, information,-and answekhereafter mentioned \u2014 the bark Merritt, built in the province of Canada and within.the dominion of Great Britain, but wholly owned by citizens of tlie United States, was employed in transporting coal and iron, products of the said province of Canada, from the port of Kingston, in the province named, into the port of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-8\">Hereupon, a libel and information was filed in behalf of the United States alleging the facts above stated. One Murray, owner of the vessel, interposed as claimant, and not denying the allegations, answered, that at the time of the importations on account of which the proceedings were taken, neither the imperial government of Great Britain nor the Dominion of Canada<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had adopted any \u201c similar regulation\u201d to that contained in the above-quoted act of 1817; and that, therefore, the case was taken out of the statute by the proviso to it. This answer was excepted to as irrelevant; that is to say was, iir effect, demurred to; and the exception or demurrer being sustained by the court below, on an appeal from the District Court, the case was now brought here by Murray for review. The vessel had exhibited no papers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>Mr. N. J. Emmons, for the claimant, appellant in this court:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-10\">1st. If the Merritt is a <em>foreign </em>vessek-^-as she needs must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>be to bring her within the regulations of the act of 1817\u2014 she was either British or Canadian, it matters not which. As such, she would not be liable, falling- within the proviso to section one, \u201cthat this regulation shall not extend to <em>the vessel of any foreign nation which has not adopted and which shall not adopt a similar regulation</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-6\">The act of 1817 was intended to retaliate upon Great Britain her unfriendly legislation on the subject of it, commencing with her act of 12th Charles II, \u201cfor th\u00e9 encouraging and increasing shipping and navigation,\u201d and continued by numerous subsequent enactments, all of which were supposed to have been reserved in force by the convention between the United States and Great Britain of July 3d, 1815.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We could show, we think, if it would aid us, the unqualified repeal.by Parliament, long prior to the alleged offence, of all its legislation on the subject. Our. allegation of. fact is, that there was no regulation by either Great Britain or Canada \u201csimilar\u201d to that of our act of 1817; that, on the contrary, American vessels were freed and absolved from all such restraints. This averment, however, stands admitted by the exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-7\">2d. If the Merritt was not a <em>foreign </em>vessel, that is to say, a vessel to which no distinct nationality could be assigned, then she has been guilty of no infraction of the law. If by the act of transfer from British to American citizens, she was utterly denationalized, aud became a mere rover of the sea, without country, then she is not within the act of Congress. The act was not directed against such possible class of ships. It was not the mischief intended to be cured. We must have new legislation to forfeit a vessel thus circumstanced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>Mr. Solicitor- General S. F.

The Merritt is not <em>American,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2020nor 'is it British,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> nor Canadian.

They-may be imported in vessels of the United States; or,</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">2d. In such'foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to the citizens or subjects of the country of which the goods -are the production, or from which they are most usually first shipped for transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">. The claimant\u2019s answer does not bring him within either of these classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">1. The Merritt is not a vessel of the United States. The information alleged \u2014 it was not denied \u2014 and that is all that the ease contains upon the subject, \u2014 that the Merritt was the property of citizens of the United States, and that she was a foreign-built vessel. That she was owned by citizens of the United States did not make her a vessel of the United States. By the statute of 1792 only ships which have been registered in the manner therein prescribed shall be denominated or deemed vessels of the United States, entitled to the benefits or privileges appertaining to such ships. There is no allegation that the Merritt had been so registered. Indeed, she could not have been under the provisions of the act last referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">2. The cargo of the Merritt was iron and lumber, the production of the British provinces of Canada, while her owners were citizens of the United States. She did not, therefore, come within the second description of the statute of 1817, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>as.a foreign vessel truly and wholly belonging to citizens of the country of which the cargo was the growth or production. On the contrary, it is conceded by the pleadings that her owners were American citizens. The Merritt, therefore, falls within 'the prohibition of the act, and is liable to forfeiture. She was neither a vessel of the United States nor a foreign vessel, wholly belonging to citizens of the country of. which her cargo was the production.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">But the claimant seeks the benefit of the proviso of the act, viz.\u2019: \u201c That this regulation shall not extend to the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted, and shall not adopt,-a similar regulation.\u201d He-alleges that neither the kingdom of Great Britain nor the province of Canada has adopted similar regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The case does not show that the Merritt has any of the evidences of being a British ship. She produces no register, or certificate, or document of any kind to entitle her to make that claim. The fact that she is foreign-built does not prove it. Proof even that she was built in Great Britain would not establish it. Pirates and rovers may issue from the most peaceful and most friendly ports. The documents a vessel carries furnish the only evidence of her nationality.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Of these the Merritt is entirely destitute, so far as the case shows. IT'hcre is nothing, therefore, to bring her within the terms of the proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> See 1 Parsons on Shipping and Admiralty, 26, 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
