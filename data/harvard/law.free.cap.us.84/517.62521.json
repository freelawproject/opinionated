C. This was apparently decided under the act of July 13th, 1861, prohibiting and making unlawful <em>\u201c </em>all commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of any State proclaimed to be in a state of insurrection against the United States, and the citizens of the rest of the United States, so long as such condition of hostility should continue;\u201d and the act of July 2dj 1864, making the prohibition applicable to all commercial intercourse to persons being within districts within the lines of National military occupation in such States.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>2. <em>Held </em>further, the full consideration-money of the purchase having been paid, that the vendor could not sustain a suit in the Court of Claims for the proceeds of the cotton, for the use of the vendee; that the vendor was not entitled to sue for himself, because he had been paid in full; nor entitled to sue for his vendee, because the sale was unlawful and void.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">Appeal from the CouVt of Claims; the case as found by that court was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\">Cutner, a loyal citizen of the United States, resident at Savannah, Georgia, one of the States which went into rebellion, was, on the 21st of December, 1864, the owner of thirty bales of cotton. On the day just named Savannah was captured b}' the army of the United States. On the 23d of February,1865, Cutner reported his cotton to the commanding officer, and it was registered-, incompliance with general military orders, by the Treasury agents in his name; and on the 3d of March following taken into the custody of the Treasury agents of the United'States and shipped to New York, and 'there sold by the United States; the net \u00a1iroeeeds, amounting to $6897, being paid into the Treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">On the 6th of March, 1865, Cutner-executed a bill of sale of the cotton specifically, and describing it as \u201c all that certain lot and quantity of cotton, viz., thirty bales of cotton, marked S.

However the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sale is described in the bill of sale, the property sold was a claim against the United States for thirty bales of cotton or the proceeds of them, and, as a matter of course, was situated at the seat of government. Then the purchasers weres. loyal citizens of a loyal State, and being such, could not be presumed to have intended to send the fruits of such contract to the aid \u00f3f the insurrectionary government, even if it were possible (which it was not) to have obtained the subject-matter of the trade from the government before sale thereof.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Messrs.

The State of Georgia, in which Savannah was, had been declared by a proclamation of the President, \u201c in a state of insurrection against the United States.\u201d Though occupied by our. forces, the \u201c state of hostility still continued.\u201d The case comes, therefore, within the act of July 13th, 1861. It comes also within the later act of July 2d, 1864; for the sale and purchase \u2014 the \u201ccommercial dealing\u201d \u2014 was made \u201c with each other \u201d'by and between parties \u201cbeing within districts within the lines of National military occupation, in a State declared in insurrection.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 257.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-15\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 1262.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b543-16\"> 13 Id. 376, \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b544-8\">,Mr. Justice BKADLEY</author>\n<p id=\"At3\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Intercourse between the inhabitants of the two belligerent sections was still prohibited when this sale was made. It was, therefore, clearly illegal, unless Schiffer &amp; Co. had a license to trade in Savannah, which the case expressly finds they had not. The sale being illegal, the suit cannot be sustained for the benefit of the vendees. It cannot be sustained for Cutner\u2019s own'benefit, because he received the full consideration of the cotton and has no interest- remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Decree affirmed. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
