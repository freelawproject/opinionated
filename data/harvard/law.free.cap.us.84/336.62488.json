He denied that he was in anywise remiss \u25a0or negligent of his duties as trustee, or that he had anything \u25a0to do with the sale of the negroes or other personalty.

The bill giving -as an excuse for not instituting proceedings sooner, that Beale had from time to time put the complainants off with promises of settlement; that having married their half-sister, \u201che took advantage of that relationship to abuse the confidence which the relationship naturally inspired, and to turn the same to his own pecuniary interest aud advantage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">The answer denied the breach of trust, and while alleging that the transactions narrated in the bill, so far as they were founded in truth, occurred nearly forty years before, aud before the respondent was born, and consequently that she could have no personal knowledge of the circumstances, yet set forth a narrative of facts which tended to show that the waste of the property was committed solely by Mrs. Berry, and that Beale had used his efforts to prevent it, and did finally arrest it, but not until most of the personal property had been made away with. It stated that the farm, and what trust property remained, had prior to 1834 been sold by order of the court, by trustees duly appointed, and the proceeds distributed. It denied that Beale ever made the admissions, promises, and excuses alleged in the bill, or that the complainants ever asserted against him in his lifetime the claim now made or any claim; and asserted coutrariwise that the cpipplainants had received all that they were euti-' tied to, aud that their husbands had used what money they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>had, and left them, in widowhood, dependent on their relatives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The answer set up also certain special defences as\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The suit against Beale in the County Cdurt of Prince George\u2019s County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">The statute of limitation [three years in the District], and independently of it the laches and lapse of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">The testimony chiefly relied on by the complainants ivas that of Mrs. Hume, one of the complainants; of a white witness named Douglass, of another, named Brashears, and of two old colored servants, Johnson and Brooks, who had been on the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">The testimony of Mrs. Hume was rec\u00e9ived'under the act of Congress of July 2d, 1864,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which enacts that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-10\">\u201cIn courts-of the United States there shall be no exclusion of any witness ... in civil actions, because he is a party to or interested in the issue joined;\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-11\">no objection having been raised to it, so far as appeared by the record, under the act of March 3d, 1865,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> amenflatory to the said act, which amendatory act provides\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-12\"><em>\u201c </em>That in actions by or against executors, administrators, or guardians, in which judgment may bo rendered for or against them, neither party shall be allowed to testify against the o.ther as to any transaction with or statement by the testator, intestate or ward, linless called to testify by the opposite party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-13\">.Mrs. Hume testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-14\">\u201c After my grandfather Berry\u2019s death, in 1827, the property commenced to- go. It went by degrees. -From 1828 to the\u2019 summer of 1830. everything was spent'except some old negroes: They Avero sold by my.mother and Mr.-Beale. The real estate was sold by commissioners- appointed by the court. My husband received my portion in person. Mr. Beale paid me my sister\u2019s portion in driblets. He never paid me anything else. I called upon him repeatedly to settle his trusteeship. Three or four years before his death, \u2019most every time I saw him, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>asked him for a settlement, and told him my inability to live. I told him my situation, and told him it was very destitute. These conversations occurred almost every time I saw him. I told him almost every week, when I saw him, that it was high time to make a settlement. He did not give me any money, and he never made any settlement. He made a great many promises, and that is all. The reason I.never instituted this suit before was he made so many promises from time to time that he would settle. He never made me any payments at all outside of the $3000 which he received as my share of the proceeds of the farm. At the conversations I.have spoken of, about a settlement, no one was present but .ourselves. He never talked before third persons unless they were interested. I occasionally wrote to Mr. Beale, and he answered my letters. In his letters he never spoke anything of the wasted property. I never wrote to him about any of it, except some servants that Otho Beale bought, and Mr. Beale (for mo) brought suit to recover them. I always thought that Mr. Beale got part of the money that the personal estate sold for. My husband thought Mr. Beale had done very wrong. He was himself a lawyer. He spoke to mo in his lifetime, in 1834 or 1835, of bringing a suit, and asked'mo to join him. I told him it was of no use, as Mr. Beale was poor and wo could make nothing out of him at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">\u201cI never'was present when any negroes were sold. I never saw any money paid by the traders for them. My mother had some negroes which came by her mother\u2019s (Mrs. Lane\u2019s) estate. Mrs. Lane was rich. They came to her before her marriage with my father, Mr. Berry, Jr. They were made over to my half-brother and to Mrs. Beale, my half-sister.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">Douglass, who testified that he had owed some money to Mr. Beale, said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">\u201c Mr. Beale was pressing me for the money. He said that he owed these ladies (half-sisters of his wife) some money, and that he wanted the money for them. These conversations ran through a number of years, to the day that I settled with him. Ho said that he wanted $5000. I, do not remember that he mentioned real estate to me. He told me that the way he became indebted to the ladies was that he had charge of their money, and had borrowed it. He said that he must raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>money from me or sell his house to raise it. In speaking of these ladies, I think he mentioned one of them as Berry: he simply used the name of Berry.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">Brashears testified only that be lived on an adjoining farm and knew Beale; that when Beale was appointed trustee, he was regarded as poor, and that he afterwards owned a house in which he lived; that he thought Beale had exercised control over the farm from the time he was married; and that <em>\u201c </em>the property on it was pretty generally on the travel from the time Mrs. Berry moved to Washington till it was all sold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">One of the old slaves, Brooks, testified thus :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">\u201cMr. Bealo bad no property, before, he was married, but a house. After the deed of trust was given and Mr. Beale got the property in his own hands ho was like the groen bay tree by the river of water. .He spread out \u2014 he got everything he wanted. He had control as a master over everything; to sell or not to sell, as he pleased. If-he chose to do anything, Mrs. Berry could not stop him. I never saw him do anything, because I was not present, but I know ho disposed of all the property. I never saw him take away any of the property; I <em>mean, </em>saw him sell any, and I never saw-him'receive any money for it. The only way that I know he sold the slaves was that I missed them, and as thej- could not be sold by law without his consent, I believe he sold them. I know it must have been done by his consent, because nobody else could have done it. He was the guardian of the children. Before Mrs. Berry moved to Washington, she lived in very handsome stylo and had plenty of everything. She was rich.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">The other negro, Johnson, testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\">\u201c As far as I know, Mrs. Berry and Mr. Beale were hand-inglovo, and between them they sold the colored people; somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five; not one was left to tell the tale. Mr. Beale would come down from Washington once or twice a week. I don\u2019t know who received any of the money for the negroes. I have seen the negro-traders there often. Mr. Beale would bring them down there from the city, and have the negroes hiding about like young rabbits. And I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>have often heard the servants say that they thought <em>Mr. Beale ought to interfere and protect the children. </em>I never knew'him to interfere to prevent them being sold. He only told me that he would see that I was not sold to Georgia. My wife belonged to him. She came from old Mrs.-Lane. I never saw Mr. Beale have any possession of any of the servants, except when any of them were to be sold, when, of course, he always had a-hand in it. There were only two oid.men and two old women, three or four house servants, and myself left on the farm after\u2019 Mrs. Berry came to Washington. I flow the track; they sold me running. I think one of the old ones that were left was after-wards sold to a brother of old Mr. Berry. Mrs. ELeanor Berry had no property when she married young Mr. Berry. His father gave him the farm, and stock, and servants, and let him have it to make what ho could, but gave him- no title to it, or any of it, <em>because his wife had the reputation of being an extravagant woman, and he was fearful that the children might come to want.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">Certain letters were introduced by the defendants from Mrs. Hume to Mr. Beale, by way of discrediting her testimony.

It is not pretended that any settlement of Beale\u2019s trusteeship was ever made. No account was ever rendered to the court, or anywhere else, by Beale. A large amount of personal property came to his hands. The deed of trust vested the legal title to all of the property in him, and Mrs. Berry had nothing but the <em>use </em>under said deed. That Beale profited by it is shown by the testimony of Mrs. Hume, and of Johnson and Brooks, old family servants. That ho acknowledged his obligation, and promised to pay, is shown by the testimony of Mrs. Hume and of-Douglass. The case is one where two dependent females, sisters-in-law to the trustee, looked to him, leaned upon him, and trusted him to take care of the estate which had been left them by their grandfather. They, of course, were reluctant to believe that their brother-in-law would wrong them, and his repeated promises doubtle\u00e9s kept them from calling him to a settlement in court long ago.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">Under such a state of facts, neither the lapse of time nor statute of limitations can avail. The principle settled by this court in <em>Michoud </em>v. <em>Girod,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rules the case. . In that case the court, speaking of the acquiescence of parties like the complainants here, say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">\u201cWe can only see in their conduct the fears and foi-bearance of dependent relatives, far distant from the scenes of the transactions of which they complain, desirous of having what was due to them, and suspecting it'liad been withheld, but unwilling to believe that they had been wronged by brothers with whom they had been associated in a common interest by another brother who was dead. In a case of actual fraud courts of equity give relief after a long lapse of time, much longer than has passed since the executors in this instance purchased their testator\u2019s estate. In general, length of time is no bar to a trust clearly established to have once existed; and where fraud is imputed and proved length of time ought not to exclude i\u2019elief.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Messrs.

Consider that testimony. If Mr. Beale was speaking of what he owed Mrs. Hume and Mrs. Crosby, in their own right, he would have used their names, and not have used the name of Berry, which they had laid aside years before; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>he would have had no occasion to speak of owing any one named Berry at all. Mr. Beale, \u201c said he had charge of their money, and borrowed it.\u201d That was the'way in which he owed Miss Rosalie, and that certainly was <em>not </em>the way in which he owed the complainants. If he owed <em>them </em>anything, it was because he had fraudulently sold their slaves, and not because he had borrowed their money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">That the laches were gross; the lapse of time in connection with the death of the party charged with mal-administratiou, conclusive. <em>In.

In any aspect of\u2019the case, there has been such gross laches on the part of the <em>ceslui que trusts </em>that they have disentitled themselves to the relief which they seek to obtain. It is an .established rule with, courts of equity, independent of any statute limiting the time in which suits can be brought, that they will not entertain stale demands. This rule is necessary from considerations of public policy, and because it is impossible to do entire justice when the transactions sought to be impeached have become obscure by lapse of time, and the evidence on the subject is liable to be lost. Story, referring to the rule imposing diligence upon parties seeking relief, says: \u201cHence, if there be a clear breach of trust by a trustee; yet, if the <em>cestui que trust </em>or beueficiary has fora longtime acquiesced in the misconduct of the trustee, with full knowledge of it, a court of equity will not relieve him, but leave him to bear the fruits bf his own negligence or infirmity of purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">This rule, requiring the party injured to seek redress in reasonable time, ha's so often received the sanction of courts of equity in this country and England, that it is unnecessary to cite authorities to sustain it! Whether the lapse of time is sufficient to bar a recovery must, of necessity, depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">By the terms of the deed in this case, the interest of Mrs. Berry in the property terminated on her marriage or death, and if the eldest child was of age or married, on the happening of either of these events the entire trust ceased, and the trustee was directed'to convey the estate, real and personal, to the children and their heirs. It is alleged that Mrs. Berry was married to Owings in 1830. If this were so, it would account for her conduct in converting the personal pi\u2019operty to her use, but the evidence on the subject of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ma.mag.e, although rendering it highly probable that it did \u2022 occur, is-insufficient to establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It is conceded, however, that she was married to Ferguson in 1843, at which time the eldest child was not only of full age, but had been married and was then a widow. These occurrences, according to the terms of the deed, terminated the trust,.but in point of fact it was terminated in 1834 or 1836, when the real estate was sold by .order of the Priuce George\u2019s County Court. This sale is- set up in the answer, and Mrs. Hume testifies that the farm was sold by commissioners appointed by the court, and that her. husband, in 1836, received from them in person, her share of the proceeds. -It is in evidence that Mrs. .Crosby was married in 1844, and she must have arrived at full age before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">It thus appears that all grounds of action, existing in this case, must have occurred between twenty and thirty years ago, and that the alleged breach of trust for which the estate of Beale is asked to account took place thirty-seven years before the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Why have these complainants slept-upon their rights for-this great length of time, and why have they delayed invoking the aid of a. court of equity until the person charged with misconduct is dead? It is plain this unusual delay places-them on the defensive, and requires satisfactory explanation before they can obtain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">It is alleged in the bill as an excuse for not suing earlier that Beale put the complainants off from time to time with promises to settle his trusteeship, and did not deuy that be was largely indebted to them on that account. This allegation receives support only in the testimony of Mrs. Hume, who had no right to testify as to any conversation or-transaction with the decedent unless the opposite party or the-court wished her to do it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This rule of exclusion was imposed by Congress in the interest of dead men\u2019s estates, but as the record does not disclose any objection to.the competency of the witness her testimony will be treated as if right<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>fully given. She says, in general terms, that she called on Beale repeatedly to settle, and that he promised to do\u2019so, and that these promises induced her not to sue him. This is the extent of her testimony on the subject, and her statement is so general and so obviously necessary to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations and of lapse of time, which were pleaded, that it carries little weight with it. It would never do to hold that a stale demand of such long standing could have vitality imparted to it, on the mere statement of a party in interest that the decedent promised to settle. There must be some corroborating circumstances to call into activity the powers of a court of equity, and these are wholly wanting in this case. No one was ever present at any of these conversations, and there is no specification of time or place, nor does she say that Beale ever admitted any indebtedness on accouut of this trust. Besides, she never wrote to him, nor did he ever write to her on the subject, which is a little remarkable, considering her destitute situation from 1837 to the commencement of this suit. Indeed, the letters which she did write to him in 1837 and 1846 are inconsistent with the idea that she thought he intended to defraud her, which she now says she always entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">There is nothing in the record except this testimony that tends even to show that Beale ever admitted he was chargeable for the wrongful conversion of the property in question. He expressly disclaims this liability in the Maryland suit in 1830, and the court could not have rendered the decree it did without being satisfied at least that he was not personally concerned in the waste of the property. It is hard to believe, on the unsupported testimony of a party in interest, that Beale at different times during a long life confessed a liability which he repudiated on the occasion of that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">It is a little singular that Beale should have confined his promises to Mrs. Hume, and not extended them to Mrs. Crosby. Mrs. Crosby does not testify, and we do not learn that either herself or husband, with whom she lived for thirteen years, ever manifested disapprobation of Beale\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>duct. If the other sist\u00e9r,- Rosalie', who died unmarried in 1860, considered Beale had wronged her, she would not have intrusted him, as she did, with the management of her share of the money received from the sale of the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">There is one other point in connection with the testimony of Mrs. Hume- worthy of comment. She swears that, in 1834 or 1835, she advised her husband against suing Beale, for the reason that he was poor and nothing could be made out of him, and that her husband used to lend Beale money and supersede his debts for him. If this be so, the theory on which this case is prosecuted falls to the ground, for the whole effort is to show that Beale got so rich immediately after the conversion of the personal estate that he must have shared the proceeds. It is argued that the conversations which Beale had with Douglass refer to the obligations arising from his breach of trust, and that, therefore, Mrs. Hume is sustained by the testimony of Douglass. But manifestly Beale is not talking on this subject; he is talking about the. sum of $3000 which Miss Rosalie Berry got from the sale of the farm and placed in his hands to loan. This money he owed the estate of Miss Berry, and was desirous of paying to her next of kin, Mrs. Hume and Mrs. Crosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">It is needless to pursue the subject further. If Beale was guilty of misconduct in his character of trustee, the complainants had full knowledge of it and acquiesced in it for a great length of timej and there is nothing shown in the evidence to overcome the decisive influence of this knowledge and acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> Harwood <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., supra, 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> 15 Stat. at Large, 533.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
