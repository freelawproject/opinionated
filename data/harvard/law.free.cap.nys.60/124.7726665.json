It is conceded that the services of the plaintiff in disposing of defendant\u2019s farm were rendered, that the farm was sold pursuant to the negotiations made by the plaintiff, and that there was an agreement, either expressed/or clearly implied, that he should be compensated for his services. The referee has found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>services of the plaintiff were worth $200; and while the pleadings allege a contract to pay a certain sum per acre, amounting to much more than the referee has found, the finding of the referee for a smaller sum, based upon a different calculation, does not justify this court in reversing the judgment, and the pleadings may be deemed to'have been amended to conform to the facts as established by the evidence. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s contract was for a certain sum per acre of the property disposed of, or whether his compensation was to be measured by a certain per cent, of the amount realized, or whether he was to have a reasonable amount for his services, is not very material. That he was entitled to compensation is clear, and, the amount fixed by the referee not being excessive, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
