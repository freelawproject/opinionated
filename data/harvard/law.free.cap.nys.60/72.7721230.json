Judgment is directed to be entered in accordance with the foregoing conclusion of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-20\">Dated July 17, 1899. Truman K. Fuller, Referee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-21\">The following is the opinion of the referee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-22\">It appeared upon the trial that Lemon Thomson, one of the firm, had died pending the action; whereupon it was ordered that the pleadings be amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>in that regard, and, deeming them to be so amended, the trial proceeded against the remaining members as survivors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">This action is brought to procure an injunction permanently restraining the defendants, the one from doing, and the other from permitting, any interference with the natural outflow of the waters of Big Moose Lake, upon the ground that such interference would work irreparable injury to the lands of the plaintiff, and for such damages as he may have sustained by reason thereof. No damages were proved. The defendants answer separately,\u2014the firm admitting that, when the complaint was served, they were engaged in building a dam at the outlet of Big Moose Lake, in township 8, with the permission of the other defendant; and alleging that all that part of township 41, Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, which is wet by the waters of Big Moose Lake, lies in Hamilton county, and belongs to the Nehasane Park Association; or, in other words, that the plaintiff owns no land which would be touched by their interference with the waters of Big Moose Lake.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">The proposition is self-evident that if the plaintiff owns no land which surrounds Big Moose Lake and would be affected by the proposed interference with its waters, and has no possession of any which would be thus affected, he is not entitled to the injunction prayed for; and the converse of this proposition is equally true,\u2014if he does own such land, or has such possession, he is entitled to the restraining order and judgment of this court; for I must hold, upon what appears to me to be the overwhelming weight of evidence in the case, on this branch of it, that the proposed interference with the outflow of the waters of Big Moose Lake does and would injure the lands surrounding it at its easterly end, and surrounding the bays and inlets of said lake in that quarter. I regard this fact as amply proved, and scarcely contradicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">It was incumbent on the plaintiff, therefore, in the first instance, to establish his ownership by unassailable muniments of title. There is no question of possession that intervenes. To do this, the plaintiff offers in evidence a comptroller\u2019s deed to Baker Woodruff, dated April 17, 1874, purporting to convey \u201cTotten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, township 41, all thereof in the county of Herkimer, being 2,250 acres, more or less,\u201d and follows this by a deed from Baker Woodruff and wife to himself, dated December 25, 1883, purporting to convey the same premises. For years it has been considered by the comntroller\u2019s office, and by parties interested, that there were at least 2,250 acres (more or less) of the Totten and Crossfield purchase, township 41, located in the county of Herkimer, and I find such to be the fact. I find this fact, however, upon disputed evidence. And this leads me to remark that, from the evidence in this case, it is manifestly the duty of the state to complete the survey begun by Superintendent Colvin (the appropriation for which became exhausted before said survey was completed) to establish and locate upon the land the boundary line between the counties of\u2019 Herkimer and Hamilton, in order that citizens who are dealing in land in said counties near the supposed boundary line may know exactly where said boundary line isl. Contrary to what I find to be the fact, some of the witnesses (surveyors) locate said boundary line in such place as to carry the entire tract known as \u201cTotten and Crossfield\u2019s Purchase,\u201d township 41, into, and make it a part of, the county of Hamilton, thus annihilating the title of the plaintiff, whose description reads, \u201ctownship 41, Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, all thereof in the county of Herkimer,\u201d and also the title of his grantor, Woodruff. That the boundary line between the counties of Herkimer and Hamilton runs in such a manner as to accomplish this result is too improbable to be believed, especially in the light of the long course of action of the comptroller\u2019s office in reference thereto, and from the records, maps, and surveys on file in the various state offices for the guidance of the land department of the state. After the most untiring research of counsel, made evident upon this trial, the plaintiff is forced to allege in his complaint, and the defendants admit in their answers, that the boundary line between those two counties has never been legally located; thus rendering all descriptions of land bordering thereon indefinite and uncertain, to the confusion of buyers, sellers, and even the owners thereof. Thus, again, is furnished a criticism, if not an animadversion, upon that department of the state government whose duty it is to establish and locate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>boundary lines of counties, so that the citizens of the state may take due notice thereof and govern themselves accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">I come now to the examination of plaintiff\u2019s title, founded, as it is, upon the Baker Woodruff deed. This deed bears date December 25, 1883. In turn, Woodruff\u2019s title is based upon a comptroller\u2019s deed bearing date April 17, 1874. The sale which ultimated in this latter deed took place in 1871. The unpaid taxes which formed the basis of this sale seem to have been those which were assessed by the commissioners appointed by chapter 347, Laws 1853, entitled \u201cAn act to construct certain roads, from the settlements in Lewis county to Brown\u2019s tract in Herkimer county.\u201d This act appointed Lyman R. Lyon and Francis Segur as commissioners, and transferred to them the powers theretofore conferred upon the commissioners of highways of this state by the act of April 24, 1835, over the lands specified in section 2 of said act. That section gives the lands over which the jurisdiction of the commissioners is extended. It is deemed best to notice with particularity liow those lands are described: (1) \u201cAll that part of Brantingham tract, in the county of Lewis, lying east of the west line of lots numbers 12, 30, 48, 66, 84, 102, 120, 138, 156, 174, 192, 210, 228, 246, 266, 283, 300, 316, 332, and 347.\u201d (2) \u201cAlso all of Brown\u2019s tract, consisting of eight townships, numbers 1 to 8, inclusive, lying in the counties of Lewis, Herkimer, and Hamilton, excepting the subdivision lots in towns 3 and 4.\u201d It is seen, therefore, that, when the legislature intended to make an exception of lands, they employed appropriate language to do it. (3) \u201cAlso all of townships 1, 2, 3, and 4, Moose river tract, in the counties of Herkimer and Hamilton.\u201d (4) \u201cAlso all of townships 4, 5, 6, 7, and 41, of Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, in the county of Hamilton.\u201d This is a mistake. They are not all located in the county of Hamilton. The first four are located entirely in that county, and by far the larger portion of the fifth; but there is a small triangular portion of lot 41 located in Herkimer county. Did the legislature know that, or did not they think of it? Or did they intend to except from the jurisdiction of the commissioners that triangle of 2,250 acres? I do not think they did. If they had, they would have said so. They knew how, as the act shows. Those words, \u201cin the county of Hamilton,\u201d are about 19-20ths true and l-20th error, in locating those townships of the Totten and Crossfield purchase; but that slight error does not imply an exemption from the jurisdiction of the commissioners. It has never been so regarded by them, nor by the comptrollers of the state. Exhibits before me show that this very triangle, lying in Herkimer county, 2,250 acres of the Totten and Crossfield purchase, township 41, was assessed by the commissioners nine days only after the passage of the act appointing them (to wit, June 8, 1853), their first assessment bearing date June 17, 1853, and was continuously assessed by them every year thereafter, down to and including the year 1865, and the taxes paid during all those years, excepting three, without any question ever having been raised, so far as I see from the evidence Defare me, that such tax was illegally assessed for want of jurisdiction in the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">Again, no reason appears why this triangle should be exempted. On the contrary, ample reason appears why it should not be,\u2014why it was not, and was not intended to be, exempt. It lies in the midst of the improvements sought to be made by the building of the roads provided for by the act. On the east, south, and west it is surrounded by lands set apart for this improvement, and at least two townships of Brown\u2019s tract extend much further north than the triangle. There are no subdivision lots in it, that have been called to my attention, which require local highway improvements as a basis for such exemption; and I am forced to find, not only from the language of the statute, but from all the surroundings of the case, in this part of it, that the said triangle was not exempted, but was legally assessed by the commissioners. The tax sale of 1871 was for the nonpayment of these special road taxes for the years 1861, 1868, and 1864. Nothing beyond what has been above considered, relating to the wording of the statute, has appeared in criticism of the sale of 1871, and the deed in 1874 based upon it, except that in the year 1864 the assessment roll was signed only by one commissioner, the other having resigned. This defect, if it is one, is not jurisdictional, but goes only to the regularity of the proceeding. This was cured by chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ter 434 of the Laws of 1865, the next year. Section 2 of said act says: \u201cIn case of the resignation, death, disability or refusal to serve of either of said commissioners, any assessment roll, report or receipt for moneys received under said act (1853-1859) made by one commissioner shall be as valid and legal as if signed by both commissioners; and the assessment roll made and signed by one of the commissioners for the year 1854, is hereby declared to be valid and legal the same as if signed by both commissioners.\u201d \u201c1854\u201d should read \u201c1864\u201d; for the records show that every assessment roll from 1853 to 1865, inclusive, was signed by two commissioners, except in the single year 18G4. This was an evident blunder of the legislature or the copyist; but the curative properties of the act must be applied to the year which needed curing, if any, and not to the one wherein the assessment roll was signed all right by both commissioners. The records show that the assessment roll for the year 1854 was signed by both commissioners, showing an evident error in the curative statute as to the year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">These views lead to the conclusion that the tax sale of 1871, resulting in the comptroller\u2019s deed of 1874 to Baker Woodruff, was legal and valid, and conferred upon Mr. Woodruff a good title in fee, to be defeated only by some subsequent, and not by any antecedent, claim; and the conveyance by Baker Woodruff and wife to Aaron Lloyd of the same premises received by him from the comptroller, to wit, \u201cTotten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, township 41, all thereof in the county of Herkimer, being 2,250 acres, more or loss,\u201d in 1883, vests in Aaron Lloyd the same title, subject only to similar defeat. I hold that the title of the plaintiff to the lands in question rests wholly upon the Baker Woodruff deed, conveying to him the \u201cTotten &amp; Crossfield purchase, T. 41, all thereof in Herkimer Co., being 2,250 acres, more or less.\u201d This, I hold, is a good title to-day, and is not impaired by any previously existing titles; for they were all wiped out by the sale of 1871 to Woodruff, whose title was duly conveyed to the plaintiff in 1883. I have reached the foregoing conclusions only after a very careful review of the evidence given before me on the trial of this case, after a careful examination of the numerous exhibits furnished me by both sides, and after a patient study of the somewhat voluminous briefs of counsel, both old and new, with an examination of many of the authorities cited. As a result of these conclusions, I find that the plaintiff, Aaron Lloyd, is the owner of \u201cTotten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, township 41, all thereof in Herkimer county, being 2,250 acres, more or less,\u201d and is entitled to a judgment permanently restraining the defendants, their officers, agents, servants, and employ\u00e9s, from interfering with the outflow of the waters of Big Moose Lake, by dam or otherwise, and from permitting any such interference, together with the costs and disbursements of this action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-5\">Theodore F.
