The complaint contained three causes of action. The defendant answered each cause of action separately. Each answer contained first a general denial, and then an allegation \u201cthat, before the commencement of this action, the defendant satisfied and discharged by payment any and all claim or claims which the plaintiff had at any time heretofore against her.\u201d After the service of the answer, the plaintiff demanded a bill of particulars of the specific defenses of payment, and, that demand not being complied with, a motion was made to compel the service of a bill of particulars as to those defenses. The motion having been granted, this appeal is taken from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">We think the motion was improperly granted. The obvious purpose of the application was to limit the defendant in making proof of her defenses of payment. Ordinarily, when a defense is pleaded, a bill of particulars will not be granted. Moody v. Belden (Sup.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 119. The mere fact that the plaintiff does not know the nature of the payment is not sufficient to take this case out of the general rule. The office of a bill of particulars is not to compel the disclosure by a party of the nature of his proof, or the names of witnesses, or to disclose the case relied on, or the proof to support it. Higenbotam v. Green, 25 Hun, 214. The cases referred to in the memorandum of the judge who granted this motion do not apply. In each of these cases a good reason was shown why the bill of particulars should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
