J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aly\">On the 14th day of October, 1898, the plaintiff herein obtained an attachment against the property of the defendant upon the ground that the defendant was keeping himself concealed for the purpose of avoiding the service of the summons in this action. On the same day James McOreery, Thomas Rosevear, and James Crawford McOreery, the appellants herein, also obtained an attachment against the property of the said Flynn. The attaching parties seized the same property, the levy of the plaintiff thereunder being prior to that of the appellants. Subsequently the appellants obtained a judgment in their action, issued an execution thereunder, and levied upon the property previously taken under the attachments aforesaid. Thereafter the appellants, as judgment creditors, obtained an order to show cause why an order should not be made vacating the attachment obtained by the plaintiff herein upon the ground, among others, \u201cthat no sufficient cause of action for which an attachment could issue is shown to exist by the papers whereon the said warrant was granted, to show to the satisfaction of the justice granting the same that a cause of action existed in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, and upon the further-ground that the said papers do not show that said plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum claimed, over and above all counterclaims known tb the plaintiff, and that no assignment to the plaintiff, or delivery of the merchandise alleged to have been sold by the assignors, is shown in said papers.\u201d The order was returnable at a special term of the city court on the 2Gth day of October, 1898, and the motion was denied, and the order denying the same was subsequently affirmed by the general term of the city court, from which last-named order this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The appellants herein had a lien upon the property of the defendant by virtue of their levy under the execution issued upon their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>judgment, and were therefore in a position to attack the plaintiff\u2019s attachment. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 682; Bank v. Alberger, 75 N. Y. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The plaintiff sues upon a claim for goods sold and delivered and' alleged to have been assigned to him by the firm of Schutte &amp; Abbes. The facts stated by the plaintiff in his application as constituting a cause of action against the defendant, and the assignment thereof to the plaintiff, are embodied in the affidavits of H. D. Schutte and of the plaintiff himself. Schutte testifies \u201cthat he is a member of the firm of Schutte &amp; Abbes, and that deponent\u2019s firm sold to the above-named defendant, between May 26 and August 1, 1898, goods, wares, and merchandise, at prices agreed upon, and of the value of $311.66; that there are -no payments, counterclaims, or set-offs against said indebtedness.\u201d The plaintiff swears that \u201cthe defendant is indebted to deponent in the sum of $311.66 over and above all payments, counterclaims, and set-offs, as near as they are known to deponent, and as more fully appears from the affidavit of Henry D. Schutte, which is hereto annexed; and plaintiff begs leave to refer to his complaint, which is hereto annexed, and made a part hereof.\u201d It will be observed that the affidavit of Schutte contains no averment of the delivery of the goods- sold, nor that the claim thereon was due or owing to his firm, nor that any assignment thereof had been made. The affidavit of the plaintiff refers to the affidavit of Schutte only for the purpose of showing that the sum of $311.66 is \u201cover and above all payments, counterclaims, and set-offs.\u201d All the allegations of the complaint to which reference is made by the plaintiff are stated to be made \u201cupon information and belief\u201d only, and do not state the source of the information nor the grounds of belief. Affidavits made for the purpose of obtaining an attachment against the property of a debtor, containing these defects, have repeatedly been held to be insufficient, and attachments issued thereunder vacated and set aside. Hoormann v. Cycle Co., 9 App. Div. 579, 41 N. Y. Supp. 710; Belmont v. Iron Co., 12 App. Div. 441, 42 N. Y. Supp. 122; Einstein v. Cycle Co., 18 Misc. Rep. 88, 41 N. Y. Supp. 837; Acker v. Saynisch (Sup.) 56 N. Y. Supp. 1025. \u201cThe writ of attachment being the exercise of an extraordinary power, the right to it depends upon a strict compliance with the statute.\u201d Lacker v. Dreher, 38 App. Div. 75, 55 N. Y. Supp. 979. If, from a reading of the complaint, an inference could fairly be drawn that the statements therein were made from personal knowledge, it might be said to be sufficient. Crowns v. Vail, 51 Hun, 204, 4 N. Y. Supp. 324. But the averments therein are expressly alleged to be made upon information and belief, and the plaintiff does not furnish the slightest reason for not presenting the affidavits of the persons from whom his information must have been obtained. On the contrary, he presents the court with an affidavit, made by one of his alleged assignors, which is wholly silent upon the question of delivery of the goods,' time of credit, and assignment to the plaintiff of the alleged cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A motion was made herein by the plaintiff for a dismissal of the appeal. An examination of the papers upon which the same is founded leads to a denial of that motion, and for the reasons stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>herein the order of the general term and of the special term of the city court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Motion to dismiss appeal denied, with $10 costs, and order of the general term and of the special term of the city court reversed, with costs, and motion to vacate attachment granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
