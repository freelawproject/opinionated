The learned justice rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for $85 damages and $18.50 costs, making a total of $103.50, from which judgment the defendant Chapman alone appeals. As testified by the auctioneer, the defendant Klinger, the goods were sold at public auction' to one Biehler, doing business as the Restaurant Furniture Company. The defendant Chapman was Biehler\u2019s bookkeeper. There is no evidence in the case of any demand and refusal of the goods, and therefore, even if they were bought by Chapman for himself, he could not be held liable for conversion because of their purchase (Gillet v. Roberts, 57 N. Y. 28, 30), unless he also sold the goods (Pease v. Smith, 61 N. Y. 477, 480), of which there is no evidence. The judgment should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
