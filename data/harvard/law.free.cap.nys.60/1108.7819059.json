It was held in the carefully considered case of Thalheimer v. Hays, 42 Hun, 93, that a defendant had that right under section 683 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We think that case was well decided, and we can add nothing to its reasoning. The appellant contends that this court in Sheehan v. Carvalho, 12 App. Div. 430, 42 N. Y. Supp. 222, took a different view of the rights of interested parties under section 683. This, however, is not the fact. Sheehan v. Carvalho was not an attachment case. It was an application to vacate an order to examine witnesses before trial. What we held there was that in the ordinary proceedings attendant upon the course of an action\u2014where dual motions are not specifically provided for\u2014a party cannot move to vacate his adversary\u2019s order for insufficiency of the papers upon which it was granted, and, when defeated, renew the motion upon affidavits without leave of the court. That undoubtedly is the general rule, but the Code itself makes an exception in the case of the three provisional remedies of injunction, arrest, and attachment. In the case of an injunction it is expressly provided that a denial of a motion founded only upon the papers on which it was granted shall not prejudice a subsequent motion upon affidavits. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 628. The same precise language is not used in the case of orders of arrest and warrants of attachment, but the substance is the same. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 568, 683. Dual motions are distinctly provided for in both instances; and Justice Barker, in the case cited, gives good reasons for a liberal construction of the option thus afforded to a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-14\">The order appealed from was right, and should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
