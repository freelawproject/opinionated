The language of the statute is that \u201can injunction order may be granted.\u201d It is equally within the discretion of the court to continue or to refuse to continue such an order; and, in the absence of facts tending to establish that the court has abused this discretionary power, it would be ordinarily unwise for this court to interpose its discretion for that of the trial court, although this court may properly exercise an independent discretion in a proper case. The verified complaint in the action is based almost entirely upon information and belief. There are no specific allegations of fraud, nor is it shown that the defendants are insolvent, or that there is any good reason to suppose that a judgment rendered in the action may not be enforced. Under these circumstances it was proper for the trial court to refuse to interfere with the orderly administration of the estate of defendants\u2019 intestate, and we conclude that the order appealed from should be affirmed. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
