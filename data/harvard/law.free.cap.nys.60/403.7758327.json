Barclay against Michael Moloney for an injunction. On plaintiff\u2019s motion a preliminary injunction was granted until the hearing of a motion to continue the injunction pendente lite, and defendant was ordered to show cause on less than eight days\u2019 notice why the same should not be continued. On the hearing an order was made denying the motion to continue the injunction pendente lite, and dissolving the same, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AEC\">Modified.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b421-14\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

These are all valid objections to that part of the order which required the defendant to show cause in less than eight days why the injunction should not be continued, and the learned judge at special term was justified in setting so much of the order aside. The justice went further, however, and vacated the injunction itself, which was entirely separate and distinct from the other provision alluded to. As the papers warranted the granting of an injunction in the first instance, it should stand until, on proper notice, it is either continued or vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">The order is accordingly modified by dismissing the order to show cause and reinstating the injunction, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
