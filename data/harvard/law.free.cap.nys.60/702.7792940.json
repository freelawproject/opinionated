In this view, he fails to state any circumstances which render it necessary for his protection that the witness\u2019 testimony should be perpetuated. This he was required to do by subdivision 6 of section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He states certain facts, which show that it is very important he should know what this witness will testify to, and that he cannot, with safety, bring an action against Salmon until he is thus advised. These, however, are not circumstances which relate to the necessity of perpetuating the witness\u2019 testimony, and, as no such circumstances are disclosed, the order for the examination was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">It is apparent, however, that the real object of the applicant is not what he thus avows. In fact, his counsel deposes that the witness\u2019 testimony is necessary \u201cfor the plaintiff in determining whom he shall make defendant in this [contemplated] action.\u201d And again: \u201cThat a summons cannot be drafted herein, nor a complaint, without finding out who was in possession of said premises [the premises in front of which the applicant was injured] at the time of the alleged injury.\u201d The real object of the applicant, therefore, is to ascertain whether he has a cause of action against Salmon. The order should consequently have been vacated\u2014First, because the applicant\u2019s purpose is not, as it was in Bank v. Sheehan, 101 <em>N. </em>Y. 176, 4 N. E. 333, to examine a person against whom an action is about to be brought, but to examine a witness to ascertain whether he has a cause of action against a particular person, and, if he finds he has, to frame his complaint advisedly against such person. That as we held in Re Anthony, 42 App. Div. 66, 58 N. Y. Supp. 907, is not authorized by sections 871 to 876 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Second, because, as was said in the case last cited, \u201cthe proposed defendant must always be definitely, and not tentatively, named in the affidavit, \u25a0and it must be made to appear that the applicant has a cause of action against such specific person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
