She never demanded the garment. This evidence was insufficient to sustain an action wherein the plaintiff is required to prove that the defendant exercises dominion over the property in exclusion or in defiance of the owner\u2019s right. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
