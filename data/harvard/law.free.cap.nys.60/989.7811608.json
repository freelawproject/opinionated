The court charged: \u201cIn this case it is for you to' say whether the act of the plaintiff in attempting to get off the car at the time of the accident was negligence.\u201d At least one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses swears the car was moving slowly. The court\u2019s refusal to charge was not error, under Kelly v. Railroad Co., 25 App. Div., at page 604, 50 N. Y. Supp. 426, but seems warranted by that case. See, also, Filer v. Railroad Co., 49 N. Y. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">McCARTHY, j., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
