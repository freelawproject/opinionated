Her estate was administered by the public administrator, and, no next of kin appearing to claim her estate, the balance, after deducting the expenses of administration, was deposited in the office of the comptroller of the city of New York. On September 15, 1898, 18 years after the death of the deceased, .a petition was presented to the surrogate\u2019s court, asking that this sum be paid to the petitioners as the next of kin of the deceased. Notice of this petition seems to have been given only to the authorities in the city of New York. No notice, by publication or otherwise, was given to the next of kin of the said Mary Dunne. The proceeding was therefore substantially ex parte, being only defended by the corporation counsel of the city of New York. The evidence of relationship of the petitioners consisted solely of their own testimony, with ihe exception of certain declarations made by the deceased during her lifetime, and the records of a ship arriving' in the city of New York in 1849, in which the deceased had stated she arrived in this country. The matter was referred to a referee, before whom the testimony was taken, and he reported that he was not satisfied that the petitioners were the next of kin of the deceased, and upon that report the surrogate denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Assuming the testimony given by the petitioners to be true, the case presents some curious incidents. Upon the ship Ashburton, which arrived in New York on June 30, 1849, there were as passengers a Miss Murray, age 30, female, from Ireland; Eichard White, age 7, male, from Ireland; Joseph White, age 19, male, from Ireland; Mary Dunne, age 23, female, Ireland; Eliza Dunne, age 4, female, Ireland; and Catherine Murray, female, Ireland. This ship made regular trips between Great Britain and this country for several years. It was also proved that the deceased was always known in this country by the name of Mary Dunne, and she stated that she arrived here in 1849 upon the ship Ashburton, and that she was a widow, and that her maiden name \"was Murray. It would follow from this, with reasonable certainty, that she was the Mary Dunne on the passenger list of the ship as having arrived on June 30, 1849. One of the petitioners, who claimed to be a sister of the deceased, testified that her sister married in Ireland, but does not mention her husband\u2019s name; while another petitioner, who .claims to be a niece of the deceased, testified that her aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s name was George Kearns. This would tend to show that the person who was the relative of the petitioner was not the Mary Dunne whose estate is sought to be distributed in this proceeding. On the other hand, there was evidence, as to the declarations of the deceased respecting the name of her parents and the place of her birth, which would tend to corroborate the statement of the petitioners that the deceased was the relative of the petitioners, and that they were her next of kin. Upon this condition of the record, we do not think that we would be justified in reversing the order of the surrogate, and directing the payment of this money to the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed,- with leave, however, to the petitioners to renew the application upon further proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and notice of the application to be given to the next of kin of Mary Dunne or Mary Murray, by publication or otherwise, as the surrogate should direct, with costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
