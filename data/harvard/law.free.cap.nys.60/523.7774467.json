He was absent, and the vice president was asked to sign.

Mayer, Vice President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">The tenant defaulted in the payment of the rent for the months of July, August, and September. Notices of such default were duly served upon the defendant, and after the expiration of the 30 days from the time of giving the notice these actions were begun. At the time of the trial both actions were tried as one action, but separate judgments were rendered in each case in favor of the plaintiff, and upon appeal therefrom by the defendant to the general term of the city court (56 N. Y. Supp. 387, 390) were there affirmed, and from the judgments of affirmance by that court this appeal is taken. The facts in each case are similar, and are substantially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">Assuming that the guaranty in question would have been valid and binding upon the defendant corporation, had it been signed .by one having proper and requisite authority to execute it, I am of the opinion that the record fails to show that Oscar I. Mayer, the vice president, had the necessary power to bind the defendant by his signature thereto. The plaintiff read in evidence the direct examination of said Oscar I. Mayer, taken under and by virtue of an order of the city court made in these actions on the 5th day of March, 1897. In that deposition Mayer states that the defendant is a corporation organized for the purpose of the manufacture and sale of beer; that David Mayer is the president; that Albert (the tenant) carried on a saloon at No. 65 Hester street, in the city of New York, and was a customer of the defendant; that he. (Mayer) had seen the guaranty in question twice,\u2014once on the elevated railroad train going north, and again the same day at the brewery of the defendant; that Albert handed it to him at the brewery, and said he (Albert)<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>wanted the guaranty of the brewing company on the lease; that he (Mayer) replied that the company had stopped giving guaranties; that Albert then said, \u201cI want to get the guaranty of Mr. David Mayer, as I had it previously, but the landlord thinks it better to get the brewing company;\u201d that he (Mayer) said, \"Tell the landlord that, if he insists upon the guaranty of the brewing company, he simply has an empty signature, because the brewing company will absolutely guaranty nobody\u2019s rent or contract;\u201d and that Albert said he would tell Aaronson so. The defendant\u2019s counsel then read a portion of the deposition, not previously read by the plaintiff, in which Mayer stated that nobody had any right to sign or make a contract for the defendant without attaching the seal of the board of directors thereto. Oscar I. Mayer was also sworn in behalf of the defendant, and made substantially the same statements; adding that Albert came to him with a request from Aaronson to have David Mayer sign the paper, and, when he ascertained that David Mayer was not there, said he would take the guaranty of the defendant, and that he (Mayer) told Albert that the brewing company would not sign the guaranty without the direction of the board of directors. This is all the testimony relative to the authority of Oscar I. Mayer to sign the guaranty. It appears by Mayer\u2019s testimony that, at the time of the conversation between himself and Albert, he (Mayer) signed the guaranty in the manner it appears; and he says that Aaronson was not present. Aaronson swears that he was present when Mayor signed, as he says, \u201cthe lease.\u201d Aaronson does not dispute the conversation testified to by Mayer, or the statements Mayer swears that he made at the time he signed the guaranty; and it therefore becomes a question of law to determine whether Mayer had authority to bind the defendant corporation by placing the name of the company to the contract. If Aaronson, who, the plaintiff claims, was acting for her in the matter of procuring the guaranty and lease, was present at the time Mayer signed the name of the defendant to the guaranty, he had notice of the want of authority in Mayer to bind the company by such signing. H he was not present, the plaintiff, upon the delivery to her by Aaronson of the guaranty, with the name of David Mayer in the instrument as the guarantor, and the name of the defendant as the only signer thereto, was put upon her inquiry as to the nature and conditions of the contract, and was chargeable as to the powers and purposes of the corporation. \"Whatever is sufficient to put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry is constructive notice of everything to which that inquiry will reasonably lead.\u201d Cheever v. Railroad Co., 72 Hun, 380, <em>25 </em>N. Y. Supp. 449. \u201cAll persons dealing with a corporation are bound to take notice of the nature and extent of the powers and authority possessed by its officers.\u201d De Bost v. Albert Palmer Co., 35 Hun, 386. \u201cThe plaintiff was chargeable with knowledge of the corporate powers of the defendant, and of the extent to which its cashier could bind the company.\u201d Jemison v. Bank, 122 N. Y. 140, 25 N. E. 264; Alexander v. Cauldwell, 83 N. Y. 480; Wilson v. Railroad Co., 114 N. Y. 487, 21 N. E. 1015. \u201cThe by-laws of the company were put in evidence. They show no authority to issue promissory notes. In this state of the by-laws, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>was necessary for the plaintiff, in order to establish the liability of the defendant on the notes, to show either acquiescence or ratification of the power assumed by the treasurer to issue notes.\u201d Bangs v. Macaroni Co., 15 App. Div. 522, 44 N. Y. Supp. 546. In the case at bar there is no evidence that the defendant had any knowledge or information of tli\u00e9 existence of the guaranty, or that it knew of the signing of the same by Mayer. From the foregoing, it will be seen that there was an entire failure to show that Oscar I. Mayer had power or authority to bind the defendant by the signing of such instrument. The judgments should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u2022Judgments reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant, in each case, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">LEVENTRITT, J., concurs.
