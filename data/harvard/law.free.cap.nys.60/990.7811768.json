J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr8\">The point relied upon for a reversal of this judgment is the refusal to charge the defendant\u2019s request that, \u201cif the plaintiff stepped off the car while the same was in motion, then the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\u201d In Kelly v. Railroad Co., 25 App. Div. at page 604, 50 N. Y. Supp. 427, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-19\">\u201cIt must be observed that there was no question here of an attempt to alight from a slowly-moving car, which, after a signal to stop, came to a standstill. It is doubtless the rule that under such circumstances the question of contributory negligence is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">See, also, Filer v. Railroad Co., 49 N. Y. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>We think that the mere refusal to charge as requested is not error. If the request referred to rapid motion, a different question would arise; and, however much the language used by the court after the denial may be criticised, the defendant did not except to such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The judgment and order must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
