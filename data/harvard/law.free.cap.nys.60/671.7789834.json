Besides the petition, a supplemental affidavit was made by the attorney for the petitioner, setting forth certain facts as to the issue of new bonds; and a further affidavit, showing that the preferred stock holdings of five of the directors who voted for the reduction in the price of gas was very small. An addition to the petition sets forth certain reasons why the writ is demanded, namely, that the petitioner desires to secure the inspection of the books in order to ascertain the financial condition of the company, and whether it is selling gas at a price below cost, and whether it is using capital, and not income, to pay fixed charges; and, \u201cif it should appear that the directors of the said company have been, and are still, engaged in wasting the property of the company. to bring the facts of the case to the attention of the other stockholders of this company, and to lay the same before the attorney general of the state of New York, so that proper action may be taken to recover the property wasted by such directors, to prevent its further waste, to prevent the further incumbrance of your petitioner\u2019s' property, and, if necessary, to have a receiver of said company appointed by the court.\u201d The answering affidavits deny all the allegations of the moving papers as to any acts of waste or wrongdoing on the part of the directors, and further show that the reduction in the price of gas was made in order to meet the rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>of other companies, and thus retain customers. The opposing papers also show that the petitioner has not been injured, but that his securities had a larger market value at the time of his application for the writ in 1899 than they had in 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Without attempting to detail all the facts set forth in the petition, or the manner in which they are met in the opposing affidavits, it is sufficient to say that it is difficult to determine what useful purpose would be served by permitting, an examination such as is here sought by the petitioner. That he was fully acquainted with the facts of the original consolidation, and accepted the change in securities, appears from the petition. Yet, without any expression of a desire to assail the consolidation, the figures of the bond indebtedness and stock of the original constituent companies and of the New Amsterdam Company are detailed at length, for the purpose, we may assume, of showing the amount of fixed charges and the amount of stock on which dividends, if earned, would be applicable. Though inclined to complain of the large increase in the obligations of three companies as they stood originally and after they were merged in the New Amsterdam Company, the petitioner recognizes the fact that the consolidation is a completed affair, accomplished by the voluntary act and consent of the security holders, including the petitioner; and the precise object of going over the details is not very apparent, unless, as stated, it be to show the amount of obligations which the new company has assumed. We take it that the petitioner\u2019s main grievance is the action of the directors in reducing the price of gas, and thus, as he claims, imperiling the financial standing of the company, and compelling it, as he is informed, to resort to its capital for the purpose of paying its fixed charges; and that it is to determine whether such is the fact that he desires an examination of the books and accounts of the company. That the reduction in the price of gas was a measure forced' upon the company by a formidable rivalry and competition in business is shown by the opposing affidavits, and is not\u2019 controverted; and that such action on the part of the company in order to retain its customers was necessary, and therefore a proper exercise of the power vested in its board of directors, is made to appear. Taking petitioner\u2019s statement that the present price of gas is less than the cost of production, it is obvious that the \u201cgas war,\u201d if continued, may indefinitely postpone dividends. But in what way will the security holders or the company itself be benefited by the petitioner obtaining information that for the time being the company is compelled to do business at a loss, if such is the fact? The petitioner states that he would prevent such waste of the company\u2019s property by applying to the attorney general, or moving for a receiver to be appointed by the court. But that such a purpose, if carried out, would not tend to increase the value of the company\u2019s securities, is evident. That the company could have pursued any other course in attempting to retain its customers than to meet the cut in prices made by a rival company, the petitioner does not claim or show. An attack upon the company through the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>general would not aid the company, or advance its securities at a time when it is struggling with what the petitioner himself regards as a ruinous competition. An attack from within its lines would not help it to repel the attack from without. We have been unable to discover from these papers any proper or laudable motive which would justify granting to the petitioner the extraordinary remedy which he seeks by the peremptory writ of mandamus. The principles underlying the issuance of that writ have been so recently and clearly presented in Re Steinway, 159 N. Y. 250, 53 N. E. 1103, that it is unnecessary to repeat them. Suffice it to say that, while the court has the power, it is one to be exercised in its sound discretion, and the writ is not to be accorded to a stockholder whenever he seeks to invoke it. Had it been made to appear that the purpose sought by the examination was to promote the interests of the security holders or of the company, or that the value of the securities held by petitioner could be enhanced or protected by the relief sought, there might be a basis for the issuance of the writ. In the absence of such a showing, or where, as here, it appears that it would be injurious, rather than beneficial, not alone to the company, but to those in behalf of whom the petitioner states that he makes the application, we think the disposition made by the court below in denying-the writ was proper, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
