The mortgage was, by its terms, long past due. The owner of the equity of redemption interposes as a defense an agreement whereby, for sufficient consideration, the time for the payment of the principal was postponed indefinitely, so long as the semiannual payments of interest were made regularly. When the plaintiff\u2019s grantor was about to acquire title to the mortgaged premises, negotiations occurred between him and the plaintiff, in the course of which, the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>pellant claims, the agreement pleaded was entered into between the parties. It is unnecessary to review the evidence of the parties as to what agreement was made between them, for subsequently the defendants\u2019 grantor executed a bond to the plaintiff whereby, in con sideration of the extension of the time for the payment of the mortgage for a period of six months, he assumed such payment. All negotiations or agreements between the parties were merged in this sealed contract, the effect of which cannot be varied by paroi. After the time for the payment of the mortgage prescribed in the new bond had passed, it is claimed a new agreement was made for an extension of the time of payment. It is equally unnecessary to review the evidence on this question, for the plaintiff received no consideration for such an extension. An agreement to pay a debt past due, at a subsequent time, and also interest upon the debt up to that time, is not a sufficient consideration for an agreement to extend the time for the payment of the debt.
