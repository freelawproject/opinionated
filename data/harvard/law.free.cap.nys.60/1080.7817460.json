The answer is a general denial and an allegation \u201cthat all legal services ever rendered to her, or any services of any kind rendered to her, by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, have been fully paid for by this defendant.\u201d This is not qj. allegation of payment for the services specified in the complaint, since the answer denies such services, instead of admitting them, and thus necessarily refers to other services for which the plaintiff does not seek to recover. Hence no bill of particulars was needful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
