In Re Lyman, 160 N. Y. 96, 54 N. E. 577, the court of appeals has held that a liquor tax certificate can be forfeited for a violation of law by the holder only upon a conviction for such offense, and not in a summary investigation before a justice of this court or a magistrate. It follows that this proceeding cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
