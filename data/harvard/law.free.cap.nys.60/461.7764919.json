The plaintiff was in default for his November dues, and so not in good standing with the treasurer from the end of November until December 12, 1898, and he was therefore suspended, and not entitled to sick benefits, until on and after January 11, 1899. In the judgment here appealed from, the learned justice erroneously awarded him recovery for sick benefits during the period of his suspension. The penalty of suspension for a defined period, because of default in timely payment of dues which the member has obligated himself to pay, was not unreasonable, and the association did not waive that penalty by accepting the dues. Jennings v. Society (decided at the July term) 59 N. Y. Supp. 862. The judgment should be reversed, and, as there is no dispute as to the facts, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant.
