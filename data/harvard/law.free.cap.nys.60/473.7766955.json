He was corroborated by one Ubenstein, who says that the car had stopped; that, while plaintiff was in the act of alighting, the conductor pulled the bell, the car immediately started off, and the plaintiff was thrown to the ground. The defendant did not put a witness on the stand, counsel saying: \u201cWe have no proof to offer, as we know nothing whatever about this accident.\u201d Two wrecks later the trial justice rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for $10 costs. This was against the evidence. The defendant was bound to allow the plaintiff reasonable time to alight (Poulin v. Railroad Co., 61 N. Y. 621); and where, as in this case, two witnesses are unimpeached, the facts sworn to by them uncontradi'cted, either directly or indirectly, by other witnesses, and there is no in-, trinsic improbability in the relation given by them, neither a court nor jury can, in the exercise of a sound discretion, disregard their testimony (Newton v. Pope, 1 Cow. 109; Kavanagh v. Wilson, 70 N. Y. 177). The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">FREEDMAN, P. J., concurs. LEVENTRITT, J., takes no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
