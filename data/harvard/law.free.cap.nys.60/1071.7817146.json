J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVEz\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that on October 13, 1896, at the city of New York, the defendant Buffalo City Mills, Limited, made its draft or bill of exchange, in writing, for value received, by its duly-authorized agent and manager. Said draft was dated on October 13, 1896, and was for $450, .and drawn, payable three months after date, to the order of E. H. Kruger &amp; Co., and addressed to Messrs. Lovegrove &amp; Co., No. 143 North Third street, Philadelphia. It is alleged that the drawer delivered the draft to \u00cdawee, and that on the 16th of October, 1896, Lovegrove ac-the draft, in writing, and that the acceptance was made by \u2019ove \u201cunder his firm name of Lovegrove &amp; Co.\u201d It is averred thereafter the said draft was duly indorsed, and delivered, maturity, and for value received, by the defendant Kruger, .yee therein named, under his firm name of E. H. Kruger &amp; <em>j </em>his duly-authorized agent and attorney, to the Bank of Commerce in Buffalo.\u201d It is also alleged that on January 13, 1897, when the draft became due, \u201cit was duly presented for payment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>defendant Lovegrove by a notary public, and payment thereof demanded; that payment of the whole or any part thereof was refused, whereupon, on said day, it was protested for nonpayment, and notice of such presentment, demand, nonpayment, and protest served upon each of the defendants.\u201d It is further averred that the Bank of Commerce in Buffalo was, and that these plaintiffs, since their appointment as receivers, have been, and now are, the owners and holders' of said draft. In the amended answer of the defendant ICruger he denies \u201cthat he is the sole member of the firm of Edward H. Kruger &amp; Co., doing business at Elizabeth City, in the state of North Carolina,\u201d and also makes several other denials not important to be stated. Among other allegations found in his answer is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-5\">\u201cAnd the said defendant Edward H. Kruger, for a further and separate answer, and defense, herein alleges and shows to the court on information and belief that all of the business done under the name of Edward H. Kruger, or E. H. Kruger &amp; Co., in connection with the making, indorsing, and delivering of any and all promissory notes or drafts set up in the complaint, was done and transacted, using the designation Co.,\u2019 -with no actual partner or partners represented thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The answer also contained allegations relating to a counterclaim, which counterclaim was withdrawn before the trial. The answer contained no averment that there was a defect of parties, and the defendant Kruger was not in a situation to\u201d question the sufficiency of the complaint upon the trial. Persons v. Kruger, 39 App. Div. 416, 57 N. Y. Supp. 416. The draft mentioned in the complaint was produced and offered in evidence, and the signatures to the same were duly shown to be genuine. It is found as a fact that, after the draft was accepted by the drawee, \u201cthe said draft was duly indorsed and delivered, before maturity, and for value received, by the defendant Edward H. Kruger, the payee therein named, under the name of E. H. Kruger &amp; Co., by his duly-authorized agent and attorney, to the Bank of Commerce in Buffalo.\u201d The evidence produced at the trial satisfactorily established the fact thus stated. It was further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-7\">\u201cThat when said draft became due and payable, to wit, on or about January 13, 1897, it was duly presented for payment to the drawee and acceptor thereof, to wit, Lovegrove &amp; Co., by a notary public, and payment thereof demanded; that payment thereof, or of any part thereof, was refused, whereupon the said draft was, on said date, duly protested for nonpayment, and notice of said presentment, demand, nonpayment, and protest was duly given to the defendant Edward H. Kruger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Upon the trial some evidence was given tending to show the statutes of Pennsylvania in respect to demand, protest, and notice of commercial paper. Upon the argument the respondents were allowed to furnish an exemplified copy of the statute of Pennsylvania, and an exemplified copy relating to authentication of letters of attorney and protests of notaries public has been submitted. In the second section of the act we find the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-9\">\u201cThat the official acts, protests and attestations of all notaries public, certified according to law, under their respective hands and seals of office, in respect to the dishonor of all bills and promissory notes, and of notice to the drawers, acceptors or endorsers thereof, may be received and read in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>as proof of the facts therein stated, in all suits now pending or hereafter to be brought: provided, that any party.may be permitted to contradict by other evidence, any such certificate.\u201d P. L. 1855, p. 724.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">We think the plaintiffs were properly allowed to read in evidence the notarial certificate executed by William J. P. Allen, notary public, of the 13th of January, 1897, relating to the paper in issue, and that, pursuant to the statute of Pennsylvania, the certificate was prima facie \u201cproof of the facts therein stated.\u201d Under the Pennsylvania statute the defendant was at liberty \u201cto contradict by other evidence\u201d such certificate. In this state, by section 923 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the certificate of a notary public under his hand and seal of office is allowed to establish the presentment by him for acceptance or payment, or of the protest for the nonacceptance or nonpayment of a promissory note or bill of exchange, and of the service of notice thereof on the party to the note or bill, and to specify the mode of giving the notice, the reputed place of residence of the party to whom it was given, and the post office nearest thereto; and such certificate is declared to be \u201cpresumptive evidence of the facts certified, unless the party against whom it is offered has served upon the adverse party, with his pleading, or within ten days after joinder of an issue of fact, an original affidavit to the effect that he has not received notice of nonacceptance or of nonpayment of the note or bill.\u201d No affidavit was made by the defendant or by Brown to the effect that no notice had been received of the protest of the paper in question. Nor was any evidence given on the trial by the defendant Kruger as a witness, or Brown as a witness, that the notice of protest alleged to have been served was not received. Cuming v. Roderick, 28 App. Div. 253, 50 N. Y. Supp. 1053, does not aid the contention of the appellant, as in that case, after the notary\u2019s certificate of protest was introduced in evidence by the plaintiff, \u201che allowed the indorser, without objection or exception, to testify that notice of protest had not been received by him.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Upon the trial, a power of attorney, purporting to be executed by the firm of E. H. Kruger &amp; Co., was produced, and read in evidence, and by that power of attorney it appeared that Andrew Brown was constituted attorney to make and sign all notes, drafts, bills of exchange, checks, contracts, and other commercial or money obligations, to accept and indorse drafts, indorse checks, notes, and all and every form of obligation which the said firm can execute, giving and granting unto said Brown full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises. That power of attorney was signed and dated on the lflth day of May, 1892, and was executed with the signature of E. H. Kruger &amp; Co. On that day Edward H. Kruger appeared before a notary public, who certified to the fact of such appearance, and that such Kruger was \u201cknown to me to be a member of the firm of E. H. Kruger &amp; Co., and acknowledged the above letter of attorney to be their act and deed.\u201d The evidence given in connection with the power of attorney fully. indicated that Brown acted as the general agent of Kruger in carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>ing forward the business transacted by him with the Bank of Commerce, and had full charge of the acts and dealings with the bank, and the management of the paper which had been discounted by the bank at the instance of Brown for and in behalf of the appellant Kruger. We think the evidence warranted the court in finding that service of notice of protest upon Brown was sufficient, as he was the agent who indorsed the paper for the defendant Kruger. In Firth v. Thrush, 8 Barn. &amp; C. 387, the opinion was expressed that authority to indorse negotiable paper carried with it authority to receive notice of its dishonor. We think the Bank of Commerce had the right to presume that the draft which is the subject of this action was business paper such as it had been in the habit of discounting for defendant Kruger, and that the notice of protest given to Brown was to the agent of the appellant, and that the evidence warranted a finding of a general agency on the part of Brown. Bank v. Putnam, *42 N. Y. 343; Hubbard v. Matthews, 54 N. Y. 44. The latter case was approved and cited in Fassin v. Hubbard, 55 N. Y. 465. See, also, Lake Shore Nat. Bank v. Butler Colliery Co., 51 Hun, 68, 3 N. Y. Supp. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">2. notwithstanding the finding made by the trial court that payment of the draft was refused, \u201cwhereupon the said draft was on said date duly protested for nonpayment, and notice of said presentment, demand, nonpayment, and protest was duly given to the defendant Edward H. Kruger,\u201d it is contended in his behalf that the evidence was insufficient to establish the fact of notice. As we have before seen, the notary in Philadelphia presented the draft, and made a demand, and issued notices of its dishonor; and in his certificate, which was received in evidence, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-6\">\u201cNotice of the foregoing demand, nonpayment, and protest, partly written and partly printed, signed by me, and folded in the form of letters, as follows, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-7\">\u201cNotice for Buffalo City Mills, ' 1 Enclosed to Bank of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apm_\">L\u2019t\u2019d Directed. j-Commerce in Buffalo,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG0\">do. for A.

Kruger &amp;j Enclosed to Bank of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av1q\">Co., A. Brown, Atty.}- Commerce in Buffalo,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6x\">Directed. J Buffalo, N-. Y.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-15\">Mr. Persons, on\"e of the receivers of the Bank of Commerce, was called as a witness, and he was asked whether he was able to say \u201cwhether or not any notice of protest received from the notary public at Philadelphia for E. H. Kruger &amp; Co. was forwarded,\u201d and he answered, \u201cIt was.\u201d He was then asked if he had any recollection of the fact that this draft was not paid when it was due, and he answered, \u201cI have.\u201d He was then asked to detail the course of business as to the mailing of letters, correspondence, and notices of all kinds by the receivers. He answered, viz.: \u201cThe mail was put in an envelope, addressed, and put in a box, or left on my desk, and the janitor put stamps on and took it to the office. The janitor was John Dover.\u201d The witness added that the same course was taken with letters that were laid upon his table; and, continuing, he said: \u201cThe letters were left on my desk, or put in a general box,\u2014\u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>a mail box that hung just at the side of one of the cages in the bank, \u2014and it was Dover\u2019s business to take that mail and carry it to the office. If there wasn\u2019t any stamps on the envelopes when he took them out of the box or off of my desk, he was to put them on, and take the mail, and carry them over, and put them in the office. Q. That was the United States post office, here on Seneca street? A. That was the place it was to go.\u201d The plaintiff called Walsh as a witness, who testified that he had looked over the memorandum of the Lovegrove paper being returned from Philadelphia, and added: \u201cAfter refreshing my recollection, that enables me to recollect the fact that the paper did come back, and the notice for Kruger &amp; Co. Q. State what was done with the notice of Kruger &amp; Co. A. It was probably mailed.\u201d He was then asked the following questions: \u201cQ. What is your recollection, after being refreshed by this memorandum, arid from your knowledge of the business course that was carried on there,\u2014what is your recollection as to what was done with that notice? A. Put in an envelope, and mailed to Box 811, P. O New York City. Q. What was the course of business as to the mailing of all mail matter from the receiver\u2019s office? A. It was inclosed in an envelope, sealed, and put on the receiver\u2019s desk, or in the mail box, and taken over to the post office by the janitor.\u201d He adds that stamps were put on at the request of the receivers. The plaintiff then called John Dover, who had been employed in the bank, prior to the suspension of business, as janitor and messenger, for 12 years, and he testified that he remained with the receivers after they came into the bank, and went after the letters for the bank, and brought them from the post office to the bank; and he adds: \u201cI collected the letters for the mails,\u2014to go out in the mails; stamped them that wasn\u2019t stamped. If I found any letters that wasn\u2019t stamped, I stamped them. I had access to the stamps to do such things, and mail them. To mail them, I bundled them up, and carried them over to the United States post office on Seneca street. I always did that with letters for the mail while I was in the employ of the receivers.\u201d Subsequently the witness Walsh was further cross-examined, and gave such circumstances as were recalled by him, and in the course of his redirect examination he said: \u201cMy recollection is that I saw the notice of protest, or draft, returned, and spoke to one of the employ\u00e9s of the bank, expressing surprise. I remember the circumstances of it being received, and marking it \u2018Protest\u2019 on the tickler, and my speaking to some one about it. It was my duty to mail those notices of protest to the indorser, Kruger &amp; Co., or to Andrew Brown. Mr. Clark, the bank examiner in charge at that time, imposed that duty upon me.\u201d The witness was then asked, \u201cState what was the form of the notice of protest forwarded for Kruger &amp; \"Co. to New York,\u201d and the witness answered, \u201cIt was the usual form of notice.\u201d The witness added that he had been in the banking business, and accustomed to seeing notices of protest, for some li years, and thereupon he was asked the following question: \u201cQ. What is your best recollection now, after having seen that memorandum, and after having your recollection refreshed, as to whether or not you did forward that notice,\u2014mailed it, and put the postage on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>it? A. I think I mailed the notice the day of its receipt, after marking it \u2018Returned\u2019 on the discount tickler. Q. Is that usually the course of business? A. Yes, sir. Q. After the receivers came in, did you have the same duty about forwarding notices of protest? A. Yes, sir.\u201d We think the evidence supports the finding of fact made by the trial judge, that notices were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">In volume 3, Randolph on Commercial Paper (section 1312, p. 364), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-6\">\u201cThe evidence of the bank officers as to the invariable course of business of the bank, to the effect that notice must have been sent, has been held to be sufficient to go to the jury, although the witness had no recollection of the particular matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">In section 1314 the same learned author says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-8\">\u201cThe sufficiency of the evidence, as well as its credibility, should be left to the consideration of the jury; and their conclusion as to the facts is sufficient to support the verdict, although it may differ from the opinion of the court as to such facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">It must be borne in mind that there is no affidavit denying receipt of the notice, and, under such circumstances, we think the evidence given tending to show that notice was sent should be liberally construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">In McLean v. Ryan, 36 App. Div. 281, 55 N. Y. Supp. 232, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-11\">\u201cAn indorser can always compel the production of common-law evidence against him to prove the service of notice by an affidavit denying receipt of notice. For that reason, where the indorser is unwilling to make such an affidavit, the courts are inclined to construe the notarial certificate with great liberality,\u201d\u2014citing Bank v. Neass, 3 N. Y. 442.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">. In 2 Edw. Bills &amp; N. \u00a7 987, where a notary had testified that he had no doubt notice was given, though at that distance of time he could not recollect positively, and that it was possible he might have given the notice to the holder to forward, the author says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-13\">\u201cThis evidence, say the court, was certainly sufficient, in the first instance, to support the averment of due notice, and, there being nothing to affect it, it will support the verdict.\u201d See, also, section 188.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">In Bank v. Stone, 50 Me. 595, the notary testified that he was in the habit of delivering notices to S., and S. testified that he was in the habit of delivering notices for the notary, and that he seasonably delivered to the parties to be notified all notices handed him for delivery, but had no definite recollection of doing so in the present instance; and it was held by the court that this testimony was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">In Daniel on Negotiable Instruments (volume 2, \u00a7 1056), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-16\">\u201cWhere a notary testified that \u2018it was usual for him to send notices of dishonor on the evening of the day of protest, and he had no doubt it was duly done in this instance,\u2019 it was held sufficient evidence of notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">See, also, Miller v. Hackley, 5 Johns. 375; Bank v. Mitchell, 15 Conn. 206; Daniel, Neg. Inst. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 1054, where it is said, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-18\">\u201cWhen the mail is the proper channel for the communication of notice, it is not necessary to show the distinct fact that the particular letter containing the notice was put in the mail by ocular evidence thereof. Proof that notice was put with letters for the post office by one clerk, and that the letters of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>day were deposited by another clerk, would be sufficient. And it would likewise be sufficient that it was put with letters customarily made up in the usual course of business for the postman, and that he invariably carried all the letters found upon the table.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">The trial court having found the essential fact upon evidence which we believe to be sufficient to support its finding, it is our duty to sustain the conclusion drawn by the trial judge from the evidence, and sustain his finding of fact in respect to the service of notice, and the judgment should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
