The appellant bases his contention on section 1362 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the consolidation act, which provides that the trial of an action may be adjourned by the court, on the application of either party, for a period not exceeding eight days, but that \u201cby consent or where neither party objects\u201d a longer adjournment may be granted. The return discloses the fact that an adjournment for more than eight days was had, but it does not appear whether the parties consented thereto, or whether either of them objected. Jurisdiction having concededly attached, it will be presumed to continue until it affirmatively appears that it has been devested; and this rule obtains even in courts of limited jurisdiction. 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 274, 275, and cases cited. No papers are contained in the record\u2014which is conclusive on us\u2014showing that the appellant objected. The mere statement of counsel that he had objected is not a substitute for the fact. The proceedings will be deemed regular until the contrary appears. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
