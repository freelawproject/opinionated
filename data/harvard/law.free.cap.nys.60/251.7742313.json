No question is raised as to the amount \u00f3f damages. The defendant contends that it is not liable in the premises, because section 98 of the railroad law only makes it the duty of a street surface railroad company to keep in permanent repair the street between and two feet in width outside of its tracks \u201cunder the supervision of the proper local authorities and when\u00e9ver required by them to do,\u201d and there is no evidence in this case that notice was given to the defendant by any local authority of the condition of the pavement. But such notice, as has been authoritatively held, is not a condition precedent to the performance by the defendant of the duty assumed by it of keeping the public thoroughfare in repair, neglect of which renders it liable 'in a civil action to any one of the public-sustaining special damage from such neglect. City of Brooklyn v. Brooklyn City R. Co., 47 N. Y. 475. Of the bad condition of the-street, which was testified to by several persons, the defendant was aware, through its officer, some months before the accident; for its track foreman testified that the street had been torn up in the month of August, and that, coming along there and seeing it was in bad condition, he had sand and dirt furnished, and the stones relaid temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Again, the defendant urges that it was not liable herein because the plaintiffs failed to show that the defendant was using the tracks upon the street at the time of the alleged injury, and that the contrary affirmatively appears in the case. That defense cannot be availed of here, because the defendant, after expressly admitting in its answer the allegation in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that the defendant was the owner or lessee of, or maintained, tracks upon and along the public street, proved by its own witness that it (the defendant) attended to the care of the street. There was no evidence of abandonment or nonuser of the track in the case, excepting that a truckman incidentally said that, \u201csince the car stopped running there, Bleecker street was neglected very much.\u201d The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Jfidgment affirmed, with costs to the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">FREEDMAN, P. J., concurring. LEVENTRITT, J., taking no-part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
