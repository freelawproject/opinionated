The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $75. The paintiff\u2019s expert, however, testified that it would cost only from $6 to $8 to repair the defect, and the experts of the defendant agreed with these figures. The recovery must therefore be limited to this sum. It is true that the plaintiff testified that he had to take Ms son from work to watch the heater during a period of three months, and that the son\u2019s time. \u201cwas worth a dollar a day.\u201d This testimony will not support the additional damage awarded. There is no proof what the son\u2019s work was, or whether he was paid for it; nor is there proof that the father was entitled to the proceeds of the work from which the son was taken, or that he actually paid anything to the son for watching the heater. There is in fact nothing in the record to overcome the presumption of gratuitous service on the part of the son. For aught that appears, the son may have been taken away from work which he was performing for his father without any agreement for compensation. The judgment should be reduced to $8.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the respondent consent to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>reduction of the amount of recovery to $8, in which event the judgment will be reduced to that sum, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
