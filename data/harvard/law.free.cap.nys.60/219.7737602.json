Marion Beveridge died during the lifetime of David, intestate, leaving David and two-other children her sole next of kin. David died subsequently, leaving a will, by which he assumed to dispose of the insurance policy issued in favor of his mother. David\u2019s executors made claim to the insurance policy, and a litigation as to the insurance subsequently ensued between them and the administrator of Marion, in which judgment was entered declaring that the latter was entitled to the fund. 52 N. Y. Supp. 1132. The plaintiffs demand of the defendant one-third of the insurance moneys, less the expenses of administration, etc. (there being no debts against the estate of Marion),, which is resisted on the ground that the decree in the previous litigation is conclusive against any right of the plaintiffs to share in the proceeds of the policy. The dispute or controversy now submitted to us seems to be as utterly needless and without merit as the-one determined in the prior action between the parties. The judgment in that action decided that the personal representatives of Marion, not those of David, were entitled to the insurance moneys; but it did not and could- not have adjudicated upon the right of David to share in the estate of his mother as one of her next of kin. Of course, the interest of David in the estate of his mother vested at the time of the latter\u2019s death, and on David\u2019s death passed to his-personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Judgment for plaintiffs on agreed statement of facts, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
