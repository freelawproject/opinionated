Act. The appellant, therefore, is not prejudiced by the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Moreover, the case having apparently been tried upon oral pleadings, to determine defendant\u2019s indebtedness, and the defendant having admitted his indebtedness to the plaintiff in the amount for which judgment was rendered against him, and no exception appearing in the case which presents a question of law calling for reversal, the judgment represents substantial justice, and for that reason it should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
