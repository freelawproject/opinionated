In this respect the averments are not to be treated as conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>of law, but as averments of fact, at least sufficient to resist the motion to strike out.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The order' should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
