Judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b772-6\">It was shown by the statement of facts: That the plaintiffs are, respectively, a brother and sisters and the sole heirs at law and next of kin of Alfred Charles Fenn, who died on or about the 29th day of August, 1893, leaving a last will and testament, dated June 16, 1893, and proved November 22, 1893, and recorded in the office of the surrogate of said county in Liber 499 of Wills, at page 297. That a dispute or question has arisen between the parties hereto as to the validity of that portion of said will which disposes of or affects such articles of jewelry as were left by said testator at the time of his death. That the only portion or portions of said vsjill affecting said jewelry is the second clause thereof, which is as follows: \u201cSecond. All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real and personal, and wheresoever situated, I give, devise, and bequeath to my executors, hereinafter named, in trust, however, to sell and dispose of the same at public or private sale, in their discretion, and, after paying all my just debts, to divide the net proceeds derived from the sale thereof equally between my brothers and sisters who may be living at the time of my death. I hereby authorize and empower my executors to execute and deliver such deeds or other instruments as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this, my will. I hereby authorize and empower my executors to distribute among such- of my friends as they, in their discretion, may see fit, such articles of jewelry or wearing apparel as they may be desirous of having.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b772-7\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

There is no ultimate gift of the jewelry and wearing apparel to any one, and the provision of the will with respect- to those articles is so vague that it cannot be said that any one has the right, under the will, to claim any of them from the executors; for the distribution is to be among such of the testator\u2019s friends as the executors, in their discretion, may see fit to select, and of such articles as such friends may be desirous of having. The executors hold the articles for the next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">\u2022 There should be judgment for the plaintiffs on the submission,, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
