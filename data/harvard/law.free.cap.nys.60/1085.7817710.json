During this period the defendants sold over 3,500 pounds of saccharine, the greater part of which, however, was not delivered to the purchasers until .after September 26th. The judgment awards to the plaintiffs 50 \u25a0cents upon each pound of saccharine delivered subsequent to Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>tember 26th, although the contract of sale was made between that date -and August 1st; and the sole question is whether this was correct. -</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The defendants bound themselves to pay the plaintiffs 50 cents upon each pound of saccharine \u201csold and delivered\u201d while the contract was in force. The plaintiffs contend that a \u201csale\u201d is not complete until title passes by delivery; and hence that, in the eye of the law, the \u201csale,\u201d in. the present case, as well as the delivery, took place after the contract was resumed. But this argument completely ignores the original transaction, which resulted in the subsequent delivery of the goods. It assumes that the word \u201csold,\u201d as used in the \u25a0 contract, referred exclusively to an executed, and not to an executory, sale. This construction is neither within the letter nor the spirit of the contract. The instrument, read in the light of the surroundings, shows that there was no intention to compel the defendants to make the specified payments upon goods, the agreement to sell which was made while the contract was in suspense. The substance of the arrangement was that the defendants agreed to make the payments only while they remained in exclusive control of the market. Such .control would naturally enhance prices, and its continuous existence was the postulate upon which the bargain and liability thereunder rested. The price which would justify the bonus paid to the plaintiffs depended, of course, upon this exclusive control of the market. The moment that exclusive control ceased or was suspended, the price would naturally drop, and there would no longer be a suitable basis for the bonus. As matter of fact, the defendants, as was to be expected, were forced to lower their prices between August 1st and September 26th; and the goods in question, though delivered after September 26th, were contracted for at the lower rates during the period of suspension. Clearly, no payment of the bonus in such-case was contemplated. With what grace could the defendants have refused to pay the plaintiffs upon goods contracted to be sold prior to August 1st (when they had complete control of the market, and higher prices were consequently obtainable), merely because such goods were not delivered under the contract until the period of suspension? The defendants, under such circumstances, would not have been heard to say that the sale was only executed upon delivery, nor would they have been heard to say that, because of the use of the words \u201csold and delivered,\u201d the contract and delivery must both be within the period when the bargain was in force. The essential bargain was that, when the defendants made an agreement to sell during the running life of the contract, they were, upon delivery and payment (at any period), to give the plaintiffs the agreed bonus. But they were not bound to do so when the agreement .of sale was made' during the suspension of the contract, although delivery and payment might be made after the resumption of the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs, and, as the facts, are conceded and cannot possibly be varied upon a new trial, the complaint should be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
