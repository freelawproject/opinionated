Morgan, as state comptroller, and another, against George B. Warner and another, as the executor of the estate of John Stolp, deceased, and others, to determine, the value of certain notes bequeathed by decedent to some of the defendants, for the purpose of determining the transfer tax thereon. From an order of the surrogate reversing the appraisal of the appraiser in favor of defendants the plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A9bT\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b982-6\">Upon February 10, 1899, John Stolp, a resident of Onondaga county, died, leaving a last will and testament. At the time of his death he held three notes against four of his grandnephews and grandnieces. By the fourth -clause of the decedent\u2019s will, the notes, and the amounts due thereon, were .\u25a0given to the makers of said notes, and the executors were directed to cancel -and surrender said notes to the makers thereof without payment. The ap,-praiser appointed valued the said notes at their face value, and upon his report the surrogate determined the value of the interest passing under the will to these legatees as the face value of the notes, and assessed the tax accordingly. The executors under the will and these legatees appealed from that part of the order, and upon the appeal the surrogate reversed the order in so far as it -determined the value of said notes as of the face value, and thereupon determined the said notes and the interest passing under the will to be valueless, :and the said legatees were charged with no tax thereupon. From this determination of the surrogate the comptroller has appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b982-7\">Argued before HARDIN, P. J., and ADAMS, McLENNAN, 'SPRING, and SMITH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b982-8\">John McLennan, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b982-9\">George B. Warner, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b982-10\">SMITH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtRS\">The appellant is met at the threshold of his argument with the objection that this appeal is unauthorized. By section 232 of chapter 808 of the Laws of 1896 the procedure under such assessment is prescribed. Pursuant to that section, the determination was first made upon the report of the appraiser, and upon an appeal from said determination by the executors and the legatees the determination was in part reversed. The statute then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-11\">\u201cWithin two years after the entry of an order or decree of a surrogate \u25a0determining the value of an estate and assessing the tax thereon, the comptroller of the state may, if he believes that such appraisal, assessment or -determination has been fraudulently, collusively or erroneously made, make \u25a0application to a justice of the supreme court of the judicial district in which the former owner of such estate resided, for a reappraisal thereof. The justice to whom such application is made may thereupon appoint a competent .\u25a0\u00a1person to reappraise such estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The claim of the respondent is that the legislature has prescribed \u25a0a, specific mode of review of the determination of the surrogate upon the appeal, that that provision was intended to be exclusive, and that no right of appeal from that determination is given by \u25a0the statute. To sustain this claim he cites a case decided in the First department. In re Smith\u2019s Estate, 40 App. Div. 480, 58 N. Y. Supp. 128. It was there held that the supreme court had no power to vacate an order made by a justice of that court under the foregoing section directing a reappraisal of the estate of a decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>for the purpose of assessing a transfer tax thereon. In the opinion in that case Justice Rumseyi says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-5\">\u201cWhat is to be done under that statute is prescribed by the statute, and must be done as is prescribed, and by the magistrate who is directed to-do it, and the courts generally have no jurisdiction in the matter. In theseproeeedings they can act only as they are authorized to act by the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">All that is there held is that no statute authorized the motion, that was then under consideration. But this appeal need not necessarily rest upon that single statute. If other statutes exist' which are applicable thereto, they must be read in connection with, the statute; they together prescribing the mode of determination of this tax, and also the mode of review. By section 2570 of the-Code of Civil Procedure it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">\u201cAn appeal to the appellate division of the supreme court may be taken from a decree of the surrogate\u2019s court or from an order affecting a substantial right made by a surrogate or by a surrogate\u2019s court in a special proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">This proceeding would seem to come within the purview of that section, and the order made by the surrogate from which this appeal is taken, involving, as it does, a substantial right, may be reviewed under this section by the appellate division. The comptroller, \u2019then, if he desires further evidence, or further examination of the assets of an estate, may proc\u00e9ed under the transfer tax statute, and have a reappraisement under an order of a justice of the supreme court. If, however, he desires simply a review of the determination made by the surrogate thereupon, he may have that review upon ah appeal. The provision in the transfer tax law for a reappraisal under the order of a justice of the supreme court was made by an amendment to the statute in 1896. If that could be deemed to express an intention of the legislature to be the only method of review of the determination of the surrogate upon said appeal, it would conflict with the provision of the constitution of 1895, which provided that the jurisdiction of the appellate division, should thenceforth be as then exercised, in addition to such further jurisdiction as should be given to said court by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Reaching, then, the merits of this case, we think the order of the surrogate was right. It is first challenged upon the ground that the finding of the surrogate that the notes were valueless was without evidence. We are satisfied that the testimony of the executor-as to the declarations of the testator are incompetent evidence of the value of the notes, and are not proof upon which a finding of the surrogate can be made or sustained. At folios 64 and 65 of the-record, however, the executor swears without qualification that these notes were valueless. This evidence was given without objection. The executor was not cross-examined thereupon. While-the witness has stated a conclusion of fact, which, under proper objection, would have been excluded as improper in form, nevertheless no objection was made. ,The presumption is that, if objection had been made, the form of the question would have been corrected to ask for the facts from which this conclusion was drawn. The comptroller cannot .now be heard to say that the fact as to the value of the notes was found without sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>The appellant further contends that, notwithstanding the insolvency of the makers, inasmuch as the notes are given as legacies to the makers themselves, they should be assessed at their face value. It will hardly be claimed that, if these notes were given by the will to legatees other than the makers, they should not be appraised at their market value. Upon this the statute is clear. In chapter 908 of the Laws of 1896, under which this tax is assessed, this rule of appraisal is unmistakably stated. In section 230 provision is made for the appointment of \u201ca competent person as appraiser to fix a fair market value of property subject to this tax.\u201d In section 231 the appraiser \u201cshall at such time and place appraise the same at its fair market value as herein prescribed.\u201d In section 232: \u201cThe surrogate shall forthwith as of course determine the cash value of all the assets.\u201d In section 222 of the act: \u201cEvery tax shall be a lien upon the property transferred and the person to whom the property is transferred and the executor shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment.\u201d In section 224 the executor is forbidden to deliver the legacy until the payment of the tax, and he has power to sell the property to collect the tax thereon. The statute, it will be seen, thus plainly provides for the appraisal of all property at its fair market value. \u00a1No exception is made in cases where promissory notes are given to their makers, and the court is not authorized to read into the statute any such exception. If these views are right, they lead to an affirmance of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
