Defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. were overruled by the court below, in banc, and we now have its appeal from the judgment entered upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">By the second and third assignments of error it is charged that the learned trial judge erred in refusing defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions and in overruling its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. These assignments raise the controlling question involved on this appeal. The defendant contended that it was not liable because the policy, under its terms, had lapsed on November 20, 1922, by reason of the non-payment of premiums, and had not been reinstated. Plaintiff contended that the policy was in force at the date of the death of the insured (August 4, 1923), because there had been paid by him, or on his behalf, to the agents of defendant in the city of Johnstown during the year beginning October 19,1922; the sum of $90 on account of total premiums for that year, aggregating $105.68, which payment's \u2014 together with a payment of $5 in excess of the premiums due for the first year \u2014 left a balance of $10.68 (credited on her claim) as the amount of premiums unpaid for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>year beginning October 19,1922, and that by these payments the policy was continued in force at least until September 8,1923. Delivery of the policy by its agents and the receipt by it of all premiums due for the first year, ending October 19,1922, was admitted by defendant, but it denied that it received any payment's on account of premiums for the ensuing year and' contended that plaintiff had not introduced any evidence from which a waiver by it of the provisions of the policy relative to the effect of the non-payment of, premiums when due, or within the period of grace provided for, or of the provision that no agent may \u201cwaive any forfeiture,\u201d could legally be inferred. As plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and testimony showed that no payment on account of premiums for the year in question was made to defendant\u2019s agent until November 22, 1922, (which was beyond the period of grace), we are required to consider whether there was any evidence on behalf of plaintiff justifying the trial judge\u2019s refusal of defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The application for the policy was made on October 17, 1921, and it was averred in the third paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s statement that on that date defendant had in the city of Johnstown \u201cagents, who were duly authorized by defendant to 'solicit policies or contracts of insurance; to deliver to purchasers policies or contracts of insurance; to receive payment of premiums on such policies or contracts of insurance; and to receipt for same,\u201d and the names of the alleged agents were set out in the fourth paragraph of the statement. At the trial it was admitted by counsel for defendant that \u201cthe agents of the defendant company in the city of Johnstown were known as the Keystone General Insurance Agency, composed of Julius Fisher and Moses B. Silverstone, and that Martin A. Haluska was an employe of the said Fisher and Silverstone, acting under them,\u201d and that these agents \u201cwere authorized to solicit policies of insurance, collect the first annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>premium thereon, and......that they had the authority to deliver contracts of insurance and the authority to receipt for the first' annual premium. \u2019 \u2019 The insurance contract was called an \u201cEndowment Bond\u201d and provided for \u201cthe payment in advance of Ohe Hundred One Dollars Sixty Cents for one year\u2019s insurance from the date [thereof].\u201d It was further stipulated that the bond would be renewed \u201cat the end of tthe first year as an insurance for the whole period of life from-that date, subject to the payment in advance of One Hundred One Dollars Sixty Cents on the 19th day^of October, 1922, and the payment of a like amount thereafter on every anniversary of this bond until twenty full years\u2019 premiums, including the first, shall have-been paid hereon to the company, or until the prior death of the purchaser.\u201d On the back of the policy there\" was an endorsement to the effect that the premium might be paid \u201cin semi-annual instalments of Fifty-two and 81/100 dollars each, due on the 19th day of October and April in each and every year during the premium paying period of this contract.\u201d \u25a0 The contract contained the following provision's with respect to the payment of premiums and the effect of non-payment: \u201cAll premiums are payable in advance at the home office of the company, but will be accepted if paid to an agent authorized to receive the same in exchange fofi a receipt signed by the treasurer or secretary, and countersigned by such agent....... If any premium or instalment thereof be not paid before the end of the period of grace, then this bond shall immediately cea'se and become void, and all premiums previously paid shall be forfeited to the company, except as provided in this bond. In the event of death, any unpaid portion of the premium for the then current contract-year shall be considered an indebtedness to the company against this bond.\u201d Manifestly, the last paragraph means death while the policy is in force, by reason of the payment of the first, and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>fore payment of the second, semi-annual premium in any year.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">The period of grace was fixed in the following paragraph in the contract: \u201cIn the payment of any premium under this policy, except the first, a' grace of one month (but not less than thirty days) will be allowed, during which time the policy will remain in force; but any such overdue premium shall be considered in default. If death occurs within the grace period the unpaid premium for the then current policy year shall be deducted from the amount of insurance payable.\u201d It is to be noted that if the premium remained unpaid at the expiration of the period of grace the policy would lapse by its own terms without any affirmative act of forfeiture on the part of defendant: Lantz v. Vermont Life Ins. Co., 139 Pa. 546; McDonald v. Columbian Nat. Life Ins. Co., 253 Pa. 239; Cooper v. Belt Automobile Indemnity Assn., 79 Pa. Superior Ct. 479. As the death did not occur during the period of grace and as the defendant admitted that the semi-annual premiums due October 19,1921, and April 19,1922, Avere received by it, we may confine our consideration to the evidence relative to payments on account of premiums for the year beginning October 19, 1922. Under the contract $52.84 was due and payable on that date and a like sum on April 19,1923. Bc'solving all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the plaintiff and giving her the benefit of <em>every </em>inference reasonably deducible ther\u00e9from, we may treat these facts as established. No payment was made on account of the semi-annual payment due October 19, 1922, until November 22, 1922, oh which date $30 wa's paid to defendant\u2019s agents at JohnstoAvn by an uncle of the insured, who received from the agents what may be described as an informal memorandum, on a printed form, stating that the premium due on October 19, 1922, was $52.84 and containing on the back thereof the endorsement \u201cPaid $30. Countersigned: F,\u201d This initial was placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>paper by a stenographer named Fuller who had authority to sign for Fisher, the agent. The memorandum also contained the following notice: \u201cThis receipt is not binding unless countersigned by the manager of this company or by an agent duly authorized to receive the within described premium.\u201d It was not signed \u201cby the treasurer or secretary [of the company]\u201d as provided for in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">The next semi-annual payment of $52.84 became due and payable April 19, 1923, but no further payment was made on account of premiums until April 23,1923, when $60 was paid by plaintiff\u2019s husband in behalf of the insured to the agents of defendant at Johnstown and a memorandum upon the same form as that above described was given by them, which contained the endorsement: \u201cPaid on account $60. Balance due $68.52. Countersigned: F.\u201d Neither of these informal receipt's was dated, and neither of these payments is included in the admission of defendant\u2019s counsel relative, to payments made by the insured, himself. There was evidence on behalf of defendant that under date of January 16, 1923, the insured \u2019signed a written statement with respect to his then condition of health \u201cfor the purpose and as the basis of reinstating\u201d the policy, and that defendant declined to consider this application because the insured\u2019s occupation had become more hazardous and defendant had information that he was then \u2019suffering from tuberculosis. On the part of plaintiff the, authenticity of this paper was denied, and, in view of the verdict, we disregard this paper and the reasons assigned by defendant for declining to give it favorable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We have then the case of a policy, which, under its provisions, lapsed on November 20, 1922, by reason of non-payment of premium\u2019s and proof of two payments on account of premiums for the then current contract year made, subsequent to that date but prior to the death of the insured, to the agents of defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>There is, however, no evidence tracing these payments into the hands of the defendant company. Could a jury properly be permitted to find from the evidence we have summarized that defendant had waived the provision in the policy that its obligation would <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>cease and become void\u201d if any premium or instalment thereof was not paid before the end of the period of grace? Clearly not, unless the acts of defendant\u2019s agents at Johnstown in accepting the payments we have referred to after the policy had lapsed were binding upon it and were sufficient evidence of a waiver by it to go to the jury. \u201cThe underlying element which opens the question of implied waiver to the jury is that the insurer has done some act or pursued some course of conduct which tended to mislead the insured\u201d: Brown v. Penna. Casualty Co., 207 Pa. 609, 611. We have held that acceptance and retention by the insurer of a past due premium is sufficient evidence of a waiver to take the case to the jury: Malchinsky v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 90 Pa. Superior Ct. 1. The difference between that case and the one now before us lies in the fact that here the plaintiff has not traced the payments into the hands of the defendant. Plaintiff contends that payment to the agent was payment to the principal and that the acts of the agent in accepting the money were binding on the defendant. The answer to this is to be found in the policy, which provides that \u201cNo agent is authorized to make, alter or discharge this contract, waive any forfeiture thereof, make any contract binding on the company, accept any note in payment of any premium, extend the time for paying the same, nor to assume its payment.\u201d It is true that a clause providing that an agent may not waive any provision of the policy may itself be waived (Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. v. Norton, 96 U. S. 234), but there must be some evidence of acts or declarations of the company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>or of its general officers, indicating such, a waiver: Murphy v. Prudential Ins. Co., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 560, 566. There is not a particle of evidence indicating in any way that the company had waived, or intended to waive, either the limitation upon the authority of its agents contained in the policy, or the provisions written therein with respect to the effect of a failure to pay premiums within the period of grace. It follows that defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions should have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The judgment is reversed and is here entered for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
