After review of the trial court\u2019s findings, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The trial court was directed on remand to: (1) determine whether defendant Albert O. Homer\u2019s retirement package was earned during the course of the marriage, and if so, determine whether division of the retirement package was equitable; (2) make further findings of fact regarding its determination that the marital assets of the parties should be divided fifty-five percent to defendant and forty-five percent to plaintiff Jane E. McNamara; and (3) determine, on the basis of the expanded record, the equitable disposition of the marital assets in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In a divorce action, this Court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings is limited to clear error. <em>Sparks v Sparks, </em>440 Mich 141, 151; 485 NW2d 893 (1992); <em>Beason v Beason, </em>435 Mich 791, 805; 460 NW2d 207 (1990); <em>Pelton v Belton, </em>167 Mich App 22, 25; 421 NW2d 560 (1988). A finding is clearly erroneous if, after a review of the entire record, the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Beason, supra </em>at 802; <em>Draggoo v Draggoo, </em>223 Mich App 415, 429; 566 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>NW2d 642 (1997). If the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are upheld, we then must decide whether the dispositive ruling was fair and equitable in light of those facts. <em>Sparks, supra </em>at 151-152; <em>Welling v Welling, </em>233 Mich App 708, 709; 592 NW2d 822 (1999); <em>Draggoo, supra </em>at 429. A dispositional ruling is discretionary and should be affirmed unless this Court is left with the firm conviction that the division was inequitable. <em>Sands v Sands, </em>442 Mich 30, 34; 497 NW2d 493 (1993); <em>Welling, supra </em>at 709-710; <em>Draggoo, supra </em>at 429-430. Further, assets earned by a spouse during the marriage, whether they are received during the existence of the marriage or after the judgment of divorce, are properly considered part of the marital estate. <em>Vander Veen v Vander Veen, </em>229 Mich App 108, 110; 580 NW2d 924 (1998); <em>Byington v Byington, </em>224 Mich App 103, 110; 568 NW2d 141 (1997). Generally, marital assets are subject to division between the parties, but the parties\u2019 separate assets may not be invaded. <em>Reeves v Reeves, </em>226 Mich App 490, 494; 575 NW2d 1 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The trial court made several findings of fact with regard to defendant\u2019s retirement package, which included a consulting agreement, a nondisclosure agreement, an agreement not to compete, and a release agreement. The trial court concluded that the consulting agreement, nondisclosure agreement, and agreement not to compete all related to future employment by defendant, and that although the agreements were signed during the latter part of the marriage, the compensation was defendant\u2019s separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>asset and appropriately excluded from the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\">The trial court\u2019s findings in this regard are not clearly erroneous, because although the agreement was signed during the marriage, defendant\u2019s compensation from the package was not earned during the course of the marriage. Because the compensation was not earned during the marriage, it is not a marital asset. See <em>Byington, supra </em>at 110. The trial court also did not clearly err in finding that the release agreement was part of the marital estate, because the net proceeds were accrued during the course of the marriage. <em>Id. </em>In addition to these findings, the trial court further determined that the parties\u2019 bonuses for years 1996 and 1997, and that portion of the nbd account that did not relate to income from the consulting agreement, were, marital assets. We conclude that these finding are also not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In addition, the trial court found that the income from the release agreement, the portion of the NBD account not related to the consulting agreement, and the 1996 and 1997 bonuses of the parties were marital assets that should be divided equally by the parties. The trial court reaffirmed its finding that the remaining assets should be divided fifty-five percent to defendant and forty-five percent to plaintiff. In support of this conclusion, the trial court noted that premarital assets had been excluded from the property division, that defendant was responsible for a larger percentage of the increase of the parties\u2019 marital assets due to his income, and that plaintiff has significant, increased earning potential during the course of her career and an ability to thus maintain her standard of living, whereas defendant might have to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>on assets to continue to maintain his standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On the basis of the expanded record, we cannot find the trial court\u2019s asset distribution to be inequitable. Therefore, because such dispositional rulings are discretionary, <em>Sands, supra, </em>we do not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-6\">Zahra, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b684-7\">White, P.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMZJ\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in </em>par\u00ed). I join in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s findings on remand should be affirmed. I write separately because while the trial court\u2019s general conclusions are sound, it is unclear on this record whether the resulting judgment should be affirmed. Specifically, while the trial court determined that the parties\u2019 bonuses for 1996 and 1997 should be treated as marital property, and split equally, and that the NBD bank account should be awarded solely to Albert O. Homer to the extent it represented money received from the consulting agreement, with the remainder split equally, the court did not state any numbers, and did not resolve all remaining disputes. While the court stated that defendant\u2019s 1996 and 1997 bonuses should be treated as marital property and divided equally, defendant\u2019s counsel appeared to assert that the bonuses were paid as part of the consulting agreement that was treated as his separate property. The court left this issue open, so that it is unclear whether the ultimate judgment will award plaintiff one-half of defendant\u2019s bonuses for those years. Also, the accounting for the nbd account was left unresolved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>so that it is unclear how the judgment will actually divide the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">Under the circumstances, I would affirm the court\u2019s opinion as far as it goes, and remand with instructions to make specific findings regarding the actual distribution of the nbd account and the bonuses, and authorize the court to enter an amended judgment on remand, which this Court can then review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
