We conclude that \u00a7 52-146r, if applied retroactively, would not prevent the disclosure of the documents at issue, and that the action of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) was constitutionally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The plaintiffs, Katherine Maxwell, the controller of the town of Windham, and the town of Windham, appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court affirming the decision of the commission ordering the disclosure of certain documents pursuant to the act. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. Pursuant to the act, the defendant Steven Edelman<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requested disclosure by the plaintiffs of \u201call [of the town\u2019s] legal bills, receipts, itemized statements and similar instruments since 1994.\u201d Maxwell informed Edelman that while some of these records were available for inspection, certain billing invoices of the Windham town counsel, Richard Cody, were exempt from disclosure because they involved pending litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Edelman subsequently filed a complaint with the commission requesting that the plaintiffs be compelled to disclose the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The plaintiffs claimed before the commission that the invoices were exempt from disclosure pursuant to two exemptions in the act. The first exemption claimed was based on \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10), which shields from disclosure, among other things, \u201ccommunications privileged by the attorney-client relationship . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs also claimed exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (4), which bars disclosure of \u201c[rjecords pertaining to strategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims or pending litigation to which the public agency is a party until such litigation or claim has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The commission first concluded that the plaintiffs had not proven that the invoices \u201ccontain confidential communications within the meaning of the attorney-client privilege exemption\u201d under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10). With respect to the second claimed exemption, the commission concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to prove that the counsel bills pertain to strategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims or pending litigation within the meaning of \u00a7 1-210 (b) (4) . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the commission ordered the plaintiffs to disclose the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The plaintiffs then appealed from the final decision of the commission to the trial court. They claimed, inter alia, that \u00a7 52-146r, which took effect after the commission rendered its decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> should be applied retroactively and required reversal of the decision of the commission. They also contended that \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) constituted an unconstitutional delegation to the commission of the authority to define the attorney-client privilege in violation of the separation of powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>doctrine. The trial court rejected both claims and affirmed the decision of the commission. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The first issue that we address is whether the enactment of \u00a7 52-146r requires reversal of the decision of the commission. The plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 52-146r, which provides that the attorney-client privilege applies to communications between government attorneys and the public agencies by which they are employed, should apply retroactively to the commission\u2019s decision, and that such application would result in reversal of the decision that the invoices were not subject to the attorney-client privilege. The commission claims that \u00a7 52-146r was a substantive change in the law and thus must be applied prospectively only. We conclude that the language and legislative history of \u00a7 52-146r demonstrate that the statute was intended to codify the preexisting law pertaining to the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, irrespective of whether \u00a7 52-146r applies prospectively or retroactively, that statute does not require reversal of the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our examination of this issue. Determining the effect of \u00a7 52-146r on the decision of the commission is an issue of statutory construction. Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision therefore is plenary. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>252 Conn. 79, 84, 743 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">When construing a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 52-146r (b), which provides: \u201cIn any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding, all confidential communications shall be privileged and a government attorney shall not disclose any such communications unless an authorized representative of the public agency consents to waive the privilege and allow such disclosure.\u201d The term \u201c[confidential communications\u201d is defined in \u00a7 52-146r (a) (2) as \u201call oral and written communications transmitted in confidence between a public official or employee of a public agency acting in the performance of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment and a government attorney relating to legal advice sought by the public agency or a public official or employee of such public agency from that attorney, and all records prepared by the government attorney in furtherance of the rendition of such legal advice . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 52-146r, we held in <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>245 Conn. 149, 158, 714 A.2d 664 (1998), that the attorney-client privilege applies to communications between a municipality and its attorney. In adopting the test previously employed by the Appellate Court in that case; <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>44 Conn. App. 611, 620-21, 691 A.2d 29 (1997); we defined the privilege as follows: \u201c[Communications to an attorney for a public agency are protected from disclosure by privilege if the following conditions are met: (1) the attorney must be acting in a professional capacity for the agency, (2) the communications must be made to the attorney by current employees or officials of the agency, (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>communications must relate to the legal advice sought by the agency from the attorney, and (4) the communications must be made in confidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">A comparison of our articulation of the privilege in <em>Shew </em>and the language of \u00a7 52-146r demonstrates that the essential elements of the common-law and statutoiy privileges are identical. At their core, both the common-law and statutoiy privileges protect those communications between a public official or employee and an attorney that are confidential, made in the course of the professional relationship that exists between the attorney and his or her public agency client, and relate to legal advice sought by the agency from the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 52-146r buttresses our conclusion that that statute merely codifies the common-law attorney-client privilege. Representative Paul R. Doyle, a proponent of the bill that ultimately became \u00a7 52-146r, made the following remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives: \u201cWhat this bill does is it clarifies, recently the Connecticut Supreme Court determined that clearly a municipality and a lawyer have [an] attorney-client privilege agreement too. But the trouble is that does not clarify whether or not state officials and their attorneys have an attorney-client privilege. The overall attorney-client privilege is basically a common law right. And this just clarifies that there is a statutory attorney-client privilege between a state official and an employee.\u201d 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1999 Sess., pp. 3609-10. Representative Doyle\u2019s remarks make clear the legislature\u2019s intention that \u00a7 52-146r merely codify the common-law attorney-client privilege as this court previously had defined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The commission correctly applied the common-law attorney-client privilege in concluding that the invoices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>were not exempt from disclosure. Although the commission did not refer to our decision in <em>Shew </em>explicitly, the commission in its final decision cited <em>LaFaive </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>2 Conn. App. 58, 476 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 801, 477 A.2d 1021 (1984), and <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Conn. 698, 647 A.2d 324 (1994), in setting forth the elements of the attomey-clientprivilege. <em>Shew, LaFaive </em>and <em>Ullmann </em>all enunciate the same well established common-law elements of the attomey-clientprivilege; \u00a7 52-146r merely codified those elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It is therefore unnecessary to decide the issue of whether \u00a7 52-146r applies prospectively or retroactively. That statute, even if applied retroactively, would not affect the legal standard that the commission applied in deciding that the invoices were not protected by the attorney-client privilege. We therefore reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 52-146r requires reversal of the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 second contention, namely, that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10), violated the separation of powers doctrine embodied in article second of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10), by delegating to the commission the authority to define the attorney-client privilege, unconstitutionally intruded upon the authority of the judicial branch. We conclude that \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) does not delegate such authority to the commission, and therefore we disagree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is premised upon the assumption that in \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10), the legislature has delegated to the commission the authority to define, and therefore eviscerate, the attorney-client privilege. Section 1-210 (b) (10) does not, however, in its language or operation, support that assumption. The statute in no way addresses the authority of the commission. Instead, \u00a7 1-210 (b) simply provides that \u201c[n]othing in the [act] shall be construed to require disclosure of . . . (10) . . . communications privileged by the attorney-client relationship . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">At the time the commission rendered its decision in the present case, there was no extant statutory definition of \u201ccommunications privileged by the attorney-client relationship . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10). The fact that this phrase was left undefined, however, does not mean that the commission was given a blank slate upon which to formulate its own definition of the privilege. \u201cIn the absence of guidance from the language of the statute or the legislative history, we look to common law principles .... It is assumed that all legislation is interpreted in light of the common law at the time of its enactment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 153, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996); see also <em>Madison Hills Ltd. Partnership II </em>v. <em>Madison Hills, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 81, 91, 644 A.2d 363, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 913, 648 A.2d 153 (1994). The scope of the exemption for attorney-client privileged communications under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) prior to the enactment of \u00a7 52-146r was therefore defined by reference to the common-law privilege. Thus, the statute simply reinforces the notion that the commission, in rendering its decisions, must apply and respect the privilege when it is asserted. Moreover, any improper failure by the commission to apply the privilege would be subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Our construction of \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) is bolstered by the legislative history of the act. As we noted in <em>Rules </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Committee of the Superior Court </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 234, 240, 472 A.2d 9 (1984), the legislative history of the act expresses a concern with preserving the independence of the judicial branch and avoiding potential separation of powers issues that could arise from conflicts between the act and the prerogatives of the judicial branch. Our conclusion that \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) does not delegate to the commission the authority to define the attorney-client privilege sidesteps a potential clash between the act and the judicial branch, and therefore respects the legislative concern for the independence of the judicial branch. Finally, our conclusion is supported by the well established canon of statutory construction that \u201cwhen presented with a constitutional challenge to a validly enacted statute . . . [we must] construe the statute, if possible, to comport with the constitution\u2019s requirements.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Because we conclude that \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) does not invest the commission with the authority to formulate the attorney-client privilege, we need not address the issue of whether such a delegation is consistent with article second of the constitution of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-146r provides: \u201c(a) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u201c(1) \u2018Authorized representative\u2019 means an individual empowered by a public agency to assert the confidentiality of communications that are privileged under this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">\u201c(2) \u2018Confidential communications\u2019 means all oral and written communications transmitted in confidence between a public official or employee of a public agency acting in the performance of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment and a government attorney relating to legal advice sought by the public agency or a public official or employee of such public agency from that attorney, and all records prepared by the government attorney in furtherance of the rendition of such legal advice;</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">\u201c(3) \u2018Government attorney\u2019 means a person admitted to the bar of this state and employed by a public agency or retained by a public agency or public official to provide legal advice to the public agency or a public official or employee of such public agency; and</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">\u201c(4) \u2018Public agency\u2019 means \u2018public agency\u2019 as defined in section 1-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">\u201c(b) In any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding, all confidential communications shall be privileged and a government attorney shall not disclose any such communications unless an authorized representative of the public agency consents to waive the privilege and allow such disclosure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-16\"> When the proceedings in this case began in 1998, the act was codified at General Statutes \u00a7 1-7 et seq.
