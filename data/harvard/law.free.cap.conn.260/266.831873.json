Cellco\u2019s application proposed to share the tower with four other wireless telecommu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>nication service providers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including both cellular and noncellular providers. The council approved the application following three public hearings held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-50m,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at which the town participated and opposed Cellco\u2019s application. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>four other service providers participated as intervenors in the council proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The council\u2019s decision approving the application was predicated on its determination that it had jurisdiction over the proposed facility because the facility would be \u201cused in a cellular system\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 16-50i (a) (6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the council asserted that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-50x (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>it had <em>exclusive </em>authority, maintaining that the town does not retain jurisdiction to enforce its own municipal laws, despite the fact that the proposed tower would have both cellular <em>and </em>noncellular attachments. In addressing the merits of whether to issue the certificate, the council found that Cellco\u2019s existing facilities in the area did not provide adequate coverage or capacity in the northern portion of the town and noted similar deficiencies by the other carriers. The council determined that shared access to the tower by the cellular and noncellular service providers would be consistent with state law and policy promoting shared use. With regard to the potential environmental impact of the facility, the council made extensive findings supporting its conclusions that \u201c[development of the . . . site would involve minimal land disturbance and would not substantially alter the character of the natural resources including wetlands and watercourse, vegetative composition, and wildlife habitats. Furthermore, there are no environmental constraints at this site [that] would justify denial of this site.\u201d Finally, in response to concerns raised by the town, in order to minimize the impact on the residential neighborhood, the scenic quality of the Merritt Parkway and the Poplar Plains brook that traversed the proposed site, the council ordered that the tower be reduced in height and relocated on the lot further away from the inland wetlands and the watercourse than proposed by C\u00e9lico.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Following the council\u2019s approval of the application and grant of the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need, subject to certain conditions, C\u00e9lico <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>proceeded with plans to construct the approved tower. It submitted the certificate to the town zoning enforcement officer in order to receive the zoning certification necessary to obtain a building permit. The zoning officer informed C\u00e9lico that its failure to comply with the town\u2019s zoning regulations prevented the issuance of the permit. C\u00e9lico appealed from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision to the zoning board of appeals, which thereafter denied the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 4-183 and 16-50q,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the town appealed from the council\u2019s decision approving Cellco\u2019s application for the certificate of environmental compatibility, and pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 and 8-10,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> C\u00e9lico appealed from the zoning board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>appeals\u2019 decision denying its appeal from the zoning officer\u2019s denial of its application for a certificate of zoning compliance. See <em>Westport </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>47 Conn. Sup. 382, 797 A.2d 655 (2001). Because the claims overlapped, the trial court consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The trial court first considered Cellco\u2019s claim that, because the council has exclusive jurisdiction over the siting of a telecommunications tower, pursuant to the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act, and the town had no direct role in the siting process, the town was not aggrieved and, therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the town\u2019s appeal. See <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 729, 573 A.2d 736 (1990) (party must be aggrieved to have standing to bring administrative appeal). The trial court rejected that contention, however, concluding that, because, under the town\u2019s theory, a mixed use of cellular <em>and </em>noncellular providers, as in this case, would allow the town to apply its local laws and ordinances, the decision of the council interfering with the town\u2019s rights made it an aggrieved party.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Turning to the merits of the consolidated appeals, the trial court addressed the issue of whether the council improperly asserted its exclusive authority in locating the tower and, concomitantly, whether the zoning board of appeals improperly denied Cellco\u2019s appeal from the denial of its application for a certificate of zoning compliance necessary for the issuance of a building permit. The trial court determined, based upon its reading of \u00a7\u00a7 16-50x (a) and 16-50i (a) (6),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in conjunction with General Statutes \u00a7 16-50p (b) (1) (B) and (b) (2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the legislature intended to give the council exclusive jurisdiction over telecommunication towers, including those that are shared by cellular and noncellular carriers. The trial court next considered the town\u2019s argument that the council\u2019s actions were procedurally and substantively illegal. Applying a limited standard of review pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (j), the court examined whether the council\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether its decision approving the application subject to certain modifications reflected a proper application of the pertinent statutory factors set forth in the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act. Concluding that the council\u2019s actions were proper, the trial court next turned to the town\u2019s procedural claim that the council had acted improperly by deferring any consideration of the town\u2019s zoning regulations until after the council\u2019s approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>application for the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need. Following its examination of the record before the council, which included testimony and exhibits relating to the town\u2019s zoning and other regulatory concerns, the court rejected the town\u2019s procedural claim, concluding that the council had recognized the town\u2019s concerns, including the factors encompassing environmental and residential objections, prior to the application approval, as evidenced, in part, by it conditioning its approval on Cellco\u2019s compliance with some of the town\u2019s recommendations. Accordingly, the trial court, in separate judgments, dismissed the town\u2019s appeal and sustained Cellco\u2019s appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Our careful examination of the record, coupled with the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgments of the trial court should be affirmed. The question of aggrievement, and the issues pertaining to whether the council\u2019s jurisdiction was exclusive and whether there existed any prejudicial procedural impropriety, were properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. See <em>Westport </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>supra, 47 Conn. Sup. 392-408. Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. Accordingly, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>National Safety Associates, Inc., </em>241 Conn. 278, 282, 694 A.2d 795 (1997); <em>Molnar </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>239 Conn. 233, 235, 685 A.2d 1107 (1996); <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>232 Conn. 57, 64, 653 A.2d 151 (1995); <em>Advanced Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 378, 380-81, 650 A.2d 540 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> The plaintiff in the first case, the town of Westport, and the defendant in the second case, the zoning board of appeals of the town of Westport, appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgments to the Appellate Court. We then transferred the consolidated appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\"> The other providers are: Springwich Cellular limited Partnership (Springwich); Sprint Spectrum, L.P., doing business as Sprint PCS (Sprint); Nextel Communications of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc., doing business as Nextel Communications (Nextel); and Omnipoint Communications, Inc.
