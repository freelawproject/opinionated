J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6N\">This appeal arises out of a dispute between, on one side, the named testamentary guardians of a neglected child and, on the other side, the department of children and families (department) and the child\u2019s foster parents. After a trial to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the disposition of the child, the trial court rendered judgment appointing the foster parents as the child\u2019s custodians and the department as the child\u2019s statutory parent. The testamentary guardians appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The testamentary guardians, Chad P. and Sara P. (Ps), claim on appeal that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the petitioner, which was the department, and the foster parents, Aldo V. and Lisa V. (Vs), had rebutted the presumption that it would be in the best interests of the minor child, Joshua S., to permit the Ps to serve as guardians even though the trial court found them to be fit, suitable and worthy custodians for Joshua S.; (2) vested care and personal custody of Joshua S. with the Vs, on the sole basis of the bond that existed between Joshua S. and the Vs, even though that bond was allowed to form and solidify solely as a result of the misconduct and improper actions of the department; (3) concluded that the department should be appointed as Joshua S.\u2019 statutoiy parent after determining that the department had engaged in misconduct; (4) concluded that the Superior Court, rather than the Probate Court, had authority to appoint a statutory parent for Joshua S.; and (5) denied the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. During the early morning hours of June 10, 1999, Kelly S., a woman with a long history of psychiatric problems,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stabbed to death her husband, Charles S., in the bedroom of their East Hartford home. Awakened by the screams of Charles S., Kelly S.\u2019 then nine year old daughter, Jessica M., ran into the same bedroom, where Kelly S. then began to stab her repeat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>edly. Jessica M. ran from the bedroom and down the hall, while being pursued by Kelly S. Kelly S. then doused herself, Jessica M. and a bedroom with gasoline, and set the house on fire. Kelly S. and Charles S., as well as two of their children, Jennifer S., nearly three years old, and Jonah S., one and one-half years old, died in the conflagration. Their son, Joshua S., then two months old, survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Jessica M. managed to escape and ran from the house across the street to the home of the Ps, who were neighbors and friends of Kelly S. and Charles S. Awakened upon hearing screams for help, the Ps witnessed \u201ca blaze of fire\u201d running toward their house. After recognizing the individual as Jessica M. and seeing that her hair was on fire, Sara P. instructed her to roll on the Ps\u2019 front lawn. Sara P. also threw water on her to help put out the fire. In the meantime, Chad P. telephoned for emergency assistance. As Sara P. pulled Jessica M. into the house, Jessica M. stated, \u201c[m]y Mommy had a nightmare and she killed my Daddy.\u201d Soon thereafter, Sara P. noticed that her arms were covered in blood from Jessica M.\u2019s multiple stab wounds. Sara P. then locked the front door and got blankets to wrap Jessica M. During this horrific ordeal, the Ps\u2019 five year old son, Caleb, had gotten out of his bed and witnessed Sara P. tending to the burned and bleeding Jessica M.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Thereafter, emergency assistance arrived and paramedics tended to Jessica M. in the Ps\u2019 living room for approximately twenty minutes before transporting her by ambulance to the Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center (hospital), where she underwent surgery to close up the sixty-one stab wounds she had suffered. At some point, Sara P. told the firefighters where in the house the members of the S. family slept. Soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>thereafter, a firefighter rescued Joshua S., carried him out of the burning house to the front lawn and began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Joshua S. also was taken by ambulance to the hospital for further treatment and hospitalization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On June 11, 1999, because Joshua S. and Jessica M. were both in critical condition and had no one to make decisions for them on medical issues and other matters, the department filed in the Superior Court a petition to have them adjudicated as neglected and uncared-for dependent children, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120, 46b-121 and 46b-129, and a motion for temporary custody, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>relied on by the department were that the children were neglected, uncared-for and abused, that their parents were now deceased, and that the children were now homeless and in need of a legal guardian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An ex parte order of temporary custody was issued on June 11, 1999. Thereafter, on June 18, 1999, at a hearing before the Superior Court, <em>Dyer, J., </em>the department alerted the court that mirror wills executed by Charles S. and Kelly S. had been located in their home and that the wills named the Ps as testamentary guardians for Joshua S. The court was further made aware that Chad P. had been approached by the department but had indicated to the department that he and Sara P. were not interested in assuming custody of Joshua S.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Thereafter, on June 18,1999, the trial court reaffirmed the ex parte order of temporary custody. Upon his discharge from the hospital on June 22, 1999, Joshua S. was placed in the temporary care of the Vs.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">On July 19, 1999, a contested hearing was held in Probate Court concerning the wills of Charles S. and Kelly S. The Probate Court ultimately admitted both wills to probate. Because of the pendency of the neglect petition in the Superior Court, however, the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Court declined to address the issue of Joshua S.\u2019 guardianship, despite the Ps having been named as testamentary guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On July 23, 1999, the department filed a motion with the Superior Court seeking to be appointed as Joshua S.\u2019 statutory parent for the purpose of facilitating his adoption, as well as for continuing the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for approval of adoption, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-623, 46b-121 (b), 45a-725 (a) and 45a-718 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On July 28, 1999, the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>granted intervenor status, for dispositional purposes only, to the Vs, who are Joshua S.\u2019 foster parents, and to the Ps, because they were named in his parents\u2019 wills as testamentary guardians.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, by the agreement of all parties, the Superior Court found, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that Joshua S. was neglected by his parents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On October 15,1999, another hearing was held before the Superior Court to address various pending motions, including the department\u2019s motion to appoint itself as Joshua S.\u2019 statutory parent and the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>mately denied the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss, relying on <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 366, 488 A.2d 790 (1985), where this court determined that, once a child is adjudicated neglected, the Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction over matters concerning guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Thereafter, a trial on the dispositional phase of the neglect proceeding was held between July 31,2000, and August 8, 2000. The trial court named the Vs as Joshua S.\u2019 custodians and granted the department\u2019s motion to be appointed statutory parent for the purpose of facilitating his adoption by the Vs. The Ps appealed to the Appellate Court from that judgment. This court transferred this appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">We first consider whether the trial court improperly denied the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the Ps claim that jurisdiction over the appointment of testamentary guardians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>is vested exclusively with the Probate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-596. The department and the Vs claim, conversely, that \u00a7 46b-129, read in conjunction with our decision in <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>supra, 195 Conn. 366, confers exclusive jurisdiction over Joshua S. on the Superior Court, because he was adjudicated as neglected. We agree with the department and the Vs and conclude that the Superior Court properly denied the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Immediately after Joshua S. arrived at the hospital during the early morning hours of June 11, 1999, the hospital and the East Hartford police department requested that the department intervene to address Joshua S.\u2019 needs, because he was critically injured. That day, the department filed with the Superior Court a neglect petition on behalf of Joshua S., alleging that he was suffering from serious physical injury and was in need of a legal guardian. The same day, the Superior Court granted the petition and ordered the department to assume temporary custody and care over Joshua S.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Also on June 11,1999, the department learned of the existence of the reciprocal wills of Charles S. and Kelly S. naming the Ps as testamentary guardians, and it informed the Superior Court accordingly. The court was further made aware that Chad P. had been approached by the department but had indicated to the department that he and Sara P. did not wish to assume custody of Joshua S. On July 19, 1999, a contested hearing was held in Probate Court concerning the wills of Charles S. and Kelly S. The Probate Court ultimately admitted both wills to probate, but because of the pendency of the neglect petition in the Superior Court the Probate Court declined to address the issue of Joshua S.\u2019 guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ianship, despite the Ps having been named as testamentary guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The Superior Court later affirmed the June 11 order of temporary custody, and on June 22, 1999, upon his discharge from the hospital, Joshua S. was placed in the temporary care and custody of the Vs. Subsequently, the Ps filed with the Superior Court a motion to dismiss the neglect petition, claiming that the existence of a valid will naming them as testamentary coguardians conferred sole jurisdiction on the Probate Court. The Superior Court denied the motion, concluding that it, rather than the Probate Court, had exclusive jurisdiction over the question of guardianship because a neglect petition had been filed. We agree with the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We begin by addressing the appropriate standard of review. \u201cA determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>246 Conn. 652, 660, 717 A.2d 706 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The Ps rely solely on General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 45a-596 as the basis of their jurisdictional claim. General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 45a-596 (a) provides that \u201c[t]he surviving parent<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of any minor may by will appoint a person or persons as guardian or coguardians of the person of such minor, a guardian or coguardians of the estate or both. Such appointment shall not super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>sede the previous appointment of a guardian made by the court of probate having jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The only Connecticut case construing \u00a7 45a-596 is the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em>24 Conn. App. 402, 589 A.2d 1 (1991). That case, however, did not speak to the issue of jurisdiction. Rather, the Appellate Court in <em>Bristol </em>held only that \u201c\u00a7 45a-596 (a) should be interpreted as mandating the appointment of the sole surviving parent\u2019s testamentary choice of a guardian because it should be presumed that the best interests of the child are served by that appointment. This presumption, like that of [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-56b, may be rebutted only by a showing that it would be detrimental to the child to permit the named testamentary guardian to serve as such.\u201d Id., 406. Consequently, neither <em>Bristol </em>nor \u00a7 45a-596 itself stand for the proposition urged by the Ps that the Probate Court, rather than the Superior Court, is vested with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We do have guidance on this issue, however. Ornease law instructs that when a neglect petition has been filed, the Superior Court has jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129. In <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>supra, 195 Conn. 366, we determined that \u201c[t]he language of \u00a7 46b-129, particularly that of subsection [j],<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> reveals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the General Assembly contemplated a clear distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>between guardianships ordered by the Superior Court in accordance with that provision and those ordered by appointment of the Probate Court. Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 46b-129 [j] as conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the Superior Court to enter \u2018custody-guardianship orders\u2019 in those cases in which there is a \u2018finding and adjudging\u2019 by that court that the \u2018child or youth is uncared-for, neglected or dependent,\u2019 and this finding, moreover, must be the product of a neglect petition filed with the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129. This construction still allows effect to be given those provisions of our statutes that authorize the Probate Court in cases not brought under \u00a7 46b-129 to remove a parent as guardian and then to appoint a guardian of a minor under such statutes as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-43a, 45-44, 45-44c, 45-45.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Superior Court has jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129, the existence of a will appointing a testamentary guardian does not deprive it of that jurisdiction. It is the province of the Superior Court, not the Probate Court, to determine the disposition of a neglected child.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The Ps assert nonetheless that \u201c[t]he Superior Court lacked jurisdiction in this matter not because [Charles S. and Kelly S.] were deceased but because the issue to be decided in this case was whether the Ps were fit to be Joshua [S.\u2019[ guardians as anticipated by the testamentary guardianship provisions of the [parents\u2019] [w]ills.\u201d The Ps misinterpret the issue. Here, the Superior Court had jurisdiction despite the fact that Charles S. and Kelly S. died testate. Although a Probate Court has primary jurisdiction over many issues concerning custody and guardianship, our decision in <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>supra, 195 Conn. 344, makes clear that in cases where a neglect petition is filed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129, as in this case, the Superior Court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction. \u201c[T]he Probate Court does not possess jurisdiction to adjudicate custody-guardianship matters that arise under \u00a7 46b-129 [j]. We add that courts of probate are strictly statutory tribunals and, as such, they have only such powers as are expressly or implicitly conferred upon them by statute. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Alcorn, </em>140 Conn. 96, 100, 99 A.2d 97 (1953)____While it is true that some matters of guardianship are within probate jurisdiction, we point out that \u00a7 46b-129 concerns only \u2018any child or youth [who is adjudged] uncared-for, neglected or dependent\u2019 rather than all matters of guardianship. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 635, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977).\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>supra, 366-67 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The Ps also point out that none of the cases cited by the department and the Vs in support of their position that the Superior Court enjoys exclusive jurisdiction \u201care [w]ill cases involving testamentary guardianship.\u201d The Ps further allege that the Superior Court maintained jurisdiction over the action merely because the department \u201cwon the race to the courthouse.\u201d We disagree. In making this claim the Ps ignore the paramount factual distinction between this case and <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Bondage, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 402, namely that in <em>Bristol, </em>there had been no neglect petition. The extreme and unusual circumstances in this case effectively vested exclusive jurisdiction over this matter with the Superior Court. The violent actions of Kelly S. created an emergency situation necessitating the department\u2019s filing of the neglect petition for the two critically injured and orphaned children. Had this matter been an unfortunate, but uncomplicated, situation wherein both parents had died and their wills were admitted to probate for settlement of their estates, including the determination of guardianship of an orphaned child, original subject matter jurisdiction would be vested in the Probate Court. See <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 328, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987) (Probate Court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over matters involving validity of wills and settlement of estates); 1 W. Locke &amp; P. Kohn, Connecticut Probate Practice (1951) \u00a7 39, pp. 70, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Moreover, we note that, from a practical standpoint, the Ps\u2019 position that jurisdiction rested exclusively with the Probate Court merely because a will, or a statutorily equivalent writing,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> naming a testamentary guardian exists would have an undesirable effect in that it would serve only to add a layer of delay to a time-sensitive matter that would ultimately be under Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>jurisdiction. As a general matter, when a decision of the Probate Court is appealed to the Superior Court, a trial de novo is conducted. See <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 407, citing <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 294, 259 A.2d 621 (1969) (\u201c[i]n an appeal from probate, the trial court exercises the right to make an independent and de novo determination of the issue involved, without regard to the result reached by the Probate Court\u201d). When a neglect petition has been filed, this additional step would directly contravene a child\u2019s need for quick resolution and a permanent placement. We previously have recognized the deleterious effects of prolonged temporary placement. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 292, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983); see also <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 244, 261, 754 A.2d 169 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Accordingly, we recognize that the state had a vital interest in expediting the process. The Superior Court in this case recognized the time-sensitive nature of this matter and properly denied the Ps\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">We next address the Ps\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the department and the Vs had rebutted the presumption that Joshua S.\u2019 best interests are served by the appointment of testamentary guardians. Specifically, the Ps argue that the trial court improperly concluded that the presumption was rebutted because that court found that it would be detrimental to Joshua S. to permit the appointment of the testamentary guardians, despite having found the testamentary guardians to be fit, suitable and worthy custodians for Joshua S. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We begin by setting out the appropriate standard of review. This claim requires us to determine the legal standard for rebutting the presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to appoint the named testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>mentary guardian to serve as such. \u201c[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>[244 Conn. 350, 357, 710 A.2d 717 (1998)]; <em>Jenkins </em>v. Jenkins, [243 Conn. 584, 588, 704 A.2d 231 (1998)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marrocco </em>v. <em>Giardino, </em>255 Conn. 617, 624, 767 A.2d 720 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Applicable Presumption</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The Ps cite <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 402, in support of their argument that there is a presumption that it is in a child\u2019s best interests to allow a named testamentary guardian to serve as such, and that this presumption may be rebutted only by demonstrating that this would be detrimental to the child. The Ps claim further that <em>Bristol </em>dictates that detriment is shown only by demonstrating that the testamentary guardians are not fit to serve as such. While we agree with the Ps that this presumption may be rebutted only by showing that it would be detrimental to the child to permit the named testamentary guardian to serve as such, we disagree with their narrow interpretation of how detriment is demonstrated. We conclude, moreover, that the trial court properly determined that the presumption was rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Some background is helpful to our discussion. Section 45a-596 (a) provides a testamentary vehicle for Connecticut parents to choose guardians for their children. In <em>Bristol, </em>the court considered \u201cwhether a Court of Probate or [the Superior Court] has the power to appoint, as a guardian of a minor child, a person other than the person designated in the will of the child\u2019s sole surviving parent, in the absence of evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the testamentary guardian would not be a suitable guardian.\u201d Id., 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A brief recitation of the relevant facts in <em>Bristol </em>is warranted. \u201cCandace Keeler died testate, leaving a minor son. The will named the plaintiff, her brother, Clayton Bristol, as the guardian of the person and of the estate of her son. The Probate Court of Torrington appointed Bristol and the defendant, Winifred Brundage, the child\u2019s grandmother, as coguardians of the person of the child. . . . The plaintiff appealed from the Probate Court decree to the Superior Court, claiming that the Probate Court had exceeded its authority as granted by General Statutes \u00a7 [45a-596] when it appointed Brundage as a coguaxdian of the person of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u201cThe trial court construed the statute as allowing the appointment by the Probate Court . . . [and] dismissed the appeal without any discussion or finding as to the qualifications of the particular guardians or the best interests of the child.\u201d Id., 403-404. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the appeal from probate and determined that the defendant should not have been appointed as coguardian. Id., 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiff should have had an initial advantage over all other potential guardians because he was named in the will as the guardian. See <em>Evans </em>v. Santoro, 6 Conn. App. 707, 711 n.3, 507 A.2d 1007 (1986). Phrased differently, the plaintiff should have had the benefit of a presumption that he should be named the sole guardian of the child.\u201d <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In construing \u00a7 45a-596, the court <em>in Bristol </em>appropriately likened the presumption arising under \u00a7 45a-596 to that arising under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b, which creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of a parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in a custody dispute between a parent and nonparent. Id., 406. In <em>Bristol, </em>the court stated further that the presumption arising under \u00a7 46b-56b may be rebutted by showing that it would be detrimental to the child to be in the custody of the parent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court stated in dicta, however, that the presumption was not rebutted because there was no evidence that the plaintiff \u201cwas not a fit guardian.\u201d Id., 407. Although we agree that evidence that a named testamentary guardian is not fit may demonstrate detriment and, therefore, rebut the presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to allow a testamentary guardian to serve, that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the <em>only </em>type of evidence that would rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In claiming that the trial court was required to find them unfit in order to overcome the presumption that it is in the child\u2019s best interests for the testamentary guardians to serve as such, the Ps urge us to view them as having received the baton of constitutional protections enjoyed by parents. In support of their claim, the Ps cite the long recognized fundamental liberty interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children. See <em>Troxel </em>v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000); <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S. Ct. 438, 88 L. Ed. 645 (1944); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 401, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923). The Ps\u2019 reliance on this line of cases, however, is misplaced. There is a distinction between the situation in <em>Troxel, </em>where the presumably fit parent is still alive, and the situation now facing the court. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In <em>Troxel, </em>the plaintiffs, the paternal grandparents, sought visitation with their two granddaughters in excess of what the defendant, the children\u2019s mother, had allowed. <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 60-61. The defendant and the plaintiffs\u2019 son, the father of the children, had never married. Id., 60. After the plaintiffs\u2019 son and the defendant ended their relationship, the plaintiffs\u2019 son committed suicide. Id. The defendant married another man, who formally adopted the children. Id., 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The Washington statute under review in <em>Troxel </em>allowed any person to petition for visitation rights at any time and authorized the Washington state Superior Courts to grant such rights whenever visitation may serve in the child\u2019s best interests. Id., 60. The United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court, holding that the statute, as applied in that case, violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, because it was an \u201cinfringement on [the defendant\u2019s] fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her two daughters.\u201d Id., 66, 72. In support of this determination, the court reasoned that Washington\u2019s \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d statute permitted a decision concerning visitation made by a fit custodial parent to be overruled on the basis of a Superior Court judge\u2019s determination that visitation with a third party would be in the child\u2019s best interests. Id., 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel, </em>we recently addressed a similar question concerning a nonparent petitioning for visitation in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 789 A.2d 431 (2002), and in <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Pastore, </em>259 Conn. 240, 789 A.2d 453 (2002). Relying on <em>Troxel, </em>we held in these cases that the protected fundamental right of a parent to make child rearing decisions mandates that where a third party seeks visitation, that third party must allege and prove, by clear and convincing evidence, a relationship with the child that is similar in nature to a parent-child relationship, and that denial of the visitation would cause real and significant harm to the child. <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra, 234-35; <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Pastore, </em>supra, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In situations such as in <em>Troxel, Roth </em>and <em>Crockett, </em>where a presumably fit parent is alive, the constitutionally protected interest is that of the ongoing parent-child relationship. \u201c[A] parent\u2019s desire for and right to \u2018the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children\u2019 is an important interest that \u2018undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981), quoting <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972). \u201cChoices about marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children are among associational rights this Court has ranked as \u2018of basic importance in our society,\u2019 <em>[Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 376, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1971)], rights sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State\u2019s unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.\u201d <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 116, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996); see also <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>supra, 262 U.S. 390 (right of parent to establish home, bring up children and control child\u2019s education is liberty guaranteed by fourteenth amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">All of the foregoing cases speak to a liberty right that has its basis in an ongoing relationship between parent and child. In this case, however, this special relationship no longer exists; what remains is a predeath statement by the parents of strong preference for the future regarding who should be guardians for their children. The Ps do not cite and, indeed, we have not discovered, any authority to support the proposition that this fundamental liberty interest of parents survives the death of the parents, much less that it may be passed to testamentary guardians who have had no previous relationship with the child, other than as neighbors. In the case before us, because this special parent-child relationship no longer exists, this constitutionally protected interest, likewise, no longer exists. Therefore, we are not required to give the same deference to a predeath statement of preference as we would were this a decision concerning a child made by a living parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Moreover, we conclude that to recognize the passing of constitutional protections enjoyed by parents to testamentary guardians would effectively preclude the court from considering the best interests of the child. The sole test would be whether the testamentary guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ians were fit to serve with no consideration accorded to the needs of the child. While, at first blush, this may seem to guarantee that the parents\u2019 testamentary wishes concerning guardianship are effectuated, and, therefore, the child\u2019s best interests are presumably met, this bright line scenario ignores the realities of everyday life and the complexities of interpersonal relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Although we recognize the strong public policy in favor of encouraging parents to make testamentary selections in the first instance,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we also acknowledge the fluid nature of interpersonal relationships, as well as the infrequency with which a will is reviewed after its execution. If the fitness of a testamentary guardian was the sole test to demonstrate detriment, a court would have to blind itself to any other considerations concerning the child. For example, it does not require great imagination to envision a situation wherein circumstances arose between the testator and testamentary guardian between the time of a will\u2019s execution and the death of the testator that could have a negative bearing on whether the best interests of the child would be served by granting custody to the testamentary guardian. Accordingly, we conclude that a presumption exists favoring a testamentary guardian named under \u00a7 45a-596 and it is rebuttable by demonstrating, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that it would be detrimental to the child to permit the testamentary guardian to serve as such. See <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>supra, 24 Conn. App. 406; see also <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>257 Conn. 570, 586-87 n.29, 778 A.2d 885 (2001) (preponderance of evidence is standard of proof applicable to vast majority of factual disputes in civil cases); <em>South Windsor </em>v. <em>South Windsor Police Union Local 1480, Council 15, </em>255 Conn. 800, 825, 770 A.2d 14 (2001) (in civil litigation, normal burden of persuasion is preponderance of evidence); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Drska, </em>1 Conn. App. 481, 485-86, 473 A.2d 325 (1984) (burden of proof in ordinary civil case is common preponderance of evidence standard). We conclude further that detriment may be shown, not just by demonstrating unfitness of the testamentary guardian, but by demonstrating considerations that would be damaging, injurious or harmful to the child.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We conclude further that once the presumption is rebutted, the best interests of the child remains as the determinative factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Application of the Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Having determined the appropriate standard for rebutting the presumption arising under \u00a7 45a-596, we now must address whether the trial court properly determined that the presumption was, in fact, rebutted. We conclude that the facts set out in its memorandum of decision support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the presumption was rebutted, thereby leaving the child\u2019s best interests as the determinative factor in deciding custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The following facts are relevant to our discussion of this issue. At trial, testimony was elicited that Chad P., a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>testamentary guardian, in response to the department\u2019s inquiries, had, on more than one occasion, declined to assume guardianship of Joshua S., despite the fact that he had indicated to Joshua S.\u2019 parent that he would do so.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a result, Joshua S. was placed with the Vs. We emphasize that we in no way intend to minimize the psychological trauma suffered by the Ps as a result of their participation in the events of June 10, 1999. Nor do we suggest that it was in any way improper for the Ps to decline guardianship. We do conclude, however, that the fact that the Ps suffered such trauma, and that it affected them so significantly that they felt that they could not assume guardianship of Joshua S., demonstrates, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that it would be damaging, injurious or harmful and, therefore, detrimental to Joshua S. to be placed with the Ps, thereby rebutting the presumption favoring the testamentary guardians.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, we conclude that the department and the Vs demonstrated by a fair preponderance of the evidence that it would be detrimental to Joshua S. for him to be placed with the testamentary guardians and that those facts support the trial court\u2019s determination that the presumption had been rebutted. Having determined that the presumption has been rebutted, we must now address the issue of Joshua S.\u2019 placement by utilizing the best interests of the child standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Best Interests Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The Ps claim specifically that the trial court improperly vested the care and personal custody of Joshua S. with the Vs on the sole basis of the bond that existed between the Vs and Joshua S., even though that bond was allowed to form and solidify solely as a result of the misconduct and improper actions of the department. We determine that, in asserting this claim, the Ps are essentially making a best interests argument. We disagree with the Ps\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in Joshua S.\u2019 best interests to grant custody to the Vs. See <em>Schult </em>v. <em>Schult, </em>241 Conn. 767, 777-78, 699 A.2d 134 (1997) (trial court vested with broad discretion to determine what is in child\u2019s best interests). \u201cThe best interests of the child include the child\u2019s interests in sustained growth, development, well-being, and continuity and stability of its environment. . . . The trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining what is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 33-5 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he judicial authority may admit into evidence any testimony relevant and material to the issue of the disposition, including events occurring through the close of the evidentiary hearing . . . .\u201d Therefore, even if the department\u2019s alleged mishandling of this case eliminated the Ps from consideration in its early stages, resulting in Joshua S. \u2019 temporary placement with the Vs, it was proper for the trial court, in making its ultimate custody determination, to consider that placement. The trial court appropriately could consider any evidence or events that occurred through the close of trial. See <em>In re Sheena I., </em>63 Conn. App. 713, 721, 778 A.2d 997 (2001). Indeed, \u201cthe [trial] court was bound to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the child\u2019s <em>present </em>best interests and not what would have been in [his] best interests at some previous time.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 664, 420 A.2d 875 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The record reveals a number of factors that support the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination granting custody to the Vs. The court-appointed psychologist, Anne Phillips, identified multiple factors that weighed in favor of granting the Vs custody of Joshua S., focusing specifically on the relationship with Joshua S.\u2019 extended family, the ability and inclination of the parties to foster a relationship between Joshua S. and his sister, the parties\u2019 views on corporal punishment and the parties\u2019 differing attitudes toward mental health treatment. We will address these factors in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Testimony was presented at trial that the Vs considered themselves to be part of Joshua S.\u2019 extended family of origin. Aldo V. and Kelly S. had known each other since high school and maintained a close, \u201csibling-like\u201d relationship thereafter. In addition, until her death, Kelly S. enjoyed a very close relationship with Aldo V.\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Testimony was also presented that placement with the Vs would better facilitate the continuation of Joshua S.\u2019 relationship with his sister, Jessica M., who now lives with her biological father in Minnesota. Jessica M.\u2019s father maintained a good relationship with the Vs but had no contact with the Ps. Phillips testified that contact with his sister would be important to Joshua S. \u201cin order for him in the long run to make . . . some kind of sense of his earlier experiences.\u201d In addition, the Ps candidly related to Phillips that Jessica M.\u2019s significant visible scarring and ability to verbalize her memories of the tragic event would be difficult for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Another important consideration that favored the Vs, and militated against the Ps, was the Ps\u2019 admitted use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of corporal punishment, via a rod of correction, as an appropriate disciplinary tool on their own children.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Vs, on the other hand, are opposed to corporal punishment. The significance of this issue is two-fold.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">First, as the trial court correctly pointed out, the regulations of the department prohibit foster and prospective adoptive parents from using corporal punishment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Sara P. testified, however, that there was a possibility that she would use corporal punishment on Joshua S.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Second, Phillips testified that while the Ps\u2019 use of corporal punishment on their own children may be both effective and nontraumatic, as to Joshua S., in particular, the use of corporal punishment \u201cis a particularly risky venture.\u201d In view of what Joshua S. already had endured, this could be considered a telling factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">An additional factor weighing in favor of granting custody to the Vs was their willingness to obtain traditional psychological assistance for Joshua S., if necessary. The Ps expressed reluctance to do so, instead favoring pastoral counseling and congregational support for mental health issues. The trial court found this to be an important factor, because additional testimony indicated that Joshua S. has many mental health risk factors, including a genetic predisposition to depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In addition to the foregoing, the trial court credited Phillips\u2019 testimony and found that Joshua S. was closely bonded with the Vs and that removing him from their home would create a significant risk that he would develop reactive attachment disorder<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or some other psychological difficulty. Furthermore, Phillips testified that Joshua S. is the \u201cpsychological son\u201d of the Vs and that his relationship with the Vs is that of a parent-child relationship. In contrast, according to Phillips, although the Ps articulated \u201ca sense of integrity and honor and commitment in carrying out their agreement with [Charles S. and Kelly S.], and a sense of . . . compassion in taking in an orphaned child . . . [they do not] articulate an emotional connection to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Accordingly, we disagree with the Ps\u2019 statement that the trial court vested care and custody of Joshua S. in the Vs \u201con the <em>sole </em>basis\u201d of the bonding between Joshua S. and the Vs. (Emphasis added.) There was ample testimony presented at trial, unrelated to the bonding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>issue, to support the trial court\u2019s custody determination. Thus, any misconduct or improper actions by the department in its handling of this case do not compel a contrary conclusion. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was in Joshua S.\u2019 best interests to be placed in the custody of the Vs.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The Ps claim next that the trial court improperly concluded that it, rather than the Probate Court, had authority to appoint a statutory parent for Joshua S. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Our analysis of this issue is guided by well established legal principles. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 487-88, 757 A.2d 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u201cChapter 801a of the General Statutes outlines the jurisdiction and powers of probate courts. In addition to various powers regarding wills and estates, probate courts are provided with the authority to \u2018make any lawful orders or decrees to carry into effect the power and jurisdiction conferred upon them by the laws of this state.\u2019 General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (6). . . . Other sections of the General Statutes also address the jurisdiction of probate courts.\u201d <em>In re Micheala Lee R., </em>253 Conn. 570, 581,756 A.2d 214 (2000). We note, however, that no section of the General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>utes confers on the Probate Court exclusive jurisdiction over appointing a statutory parent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We first consider the scope of the Probate Court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cIt is well established that courts of probate are statutory tribunals that have no common-law jurisdiction. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>supra, [195 Conn. 366 n.18]; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford, National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>160 Conn. 415, 428, 279 A.2d 726 (1971); <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 662, 665, 124 A.2d 901 (1956); <em>Killen </em>v. <em>Klebanoff </em>140 Conn. 111, 115, 98 A.2d 520 (1953); <em>Potter v. Alcorn, </em>140 Conn. 96, 100, 99 A.2d 97 (1953). Accordingly, [courts of probate] can exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute. . . . They have jurisdiction only when the facts exist on which the legislature has conditioned the exercise of their power. . . [A] court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. . . Ordinarily, therefore, whether a Probate Court has jurisdiction to enter a given order depends upon the interpretation of a statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Michaela Lee R., </em>supra, 253 Conn. 580-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u201cOur legislature has consistently drafted legislation to state expressly when a court has exclusive jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-42 (granting Superior Court exclusive jurisdiction over all complaints seeking dissolution of marriage, decree of annulment or legal separation); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-212h (a) (granting family support magistrate division or Superior Court exclusive jurisdiction over child support orders); General Statutes \u00a7 52-12 (granting Superior Court exclusive jurisdiction over sale of certain real property).\u201d <em>Sender </em>v. <em>Sender, </em>56 Conn.

It has jurisdiction of all matters expressly committed to it and of all others cognizable by any law court of which the exclusive jurisdiction is not given to some other court. The fact that no other court has exclusive jurisdiction in any matter is sufficient to give the Superior Court jurisdiction over that matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaBella </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>134 Conn. 312, 316, 57 A.2d 627 (1948); see General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In part I of this opinion, we held that original jurisdiction over the appointment of a guardian in this matter was conferred upon the Superior Court because this case had been initiated as a neglect petition. The appointment of a statutory parent in this case was ancillary to that neglect proceeding. Therefore, in the absence of legislation bestowing upon the Probate Courts exclusive jurisdiction over the appointment of a statutory parent, jurisdiction over the appointment of a statutory parent necessarily was conferred upon the Superior Court because it was ancillary to the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>cause of action. See <em>Sender </em>v. <em>Sender, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 499 (dispute over custodial accounting that arose in context of dissolution action over which Superior Court had exclusive jurisdiction properly within jurisdiction of Superior Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Moreover, in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Dichello Distributors, Inc., </em>6 Conn. App. 530, 535, 506 A.2d 1054, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 230 (1986), the Appellate Court addressed the jurisdictional limitations of the Probate Court and recognized that there are three types of actions in which the Superior Court does not exercise original jurisdiction: those involving the \u201ccustody of a child not the issue of the marriage involved in a divorce, settlement of an executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s account, and the question of due execution of a will.\u201d The cause of action in this case does not fit into any of the three jurisdictional categories articulated in <em>Hall. </em>See <em>Sender </em>v. <em>Sender, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to appoint a statutory parent when petitioned to do so, because the legislature has not bestowed exclusive jurisdiction over this issue upon the Probate Courts. Furthermore, the appointment of a statutory parent in this case was merely ancillary to the neglect proceeding, which, we previously have determined, was within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The Ps claim finally that the trial court improperly concluded that the department should be appointed statutory parent of Joshua S. after determining that the department had engaged in misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. . . . <em>DeSena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 63, 72-73, 731 A.2d 733 (1999).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Union Carbide Corp. </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>257 Conn. 865, 870-71, 778 A.2d 204 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The Ps claim specifically that the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, \u201cfound that [the department] engaged in possible religious discrimination, evinced an ignorance of applicable law, engaged in the intentional destruction of documents under subpoena and mishandled this case.\u201d We will address these assertions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We first clarify that, contrary to the Ps\u2019 claim, the trial court did not find that the department had engaged in religious discrimination. In discussing the department\u2019s early elimination of the Ps from consideration for guardianship, the trial court stated: \u201c[The department] received information shortly after June 10 that the Truth Baptist Church had counseled Kelly [S.] not to use medicine despite her serious mental illness and that the Church in several other respects was a \u2018cult.\u2019 While some of these reports may have generated legitimate inquiries into whether any practices of the church or of Chad P., as assistant pastor of the church, might harm Joshua [S.], [the department] disclaimed reliance on the Ps\u2019 religion per se as a basis for rejecting their guardianship. <em>Assuming the sincerity of [the department\u2019s] position, it was obviously correct since discrimination against prospective foster parents based solely on religion would be completely impermissible.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) On the basis of this statement, we conclude that the trial court credited the testimony of the department and did not find, contrary to the Ps\u2019 claim, that the department had engaged in religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We turn next to the Ps\u2019 claims that the department evinced an ignorance of applicable law, engaged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>intentional destruction of documents under subpoena and mishandled this case. Specifically, the Ps claim that a department employee intentionally had destroyed handwritten notes from telephone conversations with Chad P. and had \u201cignored\u201d the wills of Charles S. and Kelly S. Although we emphasize that we do not condone the specific instances of misconduct perpetrated by the department in its handling of this case, it does not alter the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cA statutory parent is defined as \u2018the [commissioner] or the child-placing agency appointed by the court for the purpose of giving a minor child ... in adoption . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 45a-707 (7).

The child shows a pattern of excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent responses (e.g., frozen watchfulness, resistance to comfort, or a mixture of approach and avoidance) (Criterion Al). In the Disinhibited Type, there is a pattern of diffuse attachments. The child exhibits indiscriminate sociability or a lack of selectivity in the choice of attachment figures (Criterion A2).
