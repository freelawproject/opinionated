The second case is a writ of error. In both cases, Matthew G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (victim) claims that the trial court, <em>Trombley, J., </em>improperly concluded that the provisions of article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not apply in juvenile delinquency proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ings. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. Jonathan S. (respondent) was charged in a juvenile delinquency petition with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-70, risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 and threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62. The charges stemmed from an incident on May 19,1999, in which the respondent, then thirteen years old, committed a sexual act with the victim, then ten years old. This matter was assigned docket number L15-99DD07014-0.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The respondent was arraigned on those charges on July 16, 1999. The victim\u2019s mother and father were allowed into the courtroom for the arraignment without objection. During this proceeding, the trial court, <em>Resha, J., </em>invited the victim\u2019s mother to make a statement and informed her that she was entitled to attend and to speak at future hearings. The respondent was ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to have no contact with the victim and the hearing was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">On October 1, 1999, the respondent appeared before the trial court, <em>Trombley, J., </em>on a new charge of breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This new charge was assigned docket number L1599DD-09037-0. This charge stemmed from an incident in which the respondent allegedly mouthed obscenities at the victim\u2019s mother when the two inadvertently came into visual contact with each other from separate vehicles as they left the courthouse. The victim\u2019s mother requested, through a probation officer, that she be allowed to attend the October 1, 1999 hearing. The trial court, relying on General Statutes \u00a7 46b-138b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 31-9,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concluded that, inasmuch as the October 1,1999 hearing was not a dispositional hearing, but, rather, concerned the status of the respondent\u2019s predispositional detention, the victim\u2019s mother was not allowed to attend the hearing. Accordingly, the victim\u2019s mother was denied access to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">On December 17, 1999, the respondent admitted the allegations of juvenile delinquency contained in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>amended petition charging him with committing sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor nolled the other pending charges. The trial court, <em>Trombley, J., </em>directed the probation officer to notify the victim\u2019s mother and invite her to speak to the court at the respondent\u2019s dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">On March 16, 2000, the victim\u2019s advocate appeared, on behalf of the victim and the victim\u2019s parents, for the first time in docket number L15-99DD-07014-0, and requested that the trial court permit him, the victim and the victim\u2019s mother to participate fully in all future proceedings pursuant to the victim\u2019s rights amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s advocate argued that, pursuant to the victim\u2019s rights amendment, the victim possessed a constitutional right to attend the dispositional hearings and to make a statement regarding the disposition of the matter. On May 19, 2000, the trial court concluded that the victim\u2019s rights amendment was inapplicable because it applied only to \u201ccriminal prosecution [s]\u201d and not to juvenile proceedings. The trial court, however, exercised its discretion, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-122,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and permitted the victim, his parents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the victim\u2019s advocate to attend the dispositional phase of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">On June 7, 2000, the victim appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment adjudicating the respondent a delinquent in docket number L15-99DD-07014-0. In his prehminary statement of issues, the victim claimed that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied the victim\u2019s request for an order of restitution; (2) determined that the victim\u2019s attendance at a juvenile proceeding \u201cwas a matter within the discretion of the [c]ourt\u201d; (3) denied the \u201cvictim\u2019s request to attend proceedings prior to adjudication\u201d; and (4) issued a subpoena to the victim\u2019s treating therapist. Thereafter, the state<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> moved to dismiss the victim\u2019s appeal on the ground that the victim was not a party to the respondent\u2019s juvenile delinquency proceedings and, therefore, lacked standing to appeal from the judgment adjudicating the respondent a delinquent. Furthermore, the state maintained in its motion to dismiss that the appeal failed to embody a justiciable controversy. The motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice to the renewal of the state\u2019s claims in the briefs on the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Subsequently, the victim filed a motion with this court for permission to file a late writ of error in which he acknowledged that \u201che may have mistakenly filed an appeal rather than a writ of error . . . .\u201d We granted the victim\u2019s motion, and the victim filed this writ of error,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> alleging that the trial court improperly had concluded that the victim\u2019s rights amendment does not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings. The files <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>pertaining to the writ of error and appeal then were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In its brief on appeal, the state renews its claim that the appeal should be dismissed. The state argues that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the victim was not a party to the underlying juvenile delinquency action and, therefore, does not possesses either a constitutional or statutory right to appeal from the resulting judgment. The state cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 162, 735 A.2d 333 (1999), in support of this proposition. The victim does not argue that he possesses the requisite standing to appeal and \u201ctakes no position on whether an appeal or a writ [of error] is the proper procedural vehicle for review by th[is] court.\u201d Because the victim has failed to brief the issue of standing to appeal and because the issue of standing is a gateway issue in any appeal in which standing is contested, we deem this failure to constitute an abandonment of the appeal. See, e.g., <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>246 Conn. 18, 32 n.17, 716 A.2d 78 (1998); <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 344 n.11, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996); <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 115, 653 A.2d 782 (1995). We therefore need not reach the state\u2019s jurisdictional claim and dismiss the victim\u2019s appeal from the judgment adjudicating the respondent a delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">THE WRIT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In the writ of error, the victim claims that, on March 16, 2000, he sought permission, pursuant to the victim\u2019s rights amendment, to attend all future court proceedings concerning docket number L15-99DD-07014-0. The victim maintains in the writ of error that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in denying him permission to attend all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the court proceedings\u201d and improperly concluded that the victim\u2019s rights amendment does not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">As this case comes before us on a writ of error, \u201c[t]he scope of our review reaches only those matters appearing as of record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 347, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 223, 175 A. 582 (1934).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 494, 789 A.2d 979 (2002). The record before us, however, does not contain any references to the victim being denied access to any hearing concerning docket number L1599DD-07014-0 after his March 16, 2000 request to attend all future court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">On January 8, 2001, the victim filed a motion for rectification, seeking clarification from the trial court as to whether he had been allowed to attend the hearings held in the matter on December 2,1999, and December 17, 1999. The trial court filed a memorandum in response to the victim\u2019s motion for rectification, and, subsequently, the victim filed a motion for review seeking further clarification. The trial court, in its memorandum of decision on the motion for review, addressed whether the victim and his family were denied access to the courtroom on each of the following days: December 2, 1999; December 17, 1999; December 23, 1999; and January 20, 2000. The trial court found that, on each of the aforementioned dates, there was no request by or on behalf of the victim or any member of his family to attend the proceedings. The court further found that there was no denial of access to the proceedings on any of the aforementioned dates. Our review of the relevant transcripts confirms the accuracy of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Before addressing the substantive issues raised in a writ of error, we first must determine whether we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>jurisdiction. We previously have held that a party bringing a writ of error must be aggrieved. See, e.g., <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984). \u201cThe fundamental test for establishing classical aggrievement is well settled: [F]irst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision .... Second, the party claiming aggrievement also must demonstrate that its asserted interest has been specially and injuriously affected in a way that is cognizable by law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>250 Conn. 476, 480, 736 A.2d 131 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As we previously stated, the victim was not denied access to any hearing after March 16, 2000, the date on which the victim\u2019s advocate appeared on behalf of the victim and requested that he, the victim and the victim\u2019s family be allowed to attend all future hearings. Furthermore, a review of the transcripts does not show any denial of access on December 2, 1999, December 17, 1999, December 23,1999, or January 20,2000. The victim maintains in his brief to this court, however, that he is aggrieved because he and his mother were excluded from the hearing held on October 1, 1999.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The October 1,1999 hearing was an arraignment hearing for the respondent on the breach of the peace charge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The charge pertained to an incident in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the respondent allegedly mouthed obscenities at the victim\u2019s mother. During the October 1,1999 hearing, the victim\u2019s mother requested, through a probation officer, that she be allowed to attend the hearing, but her request was denied. The record does not reflect that on, or prior to, October 1, 1999, any written motion concerning access to the proceedings was submitted to the trial court. Furthermore, no mention was made on October 1, 1999, of a constitutional right to attend the hearing; instead, the request to attend this hearing was conveyed to the court by a probation officer, who merely stated: \u201cYour Honor, first of all, I just want to report to the court that the victim is here today requesting to be present in the hearing for today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Thus, the record reflects that the trial court was provided with no legal basis in support of the request to attend the October 1, 1999 hearing. Consequently, the trial court reasonably assumed that the victim\u2019s mother was seeking access to the courtroom pursuant to \u00a7 46b-138b<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 31-9.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court exercised its discretion pursuant to \u00a7 46b-122<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and denied the request, concluding that \u00a7 46b-138b and Practice Book \u00a7 31-9, which afford victims, and certain persons associated therewith, the right to attend juvenile delinquency hearings, apply only to dispositional hearings and not to nondispositional hearings, such as the October 1,1999 hearing at issue in the present case. Furthermore, the trial court denied the mother\u2019s request to attend the hearing in order to avoid another face-to-face confrontation between the victim or the victim\u2019s mother and the respondent in light of the volatile relationship that existed between them at that time.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Neither the victim\u2019s mother nor the victim advised the trial court of any basis in support of the request to attend the October 1, 1999 hearing. The victim has the \u201cresponsibility to present such a claim clearly to the trial court so that the trial court may consider it and, if it is meritorious, take appropriate action. That is the basis for the requirement that ordinarily [the appellant] must raise in the trial court the issues that he intends to raise on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 466, 656 A.2d 646 (1995). As such, to countenance on appeal the victim\u2019s claim regarding the October 1, 1999 hearing would be to impose an untenable burden on the trial court and would amount to appeal by ambuscade. We conclude that the request to attend the October 1, 1999 hearing was inadequate to advise the trial court of the legal basis for the request and, accordingly, we decline to review the victim\u2019s claim as to the October 1, 1999 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">With respect to the victim\u2019s claims concerning the other hearings held on December 2, 17 and 23, 1999, and January 20, 2000, we conclude, from a review of the relevant transcripts, that the victim did not request, and was not denied, access to those proceedings. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>fore, the victim is not aggrieved with respect to those dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The appeal in the first case is dismissed; the writ of error in the second case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\"> Matthew G. is the appellant in the first case, <em>In re Jonathan S. </em>(SC 16355), and the plaintiff in error in the second case, <em>Matthew G. </em>v. <em>State </em>(SC 16452).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, provides in relevant part: \u201cb.

The victim did not appeal, either directly from the judgment or by writ of error, in docket number L15-99DD-09037-0.

That coupled with [\u00a7] 31-9 of the Practice Book, which indicates that whenever a victim of an alleged delinquent act [or] parent or guardian of such victim exercises the rights pursuant to statute that, again, the purpose has to be for making a statement concerning disposition. No statement shall be received unless the alleged delinquent has signed the statement of responsibility, confirmed a plea agreement or been convicted as a delinquent. So reading those two in conjunction with each other, victims are invited by statute and by Practice Book to make statements to the court concerning disposition only when disposition is the issue. And we\u2019re having a detention hearing today, an arraignment today, and based upon my understanding of the Practice Book and the General Statutes, the victim would not be permitted to enter the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u25a0\u2018You may so inform the victim if you would like so [he] doesn\u2019t have to needlessly hang around the courthouse.
