The trial court thereafter rendered judgments in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of twenty-two years, execution suspended after seventeen years, and five years probation. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgments of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>56 Conn. App. 763, 772, 746 A.2d 196 (2000). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court correctly determined that the trial court properly had admitted into evidence, under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, statements made to a social worker by a child who was sexually assaulted identifying the defendant as the perpetrator of the sexual assaults. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>253 Conn. 901, 753 A.2d 938 (2000). We conclude that those statements properly were admitted under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule and, therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. The defendant sexually assaulted A<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on various occasions between May 1,1991, and December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>16, 1993. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 764-65. The assaults occurred in residences that the defendant shared with A, A\u2019s mother, who also was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, and A\u2019s two younger siblings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> one of whom was the defendant\u2019s biological daughter. See id. The family lived in an apartment in Hartford from May 1, 1991, through April 30, 1993. Id. The family thereafter relocated to an apartment in Manchester. Id., 765. The assaults ended when the defendant moved out of the Manchester residence in December, 1993. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">A remained silent about the sexual assaults until the summer of 1995, when she told an older school friend that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. See id. Although the friend urged A to tell her mother about the assaults, A did not inform her mother until December 14, 1995. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Upon learning of the sexual abuse, A\u2019s mother immediately sought help from Frederick J. Rau, an obstetrician-gynecologist who had been treating A for abdominal pelvic pain since March, 1993. Id., 765, 766. Rau spoke with Diane Edell, a social worker and the program director of a center for evaluating sexually abused children (abuse evaluation center) at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center (hospital), and arranged for A to be examined at the hospital. Id., 765. Edell, who also evaluated complaints of sexual abuse for the abuse evaluation center, interviewed A on December 14 and December 22,1995. Id. A spoke openly about the sexual abuse because she believed that Edell was a physician. Id. The December 22 session was videotaped while Detective Robert Nelson of the Hartford police department and Detective Russell Wood of the Manchester police department observed the interview through a one-way mirror. Id. Although the detectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>received a videotape of Edell\u2019s interview of A, neither officer interviewed A. Id., 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Thereafter, on Januaiy 10,1996, Elaine Elizabeth Yordan, a pediatrician and associate director of the section of adolescent medicine in the hospital\u2019s department of pediatrics, examined A. Id., 766. The results of Yordan\u2019s examination neither proved nor disproved that A had been sexually assaulted. Id. Although Yordan possessed Rau\u2019s medical histoiy of A, she did not use it in her diagnosis and did not view the videotape of Edell\u2019s interview. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">At trial, Edell testified that she spoke with Rau and A\u2019s mother on December 14, 1995, and, on the basis of those conversations, \u201cthought it was a good idea to see [A] right away.\u201d Edell explained that the purpose of a diagnostic interview was to help \u201cthe physician proceed with the medical evaluation based on what the child is claiming happened to [him or her] . . . .\u201d Edell further testified that, following her interview with a child, she would give the child\u2019s parent a general summary of the substance of the interview, would make recommendations regarding mental health follow-up, including whether crisis counseling or long-term or short-term therapy was warranted, and would prepare a report of the interview that would be shared with the examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Yordan also testified at the defendant\u2019s trial. She could not recall whether she had spoken to Edell prior to examining A but stated that her usual practice \u201cis to speak [with] the interviewer,\u201d if the child has been interviewed, to determine the nature of the allegations. Yordan further testified that she had not spoken with Rau before examining A and that she had obtained a medical history from A\u2019s mother prior to examining A.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant asserted, inter alia, that the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>allowed into evidence Edell\u2019s testimony regarding A\u2019s statements identifying the defendant as the perpetrator under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rale. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 766. The Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that the trial court properly had allowed Edell\u2019s testimony. Id., 771. The Appellate Court reasoned that \u201cA\u2019s complaint to Edell did not lack trustworthiness because A thought Edell was a physician . . . [and because] Edell was part of the chain utilized to elicit information for future medical and psychological treatment.\u201d Id., 770-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">On appeal to this court, the defendant renews his claim that A\u2019s statements to Edell did not fall within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rale. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the exception is inapplicable under the particular circumstances of the present case because Edell is a social worker and not a physician, psychologist or psychiatrist. He further contends that A\u2019s statements do not come within the exception because Edell\u2019s interview of A was not within a chain of medical care in view of the fact that the substance of that interview never was utilized by a physician, psychologist or psychiatrist in diagnosing or treating A, and the fact that A never received any treatment for the psychological trauma that A may have suffered as a result of the sexual abuse. We disagree with the defendant and conclude that the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rale applies to statements made by a sexual assault victim to a social worker who is acting within the chain of medical care, as long as those statements are made for the purpose of obtaining medical diagnosis or treatment and are pertinent to the diagnosis or treatment sought. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 44, 770 A.2d 908 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u201cThe hearsay rule ... is premised on the theory that out-of-court statements are subject to particular hazards. The declarant might be lying; he might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>misperceived the events which he relates; he might have faulty memory; his words might be misunderstood or taken out of context by the listener. And the ways in which these dangers are minimized for in-court statements\u2014the oath, the witness\u2019 awareness of the gravity of the proceedings, the jury\u2019s ability to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor, and, most importantly, the right of the opponent to cross-examine\u2014are generally absent for things said out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u201cNonetheless, the . . . [r]ules of [e]vidence also recognize that some kinds of out-of-court statements are less subject to these hearsay dangers, and therefore except them from the general rule that hearsay is inadmissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 146, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999), quoting <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 598, 114 S. Ct, 2431, 129 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1994). One such category covers statements made by a patient to a physician for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 44; <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 565, 638 A.2d 578 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The rationale underlying the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule is that \u201cthe patient\u2019s desire to recover his health . . . will restrain him from giving inaccurate statements to a physician employed to advise or treat him.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>152 Conn. 272, 275, 205 A.2d 773 (1964), overruled on other grounds by <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>250 Conn. 312, 736 A.2d 889 (1999); see also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.20.2, p. 634 (\u201c[the] exception is based on the theory that a person who consults a doctor for advice or treatment will be motivated by a desire to recover . . . and that person will therefore refrain from giving inaccurate statements to the individual advising or treating him or her\u201d). \u201cSince statements made to physicians are usually made in response to questions, many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>are not spontaneous. Instead, their reliability is assured by the likelihood that the patient believes that the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the accuracy of the information provided to the doctor, which may be termed a selfish treatment motivation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed. 1999) \u00a7 277, p. 233. Thus, \u201c[o]ut-of-court statements made by a patient to a physician may be admitted into evidence if the declarant was seeking medical diagnosis or treatment, and the statements are reasonably pertinent to achieving those ends. ... A physician, who is consulted by a patient for the purpose of obtaining from [the physician] professional medical treatment or advice incidental thereto, may testify to [his or her] opinion even though it is based, in whole or in part, on statements made ... by the patient; and, of course, [the physician] may also testify to such statements.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>13 Conn. App. 368, 369, 374 and n.3, 536 A.2d 600, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 808, 541 A.2d 1239 (1988), the Appellate Court concluded that, under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, a Spanish-speaking hospital security guard enlisted by the examining physician to assist in taking the medical history of a six year old sexual abuse victim, who spoke only Spanish, could testify at trial about nonverbal assertions that the victim made, which indicated that her father had sexually abused her. In <em>Maldonado, </em>the defendant had brought his child to the hospital because she was experiencing significant vaginal discharge. Id., 369. Upon the child\u2019s return to the hospital the following evening, \u201cthe examining physician [who did not speak Spanish] enlisted the aid of a Spanish-speaking security guard to take [the child\u2019s] medical history.\u201d Id. \u201cOut of the presence of the defendant and the [examining physician], [the child] indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cated to the security guard, without speaking but by nodding her head, that she . . . had been molested and that the molesting individual was her father.\u201d Id. The security guard was unsuccessful in attempting to get the child to repeat her responses in the presence of the examining physician. Id., 369-70. The trial court permitted the security guard to testify at trial concerning, inter alia, the child\u2019s assertions that her father was the abuser. See id., 370, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In determining that the child\u2019s assertions fell within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, the Appellate Court reasoned that the security guard was acting within the chain of medical care: in light of the language barrier between the examining physician and the child, the physician asked the security guard to assist in obtaining the child\u2019s medical history. See id., 372, 374 n.3. The court further reasoned that the child\u2019s assertions were reliable in light of the child\u2019s awareness that the security guard was questioning her on behall\u2019 of the examining physician and that she was aware that she had a condition that necessitated the administration of medical treatment. Id., 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The Appellate Court came to the same conclusion in the present case. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that A\u2019s statements fell within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule because A had made them in furtherance of obtaining medical treatment and because A had made them to an individual within the chain of medical care. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 770. The court further concluded that A\u2019s statements were reliable because \u201cA thought she was talking to a physician and therefore was seeking medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In so concluding, the court noted: \u201cIt is not unreasonable to . . . conclude that because Rau, A\u2019s treating physician, sent A and [A\u2019s] mother to the hospital, specifically calling Edell whom he knew to be a social worker with advanced training in therapy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and public health, and the [the program director of the abuse evaluation center], that statements by A to Edell would be reasonably pertinent to future medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d Id. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The rationale for excluding from the hearsay rule statements that a patient makes to a physician in furtherance of obtaining medical treatment applies with equal force to such statements made to other individuals within the chain of medical care. In each case, we presume that such statements are inherently reliable because the patient has an incentive to tell the truth in order to obtain a proper medical diagnosis and treatment. See, e.g., 2 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 277, p. 233. In so concluding, we overrale <em>State </em>v. <em>Barile, </em>54 Conn. App. 866, 871-72, 738 A.2d 709 (1999), to the extent that it holds that the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rale does not cover statements made to a social worker who is in the chain of medical care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We hold today that statements made by a sexual assault victim to a social worker who is acting within the chain of medical care may be admissible under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rale.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Turning to the facts of the present case, the record amply demonstrates that A\u2019s mother had taken A to the hospital for medical treatment and advice pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>thereto, and that Edell, a social worker employed by the hospital, was acting within the chain of medical care when she interviewed A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, A\u2019s own belief that if she told Edell exactly what had happened, then Edell could help her, demonstrates A\u2019s own understanding that her mother brought her to the hospital for treatment. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s claim that there is no evidence in the record that A was seeking medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that Edell was acting not as a social worker but, rather, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>agent of the Manchester and Hartford police departments when she interviewed A. The record demonstrates that Edell, who as a social worker, was statutorily obligated to report suspected child abuse under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-101,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had notified the Manchester police department of A\u2019s disclosure of sexual abuse sometime after the December 14, 1995 segment of Edell\u2019s interview, at which A had disclosed the abuse, but before December 22, 1995. The record further discloses that the Manchester police received a sworn statement from A\u2019s mother on December 21, 1995. There is no evidence that Edell was, in fact, employed by either police department or that she had assisted in any capacity in the departments\u2019 respective investigations of the alleged abuse. The record does disclose, however, the joint efforts of the abuse evaluation center, the department of children and families and the law enforcement community to conduct interviews of child victims of sexual abuse in a manner that is intended to spare the victims any additional trauma.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Accordingly, Edell testified that it was the practice of the abuse evaluation center to videotape the interviews of child abuse victims in order to spare them the additional trauma that could result from being interviewed repeatedly by numerous state agencies and police departments that are conducting independent investigations into the alleged abuse. Edell further testified that, following an interview in which there has been a disclosure of sexual abuse, the hospital would forward a copy of the videotaped interview, along with a copy of the interviewer\u2019s report, to the department of children and families and the local police department, and that the hospital would retain the originals. Detective Wood of the Manchester police department and Detective Nelson of the Hartford police department also testified that, upon receiving a complaint of child sexual abuse, their respective departments would have the abuse evaluation center interview the victim whenever practical. None of these circumstances changed Edell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>essential role within the chain of medical care when she had conducted the interview of A. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the presence of officers from the Manchester and Hartford police departments at Edell\u2019s interview of A caused Edell to become an agent of local law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Turning to the relevance prong of the medical treatment exception, the defendant claims that A\u2019s statements to Edell identifying him as the perpetrator should not have been admitted into evidence because he was not a member of A\u2019s household when A disclosed the sexual abuse and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s identify as the perpetrator was not relevant to A\u2019s medical treatment. In so arguing, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Dollinger, </em>20 Conn. App. 530, 568 A.2d 1058, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 805, 574 A.2d 220 (1990), for the proposition that the identity of the perpetrator is only relevant to the victim\u2019s medical diagnosis and treatment when there is a possibility of recurrence because the perpetrator remains in the victim\u2019s household. See id., 535 (\u201c[i]f the sexual abuser is a member of the child victim\u2019s immediate household, it is reasonable for a physician to ascertain the identity of the abuser to prevent recurrences and to facilitate the treatment of psychological and physical injuries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">We recently rejected a similarly narrow interpretation of the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule in <em>State </em>v. Kelly, supra, 256 Conn. 23. In Kelly, the defendant, Alex Kelly, had sexually assaulted the victim in an automobile. Id., 28-29. On appeal to this court, Kelly cited <em>State </em>v. DePastino, supra, 228 Conn. 552, a case in which the defendant, Keith DePastino, had sexually abused his girlfriend\u2019s three year old daughter and the couple\u2019s eighteen month old daughter in an apartment in which they all resided; id., 555; for the proposition that statements concerning the identity of the perpetrator of sexual abuse fall within the medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>treatment exception only when those statements are made to a physician by a child who was sexually assaulted in the home. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 45. In rejecting such a narrow interpretation of the medical treatment exception, we reiterated our reasoning in <em>DePastino </em>that \u201ctestimony pertaining to the identity of the defendant and the nature of the sexual assault [are] wholly relevant and pertinent to proper diagnosis and treatment of the resulting physical and psychological injuries of sexual assault.\u201d Id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>supra, 565. We concluded that \u201c[i]n any sexual assault, the identity of the perpetrator undoubtedly is relevant to the physician to facilitate the treatment of psychological and physical injuries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 45. For those same reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that A\u2019s statements to Edell identifying the defendant as the perpetrator were irrelevant to A\u2019s efforts to obtain medical treatment because the defendant left the household after sexually abusing A. We, therefore, agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court properly allowed Edell to testify, pursuant to the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, regarding A\u2019s statements to Edell identifying the defendant as the person who sexually assaulted A.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

In <em>Barile, </em>it was unclear whether the social worker was acting in conjunction with other medical personnel, such as a physician, in treating the victim. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Barile, </em>supra, 871.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\"> At trial, A\u2019s mother testified that she had called Rau on the day that A informed her of the sexual abuse and that Rau had visited her home to do an investigation that same day.

Edell explained the purposes behind the diagnostic interview as follows: \u201c[I]t helped the physician proceed\u2014and still does\u2014helps the physician proceed with the medical evaluation based on what the child is claiming happened to [him or her]: how much needs to be done, whether they need to have cultures done or not. . . . The doctor really needs to know how serious is what they\u2019re saying, should they reschedule an appointment, etc. So it really guides them in terms of what they do. The other thing is that we do make recommendations regarding mental health issues regarding treatment issues for the child.\u201d Edell also testified that, following an interview, she would give the child\u2019s parent a general summary of the interview, would make recommendations regarding mental health counseling and therapy, and would prepare a report of the interview, which would be shared with the physicians at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Yordan testified that she had not spoken with Rau prior to examining A, but that the hospital \u201chad a copy of some of . . .
