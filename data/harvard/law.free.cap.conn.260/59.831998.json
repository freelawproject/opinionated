Second, we must determine whether the plaintiff may maintain a claim, predicated on the same factual allegations underlying the antitrust claim, pursuant to the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. We conclude that the plaintiff, as an indirect purchaser of the defendant\u2019s software product, may not recover under the Antitrust Act. We also conclude that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a claim under CUTPA because his alleged iiyuries are too remote with respect to the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In September, 1999, the plaintiff purchased from a retail store<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in Wallingford an Intel-based personal computer<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> onto which Windows 98<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had been preinstalled. As a precondition to using Windows 98, the plaintiff was required to enter into an end user licensee agreement with the defendant specifying that Windows 98 was licensed, as opposed to sold, to the end user.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>against the defendant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> alleging violations of the Antitrust Act and CUTPA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The gravamen of the plaintiffs complaint is that the defendant wielded monopoly power in the computer operating systems market and, in wielding that power, \u201cknowingly licensed its Windows 98 operating system for Intel-based [personal computers] . . . without regard to competition, at a monopoly price in excess of what [the defendant] would have been able to charge in a competitive market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant moved to strike the plaintiffs complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Specifically, the defendant contended that the plaintiff was an indirect purchaser of Windows 98 who was ineligible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>recover under the Antitrust Act and who, in the absence of a cause of action under the Antitrust Act, also was ineligible to recover under CUTPA. The trial court agreed with the defendant and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, from which the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">ANTITRUST ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court, in applying <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) <em>(Illinois Brick), </em>improperly concluded that the plaintiff was an indirect purchaser of Windows 98 and, therefore, was barred from bringing an antitrust action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 35-35<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to recover damages for the defendant\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive practices.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claim, we set forth the standard of review applicable to an appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike. \u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ciency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court,\u2019s ruling is plenary. <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232-33, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997). We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>236 Conn. 670, 674, 674 A.2d 839 (1996); see also <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108-109, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would suppoit a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>236 Conn. 820, 826, 676 A.2d 357 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewish Home for the Elderly of Fairfield County, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cantore, </em>257 Conn. 531, 537-38, 778 A.2d 93 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d We, therefore, begin our analysis of the plaintiffs antitrust claim with a discussion of federal antitrust law. Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, as amended, the statute on which \u00a7 35-35 is modeled, provides in relevant part that \u201cany person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. . . .\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (a) (2000). The United States Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of the Clayton Act as precluding an indirect purchaser of goods or services from bringing a private action against the seller who engages in anticompetitive practices in the sale of those goods or services. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Utilicorp United, Inc., </em>497 U.S. 199, 207, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990); <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp., </em>490 U.S. 93, 103, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989); see <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 730, 746-47; <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 490-94, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968) <em>(Hanover Shoe). </em>Only those who purchase directly from such a seller may recover under the federal antitrust statutes. See, e.g., <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Utilicorp United, Inc., </em>supra, 207 (in distribution chain, indirect purchasers are not \u201cimmediate buyers\u201d of antitrust defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>the defendant manufacturer and distributor of shoe making machinery argued that the plaintiff shoe manufacturer, though a direct purchaser, did not suffer a legally cognizable injury because the plaintiff had passed on the defendant\u2019s allegedly illegal overcharge to the individual purchasers of the plaintiffs shoes. <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>supra, 392 U.S. 493, 487-88. We note that the term \u201c \u2018[p]ass on\u2019 is [used to describe] the process by which a middleman in the chain of distribution who has been overcharged by a manufacturer or by a producer adjusts his prices upward so as to pass on his increased costs to his own customers.\u201d Annot., 55 A.L.R. Fed. 919, 922 n.3 (1981). An antitrust defendant who asserts the pass on theory defensively attempts to prove that its allegedly illegal overcharge for goods or services did not cause the plaintiff a legally cognizable injury because the plaintiff had passed the overcharge onto the next economic actor in the vertical chain of distribution. See <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Corp., </em>supra, 487-88; see also <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>the court rejected the defendant\u2019s use of the pass on theory. <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>supra, 392 U.S. 494. In so deciding, the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s contention that its anticompetitive practices did not cause the plaintiff injury, reasoning that \u201c[a]s long as the seller continues to charge the illegal price, he takes from the buyer more than the law allows. At whatever price the buyer sells, the price he pays the seller remains illegally high, and his profits would be greater were his costs lower.\u201d Id., 489; see also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hendrickson Bros., Inc., </em>840 F.2d 1065, 1079 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 848, 109 S. Ct. 128, 102 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1988) (\u201c[i]n general, the person who has purchased directly from those who have fixed prices at an artificially high level in violation of the antitrust laws is deemed to have suffered the antitrust injury . . . and hence may recover the entire amount of the illegal overcharge even if some or all of the overcharge may have been passed on to others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The court\u2019s rejection of the defensive use of the pass on theory in <em>Hanover Shoe </em>rested on several fundamental concerns relating to the efficient enforcement of antitrust law. See generally <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>supra, 392 U.S. 490-94. The court understood that the defense would lead to an \u201cinsuperable difficulty\u201d in measuring the extent to which the illegal overcharge has impacted the price of goods at each stage of distribution. Id., 492-93. In this regard, the court was especially mindful of the various factors influencing each company\u2019s respective pricing policies. Id., 492. As the court stated, \u201c[n]ormally the impact of a single change in the relevant conditions cannot be measured after the fact; indeed a businessman may be unable to state whether, had one fact been different (a single supply less expensive, general eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>nomic conditions more buoyant, or the labor market tighter, for example), he would have chosen a different price.\u201d Id., 492-93. The court also expressed concern that the use of the pass on theory \u201cwould require additional long and complicated proceedings involving massive evidence and complicated theories\u201d; id., 493; as antitrust defendants attempt to establish that plaintiffs have raised their prices in response to the illegal overcharges. Id., 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>the court also alluded to some of the adverse consequences that would flow from permitting the defensive use of the pass on theory. For example, the court noted that \u201cthose who violate the antitrust laws by price fixing or monopolizing [should not] retain the fruits of their illegality because no one was available who would bring suit against them.\u201d Id., 494. The court keenly understood that the defensive use of the pass on theory would lead not only to greater complexity in the administration of antitrust actions, but also to a weakening of antitrust enforcement as defendants would attempt to escape liability merely by showing that the direct purchaser had passed on the illegal overcharge to the next level of purchasers in the distribution chain and, conversely, plaintiffs would attempt to prove that they had not passed on the overcharge. Id. As the court remarked, \u201cif [direct] buyers are subjected to the [pass on] defense, those who buy from them would also have to meet the challenge that they passed on the higher price to <em>their </em>customers. These ultimate customers, in <em>[Hanover Shoe] </em>the buyers of single pairs of shoes, would have only a tiny stake in a lawsuit and little interest in attempting a class action.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. Lastly, the court rejected the defensive use of the pass on theory because it would substantially reduce the direct purchaser\u2019s incentive to bring a private antitrust action and, thus, the effectiveness of federal antitrust enforcement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the court built upon its holding in <em>Hanover Shoe </em>and held that an indirect purchaser could not bring an antitrust action and offensively use the pass on theory to recover under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 735. In that case, the state of Illinois and 700 local governmental agencies in the greater Chicago area brought an action against several manufacturers and distributors of cement block alleging that the defendants engaged in price fixing. Id., 726-27. It is important to note that the plaintiffs themselves did not purchase the cement block from the defendant manufacturers and distributors. See id., 726. Rather, the cement block had been purchased by various masonry contractors who, in turn, were hired by various general contractors. Id. The plaintiffs had hired the general contractors to complete various construction projects in which the cement block ultimately was incorporated. Id. The plaintiffs in <em>Illinois Brick, </em>therefore, were indirect purchasers of cement block that already had passed through two levels in the chain of distribution before the product was incorporated into the plaintiffs\u2019 completed buildings and construction projects. Id. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs sought to recover the illegal overcharge that the masonry contractors had paid to the defendants by demonstrating that the masonry contractors incorporated the overcharge into their bids on the masonry portions of the construction projects submitted to the general contractors, and that the general contractors, in turn, had incorporated the masonry contractors\u2019 bids into their own bids to the plaintiffs, thereby passing on the defendants\u2019 illegal overcharge to the plaintiffs. Id., 727. In essence, the plaintiffs in <em>Illinois Brick </em>were attempting to use the pass on theory offensively to prove that the defendants\u2019 illegal conduct had caused their injuries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See id., 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to use the pass on theory for several reasons. Among those reasons was the court\u2019s concern that the offensive use of the pass on theory would \u201copen the door to duplicative recoveries under \u00a7 4 [of the Clayton Act].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 731. The court reasoned that \u201c[a] one-sided application of <em>Hanover Shoe </em>substantially increases the possibility of inconsistent adjudications\u2014and therefore of unwarranted multiple liability for the <em>defendant\u2014by presuming </em>that one plaintiff (the direct purchaser) is entitled to full recovery while preventing the defendant from using that presumption against the other plaintiff [the indirect purchaser]; overlapping recoveries are certain to result from the two lawsuits unless the indirect purchaser is unable to establish any pass-on whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>further grounded its rejection of the offensive use of the pass on theory on concerns that its application would result in additional administrative costs to the judicial system and the inefficient enforcement of federal antitrust law. Id., 731-32; see also id., 745 (\u201c[t]he combination of increasing the costs and diffusing the benefits of bringing a treble-damages action could seriously impair this important weapon of antitrust enforcement\u201d). As the court stated, \u201c[t]his perception that the attempt to trace the complex economic adjustments to a change in the cost of a particular factor of production would greatly complicate and reduce the effectiveness of already protracted treble-damages proceedings applies with no less force to the assertion of pass-on theories by plaintiffs than it does to the assertion by defendants. However long and complicated the proceedings would be when defendants sought to prove pass-on . . . they would be equally so when the same evidence [is] introduced by plaintiffs. Indeed, the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties involved in the defensive use of pass-on against a direct purchaser are multiplied in the offensive use of pass-on by a plaintiff several steps removed from the defendant in the chain of distribution. The demonstration of how much of the overcharge was passed on by the first purchaser must be repeated at each point at which the price-fixed goods changed hands before they reached the plaintiff.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 732-33. The court ultimately was concerned that allowing indirect purchasers to sue and, thereby, prove their damages under the pass on theory, \u201cwould transform treble-damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge\u2014from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers.\u201d Id., 737. Therefore, the federal courts have limited recovery under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Act to those consumers who are direct purchasers in relation to the antitrust defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We next examine the relationship between Connecticut and federal antitrust law. The Antitrust Act, like federal antitrust law, attempts to promote competition in the marketplace. E.g., <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New </em>Haven, 184 Conn. 285, 294, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). \u201cThe legislative history of the [Antitrust] [A]ct clearly establishes that it was intentionally patterned after the antitrust law of the federal government. See 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1971 Sess., p. 4182, remarks of Representative David H. Neiditz (\u2018this bill gives Connecticut an [antitrust] [l]aw similar to the existing [f]ederal [antitrust] [l]aw in every respect\u2019); 14 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1971 Sess., p. 3211, remarks of Senator William J. Sullivan (\u2018[the proposed legislation] gives the small businessman the protection afforded to the large corporations under the [f]ederal [antitrust] [a]ct\u2019).\u201d <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 15, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). Accordingly, General Statutes \u00a7 35-35 provides that \u201c[t]he state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a consumer, injured in its business or property by any violation of the provisions of . . . chapter [624] shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The legislature amended the Antitrust Act in 1992 to make explicit its intent that the judiciary shall interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the Antitrust Act in accordance with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of federal antitrust law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 15 n.17; see Public Acts 1992, No. 92-248, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 92-248) (codified at General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b). Thus, the Antitrust Act mandates \u201cthat in construing [the Antitrust Act], the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b; cf. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 303 (judicial opinions interpreting federal antitrust statutes aid this court\u2019s construction of Antitrust Act). Notwithstanding this mandate, the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 35-44b is irrelevant to our determination of the issue presented by this appeal because the inclusion of the term \u201cconsumer\u201d in \u00a7 35-35 renders the statute textually different from \u00a7 4 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the Clayton Act. The plaintiff further contends that our adherence to the direct purchaser rule of <em>Illinois Brick </em>would render the term \u201cconsumer\u201d superfluous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Any question regarding the textual difference between the federal and state statutes as a result of the inclusion of the term \u201cconsumer\u201d in \u00a7 35-35, on the one hand, and the absence of that term in \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, on the other hand, was resolved in <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 340-42, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979), in which the United States Supreme Court held that consumers may recover damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act for noncommercial injuries caused by a defendant\u2019s antitrust violations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Reiter, </em>the plaintiff,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a retail purchaser of hearing aids, sought to recover damages from the defendant hearing aid manufacturers. Id., 335. The plaintiff alleged that the manufacturers had committed various antitrust violations including engaging in illegal vertical and horizontal price fixing of hearing aids and related services. Id. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the manufacturers conspired \u201camong[st] themselves and with their retail dealers to fix the retail prices of the hearing aids.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Id., 335 n.1. Certain manufacturers moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act because she \u201chad not been injured in her \u2018business or property\u2019 within the rneaning of [\u00a7 4 of] the [Clayton] Act\u201d; id., 335; and, consequently, her injuries were not commercial. See id. The District Court disagreed with the manufacturers and \u201cheld that under \u00a7 4 [of the Clayton Act] a retail purchaser is injured in \u2018property\u2019 if the purchaser can show that antitrust violations caused an increase in the price paid for the article purchased.\u201d Id.; see <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>435 F. Sup. 933, 936-38 (D. Minn. 1977). The District Court then certified the issue for interlocutory review. <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>supra, 442 U.S. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and held that retail purchasers of consumer goods or services who do not allege a commercial or business related injury are not injured in their business or property within the meaning of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id.; <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>579 F.2d 1077, 1086, 1087 (8th Cir. 1978). The United States Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Appeals, holding that \u201c[a] consumer whose money has been diminished by reason of an antitrust violation has been injured \u2018in his . . . property\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 4 [of the Clayton Act].\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>supra, 442 U.S. 339; see also <em>Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. </em>v. <em>California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 529 n.19, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (acknowledging holding in <em>Reiter </em>that consumers may maintain action under \u00a7 4 of Clayton Act); <em>Blue Shield of Virginia </em>v. <em>McCready, </em>457 U.S. 465, 473, 102 S.

Ed. 2d 149 (1982) (discussing holding in <em>Reiter </em>that consumers have standing under \u00a7 4 of Clayton Act to seek damages for increase in purchase price caused by price-fixing conspiracy). In construing the language of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, the court in <em>Reiter </em>reiterated that, in using the phrase \u201cany person,\u201d Congress \u201cintended] [that] it . . . have its naturally broad and inclusive meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>supra, 442 U.S. 338, quoting <em>Pfizer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Government of India, </em>434 U.S. 308, 312, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563 (1978). The court further concluded that the term \u201cproperty\u201d in \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act has a similarly broad meaning and that money is a form of property. <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>supra, 442 U.S. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Thus, \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act provides a remedy for those consumers who have been injured by a defendant\u2019s antitrust practices. See, e.g., <em>California </em>v. <em>California &amp; Hawaiian Sugar Co., </em>588 F.2d 1270, 1273 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 932, 99 S. Ct. 2052, 60 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979) (\u201ca consumer class [i.e., a class] not composed of direct purchasers . . . cannot claim under the Clayton Act that overcharges had been passed on to them by those selling to them\u201d). We conclude that allowing only those consumers who purchase directly from the antitrust defendant to bring suit under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>state antitrust law ensures that the Antitrust Act remains harmonious with federal antitrust statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In so deciding, we disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the legislative history of \u00a7 35-35 supports the plaintiffs right to sue under the Antitrust Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To the contrary, the legislative history makes clear that the legislature intended to \u201c[give] Connecticut an [antitrust] [l]aw similar to the existing [fjederal [antitrust] [l]aw in every respect . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>14 H.R.

Notwithstanding the plaintiffs argument to the contrary, which the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of the attorney general has adopted as its own; see footnote 24 of this opinion; we believe that the legislature\u2019s refusal to enact legislation authorizing indirect purchasers to sue under the Antitrust Act, coupled with its enactment of P.A. 92-248, \u00a7 2 (codified at \u00a7 35-44b), which expressly provides that we are to be guided by federal court interpretation of federal antitrust statutes\u2014including, by implication, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois </em>Brick\u2014amply supports our conclusion that an indirect purchaser may not recover under the Antitrust Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Turning to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, we conclude that the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts for the trial court to determine, as it did, that the plaintiff is an indirect purchaser of Windows 98 and, consequently, that he is barred from bringing an antitrust claim under \u00a7 35-35. The plaintiff alleged that he \u201cpurchased an Intel-based personal computer from Staples in Wallingford onto which Windows 98 was preinstalled.\u201d Nowhere in his complaint did the plaintiff allege that he directly purchased Windows 98 from the defendant. Rather, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant charged original computer equipment manufacturers<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> different prices for their respective licenses to Windows 98. The plaintiff also alleged that \u201c[original computer equipment manufacturers] and distributors of upgrade CD ROMs have treated [the defendant\u2019s] monopoly price for Windows 98 as an element of their cost and have passed most, if not all, of [the defendant\u2019s] monopoly price onto [the] plaintiff and [other similarly situated buyers].\u201d The mere fact that a direct purchaser, such as an original computer equipment manufacturer or a retailer like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Staples, has passed on most or all of the defendant\u2019s illegal overcharge does not vault the plaintiff into the status of a direct purchaser. See, e.g., <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Utilicorp United, Inc., </em>supra, 497 U.S. 207; <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hendrickson Bros., Inc., </em>supra, 840 F.2d 1079. The fact remains that the plaintiff purchased from a retailer, not the defendant, a personal computer onto which Windows 98 had been preinstalled.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The plaintiff nevertheless contends that the direct purchaser rule is inapplicable because he is an end user licensee of Windows 98 and, thus, in privity with the defendant. This argument fundamentally misunderstands the import of the court\u2019s holding in <em>Illinois Brick. </em>The rationale underlying <em>Illinois Brick </em>and its progeny is that restricting standing to a <em>direct purchaser </em>who has purchased goods <em>directly </em>from the anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>trust defendant will maximize the effective enforcement of antitrust statutes \u201cby concentrating the full recovery for the overcharge in the direct purchasers . . . .\u201d <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 735. Thus, the court\u2019s focus was on the underlying economic transaction between the direct purchaser and the antitrust defendant and not, as the plaintiff contends, whether the plaintiff and the defendant were in contractual privity by virtue of a licensing agreement. The plaintiff alleges nowhere in his complaint that he was required to pay the defendant for the acquisition of the licensing rights to use Windows 98. Thus, there is no economic relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant for purposes of the direct purchaser rule of <em>Illinois Brick. </em>We, therefore, reject the plaintiffs argument that his status as an end user licensee obviates any inquiry into whether the plaintiff is an indirect purchaser. We conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike count one of the plaintiffs complaint setting forth his claim under \u00a7 35-35 of the Antitrust Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">CUTPA</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The plaintiff also challenges that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment striking the plaintiffs CUTPA claims made pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110b<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and 42-110g.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As we previously noted, these claims were predi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>cated on the same factual allegations underlying the plaintiffs state antitrust claim. The trial court struck the CUTPA claims on the ground that it \u201cha[d] no authority to embark on a path\u201d that would undermine the United States Supreme Court\u2019s policy choices expressed in <em>Illinois Brick. </em>The plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s reasoning conflicts with CUTPA\u2019s remedial intent and imposes a privity requirement that the legislature previously had removed from the statutory scheme. Relying on <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp., </em>supra, 490 U.S. 93, the plaintiff further argues that the trial court identified an inconsistency between federal and state law that does not exist inasmuch as federal antitrust law does not preempt state statutes that authorize the recovery of damages by indirect purchasers.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We find the plaintiffs reliance on <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp., </em>supra, 490 U.S. 93, misplaced. In that case, the United States Supreme Court considered whether federal antitrust law preempted state indirect purchaser statutes, that is, state statutes authorizing indirect purchasers to recover for overcharges passed on to them by direct purchasers in violation of state antitrust law. See generally id., 100-101. In holding that such statutes were not preempted, the court reasoned that the congressional purposes underlying the direct purchaser rule, which the court identified in <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 720, namely, the avoidance of unnecessarily complicated antitrust actions; see id., 732-33, 741, 745; the encouragement of vigorous federal antitrust enforcement by providing direct purchasers incentives to bring antitrust actions; see id., 734-35, 745, 747; and the avoidance of multiple liability; see id., 730-31, 737-38; did not govern state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>antitrust statutes. <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp., </em>supra, 105-106 (\u201c[t]he congressional purposes on which <em>Illinois Brick </em>was based provide no support for a finding that state indirect purchaser statutes are pre-empted by federal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The fact that federal law does not preclude states from authorizing indirect purchasers to recover damages for antitrust violations is irrelevant to the present analysis, however, because our legislature has expressed the intent that Connecticut\u2019s antitrust law be interpreted harmoniously with federal antitrust law. General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b. Under federal law, an indirect purchaser may not recover under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act for a defendant\u2019s antitrust violations. See, e.g., <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Utilicorp United, Inc., </em>supra, 497 U.S. 207. Likewise, we concluded in part I of this opinion that an indirect purchaser cannot recover damages under this state\u2019s Antitrust Act. Therefore, the issue before this court is not whether federal law preempts state antitrust law but, rather, whether an indirect purchaser who is barred from recovering under our <em>state </em>antitrust law may nonetheless recover under CUTPA for the same allegedly anticompetitive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The plaintiff contends that \u201cby abolishing CUTPA\u2019s privity requirement our legislature made clear its intent that indirect purchaser-consumers be allowed to bring CUTPA claims.\u201d The plaintiff, however, has directed us to no authority, including any part of the legislative history of Public Acts 1979, No. 79-210, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 79-210), pursuant to which the privity requirement of \u00a7 42-110g was eliminated, in support of his claim.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>our own examination of the legislative history of P.A. 79-210 has not uncovered any such legislative intent. Nevertheless, we previously have held that, with the removal of CUTPA\u2019s privity requirement, the legislature did not intend to displace the remoteness doctrine as a standing requirement with CUTPA\u2019s ascertainable loss requirement. <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>258 Conn. 313, 373, 780 A.2d 98 (2001). We, therefore, reject the plaintiffs claim that the elimination of CUTPA\u2019s privity requirement from \u00a7 42-110g (a) a fortiori compels us to conclude that the plaintiff, as an indirect purchaser, has standing to pursue his CUTPA claims arising out of the defendant\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive conduct.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201cIn 1973, when CUTPA was first enacted, the predecessor to \u00a7 42-110g contained language that limited standing to \u2018 [a]ny person who purchases or leases goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>or services . . . .\u2019 Public Acts 1973, No. 73-615, \u00a7 7. In 1979, however, the legislature amended [CUTPA], deleting all references to \u2018purchasers, sellers, lessors, or lessees.\u2019 [P.A. 79-210], \u00a7 <em>1.\u201d Jackson v. R. G. Whipple, Inc., </em>225 Conn. 705, 724, 627 A.2d 374 (1993). Notwithstanding the ehmination of the privity requirement, we previously have stated that \u201cit strains credulity to conclude that CUTPA is so formless as to provide redress to any person, for any ascertainable harm, caused by any person in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 725-26. Thus, notwithstanding the broad language and remedial purpose of CUTPA, we have applied traditional common-law principles of remoteness and proximate causation<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> to determine whether a party has standing to bring an action under CUTPA. See, e.g., <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 372-73; <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 300, 306-308, 692 A.2d 709 (1997); <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 222-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Accordingly, in <em>Ganim, </em>we held, inter alia, that the harms alleged by the plaintiffs, the city of Bridgeport and its mayor, against the defendant firearms manufacturers, trade associations and retail sellers were too remote and derivative with respect to the defendants\u2019 conduct in designing, marketing and selling firearms; <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 258 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>344; and, consequently, the plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their claims, including a CUTPA claim, for their alleged injuries. Id., 365, 372-73. In <em>Ganim, </em>the city and mayor of Bridgeport brought an action in nine counts against the defendants alleging, inter alia, that the defendants\u2019 design, marketing and sale of firearms had victimized city residents and contributed to an increase in city crime, resulting in, inter alia, higher expenses related to policing and emergency and social services. Id., 327. The plaintiffs sought to recover pursuant to the Connecticut Product Liability Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq., and CUTPA. <em>Ganim, </em>v. <em>Smith, &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 325-26. The plaintiffs also set forth common-law claims of public nuisance, negligence, unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy. Id., 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In concluding that the city and mayor of Bridgeport lacked standing because their injuries were too remote with respect to the defendants\u2019 conduct, we employed a three part policy analysis used by the \u201c[federal] courts in their application of the general principle that plaintiffs with indirect injuries lack standing to sue .... First, the more indirect an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to determine the amount of [the] plaintiffs damages attributable to the wrongdoing as opposed to other, independent factors. Second, recognizing claims by the indirectly injured would require courts to adopt complicated mies apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, in order to avoid the risk of multiple recoveries. Third, struggling with the first two problems is unnecessary whe[n] there are directly injured parties who can remedy the harm without these attendant problems.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 353. These considerations are similar to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>on which the direct purchaser rule of <em>Illinois Brick </em>rests.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Applying the three part policy analysis to the facts of the present case, we are convinced that the plaintiffs claimed injuries are too indirect and remote with respect to the defendant\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive conduct for the plaintiff to recover under CUTPA. Turning to the first factor in the analysis, we highlight the numerous links in the chain of distribution that separate the plaintiffs claimed damages, namely, that he had paid a monopoly price for the defendant\u2019s Windows 98 software, from the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct. According to the plaintiffs complaint, the plaintiff had purchased from a retailer a personal computer onto which Windows 98 had been preinstalled. As we noted in part I of this opinion, the plaintiffs complaint is bereft of any facts tending to demonstrate that the plaintiffs injuries were a direct result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Considering the fact that Windows 98 was preinstalled onto a personal computer that the plaintiff had purchased from a retailer in combination with the allegation that the defendant had sought to induce original computer equipment manufacturers, such as IBM, Gateway, Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, to install Windows 98 onto their respective computer systems, we identify at least one additional known link separating the defendant\u2019s conduct from the plaintiffs alleged injury. The plaintiff also alleged in his complaint that the original computer equipment manufacturers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>distributors had factored the price of Windows 98 into their costs and had \u201cpassed most, if not all, of [the defendant\u2019s] monopoly price on to [the] plaintiff and [all other similarly situated end user licensees].\u201d Accordingly, the plaintiff traces his injuries to the defendant by virtue of the following chain of events: first, the defendant illegally overcharged the original computer equipment manufacturers for licenses to install Windows 98 onto the computers that they had manufactured; second, the manufacturers factored the overcharges into their costs when they priced and sold to retailers the computers onto which Windows 98 had been preinstalled; and third, retailers passed on either the whole overcharge or a part thereof to the plaintiff and other consumers. The numerous steps between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs injury \u201calone is strongly suggestive of remoteness.\u201d <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Turning to the second factor of the analysis, we must determine whether recognizing the claims of the indirectly injured would lead to apportionment problems and the risk of multiple recoveries under the circumstances of the present case. To allow the plaintiff to recover for his injuries under the circumstances of the present case inevitably would lead us into a quagmire whereby we would be required \u201cto adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, in order to avoid the risk of multiple recoveries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 353. These are the same concerns that the court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>identified in declining to allow indirect purchasers to recover damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. See <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 431 U.S. 737-38. As we discussed in part I of this opinion, the direct purchaser rule had arisen, in part, out of a concern that allowing indirect purchasers to recover \u201cwould transform treble-dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge\u2014from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers.\u201d Id., 737. Added to the difficulties of apportionment is the impossible task of measuring the damages of each indirect purchaser, from those closest to the direct purchaser to those, like the plaintiff, who are the ultimate purchasers of finished products. See id., 741-42 (discussing inherent problems of measuring impact of illegal overcharge at each level in chain of distribution). The second factor of our analysis counsels against such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The third factor in our analysis also counsels against allowing the plaintiff to recover damages for his injuries. Under this factor, we consider whether \u201cthere are directly injured parties who can remedy the harm without these attendant problems.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 353. The plaintiff identifies at least two additional levels of parties, namely, original computer equipment manufacturers and retailers, whose injuries are more closely related to the defendant\u2019s conduct. There may be, however, additional layers of injured parties throughout the distribution chain not yet identified by the plaintiff. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs injuries are too remote in relation to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and, consequently, the plaintiff lacks standing to assert a CUTPA claim against the defendant on the basis of the defendant\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive conduct. See id., 346-47 (remoteness of injury implicates party\u2019s standing and, in turn, court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction).

First, the court had granted certiorari on the issue of whether a consumer alleging noncommercial injuries may recover under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, which arose from an interlocutory order that the District Court had certified to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Id., 334-36. Second, the court explained in a footnote that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals expressly had declined to address whether the plaintiffs claim for treble damages was barred by the direct purchaser rule and, therefore, that issue was not before the United States Supreme Court on appeal.

A frequent, unfortunate exception concerns the antitrust laws. Under Connecticut law, a consumer, a business, even the state, cannot recover for the harm caused by a violator of our antitrust laws <em>unless </em>the consumer, business or the state purchased a product or service <em>directly </em>from the violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u201cIn antitrust cases, when competing manufacturers conspire to fix prices, a middleman purchases the goods at a higher price and passes that higher price onto the consumer. The consumer is ultimately harmed but cannot recover from the manufacturer. Only the middleman can recover damages but the middleman has passed along the higher costs to the consumer and has suffered little, if any, harm. Thus, this anomaly in <em>the law </em>harms anyone who is an indirect purchaser, including retailers, to small businesses, union health plans, and ordinary consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u201cSenate Bill 1262 simply provides that any person who is harmed by the actions of an antitrust violator may recover damages from the violator of our laws. . . .
