On July 31,1997, the plaintiff, Nickola J. Cunha, was injured when the vehicle that she was driving on Whitney Avenue in Hamden was struck by a vehicle operated by the named defendant, Carlos Colon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Colon was driving a vehicle leased to him by its owner, the defendant, Elrac, Inc. (Elrac). The plaintiff commenced this action for damages against Colon and Elrac, claiming that the injuries she sustained were caused by Colon\u2019s negligent operation of the leased vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim against Elrac was predicated upon \u00a7 14-154a, which provides that the owner-lessor of a motor vehicle is liable to the same extent as the lessee for any personal or property damage caused by the lessee\u2019s operation of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Following the commencement of this action, the plaintiff issued a written release to Colon and his insurance carrier, Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), in consideration for payment of $20,000. The written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>release purported to release Colon and Allstate from liability for any damages arising from the July 31, 1997 motor vehicle accident and purported to extend to \u201cColon and Allstate . . . only.\u201d Thereafter, Elrac amended its answer to allege, by way of special defense, that the release issued by the plaintiff to Colon also operated to relieve Elrac of any liability to the plaintiff arising out of Colon\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Elrac subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its special defense. The plaintiff objected to Elrac\u2019s motion on the ground that, under \u00a7 52-572e, the release \u201cof one joint tortfeasor does not discharge the other tortfeasors unless . . . the release so provides.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e (b). In support of its motion for summary judgment, Elrac relied primarily on <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>249 Conn. 709, 725, 735 A.2d 306 (1999), in which this court concluded that \u00a7 52-572e did not apply to vicariously hable defendants. The trial court concluded that Elrac was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of our holding in <em>Alvarez.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>supra, 249 Conn. 709, we considered \u201cwhether, notwithstanding ... \u00a7 52-572e, a release executed in favor of an employee operates as a matter of law to release the employer whose sole liability is premised on the doctrine of respondeat superior.\u201d Id., 710-11. We answered that question in the affirmative, observing, first, that, at common law, \u201cwhere the liability of a principal for a tort committed by his agent is predicated solely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior, a valid release of either operates to release the other.\u201d Id., 715-16. We then carefully examined the language, history and purpose of \u00a7 52-572e to determine whether it had abrogated that common-law doctrine. Id., 716-23. In concluding that it did not, we explained that \u201cthe intent of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 52-572e was to enable an injured party to secure payment of damages from one tortfeasor while maintaining the right to proceed against other tortfeasors who remain independently at fault <em>for their own wrongful acts that contributed to the injury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id., 719; accord id., 722. We further explained that \u201ca principal whose liability rests solely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior and not upon any independent act of the principal is not a joint tortfeasor with the agent from whose conduct the principal\u2019s liability is derived. . . . Essentially, aside from the relationship between the parties creating the [potential for] vicarious liability, the principal is not a tortfeasor in the true sense of the word because he is not independently liable based upon his own independent actionable fault.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 720-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We agree with the trial court that <em>Alvarez </em>controls the present case. The plaintiff seeks to invoke \u00a7 52-572e in the context of a claim against Elrac that is predicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>solely upon Elrac\u2019s vicarious liability under \u00a7 14-154a for the tortious conduct of its lessee, Colon. As we explained in <em>Alvarez, </em>however, \u00a7 52-572e was intended to apply only to joint tortfeasors who are independently at fault on the basis of their own tortious conduct, and not to individuals or entities whose sole liability is derivative or vicarious in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The plaintiff seeks to distinguish <em>Alvarez </em>on the basis that that case involved the applicability of \u00a7 52-572e to common-law principles of vicarious liability, whereas the present case involves the applicability of \u00a7 52-572e to statutorily created principles of vicarious liability. It is true that because the issue in <em>Alvarez </em>was whether the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 52-572e, had intended to abrogate the common-law doctrine that a release of either the employer or the employee operates to release the other; id., 715-16; we were required to construe \u00a7 52-572e strictly under the factual scenario presented in <em>Alvarez. </em>See id., 715 (\u201c[i]n determining whether . . . a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The plaintiff suggests that a strict construction of \u00a7 52-572e is not warranted in the present case, however, because the issue presented does not involve the relationship between \u00a7 52-572e and common-law principles but, rather, the relationship between \u00a7 52-572e and another statutory provision, namely, \u00a7 14-154a. Although we agree with the plaintiff that the present case, in contrast to <em>Alvarez, </em>does not necessarily call for a strict construction of \u00a7 52-572e, we are not persuaded that that fact alone requires a different result. The plaintiff does not challenge our determination in <em>Alvarez </em>that \u00a7 52-572e was intended to enable an injured party to secure a settlement payment from one tortfeasor while maintaining the right to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ceed against other tortfeasors who remain independently at fault on the basis of their own tortious conduct. Id., 719, 722. In light of that conclusion regarding the fundamental purpose of \u00a7 52-572e, we see no reason why our holding in <em>Alvarez </em>is not equally applicable to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e provides: \u201c(a) For the purposes of this section the term \u2018joint tortfeasors\u2019 means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property whether or not a judgment has been recovered against all or any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">\u201c(b) A release by the injured person, or his legal representative, of one joint tortfeasor does not discharge the other tortfeasors unless, and only to the extent, the release so provides.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a provides: \u201cAny person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable lor any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Colon was insured under a policy issued by Allsl ate Insurance Company with a per person liability limit of $20,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> The plaintiff also named her automobile liability insurance carrier, Infinity Insurance Company (Infinity), as a defendant, alleging that Infinity improperly had refused to pay her underinsured motorist benefits to which she claimed she was entitled under her policy. The plaintiff, however, subsequently withdrew her claim against Infinity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> The plaintiff previously had filed a motion for summary judgment as to liability only. The trial court denied that motion on the basis of our holding in <em>Alvarez.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> We note, preliminarily, that \u201c[t]he standards governing our review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established. Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>253 Conn. 381, 385-86, 752 A.2d 503 (2000). The plaintiff does not assert the existence of any disputed material fact; she claims, rather, that the trial court improperly applied \u00a7\u00a7 52-572e and 14-154a to the undisputed facts of this case. Thus, our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the trial court\u2019s decision is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Karl &amp; Gelb, P.C. </em>252 Conn. 153, 156-57, 745 A.2d 178 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
