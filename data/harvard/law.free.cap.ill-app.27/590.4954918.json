Dunlap &amp; Swift had, prior to that time, sold the house and lot to appellee and received from him a mortgage or trust deed thereon to secure a part of the purchase money.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\" pgmap=\"587\">On May 19, 1883, a policy for \u00a71,000, was issued by the Hartford Fire Insurance Company to appellee, on the application of Dunlap &amp; Swift, insuring him for three years against loss or damage by fire on the house, a clause in said policy declaring the same void in case of other insurance, or the vacancy of the house for ten days without written consent indorsed on the policy. This policy7 was delivered to Dunlap &amp; Swift and no part of the amount named therein has ever been paid to appellee.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\" pgmap=\"587\">The premium for the latter policy was paid to Dunlap &amp; Swift by appellee, he, at that time, authorizing them to procure the policy on their interest, as mortgagees, in the property. He never saw the policy, nor was he informed that it covered his interest, or designated him as the insured party, until after the building was burned.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-7\" pgmap=\"587\">On August 22, 1885, appellant issued its policy insuring appellee against loss or damage by fire for three years to the extent of \u00a7500 on said house and \u00a7500 on the furniture, providing therein that it should be void in case of other insurance. From August 20, 1882, until the-latter part of September, 1885, the house was occupied as a dwelling by appellee, but he vacated the same some time in the last named month, with no intent of returning, and the same remained vacant from that date until destroyed by fire. On October 16, 1885, appellee procured the cancellation of the policy dated August 22, 1885, and appellant at the same time issued to appellee another policy for \u00a71,000 on the house alone, for a term commencing October 16, 1885, and ending August 22, 1888, providing therein that the policy should be void in case of other insurance or vacancy of the house.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-8\" pgmap=\"587(53) 588(16)\">When appellant\u2019s last policy was issued, its agent was informed by appellee that the house was vacant, but no consent was given by any of the companies by indorsement on any of the policies, to other insurance or vacancy of the! house. The premises were about wholly destroyed by fire on November 15, 1885, and this suit was brought by appellee on the policy dated October 16, 1888.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-4\" pgmap=\"588\">The defense was (1) other insurance, (2) vacancy, (3) the alleged burning of the building by plaintiff.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\" pgmap=\"588\">There was a verdict and judgment for appellee from which this appeal is taken.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-6\" pgmap=\"588\">Messrs.

J.</author> <p id=\"AGf\" pgmap=\"589\">Appellant claims that the Hartford, policy was not a valid insurance until the expiration of the term of the first policy issued by the Agricultural Insurance Company, that is, on the 21st day of August, 1885, but that it became operative on the last named date, and so remained until after the issue of the policy sued on. If that be so, we are not informed how the liability of the Hartford Company was con-tinned more than ten days after the house became vacant.</p> <p id=\"b589-12\" pgmap=\"589\">Its polic)' provided that the insurance should be void if the house became vacant and so remained for ten days, and the proof is uncontradicted that the house was vacant and unoccupied for more than ten days before the policy sued on was issued.</p> <p id=\"b589-13\" pgmap=\"589\">That being the fact there was no other insurance on the premises on October 16, 1885. American Ins. Co. v. Padfield, 78 Ill. 167; .Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 92 Ill. 64; American, Ins. Co. v. Foster, 92 Ill. 334.</p> <p id=\"b589-16\" pgmap=\"589(147) 590(56)\">The vacancy of the building, however, is no defense for appellant. When the policy sued on was issued, the house was unoccupied, and had been in that condition for several weeks. Of this appellant\u2019s agent had full notice when the policy in question was issued. Ho objection was then made to the vacancy, nor did appellee promise to have the house occupied. The injustice of permitting appellant to now deny its liability on that ground is apparent. To deliver a policy with full knowledge of the facts upon which its validity may be disputed, and then to insist upon these facts as ground of avoidance, is to attempt a fraud. This the courts will neither aid nor presume, but prefer to find there was an intent to waive the known ground of avoidance. May on Insurance 497. A review of the evidence, for the purpose of refuting the proposition that the appellee burned the building, would not be, under existing circumstances, a suitable employment of the time of this court. It is sufficient to say that the question was fairly submitted to the jury, and we think their finding for appellee is supported by the evidence; and it meets with our approval.</p> <p id=\"b590-5\" pgmap=\"590\">There was no error in the instructions given for the plain iff, or in the modification of those requested by the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b590-6\" pgmap=\"590\">Ao wrong has been suffered by appellant, nor is there, in the record any technical departure from the approved rules. The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b590-7\" pgmap=\"590\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
