People v. Dulaney, 96 Ill. 503; State v. Zanesville Turnpike Co., 16 Ohio St. 308; High on Extraordinary Remedies, Secs. 25, 321; State ex rel. v. Howard Co. Ct., 30 Mo. 375.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-3\" pgmap=\"401\">Even if it should be allowed that a contract might be made the basis for an application for the writ of mandamus, the circumstances in this case are such as that a well founded doubt arises as to whether the petitioners would be entitled to any remedy upon their petition. Granting that the contract was made as alleged in the petition, yet, as in the case of People ex rel. v. Johnson, 100 Ill. 537, \u201cby reason of a complication of circumstances not specifically provided for by the statute, a well founded doubt arises, either as to the right of the applicant to receive the fund, or the duty of the officer to pay it out, mandannus is not the proper remedy. The riglitin such cases being doubtful, the claimant must resort to some other appropriate remedy to determine it;\u201d so here, since the right to have the particular switch is so far made doubtful by the act of appellees in admitting another railroad to the use of it, that clear right which must be established before a petitioner can have the writ, can not be said to exist in this case. People ex rel. v. Klokke, 92 Ill. 134.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-4\" pgmap=\"401\">There is no legal duty existing on the part of appellant to restore the connections between its railroad and the mine of appellees.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0e\" pgmap=\"401\">The principle is wrell established that where it is sought by mandamus to coerce the performance of a particular act, \u201cthe party applying must show not only the clear, legal right to have the thing done, but he must show affirmatively that the corporation has the power, and that it is its duty, to do the act in the manner sought.\u201d Tap pan on Mandamus, page 11; People v.

App. 613.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\" pgmap=\"401(100) 402(53)\">The constitution requires no act upon the part of appellant but simply that it should permit some act to be performed by appellees, and before appellees can complain that they are obstructed in the exercise of that right, they should show that they have taken the steps which are essential to give them the perfect right, and to make the duty of appellant safe, specific and clear. As at common law, so under our statute, the object of memdamus is to compel the performance of some particular act or acts of imperative duty due by clear right to the relator, which he has properly demanded and the respondent has refused. Where the duty is not specific, hut general, and its performance as such involves the exercise of judgment and discretion, the writ will not lie. This is elementary law. Commissioners, etc., v.

App. 385.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b404-8\" pgmap=\"404\">Gary, J.</author> <p id=\"Axd\" pgmap=\"404(219) 405(186)\">Stripped of their verbiage, the pleadings In this ease present this state of facts: In 1879, under a eontraet between the parties, the appellants constructed a switch by which cars from the line of their road could be taken to a coal shaft of the appcllees-and returned to the line, thereby furnishing facilities for the appellees to send their coal to market. This condition of things continued until 1887, during all which period appellants furnished to appellees, over this switch, such cars as appellees required for the transportation of their coal, when, by another company, another line of road was constructed, to which the appellees obtained access by a switch so constructed that cars of that other company can be, over the switch connected with appellants\u2019 road, taken upon their line. Thereupon the appellants disconnected the switch from their line, and allege as the reason for so doing, that as the cars of the other company could, over that switch, be taken upon their line,it was dangerous to the lives of their passengers and employes, and to their property, to continue it. The appellees filed their petition for a mandamus to compel the appellants to restore the connection, and thereafter furnish ears for their coal, as before, and rely upon the former course of business between the parties, and upon Sec. 5, Act 13, Cons, of 1870, that \u201cail railroad companies shall permit connections to be made with their tracks so that any * * * coal bank I* * * may be reached by the cars of said railroad,\u201d and upon paragraph 84, Chap. 114, Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Bev. Stat.: \u201c Every railroad corporation in the State shall furnish, start and run cars for the transportation of such passengers and property as shall, within a reasonable time previous thereto, be ready or be offered for transportation at the several stations on its railroads, and at the junction of other railroads, and at such stopping places as may be established for receiving and discharging way passengers and freights; and shall take, receive, transport and discharge such passengers and property at, from and to such stations, junctions and s places5 on and for all trains advertised to stop at the same for passengers and freight respectively, upon the due payment or tender of payment of tolls, freight or fare legally authorized therefor, if payment shall be demanded,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b405-5\" pgmap=\"405\">The appellants say that the provision of the constitution is not self-executing, and, if it were, the manner of connecting is so various under differing circumstances, that mandamus is not an appropriate remedy.</p> <p id=\"b405-6\" pgmap=\"405\">If any degree of certainty as to the manner of connecting in the best way would avail the appellees, the conduct of the parties for the eight years furnishes it; and upon the authority of Vincent v. C. &amp; A. R. R. Co., 49 Ill. 33, if a court of chancery could adapt its process to the relief to which the appellees are entitled, that court would do what appellees now ask to have done, unless the reason for denying it assigned by the appellants is good.</p> <p id=\"b405-7\" pgmap=\"405\">C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. People, 56 Ill. 365, is authority that if the appellees are entitled to the relief they ask, mamdamus is an appropriate remedy.</p> <p id=\"b405-8\" pgmap=\"405(54) 406(40)\">And so the whole case turns upon the question whether the fact that a trespass upon the propierty of the appellants might be committed through the facilities furnished by this switch, and thereby the appellants exposed to great injury and loss, is a good cause for discontinuing it. It is obvious that no such trespass can be committed by the other company except over the premises of the appellees, who had it in their power, physically, for eight years, to push cars upon the main line of appellants\u2019 road, but never abused that power.</p> <p id=\"AVEz\" pgmap=\"406\">No motive can be conceived for anybody to do it. The same facilities exist in thousands of places all over \u201c the land of the free and the home of the brave,\u201d and the nation is not unhappy.</p> <p id=\"b406-5\" pgmap=\"406\">In a case where such large interests are involved, if the real merits of the case are apparent, it is not worth while to spend any time upon the niceties of the special pleading.</p> <p id=\"b406-6\" pgmap=\"406\">The judgment being such as the appellees are entitled to, upon the merits, it is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b406-7\" pgmap=\"406\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
