The bill, after setting out in detail the nature of complainants\u2019 business, alleged that on February 17, 1886, said recorder caused them to be served with the following copy of a notice:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-14\" pgmap=\"32\">\u201c Cook County Recorder\u2019s Office. ) \u201cFebruary 17th, 1886. j</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-15\" pgmap=\"32\">\u201cMessrs.

It alleged an intention on the part of the defendants to deprive complainants of that right, and irreparable damages which they would suffer in consequence, and prayed for an injunction against the defendants to restrain them from denying access to such original instruments or record books or interfering with such clerks, etc., in making use of, handling or abstracting the contents of such originals or records, and that such injunction be made perpetual.

When the corporator\u2019s application to inspect is founded on his general right he has a mandamus, but when it is founded on a suit pending he obtains a rule.\u201d See People v. Cornell, 47 Barb. 329; Herbert v. Ashburners, 1 Wilson, 297.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-3\" pgmap=\"37\">Iii Townsend v. Register of Deeds, 7 How. Pr. 413, if was held that any person so desiring had a right to examine the books of record, without charge, and this would be accorded not as a privilege, nor as a favor, but as a matter of absolute right. In State v. Williams, 41 N. J. 332, the English cases are considered at length, and it is said: \u201cIt seems, therefore, to be sufficient if the person seeking inspection has such an interest in a specific controversy as will enable him to maintain or defend an action for which the public documents will furnish competent evidence or necessary information. \u00a1Nor is it essential that his interest should be private, capable of sustaining a suit or defense on his own personal behalf. It will justify his demand for inspection, if he may act in such suit as a representative of a common or public right.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-4\" pgmap=\"37\">The evidence establishes, and it will not be denied, that all real estate transactions in the county of Cook, selling, borrowing, etc., have been for years conducted upon the basis of these abstracts of title, and that the entire business community reposes upon this system, which has obtained for so long- a time that the present generation can not remember to the contrary.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\" pgmap=\"37\">The attempt by action under the resolution in question to put an end to complainants\u2019 business is destructive of the fruits of the uninterrupted labor of fourteen years, since the fire, and subversive of the public interests, not only furthered by but absolutely based upon the system, which has subsisted for thirty-four years.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\" pgmap=\"37\">That the continuation of the existing abstracts of title is of public concern is sufficiently apparent from the evidence, and is expressly recognized as such by the \u201cAct to remedy the evils consequent upon the destruction of any public record, by fire or otherwise,\u201d (Hurd\u2019s Rev. Stat. 1881, 877,) by section 23 of which the business is largely regulated.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\" pgmap=\"37\">Threatened with special injury, the complainants can in their own names vindicate the public interests.

Goudy &amp; Green, also for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b38-4\" pgmap=\"38\">McAllister, J.</author> <p id=\"AZ\" pgmap=\"38\">The transactions in question took place, and the bill in this case was brought, before the statutes concerning recorders and the inspection of records in the office of the former, approved respectively May 31 and June 16, 1887, were passed. (Sess. Laws, 1887, p. 256, 258.) Consequently, the provisions of those acts can have no application to this case,, and it must be decided upon the law as it stood at the time of bringing the suit. The question therefore is, were the complainants entitled, as a matter of legal right, to have access to the original instruments left in the custody of the recorder for the purpose of having them recorded, and to books of records in the office, and to handle, use and make abstracts of them, for the purposes of their business, without interference or hindrance on the part of the recorder of deeds? There is nothing in the statute relative to recdrders of deeds, as it then existed, which gives the least color to any such claim. By such statute, the oath for the faithful discharge of his duties, Sec. 22, requires him to give a bond with sufficient security in the penal sum of \u00a720,000, and prescribes the condition of that bond, which shall be \u201c for the faithful discharge of his duties, and to deliver up all papers, books, records and other things appertaining to his office, whole, safe and undefaeed, when lawfully required so to do.\u201d 2 Starr &amp; C. Ill. Stat. p. 1984. That provision is a plain, indisputable, legislative recognition of the common law rules applicable to such officer and his duties, to the effect, that by virtue of his office he becomes the legal custodian of all papers, books and records appertaining to his office, and is responsible for their preservation from injury, alteration, mutilation, defacement or safekeeping.</p> <p id=\"b38-5\" pgmap=\"38(97) 39(19)\">Mow, can it be maintained that the law is so unreasonable as to charge a public officer with such duties and responsibilities, but deny to him the power, control and discretion, as to the subject-matter, necessary to his protection? The question is not new in the courts of this country. It has arisen and been decided in various courts of the highest respectability, against the claim set up here, in cases that can not be distinguished from this case with regard to the reasons and principles governing tlicir decision. Webber v. Townly, 43 Mich. 534; Bean v. People, 7 Col. 200; Buck v.Collins, 51 Ga. 391; Cormack v. Wolcott, Register, 37 Kan. 391.</p> <p id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">The effect of the decree in this case is to divest the recorder of the power conferred upon him by the law, of exercising a reasonable discretion in the care, management and government of his office, and the preservation of original deeds, hooks and records, confided to his custody. The decree is, for that reason, unauthorized by law, and manifestly erroneous. The Title Guarantee Trust Co. v. Reilly, Register, 38 Hun, 429; The German-American Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Richards, Register, 99 N. Y. 620.</p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">The resolution of the board of county commissioners, embodied in the notice given by the recorder to complainants, and set out in our statement of the case, was, in our opinion, unauthorized and void. And it seems to us that the only-decree to which the complainants were entitled, would have been a decree declaring such resolution void and restraining defendants from attempting to carry it into effect.</p> <p id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">The decree of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b39-8\" pgmap=\"39\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
