The bill alleged: That on April 20, 1885, John B. Lanyon, being the owner of lots eleven and twelve, etc., in Town of Lake, Cook County, Illinois, and being desirous of improving the same with a building to be used as an opera house, applied to orators for a loan of $8,000, to be used in making such improvements; that in compliance with such application orators advanced $9,000; that Lanyon delivered to orators three notes for $3,000 each, due in one, two and three years after date, and to secure payment of the same mule and delivered to orator, F. K. Chandler, as trustee, &amp; trust deed of said lots; that during the year 1885, Lanyon; erected on1 said lots an opera house building; that the upper portion thereof was improved as and for an opera house to be permanently used for giving public theatrical entertainments; that in order to meet the demands of the modern public, Lanyon placed upon the floor of said room 7% opera chairs of a mechanical construction peculiarly adapted for use in an opera house; that said chairs were of a character intended to be permanently attached to the floor of said opera house as a permanent fixture; that said chairs were so placed upon tlie floor of said opera house during its construction and were securely attached and fastened to said floor and building by screws firmly imbedded in said floor, by means whereof said chairs, and each thereof, became a permanent incident and improvement of said opera house building; that it was the intention of Lanyon in so attaching said chairs to said floor in the manner above specified, thereby to make them permanent fixtures and improvements in said building; that in view of the distinctive character of said building such chairs constitute an indispensable part of said opera house, and without the same, said house would be valueless for the purposes contemplated in its construction; that said $9,000- is now wholly due, but it is wholly unpaid; that said trust deed remains in full force; that on February 19, 1887, Lanyon delivered to A. H. Andrews &lt;fe Company six notes, $200 each, due in two, four, six, eight, ten and twelve months after date, and to secure the same executed to said Andrews &amp; Company a chattel mortgage upon said 796 opera chairs; that the last of said notes will fall due February 19, 1888, and that Lanyon is in default on five of said notes; that it is the intention of said defendant, to foreclose said mortgage upon the maturity of said last note, and to detach and remove said chairs, the same being permanently attached to said building; that if such intention are carried out it will result in irreparable injury to orators and wholly destroy the utility of said opera house, and greatly impair and lessen their security.

Paine, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\" pgmap=\"104\">The case of Sword v. Low, 13 M. E. Pep. 826, shows clearly that Illinois is one of the States in which the rule has become established that chattels annexed to realty under an agreement that they shall continue to remain personalty will retain their chattel character against a mortgagee of the real estate.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\" pgmap=\"104\">In that case the court says: \u201cTo determine the irremovable character of a fixture, three tests are by the modern authorities applied, viz.: 1. Actual annexation to the realty or something appurtenant thereto; 2. Application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated, and, 3. The intention of the parties making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u201d See, also, Kelly v. Austin, 46 Ill. 156.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-11\" pgmap=\"104(32) 105(109)\">In the case of Crippen v. Morrison, 13 Mich. 23, where a real estate mortgage was given with a verbal agreement that the mortgagor would erect a saw-mill on the premises, he did erect the saw-mill, but he gave a chattel mortgage on the engine and machinery six months after the real estate mortgage, having bought the engine upon express agreement to secure the purchase price by chattel mortgage. The seller of the engine was held to have the better right in a contest with the real estate mortgagee,and the court said: \u201cThe property which was the subject of this litigation was only erected upon the premises upon the agreement that it should be subject to a chattel mortgage for its purchase price. Bv this the parties kept it separate from the realty and it never became poart of it.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\" pgmap=\"105\">The complainants in this case must rest their case simply and alone upon the presumption that improvements made by the mortgagor on the mortgaged premises were made for the benefit of the inheritance. This presumption is not absolute, but may be rebutted by agreement between the mortgagor and the owner of chattels annexed. Ewell on Fixtures, 283. But conceding for the moment all that appellees claim respecting the permanent accession of these chairs to the freehold, still appellees can not complain of their removal \u201cunless such severance would impair the mortgagee\u2019s security and render it of doubtful adequacy.\u201d Till they can show that without the chairs their security is of doubtful adequacy, they have \u201cno remedy for such severance either by recaption of the articles severed, action at law for such severance, or for the articles severed, or by injunction to restrain the mortgagor from making the same.\u201d Ewell on Fixtures, 49.</p><attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\" pgmap=\"105\">Mr. Howard Hark, for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b105-7\" pgmap=\"105\">Moran, P. J.</author> <p id=\"Apt\" pgmap=\"105(100) 106(15)\">The question presented for decision is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the opera chairs are to be considered fixtures, as between the real estate mortgagee and the holder of the chattel mortgage, who sold and delivered the chairs upon a contract that the deferred payments for them should be secured by a chattel mortgage upoiW them. \"Whether articles which are attached to a building become a part of the realty or remain movable fixtures, will depend, according to the weight of authority, upon the intention of the party affixing them, particularly where the articles attached can be removed without injury to the articles themselves or to the freehold.</p> <p id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">Here the intention of Lanyon, that the opera chairs should remain personal property, is very clearly evidenced by his agreement in the contract of purchase that he would give a chattel mortgage upon them to secure part of the purchase money, and that he would insure them, \u201c loss, if any, payable to A. H. Andrews &amp; Co.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106\">We can not see that the rights of appellant are at all affected by the fact that the first chattel mortgage expired and that a new one was executed to secure the balance of the purchase money yet remaining unpaid. While the lien secured by the first chattel mortgage expired, the intention with which the chairs were put in the building continued and the new chattel mortgage created a new lien upon them, whereas the lien of the real estate mortgage did not extend to them, they continu-. ing to be chattels. It is not deemed necessary to examine and discuss the various authorities with reference to the law of fixtures as applicable to the facts of this case. We regard, the case as controlled by Sword v. Low, recently decided by the Supreme Court, 11 Western Rep. 719, in which\" the cases on the subject are fully cited and considered. And see, also, Campbell v. Roddy, 12 Central Rep. 821.</p> <p id=\"b106-7\" pgmap=\"106\">It is not alleged in the bill that Lanyon is insolvent, or that the removal of the chairs would so reduce the value of the property as to make the security inadequate. The answer alleges that the property covered by the mortgage is of the val\u00fae of \u00a710,000, and the loan secured is \u00a79,000. Under that state of facts it seems to be established that the mortgagee is not entitled to an injunction to restrain the removal of fixtures which are subject to the lien of the mortgage. Ewell on Fixtures, 49, and cases cited.</p> <p id=\"b106-8\" pgmap=\"106\">This condition of the record was proper to be considered on the motion to dissolve, and would, in our opinion, warrant the granting of the order of dissolution.</p> <p id=\"b106-9\" pgmap=\"106\">The order overruling the motion to dissolve the injunction will he reversed, and the case will be remanded to the Circuit Court, with directions to enter an order dissolving the preliminary injunction now existing in said cause.</p> <p id=\"b106-10\" pgmap=\"106\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
