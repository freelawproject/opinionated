Egbert Jamiesoh, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\" pgmap=\"229\">Bill in equity filed by appellees against appellant and Josef Matousek, praying that a deed of trust which was executed by complainants to Matousek, conveying to him a certain lot in Chicago, to secure a loan of \u00a7500, may be declared a cloud on complainants\u2019 title to said lot; that the trust deed and the notes secured thereby may he delivered up to be canceled. The facts are that Charles Drabek in November, 1883, was a loan agent in Chicago, and as such agent on November 2, 1SS3, loaned to appellees \u00a7500, which was the money of Jan and Katerina Wacha. The principal and interest notes were made payable to them, and the trust deed to secure the notes ran to Matousek as trustee. The notes were left in the hands of Brabek until the appellant purchased them, at which time she\u00a1 or her brother for her, took possession of them, and whenever interestJbeeame due she received it from Brabek, as the notes were payable at his office, and left with him the matured interest note. In November, 1885, the principal note became due and was extended for two years, new interest notes being executed, Brabek attending to the transaction, the appellant, Yiskocil, and appellees not meeting or knowing each other at the time. Before the two years extension terminated appellees paid the entire amount of the principal and interest to Brabek, although he did not have possession of the principal or last two interest notes. In April, 1887, appellees discovered that appellant held the three notes last mentioned and filed this hill for relief as stated.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\" pgmap=\"229\">On final hearing the court entered a decree as prayed for in the bill, from which appellant prayed an appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-4\" pgmap=\"230\">Messrs.

Jokes &amp; Lusk, for appellees.</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-10\" pgmap=\"230\">We maintain that the testimony of the appellant taken alone is sufficient to show that Drabek was her. general financial agent; that she did all her financial business through him; that she had loaned money through him and to him, and that she had deposited money with him, even to her last cent; that she was satisfied when he told her that \u201c she should be satisfied; that everything is in good order.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-11\" pgmap=\"230\">We respectfully refer to the case of Hurd v. Marple, 10 Ill. App. 421, in which the court say: \u201cBy placing the money in his hands to loan without any restrictions or limitations upon his authority made known to third persons, appellee constituted him her general agent in that behalf.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-13\" pgmap=\"230\">If, therefore, Drabek was appellant\u2019s general agent in this case, he had full power to collect, extend time, collect before due, or, in short, do anything the appellant could have done.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-14\" pgmap=\"230\">Drabek certainly had the right to collect the notes. Her ratification of his acts in collecting the coupons would invest him with full power to collect the principal note; and we have shown, in addition, that such is the universal custom among agents of that kind, when a note is specifically made payable at the agent\u2019s office. When such a custom exists the presumption is that both parties are acquainted with it. U. S. Life Ins. Co. v. Advance Co., 80 Ill. 549; Thompson v. Elliott, 73 Ill. 221.</p> <opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b231-3\" pgmap=\"231\">Garnett, J.</author> <p id=\"AWH\" pgmap=\"231\">When appellant purchased the notes in question she took them from Drabek and kept them. At the maturity of an interest note she presented it for payment, in a business-like manner, at his office, where it was payable, and received her money.</p> <p id=\"b231-4\" pgmap=\"231\">He was not her agent, at any time, in respect to the making or collection of the principal or interest on this loan. Any payment made to him after she took possession of the notes was made at the peril of the parties paying. That she had other transactions with Drabek and had money deposited with him is not of the slightest importance. His fraudulent representations to appellees, not made in the presence of appellant, can not, by any known rule of law, operate to her disadvantage.</p> <p id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">If Drabek had made the original loan for appellant, and as her agent, still he would have had no right to receive principal or interest, except where a note was left with him so as to give him apparent authority. Cooley v. Willard et al., 34 Ill. 68; Stiger v. Bent, 111 Ill. 328; Thompson et al. v. Elliott, 73 Ill. 221.</p> <p id=\"b231-8\" pgmap=\"231\">The evidence introduced by appellees to prove a custom authorizing Drabek to collect the notes has no bearing on this case. The proof had no tendency to prove such a custom as would avail the appellees on the undisputed facts shown in this record.</p> <p id=\"b231-9\" pgmap=\"231\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p> <p id=\"b231-10\" pgmap=\"231\">Reversed, and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
