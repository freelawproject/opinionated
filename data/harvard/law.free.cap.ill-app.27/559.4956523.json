Kelley were doing business under the firm name of Enright &amp; Kelley on the first day of July, 1885, as wholesale liquor dealers, within the said city of Chicago, and have continued as such up to the present time, and that, on said July 1, 1885, and ever since said time, said En-right and Kelley have sold, within the city of Chicago aforesaid, spirituous and vinous liquors in quantities of one gallon or more at a time without any license so to do from the city of Chicago, and that said Enright and Kelley have \u00faever applied for, nor have asked of the city of Chicago any license for said period from July 1, 1885, to May 1, 1887, under the provisions of this ordinance, but on the contrary have refused so to do, notwithstanding that the city collector has made frequent and repeated demands upon them for said license fees for each of said years.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-5\" pgmap=\"561\">Messrs. Hempstead Washburne, Clarence A. Knight and John W. Green, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\" pgmap=\"561\">The Supreme Court, in Dennehy v. City, 120 Ill. 627, settled the question as to the validity of the ordinance in question. Now, by this ordinance, a duty was imposed upon defendants to pay the amount of license fee fixed by this ordinance, The city has the undoubted right to prohibit altogether, or to classify liquor dealers as decided by the court in the Dennehy case. The power given the city is, \u201cTo license, regulate and prohibit the selling or giving away of any intoxicating, malt, vinous, mixed or fermented liquors, the license not to extend beyond the municipal year in which it shall be granted, and to determine the amount to be paid for such license.\u201d The city having the right to prohibit or grant licenses, determines that it will grant, and in so doing determines the amount to be paid for such license. In this case it has said that the amount to be paid by every person sell-ling as a wholesale dealer shall be $250 per annum. When it so determined, it fixed the amount which every person engaging in that business should be liable to pay for that privilege or right.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\" pgmap=\"561(124) 562(32)\">In the case of East St. Louis v. Trustees of Schools, 102 111. 491, the court say: \u201cWhere a municipal corporation has power to prohibit the doing of a thing, and also the power to license the same thing to be done, the license fee demanded by ordinance for the doing of such thing is not a tax, but is a price paid for the privilege of doing such thing; and so it was held in People v. Thurber, 13 Ill. 554; Ins. Co. v. Peoria, 29 Ill. 180; East St. Louis v. Wehrung, 46 Ill. 392; Ducat v Chicago, 48 Ill. 172; Walker v. Springfield, 94 Ill. 372. In People v. Thurber it is said of a like exaction, this is not a tax * * * but is a burden * * * for the right of exercising-a * * * privilege which the legislature would have the right to withhold or inhibit altogether.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\" pgmap=\"562\">So the city in this case fixed the price to be paid for the privilege of doing business as a wholesale dealer. The amount of license fee required in this case is from the persons and not from the property.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\" pgmap=\"562\">It would seem from the cases cited that the ordinance in question imposes on appellees a duty to pay the amount of the license fee fixed, and having created the duty to pay under the law, then necessarily a right of action accrued to the city, and the law implies a promise to pay on the part of appellees.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\" pgmap=\"562\">In County Comm\u2019rs v. Duchett, 20 Md. 468, the court say: \u201c When a duty is imposed by law and no remedy prescribed, a right of action accrues as at common law, otherwise there would be a right without a remedy.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-9\" pgmap=\"562\">In Fuller v. Curtis, 2 Black, 461, the court say: \u201cWhere the case shows that it is the duty of the defendant ro pay, the law implies to him a promise to fulfill that obligation.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-10\" pgmap=\"562\">In Earle v. Coburn, 130 Mass. 596, it is said: \u2018.\u2018There may be cases where the law will imply a promise to pay by a party who protests he will not pay, but those are cases in which the law creates a duty to perform that for which it implies a promise to pay, notwithstanding the party owing the duty absolutely refuses to enter into an obligation to perform it. The law promises in his stead and in his behalf.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-12\" pgmap=\"562\">In San Louis v. Hendricks, 71 Cal. 242, suit was to recover - \u00a7150, the amount of a license for selling liquors, and for damages and costs of suit; the court says: \u201cThe license tax sought. to be recovered in this action is not a penalty, but in the nature of a debt due from the defendant to the county, or, what is the same thing for present purposes, a duty devolved upon the defendant personally, which can be enforced precisely as though he had contracted with the county to pay such sum of money. People v. Seymour, 16 Cal. 332; Perry v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 351; Guy v. Washburn, 23 Cal. 116; City of Oakland v. Whipple, 39 Cal. 115.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-13\" pgmap=\"562(12) 563(102)\">The theory of all cases that may be found denying the right to bring an action for the recovery of the license fee is that when a penalty is fixed for the non-payment of the tax or license that penalty must be pursued. But our Supreme Court have long since denied this doctrine, and say that in case of a tax that it may be sued for in an action of debt, and the remedy by distress is merely cumulative. Ryan v. Gallatin County, 14 Ill. 78; Dunlap v. Gallatin County, 15 Ill. 7; People v. Stahl, 101 Ill. 346; Geneva v. Cole, 61 Ill. 397; Binkert v. Wabash Ry. Co., 98 Ill. 214.</p><attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-4\" pgmap=\"563\">Bo counsel appeared for the appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b563-5\" pgmap=\"563\">Moran, J.</author> <p id=\"AT_\" pgmap=\"563\">The first count of the declaration proceeds upon the assumption that appellees, having sold spirituous liquors in quantities of one gallon or more without having obtained the license required by the ordinance, became indebted to the city for the amount of the license fee. The consideration for a license is sought to be recovered while it appears from the allegations of said count that no license had in fact been taken out.</p> <p id=\"b563-6\" pgmap=\"563\">The count was clearly bad, and the demurrer to it was properly sustained.</p> <p id=\"b563-7\" pgmap=\"563\">\u201cA person carrying on a business for which a license is required, can not be compelled to take out a license. If he neglect or refuse to do so, he may be subject to a criminal prosecution, or he may be held to have agreed to pay a specific penalty instead of the amount of the license tax; but he certainly owes nothing for a license until he has taken out a license.\u201d Santa Cruz v. Santa Cruz R. R. Co., 56 Cal. 143.</p> <p id=\"b563-8\" pgmap=\"563\">The action of the court in overruling the demurrer to appellees\u2019 plea presents a different question. The second count is for a penalty for violating the ordinance in the manner stated in the count. The plea is of the statute of limitations found in the Criminal Code, Sec. 375, which is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b563-9\" pgmap=\"563\">\u201cAll prosecutions, by indictment or otherwise, for misdemeanors or for any fine or forfeiture under a penal statute, shall be commenced within one year and six months from the time of committing the offense or incurring the fine or forfeiture, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"AxJ\" pgmap=\"564\">The proceeding set out in said second count is not a prosecution by indictment or otherwise. The well understood legal signification of the word prosecution is a criminal proceeding, and as such it must in this State be in the name of the people. The limitation in the section above quoted applies to such criminal prosecutions by indictment or otherwise (as by information, when authorized) for any fine or forfeiture under a penal statute. It can have no application to a proceeding to collect a penalty which is not in any sense a criminal prosecution. The ordinance does not inflict a fine for its violation, but in terms imposes a penalty. Where penalties are imposed and no direction is given as to the mode of procedure for their recovery, an action of debt is a proper remedy. Webster v. The People, 14 Ill. 365; Vaughn v. Thompson, 15 Ill. 39; Town of Jacksonville v. Block, 36 Ill. 507.</p> <p id=\"b564-5\" pgmap=\"564\">An action of debt for a penalty for the violation of a municipal ordinance is purely a civil action. Town of Lewiston v. Proctor, 27 Ill. 414; Town of Havana v. Biggs, 58 Ill. 483; Webster v. The People, supra; Town of Partridge v. Snyder, 78 Ill. 519.</p> <p id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">The second count is, then, an action of debt for a statutory penalty, and not a prosecution for a fine or forfeiture under a penal statute. It is, therefore, not governed by the limitation of eighteen months, fixed by Sec. 375 of the Criminal Code, but by See. 14 of the general statute of limitations, which allows two years after the right accrues within which to bring the action.</p> <p id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">It follows that the court erred in overruling the demurrer to appellees\u2019 plea to the second count of the declaration. All the questions of law in this record arise on the pleadings.</p> <p id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564\">There is in the record an agreed statement of facts, upon which appellant is entitled to a judgment against appellees, but the amount of such judgment this court has no jurisdiction to fix on this record. That question must be left to the determination of the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b564-9\" pgmap=\"564\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b564-10\" pgmap=\"564\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
