Did adding \u201cnow\u201d to the statement that the checks were \u201cgood\u201d have the effect to limit or change the acceptance? If the checks were \u201cgood now,\u201d when and by whose act did they cease to be \u201cgood?\u201d If at all, evidently only by the act of appellee, when it charged up to Snyder the amount of his demand note. May a bank, after it has knowledge of outstanding checks drawn on it, against funds of the drawer, in its hands, and which it has previously declared \u201cgood now, \u201d use the funds in its hands that made the check \u201c good now\u201d for the purpose of paying a subsequently maturing debt of the drawer, in its hands?

Some points of difference are that a check is drawn on a bank or banker. No days of grace are allowed. The drawer is not discharged by the laches of the holder in presentment for payment unless lie can showdhat he has sustained some injury by the default. It is not necessary that the drawer of a bill should have funds in the hands of the drawee, while a check in such case would be a fraud.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-4\" pgmap=\"255\">In Merchants Nat. Bk. v. Bitzinger, 118 Ill. 484, the essential characteristic of a check is held to be that it shall be instantly payable on demand.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">And a check \u201cis not due until payment is demanded, and the statute of limitations runs only from that time.\u201d Merch.

Leather Man. Bank, 11 Paige, 612.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-11\" pgmap=\"255(14) 256(51)\">The inquiry here is, after all, not as to what would be, in the abstract, a sufficient demand to hold an indorser, but whether this bank, holding Snyder\u2019s note, payable to itself on demand at his office, had the right to demand and pay itself without first hunting up Snyder and requesting him, personally, to pay, he having telegraphed that he would have to close.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">In Home National Bank v. Newton, 8 Ill. App. 563, a very well considered case, this court held it to be \u201ca settled principle that where a depositor in a bank is indebted to the bank by bill, note, or other independent indebtedness, the bank has the right to apply so much of the funds of the depositor as may be necessary to satisfy the bank,\u201d and that \u201cthe same rule obtains where a depositor makes his paper to third persons, payable at the bank. As it is the duty of the bank to pay its customers\u2019 checks, when in funds, so at least it has authority, if it is not under actual obligation to pay his notes and acceptances made payable at the bank. It is a presumption of law that if a customer does so make payable or negotiable at a bank, any of his paper, it is his intent to have the same discharged from his deposit.\u201d This latter application of the rule, when confined to the rugular customers of the bank, is sustained by the text books and the weight of authority. 1 Daniel\u2019s Neg. Inst. (3d Ed.), Secs. 326a and 326b, and cases cited in notes. Morse on Banking (2d Ed.), p. 37.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahd\" pgmap=\"256\">But whether a bank at which paper is payable may apply the maker\u2019s funds (he being a regular customer) to pay it or must do so, need not to be discussed, as it is well settled that when a bank is itself the holder of a bill or note there payable, it may apply to the funds of the principal payor to pay it. 1 Danl. Neg. Inst. (3d Ed.), Sec. 326b; Dawson v. Real Est. Bank, 5 Pike, 284; McDowell v. Bank of Wilmington, 1 Harr. 369. Where the bill or note is made payable at a particular bank,and the bank itself is the holder, all the demand that is necessary is for the bank to examine the account of the maker, and if he has any balance, \u201cthe bank would have a right to apply it to the payment of the note.\u201d Bank v. Smith, 11 Wheaton, 171, on p. 178; 6 Curtis\u2019 Dec. 550; Lord v. Thornton, 3 Leigh, 695; State B. v. Armstrong, 3 Dev. 519; \u00c6tna N. B. v. Fourth N. B., 46 N. Y. 88; Kymer v. Laurie, 18 L. J.

If the former, appellee is not estopped to deny its liability, because the reply stated the truth and appellant was not injured thereby; neither did lie purchase the drafts (or checks) on the faith of such reply. Treating the telegram, however, as a request to accept payable on the following Monday, the reply of the bank can not be regarded as a compliance with the request. There is a distinct implication in the words \u201c Drafts named are good now,\u201d that the bank would not undertake to answer for the state of Snyder\u2019s account beyond the moment when its telegram was sent. Myers did not regard it as an acceptance payab\u2019e Monday, else he would not have demanded payment the Saturday previous. But his counsel argues that the reply of the bank was equivalent to writing \u201cgood\u201d or \u201caccepted\u201d on the face of the paper. If so, the bank at once became the principal debtor, and was hound to pay whenever the paper was presented. Appellant did not consider that he had secured any such undertaking from appellee, but regarded it purely as a race of diligence. An acceptance is a contract, and does not differ from other contracts in the essential requirement of a meeting of minds. A hank is not bound to accept by telegram the checks or drafts of its depositors, although in possession of funds to pay. Its duty in such cases is to accept a draft, or pay a chock, only on presentment. One relying on a, telegram as an acceptance, should see to it that the language used will, at least, fairly bear the meaning. Rees et al. v. Warwick, 3 Eng. C. L. 467.</p> <p id=\"b258-4\" pgmap=\"258\">The ease at bar is easily distinguishable from Coffman v. Campbell, 87 Ill. 98. There the defendants plainly said they would pay the draft, but added a phrase which did not explain itself. Having promised to pay in positive terms, the court held that if they desired to add a condition it should have fully expressed it. But here the intention to accept is not expressed; on the contrary, as we have shown, appellee\u2019s telegram plainly implied that it would not agree to hold Snyder\u2019s balance for any time to meet the paper held by Myers.</p> <p id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">Appellant contends that the making and delivery of the checks operated as a transfer to him of so much of Snyder\u2019s deposit as was required to pay them, and that after receipt of the telegrams the bank could not pay to itself a debt due from Snyder, and thereby exhaust the fund which had been appropriated to the payment of the checks. For that doctrine reliance is placed on several cases decided by the Supreme Court of this State, but the only one which appears to have serious importance is Bank of America v. Indiana Banking Co., 114 Ill. 483. That was a contest between a check-holder and an attachment creditor. A garnishee summons was served on the bank after the check was delivered, and before the bank had notice of the check. After service of the garnishee process the bank paid the check, and the court held the payment rightful. But it is well settled that an assignment of a chose in action protects the assignee against subsequent garnishment of the debtor by the creditor of the assignor, if the defense is properly presented. Brake on Attachment, Sec. 527.</p> <p id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">In the case at bar the dispute is between two creditors, one of whom is a check-holder and the other the holder of a note payable at the same bank; it is equivalent to a contest between two check-holders. The sound doctrine in such cases is set forth in Morse on Banks and Banking, p. 266, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b259-3\" pgmap=\"259\">\u201cThe rule with checks is, \u2018first come first served.5 If payment is demanded at noon upon a check which the depositor\u2019s unincumbered balance at that hour is sufficient to pay in full, the obligation of the bank to pay it in full is at once mature and perfect. It is no matter how many checks may be presented at later hours, or how much the sum of all the checks presented in the course of the day may exceed the amount of the customer\u2019s balance. This is no concern of the bank, not even if it has been informed that such checks have been drawn and will be presented for payment. Its perfectly simple duty is to pay in full each check presented, at the time of presentment, so long as the unincumbered credit of the depositor suffices to enable it to make such payments in full.\u201d This rule meets our approval. Any other must lead to endless confusion.</p> <p id=\"b259-4\" pgmap=\"259\">Considering the merits of the respective claims we shall have no difficulty in holding the equity of the bank to be at least equal to that of Myers. There was no privity between them. Myers received his checks several days before Snyder made his deposit of $5,000 in the bank, hence he could not have relied on that deposit at the time he paid Snyder for the checks. In a similar case, First National Bank v. Pettit et al., 41 Ill. 492, the court said: \u201cWo do not see * * * upon what principle it [the bank] should be required first to pay a debt due from Allen [the depositor] to persons with whom it has had no transactions and who, if losers, are so by no fault of the bank. The debt due from Allen to it is as meritorious as that due the appellees,\u201d the holders of the checks. The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b259-6\" pgmap=\"259\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
