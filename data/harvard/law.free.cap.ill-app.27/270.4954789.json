Elliott Anthony, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-13\" pgmap=\"266\">This was an action by plaintiffs in error against the defendants in error to recover for commissions alleged to have been earned by the plaintiffs while acting as brokers, within the corporate limits of the city of Chicago, for the defendants, in the purchase of certain mining stocks.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-14\" pgmap=\"266\">The defendants filed the plea of the general issue and affidavit of merits, also a special plea, to which the plaintiffs interposed a demurrer. The court overruled the demurrer, whereupon, the plaintiffs electing to abide by their demurrer, final judgment was rendered, from which plaintiffs bring error to this court, and assign for error the overruling of said demurrer. The said special \u00a1ilea is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-15\" pgmap=\"266(64) 267(132)\">\u201c And for a further plea in this behalf the said defendants, by Frederic Hllmann, their attorney, say that the said plaintiffs ought not to have maintained their aforesaid action thereof against them, because they say that, at the time of the making of the said several supposed promises and undertakings in the said declaration mentioned, if any such were or was made, the plaintiffs were carrying on and exercising, within the corporate limits of the city of Chicago, in said Cook County, to \u2022wit, at the county of Cook, the business of brokers by the co-partnership name and style of Hustis, Conglan &amp; Hay; and the defendants in fact aver that, at and prior to the time aforesaid, there was and had been, and from thence hitherto has been and still is in full force and effect in said city of Chicago, in the county aforesaid, an ordinance theretofore duly passed by the city council of said city, duly approved by the mayor of said city, and duly published according to law, in the words and figures as follows, to wit: \u201cBeit ordained by the Gity Council of the City of Chicago:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">\u201c Section 1.

Baeton, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268(112) 269(15)\">Plaintiffs in error insist, first, that the business of stock broker is not included in the ordinance, and that, therefore, plaintiffs were not required to take out a license; second, that the question of whether or not plaintiffs had a license, even though positively required to take out one, was wholly between them and the municipality, and could not in any way affect the relations between plaintiffs and defendants. There being nothing unlawful in any of the occupations enumerated in the ordinance, either in themselves or as the result of statutory inhibition, there is nothing in the nature of the business sought to be licensed which would vitiate the contract between tlie broker and his customer under which the broker could claim remuneration for his services.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">All enactments should be construed according to their intention, and the intention of this ordinance is manifest. It aims to exact a license fee from every banker and every money cln.nger, whose occupations are so well known as to require no definition, and from every merchant, produce or grain broker, every insurance broker and every real estate broker, and that no guilty man may escape, it was made clear by sections 2, 3 and 4, what was intended to be included. Had it been intended to require of a stock broker a license, his business would have been more particularly described than the others, for a stock broker is a rara avis in Chicago, while the others are more numerous than the followers of any other business in. the city.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">Assuming, however, that plaintiffs in error violated the provisions of the ordinance when they acted as brokers in buying mining stocks for the defendants, yet they are entitled to recover their brokerage from the defendant. The statute authorized the city to tax, license and regulate, and if by the ordinance it has taxed and licensed this particular business, it has not declared it unlawful to pursue it without paying the tax and taking out the license, and is powerless to make it unlawful even if it tried.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\" pgmap=\"269(157) 270(75)\">It is absurd to say that the same act committed in the same manner, with the same publicity, in the same commonwealth, is unlawful on one side of a municipal boundary and lawful on the other side in any sense in which the word unlawful can be used when an act so characterized would vitiate a contract based on the act. While it may be said that the authorized ordinance of a municipality has the same effect as an act of the legislature and be good as a general principle of law, yet the municipality can not exceed the powers of the legislature and the legislature could never say that the same consideration for a contract was in one place in the State unlawful and the contract void, and in another place was lawful and the contract valid. The following cases hold that a penalty-imposing ordinance in no respect enters into the civil relations between the person liable to the penalty for an infraction of the terms of the ordinance and other persons: R. R. Co. v. Ervin, 89 Pa. St. 71; Henry v. Sprague, 11 R. I. 456; Chambers v. Trust Co., 1 Disney, (Ohio), 336; Van Dyke v. Cincinnati, 1 Disney, 532; Jenks v. Williams, 115 Mass. 217; Peck v. Austin, 22 Texas, 261; See Royal v. Virginia, 116 U. S. 572; Insurance Co. v. Polleys, 13 Pet. 157.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">There is yet another reason why this plea is bad, and that is on account of a very wise and just distinction laid down in the English case of Smith v. Mawhood, 14 M. &amp; W. 452, which is, that when it is the intention solely of the legislative body to make the act illegal and to prohibit it, then the act can not be a good consideration for a contract; but when the sole or main object is to raise revenue, the act is not illegal in the sense that a contract based upon it is void, and can not be enforced.</p><attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">Mr. Fbedebic Ullmann, for defendants in error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APX\" pgmap=\"270\">An action for commissions or brokerage for negotiating the sale of stocks belonging to other parties can not be maintained by brokers who have\" not obtained a license to do business as brokers under the city ordinance set out in the plea. The weight of authority is that the imposition of a penalty implies a- prohibition.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\" pgmap=\"270\">\u201cWhen an incorporated town or city has been invested with power to pass-an ordinance by the legislature for the government or welfare of the municipality, an ordinance enacted by the legislative branch of the corporation, in pursuance of the act creating the corporation, has the same force and effect as a law passed by the legislature, and can not be regarded otherwise than a law of and within the corporation.\u201d Mason v. Shawneetown, 77 Ill. 533, 537; Wright v. C. &amp; N. R. R., 7 Ill. App. 438; Hopkins v. Mayor of Swansea, 4 Mills &amp; W. 640; Heland v. City of Lowell, 3 Gray, 408.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\" pgmap=\"270(42) 271(84)\">Where a statute enacts a penalty for carrying on a particular business without a license, no action can be maintained on a contract made by one who violates the statute, even though the statute contains no prohibition. Bensley v. Bignold, 7 Eng. Com. Law, 188; Downing v. Ringer, 7 Mo. 585; \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 11 Wis. 412; Williams v. Cheney, 3 Gray, 222; Jones v. Smith, 3 Gray, 500; Cincinnati Mut.

Braun v. Chicago, 110 Ill. 186. While the language of the ordinance is somewhat peculiar, yet we are inclined to the. opinion that it was intended to and does fairly embrace and apply to brokers in stocks. If we are right in that conclusion then it follows, as\" we thinkfrom the doctrine of the prevailing current of authorities, that the plaintiffs, being unlicensed as brokers at the time of the purchase by them as such, of the stock in question, their act was unlawful and they can not recover commissions, so that the plea must be held to be good and the judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b271-11\" pgmap=\"271\">Judgment affirmed*</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
