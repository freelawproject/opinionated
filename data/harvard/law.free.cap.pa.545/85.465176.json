The court of common pleas affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part an interest arbitration award under Act 111.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As is relevant to this case, the court of common pleas upheld an interest arbitration award which provided that pensions to be received by members of the Nazareth Borough Police Association (\u201cthe Association\u201d) be based upon gross (W-2) earnings. This Court granted allocatur limited to the issue of whether pension benefits are to be calculated on the basis of a pensioner\u2019s gross earnings rather than merely that pensioner\u2019s base salary when it is found that there is no inequity between the income-driven bases upon which pension contributions are paid into a plan and upon which pension benefits are paid out to beneficiaries. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The Borough employs ten full-time and two part-time police officers. The Association is an unincorporated association operated and maintained by four police officers employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the Borough. The Borough and the Association failed to successfully negotiate a police contract for the contract year beginning 1991. By letter dated September 5, 1990, the Association notified the Borough of its intent to proceed to binding arbitration pursuant to Act 111 and enclosed a list of issues in dispute. Subsequently, on August 7, 1991, the arbitration panel, in a 2-1 decision, issued an award which provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">ITEM # <em>7\u2014Pension Benefits</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">Section 4. Effective January 1, 1991, pensions to be received by members of the Police Department shall be based upon gross (W-2) earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">(Arbitration Award at 4; R.R. at 21a).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The Borough filed an appeal in the court of common pleas. It challenged the legality of Item 7, section 4 of the arbitration award. With regard to this section of the award, the court of common pleas affirmed the arbitration panel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Borough of Nazareth v. Nazareth Borough Police Ass\u2019n, </em>No.l991-C-7295 (C.P. Northampton County Feb. 24, 1992). It found that the pension benefits award based on gross (W-2) earnings was not an abuse of authority. <em>Id. </em>at 8. It reasoned that there was no authority to limit the Borough\u2019s ability to set base pension benefits on computations of gross (W-2) earnings. <em>Id. </em>Hence, it held that the arbitration panel was within its authority to require the Borough to do that which the Borough could do voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Washington Arbitration Case, </em>436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The Commonwealth Comet affirmed with regard to this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Borough of Nazareth v. Nazareth Borough Police </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n., </em>161 Pa. Commw. 354, 359, 636 A.2d 1289, 1292 (1994). In so doing, it looked to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em>526 Pa. 324, 586 A.2d 366 (1991). It construed <em>Palyok </em>as having held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A10\">the term \u201csalary\u201d as used in Section 5 of [the Police Pension Fund Act, Act of May 29, 1956, P.L. 1804, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. \u00a7 771 (\u201cAct 600\u201d) ], must be interpreted to encompass <em>all </em>forms of compensation arising from the terms and conditions of the employee\u2019s employment and, if the compensation \u201c[arises] from business connected with the [employer],\u201d it is official in nature and should be used in calculating pension benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><em>Borough of Nazareth v. Nazareth Borough Police Ass\u2019n, </em>161 Pa. Commw. 354, 358-59, 636 A.2d 1289, 1292 (1994)(quoting <em>Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em>526 Pa. 324, 328, 586 A.2d 366, 368 (1991)). Additionally, the Commonwealth Court looked to the Internal Revenue Code in defining \u201cwages,\u201d which must be included on a W-2 form. It stated that section 3401(a) of the Code defines \u201cwages\u201d as \u201c <em>\u2018all remuneration ... </em>for services performed by an employee for his employer\u2019 with certain exceptions not relevant to this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 636 A.2d at 1292. Thus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority when it based pension benefits on gross (W-2) earnings \u201c[b]ecause W-2 earnings are defined in the [Internal Revenue] Code as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer [and this definition] parallels the definition of salary in Act 600, as interpreted in <em>Palyok ....\u201d Id. </em>at 359, 636 A.2d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Judge Pellegrini authored a concurring opinion. He agreed with the majority\u2019s holding that there was nothing in the Police Pension Fund Act that prohibited the arbitrator in an Act 111 arbitration from awarding increased pension contributions. <em>Id. </em>at 361, 636 A.2d at 1293 (Pellegrini, J., concurring). He wrote separately, however, to indicate that in <em>Palyok </em>the operative fact was \u201cthat the Borough had been requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>contributions based on all compensation paid to police, not just based on wages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The Borough appealed to this Court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We have recognized that Act 111 imposes a restraint on judicial activism to ensure swift resolution of disputes involving police and fire personnel. <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. Pennsylvania State Troopers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>540 Pa. 66, 656 A.2d 83 (1995). The legislature\u2019s intent was to prevent Act 111 arbitration from being delayed by protracted litigation. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in appeals regarding arbitration awards, our scope of review is in the nature of narrow certiorari. <em>Id. </em>Under this scope of review, courts are limited to reviewing questions concerning: (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrators; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) an excess of the arbitrators\u2019 powers; and (4) deprivation of constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 656 A.2d at 90. The only question presented here is whether the arbitration panel exceeded its powers in rendering its decision. As we stated in <em>Pennsylvania State Police,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">[a]n arbitrator\u2019s powers are limited. He or she may not mandate that an illegal act be carried out; he or she may only require a public employer to do that which the employer could do voluntarily.... An error of law alone will not warrant reversal under the narrow scope of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Thus, our standard of review is that we must determine if the arbitration panel ordered an illegal act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, exceeded its powers in determining that pension benefits are to be calculated on the basis of the pensioner\u2019s gross (W-2) earnings rather than merely the pensioner\u2019s base salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The calculation of pension benefits is set forth in section 5 of Act 600, 53 P.S. \u00a7 771, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">Monthly pension or retirement benefits other than length of service increments shall be computed at one-half the monthly average <em>salary </em>of such member during not more than the last sixty nor less than the last thirty-six months of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">(emphasis added). Thus, Act 600 directs a police officer\u2019s pension benefits be calculated on the basis of salary. However, the word \u201csalary\u201d is not defined by the Act and has been subject to several constructions by the courts. <em>See Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em>526 Pa. 324, 586 A.2d 366 (1991); <em>Borough of Nazareth v. Nazareth Borough Police Ass\u2019n, </em>161 Pa. Commw. 354, 636 A.2d 1289 (1994); <em>Borough of Beaver v. Liston, </em>76 Pa. Commw. 619, 464 A.2d 679 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Borough argues that the term \u201csalary\u201d as used in Act 600 means base pay. It submits that the Commonwealth Court misinterpreted <em>Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em>526 Pa. 324, 586 A.2d 366 (1991), and erred in finding that salary in Act 600 is synonymous with gross (W-2) earnings. Thus, the Borough concludes that because salary in Act 600 means base pay, the arbitration panel was without authority to direct that pension benefits be calculated on a basis of gross (W-2) earnings. While we agree with the Borough that the Commonwealth Court misinterpreted our decision in <em>Palyok, </em>we nevertheless find that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority in directing that pension benefits be calculated on the basis of gross (W-2) earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In <em>Borough of Beaver v. Liston, </em>76 Pa. Commw. 619, 464 A.2d 679 (1983), the Commonwealth Court was presented with the issue of whether the word \u201csalary\u201d as used in Act 600 should include overtime pay. The retiree in <em>Liston </em>did not have pension fund contributions deducted from his overtime pay. The Commonwealth Court held that the word \u201csalary\u201d included only base pay and excluded overtime compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 464 A.2d at 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em>526 Pa. 324, 586 A.2d 366 (1991), this Court was called upon to address the same issue that was presented in <em>Liston. </em>However, unlike <em>Liston, </em>the retiree in <em>Palyok </em>was required to contribute to the pension fund based on his gross compensation, including overtime and extra work pay. Because of this factual difference, we reversed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s finding that the word \u201csalary\u201d in Act 600 encompassed only base pay. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 586 A.2d at 368. We saw no grounds to treat the various types of compensation differently where \u201cthe Borough implicitly acknowledge[d] the similarity between the regularly scheduled work and the additional work\u201d by deducting retirement contributions from base, overtime, and extra work pay. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 586 A.2d at 368. Our reasoning was based on the premise that \u201c[t]o permit the Borough to require contributions from the overtime and extra work compensation while denying the advantage of the additional compensation in the benefit formula would be inconsistent and inequitable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Thus, in <em>Liston, </em>where the employee was not required to make contributions from overtime pay, it was appropriate for the Commonwealth Court to find that the word \u201csalary\u201d encompassed only base pay. However, in cases such as <em>Palyok, </em>where the employee was required to make contributions from overtime and extra work compensation, it would be inequitable not to include overtime and extra work pay in the calculation of monthly pension benefits. Thus, the term \u201csalary\u201d as embodied in Act .600 denotes base salary and excludes other forms of compensation unless the parties through past practice or agreement have expanded this definition. This is consistent with our decision in <em>Palyok. </em>To the extent that the Commonwealth Court ruled that the term \u201csalary\u201d is defined as gross (W-2) earnings, it was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In the case presently before this Court, the Borough argues that the arbitration panel\u2019s decision providing that pensions be based upon gross (W-2) earnings must be stricken because it requires the Borough to commit an illegal act. The Borough alleges that this is the case because pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>Palyok </em>the Borough lacked authority to base pension benefits on gross (W-2) earnings. Thus, it concludes that the arbitration award is unenforceable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The Borough submits that at all relevant times,- the Association\u2019s members have not been required to make contributions to the Borough\u2019s police pension fund. Brief for Appellant at 7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, as the Association states, this is not the case. A review of the record discloses that although member contributions have not been assessed since December, 1987, member contributions had been made prior to that time. (R.R. 40a, 46a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, the Borough failed to reveal to this Court the fact that member contributions were made prior to December, 1987, and failed to disclose the composition of those contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Based on our standard of review and the record presented to this Court, we find that the arbitration panel did not order an illegal act be carried out. The Borough failed to inform this Court as to the contents of the member contributions. This information is essential if we are to determine whether there is no inequity between the income-driven bases upon which pension contributions are paid into a plan and upon which pension benefits are paid out to beneficiaries. Clearly, the Borough has failed to meet its burden of convincing this Court that the arbitration panel ordered an illegal act be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>carried out. Thus, because the Borough has failed to overcome its burden, we find that the arbitration panel did not exceed its powers in rendering its decision. <em>See Pennsylvania State Police v. Pennsylvania State Troopers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>540 Pa. 66, 656 A.2d 83 (1995); <em>Washington Arbitration Case, </em>436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-11\">.

The court of common pleas affirmed the arbitration panel\u2019s award, except intone respect.
