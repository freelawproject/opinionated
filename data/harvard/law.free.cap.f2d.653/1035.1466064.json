While government officials are named as party defendants, this suit is essentially a contest between private parties \u2014 plaintiffs and intervenor \u2014 for the lease. The central question is whether the Department\u2019s interpretation of an administrative regulation should be applied retroactively or prospectively only. The Department and the district court held that the regulation was unambiguous, and that therefore the Department\u2019s interpretation was fully applicable in the administrative adjudication of the private parties\u2019 dispute. Since we conclude not only that the regulation is ambiguous but also that the Department\u2019s interpretation was a reversal of a well established agency practice on which plaintiffs and hundreds of other oil and gas lease applicants reasonably relied, we reverse and hold that the rule should be given prospective effect only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-19\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-20\">The Mineral Lands Leasing Act authorizes the Secretary of Interior to lease wildcat oil and gas lands on a non-competitive basis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(a), (c). The Act expressly \u201centitles\u201d the \u201cfirst\u201d \u201cqualified\u201d applicant to a lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>which applicant is \u201cfirst,\u201d the Secretary operates a \u201csimultaneous filing program.\u201d Under the program, a list of available lands is posted monthly. Those who submit an offer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> during the short filing period are considered to have filed simultaneously. <em>See </em>43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3112.1-2 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A drawing is held, and the maker of the first offer drawn is awarded the lease, provided that he is \u201cqualified.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3112.2-l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">A. <em>The McDonald-Walsh Filing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Plaintiff Stewart Capital Corp. (\u201cStewart\u201d) is a \u201cfiling service\u201d; among its other functions, it files offers in lease drawings for its customers. In the fall of 1976, it was Stewart\u2019s usual practice to affix its customer\u2019s facsimile signature on an offer in order to avoid the logistical problem of having each customer sign personally. In late October of 1976, it filed an offer with the facsimile signatures of plaintiffs Maude McDonald and Harriet Walsh. Stewart\u2019s name did not appear on the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">At a drawing held on November 5, 1976, McDonald and Walsh\u2019s offer was drawn first. Intervenor Roy Thames\u2019 offer was drawn second. Thames filed a protest. He argued that McDonald and Walsh\u2019s offer was not \u201cqualified\u201d because it was not accompanied by certain statements of interest required \u201c[i]f the offer is signed by an attorney in fact or agent.\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3102.6-l(a)(2) (1979)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McDonald, Walsh and Stewart, claiming reliance on prior administrative decisions and practice, as well as the history of the \u201caccompanying statements\u201d regulation, argued that offers bearing facsimile signatures were not \u201csigned by\u201d an agent but were signed by the offerors themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">B. <em>Prior Rules, Decisions and Practice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">To provide a better understanding of the Department\u2019s disposition of Thames\u2019 protest, we think it helpful at this point to examine the history, decisions, and practice on which plaintiffs claimed reliance. Prior to 1964, the \u201caccompanying statements\u201d regulation provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-11\">If the offer is signed by an attorney in fact or agent, <em>or if any attorney in fact or agent has been authorized to act on behalf of the offeror with respect to the offer or lease, </em>[the offer shall be accompanied by] separate statements over the signatures of the attorney in fact or agent and the offeror stating whether or not . . . the attorney in fact or agent . .. has received, or is to receive, any interest in the lease when issued ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">19 Fed.Reg. 8835, 9014 (1954) (codified as amended at 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.42(e)(4)(i) (1954 &amp; Cum.Supp.1962)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>italicized language in the pre-1964 regulation made it clear that the statements of interest were required whenever an agent was authorized to act \u201cwith respect to\u201d an offer, whether or not the agent participated in its signing. In 1959, however, the agency adopted the \u201csole party in interest regulation,\u201d requiring the offeror to state directly whether he was the sole party with an interest in the offer and lease, and, if not, to disclose the names of all other interested-parties. 24 Fed.Reg. 281, 282 (1959) (codified as amended at 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.-42(e)(3)(iii) (Cum.Supp.1962)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The offeror and the other interested parties were further required to submit a separate statement, setting forth the nature and extent of the interest of each, within 15 days after the filing of the offer. <em>Id., as amended by </em>26 Fed.Reg. 3420, 3422 (1961). This new procedure duplicated, to a certain extent, the regulation requiring accompanying statements of interest by agents;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if an agent did have an interest, he and the offeror would be required to disclose it through the \u201csole party in interest\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">In order to reduce the duplication,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Department amended the \u201caccompanying statements\u201d regulation in 1964 by deleting the language italicized above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-10\">If the offer is signed by an attorney in fact or agent, it shall be accompanied by separate statements over the signatures of the attorney in fact or agent and the offeror ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">29 Fed.Reg. 2502, 2503 (1964) (codified at 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3123.2(d)(1) (1965)) (pertinent version at 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3102.6-1 (1979)). The amendment eliminated the need for accompanying statements in a broad class of filings involving \u201cundisclosed\u201d agents. Henceforth, accompanying statements would be required in only one instance\u2014 when the offer was \u201csigned by\u201d the agent. No matter how great an agent\u2019s involvement in a transaction, no accompanying statements would be required unless the offer was \u201csigned by\u201d the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">More than one inference could have been drawn from this amendment of the regulation\u2019s language. One possible interpretation was that the regulation was now concerned with agent-formulated offers that never passed through the offeror\u2019s hands. There was nothing in the regulation, however, to prevent the offeror from signing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>blank offers in advance and having the agent fill the terms in later;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> thus, the purpose of ensuring that the offeror reviews the offer could easily have been circumvented without violating the regulation. A second possible interpretation was that the regulation was now concerned only with offers on which the agent\u2019s name appeared; <em>i.e., </em>when the offer was signed \u201c0, offeror, by A, agent.\u201d This interpretation is also problematic.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Whatever the relative merits of these two interpretations, when McDonald and Walsh filed their offer every existing administrative. statement concerning the regulation favored the latter one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The Secretary first interpreted the revised regulation in A.M. Shaffer, 73 Interi- or Dec. 293 (1966).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Shaffer </em>did not directly involve the question whether an agent had \u201csigned\u201d within the meaning of the regulation, but rather whether the person who had signed was indeed an \u201cagent.\u201d In <em>Shaffer, </em>the persons signing the offers purported to be the offerors; their offers stated, however, that one D. E. Sanburg would acquire an interest. Pursuant to the sole party in interest regulation, they filed statements within 15 days declaring that they were actually agents for Sanburg, and that Sanburg owned a 100% interest in the offer and lease. The Secretary decided that the \u201caccompanying statements\u201d regulation was not clearly applicable to the Shaffers because they had signed as principals, not agents. The Secretary pointed out that the Shaffers had signed the signature line designated for a \u201clessee\u201d rather than that designated for an attorney in fact or agent. <em>Id. </em>at 330 n.3. The Secretary reasoned that since the Shaffers were fully chargeable with the obligations of the offer and lease, and since they had fully disclosed all interests in the lease, \u201cneither the letter nor the spirit of the agency regulation ha[d] been clearly violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. The regulation could be reasonably interpreted by offerors \u201cas covering only situations where the principal is named as the offeror and the agent signs the offer <em>expressly </em>as his agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). To apply the regulation to the situation in <em>Shaffer, </em>the Secretary said, would require its amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">While <em>Shaffer </em>does not deal with the question presented here, it does represent an extremely narrow interpretation of the regulation. More importantly, the Secretary\u2019s statement that the regulation applied only when the agent signs the offer \u201cexpressly\u201d as agent could be read to say that a statement of interest was required only when an agent\u2019s name appeared on the agent\u2019s signature line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">Further support for plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the regulation came in Mary I. Arata, 78 Interior Dec. 397, 4 I.B.L.A. 201 (1971). To be sure, <em>Arata </em>did not involve the regulation concerning agents\u2019 statements; rather, it involved the meaning of the word \u201csigned\u201d under a related regulation requiring each offer to be \u201csigned\u201d by the offeror or his agent, 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3112.2-l(a) (1979) (then 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3123.9(c) (1970)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>Arata had personally stamped her facsimile signature on an offer rather than signing it in ink. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (\u201cIBLA\u201d) held that this was sufficient. \u201cThe law is well settled that a printed name [sic] upon an instrument with the intention that it should be the signature of the person is valid and has the same effect as though the name were written in the person\u2019s own handwriting.\u201d 78 Interior Dec. at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">While <em>Arata </em>did not directly involve the question whether an agent could stamp the principal\u2019s signature as long as the principal \u201cintenfded] that it should be [his] signature,\u201d the IBLA phrased the holding of <em>Arata </em>in language requiring only that the offeror intend the stamp to be his signature, not that the offeror actually do the stamping. Following <em>Arata, </em>it became the practice of the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), the departmental branch responsible for day-to-day administration of the leasing program, to apply this \u201cintent\u201d test for purposes of testing the qualifications of a rubber-stamped offer. When an offer with a facsimile signature was drawn first, the BLM would inquire whether the offeror intended the stamp to be his signature. If the offeror filed an affidavit declaring that this was his intent, the BLM did not disqualify the offer for lack of an accompanying statement, even if it was an agent who affixed the stamp.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Thus, when McDonald and Walsh filed their lease offer, they had good reason to believe that they did not have to file an accompanying statement. <em>Shaffer </em>supported their belief that no agent had \u201csigned\u201d the offer within the meaning of \u00a7 3102.6-l(a)(2); <em>Arata </em>supported their belief that the facsimile stamp operated as their own signatures. On the basis of these precedents, the BLM had sanctioned Stewart\u2019s filing procedure for more than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">C. <em>McDonald-Walsh and Pack</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Consistent with its practice, the Eastern States Office of the BLM dismissed Thames\u2019 protest on March 14, 1977. On May 19, 1977, however, the IBLA handed down its first decision in D. E. Pack, 84 Interior Dec. 192, 30 I.B.L.A. 166 (1977) <em>(\u201cPack I\u201d). </em>In <em>Pack I, </em>the IBLA disapproved the BLM\u2019s practice, holding that an accompanying statement was required whenever an agent affixed the facsimile signature for his principal. The offeror did not always have to sign personally, the IBLA said; if the facsimile were affixed by an \u201camanuensis,\u201d one whose sole function was to affix the signature at the direction of the offeror, then accompanying statements were not required. But if the facsimile were affixed by an \u201cagent,\u201d one with discretionary authority in the formulation of the offer, then the offer had to be accompanied by statements of interest. The IBLA believed that an \u201cagent,\u201d such as Stewart, could not be converted into an \u201camanuensis\u201d for the purpose of affixing the facsimile, even if he had done so at the direction of the offeror. <em>See </em>84 Interior Dec. at 195-96. Therefore, in <em>Pack I, </em>the IBLA held the lease offer of Runnells, another Stewart customer, to be \u201cunqualified,\u201d and it awarded the lease to the second offer drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">On July 5, 1977, the IBLA, following its decision in <em>Pack I, </em>reversed the BLM\u2019s dismissal of Thames\u2019 protest. Ray H. Thames, 31 I.B.L.A. 167 (1977). On September 30, 1977, this action was filed. It was held in abeyance while the IBLA, at the direction of the Secretary, was reconsidering <em>Pack I. </em>On November 9, 1978, the IBLA reaffirmed <em>Pack I </em>and rejected the argument, supported by the BLM itself, that the rule of <em>Pack </em>should be applied prospectively only. D. E. Pack, 85 Interior Dec. 409, 38 I.B.L.A. 23 (1978) (on reconsideration) <em>(\u201cPack II\u201d). </em>In <em>Pack II, </em>the IBLA acknowledged a responsibility to limit new rules to prospective effect when the regulation at issue is ambiguous, <em>id. </em>at 418, 38 I.B.L.A. at 42; it held, however, that the \u201caccompanying statements\u201d regulation was entirely unambiguous, and that Stewart\u2019s interpretation was \u201cbizarre and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>38 I.B.L.A. at 43. It recognized that the BLM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>agreed with Stewart\u2019s interpretation, but held that the BLM\u2019s practice did not require it to refrain from retroactive application of the new rule because the BLM\u2019s practice was not an \u201cofficial decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420-21, 38 I.B.L.A. at 45-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Following <em>Pack II, </em>the court below granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on January 28,1980. On February 19, 1980, a federal district court in Utah upheld the rule of <em>Pack </em>but held that it could not be applied retroactively to the <em>Pack </em>case itself and enjoined the Department from applying it to any other lease offer filed before November 9, 1978, the date of the final decision in <em>Pack II. Runnells v. Andrus, </em>484 F.Supp. 1234, 1237-40 (D.Utah 1980). A district court in Wyoming has followed <em>Runnells. Stewart Capital Corp. v. Andrus, </em>No. C79-123K (D.Wyo. April 24, 1980), <em>appeal pending, </em>No. 80-1642 (10th Cir.). The government\u2019s acquiescence in <em>Runnells </em>and <em>Stewart Capital </em>is demonstrated by its confession of error on the issue of retroactivity in this court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and by the IBLA\u2019s recent decision in Killian L. Huger, Jr., 52 I.B.L.A. 174, 177 (1981). Thus, McDonald and Walsh remain members of a select, unfortunate group: those whose offers were rejected pursuant to the final administrative decision in <em>Pack </em>and whose appeals were heard by the IBLA prior to the court decision in <em>Runnells.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">II. <em>New Pack Construction Approved</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">On this appeal, plaintiffs argue that the <em>Pack </em>rule is arbitrary and capricious and that its formulation was an improper exercise in administrative \u201crulemaking\u201d by adjudication. It is clear, however, that these arguments are not substantial; the central issue is whether the agency should have applied the rule to offers filed before its decision in <em>Pack I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the IBLA\u2019s interpretation of the regulation in <em>Pack </em>was a reasonable one. We must give even greater deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative regulation than we would to its interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering. <em>Udall v. Tailman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). We think that it was reasonable for the IBLA to conclude that when an agent places the offeror\u2019s facsimile signature on an offer, the offer is \u201csigned by\u201d the agent within the meaning of the regulation. The purpose of the regulation, according to the IBLA, is to ensure that the named offeror is the actual offeror by requiring the statements of both the offeror and the agent. Reliance on the \u201csole party in interest\u201d regulation is inadequate, the IBLA reasoned, since its procedure requires only the statement of the offeror concerning the absence of interests in any other party. The offeror\u2019s statement is inadequate when an agent stamps the form because of the danger that the agent may be manufacturing the offeror or acting without his prior consent. <em>See Pack II, </em>85 Interior Dec. at 418-19, 38 I.B.L.A. at 43-44. Such unscrupulous rubber-stamp wielders could defeat an important purpose of the noncompetitive leasing program \u2014 \u201cthat all offerors . . . shall have an equal opportunity for success in the drawings to determine priorities.\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3100.0-5(b) (1979). The IBLA\u2019s conclusion that this danger would be alleviated by requiring the accompanying statements of both the putative offeror and the agent was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">Nor can we agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the IBLA engaged in \u201crule-making\u201d without following the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (the \u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), 553. While the courts have experienced difficulty in articulating a \u201cbright line\u201d distinction between \u201crulemaking\u201d and \u201cadjudication,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number><em>see 2 </em>K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 7:2 (2d ed. 1979), we have no doubt that the Department properly used its adjudicatory procedures in resolving the dispute between these contestants. The existence of a dispute concerning particular individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication. <em>See United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 245, 93 S.Ct. 810, 821, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973). The adjudication of Thames\u2019 protest was not converted into an exercise in \u201crule-making\u201d when the IBLA applied an existing regulation, passed in compliance with APA procedures, to a particular set of facts. Its decision that an offer stamped by an agent is \u201csigned by\u201d the agent within the meaning of \u00a7 3102.6-1, while inconsistent with the practice of the BLM and arguably inconsistent with the reasoning of prior decisions, did not overrule any previous decision to the contrary; in fact, when the IBLA decided Thames\u2019 protest, the only previous case on point was <em>Pack I, </em>a precedent the IBLA was bound to follow.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">In <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947), the Supreme Court held that the decision to make new law through rulemaking or adjudication \u201cis one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 67 S.Ct. at 1580. To hold that the agency abused this discretion by not following the rulemaking provisions of the APA in this case would rigidify the administrative decisionmaking process far beyond the permissible bounds outlined in <em>Chenery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">III. <em>Only Prospectively</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">Having concluded that the legal rule followed in this case was properly established through adjudication, we turn to the related but separate question whether the agency should have applied the rule to this case. While at one time the determination that a rule was properly established through adjudication would have compelled the conclusion that it should be applied with full retroactive effect, <em>see Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 622-24, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1734-35,14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), \u201cthe accepted rule today is that in appropriate cases the Court may in the interest of justice make the rule prospective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 85 S.Ct. at 1737. The Department itself has recognized this very principle in its own adjudications; since 1917, it has refused \u201cto give its later decisions retroactive effect, especially when to do so would adversely affect actions taken and rights and interests acquired by private persons on the faith of the earlier decisions and would inure to the benefit of other private persons.\u201d <em>Safarik v. Udall, </em>304 F.2d 944, 949 (D.C.Cir.) (collecting administrative decisions), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>371 U.S. 901, 83 S.Ct. 206, 9 L.Ed.2d 164 (1962).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Safarik, </em>the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Department\u2019s power to give its decisions prospective effect only. <em>Id. </em>at 950.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>In <em>Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union v. NLRB, </em>466 F.2d 380 (D.C.Cir. 1972), the same court went a step further and held that, under some circumstances, a reviewing court could require an agency to give a rule established by adjudication prospective effect only. The court adopted the balancing test enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chenery: </em>\u201c \u2018[The effects of] retro-activity must be balanced against the mischief of producing a result which is contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles.\u2019 \u201d 466 F.2d at 390 (quoting <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. at 203, 67 S.Ct. at 1581). The court further held that the application of this test \u201cis in each case a question of law, resolvable by reviewing courts with no overriding obligation of deference to the agency decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">While we accept the <em>Chenery </em>balancing test as the appropriate inquiry,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we need not go quite as far as the <em>Retail Union </em>court to decide this case. It may be that an agency\u2019s decision concerning retroactivity is entitled to some deference: after all, in <em>Chenery </em>itself the Supreme Court said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>the decision to make new law by adjudication \u201cis one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency,\u201d and the Court clearly made this remark in light of the general rule that adjudication operates retroactively.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We need not resolve the question of the precise standard of review, however, because we believe that the Department abused its discretion by applying the <em>Pack </em>rule to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">In general, the ill effect of retroactivity is the frustration of the expectations of those who have justifiably relied on a prior rule; the ill effect of prospectivity is the partial frustration of the statutory purpose which the agency has perceived to be advanced by the new rule. <em>See Retail Union, </em>466 F.2d at 390;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>cf. Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. at 636, 85 S.Ct. at 1741 (weighing reliance placed by law enforcement officials on prior rule against extent to which retroactive application of new rule would advance its purpose in the administration of justice). In this case, we believe that the harm to plaintiffs\u2019 justifiable reliance interests is substantial and that it is unfairly and unnecessarily inflicted. Meanwhile, we can see absolutely no harm to the statutory design from limiting the <em>Pack </em>rule to prospective application; in fact, we think that retroactive application would be contrary to the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">We first examine the reasonableness of plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the practice established by the BLM. The regulation did not clearly require plaintiffs to file accompanying statements; the phrase \u201csigned by\u201d an agent is at best ambiguous on the question whether an offer bearing the offeror\u2019s facsimile signature but not the agent\u2019s signature is required to comply. The only administrative interpretations of this language when McDonald and Walsh filed their offer strongly indicated that such an offer was not within the meaning of the regulation: in <em>Shaffer </em>the Secretary said the regulation applied only when the agent signed \u201cexpressly\u201d as agent, and in <em>Arata </em>the IBLA held that an offer with a facsimile signature was signed by the offeror if the offeror intended it to be his signature.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On the basis of these precedents, one branch of the agency itself \u2014 the branch immediately responsible for filing matters\u2014 had concluded that accompanying statements were not necessary and followed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>interpretation for over four years.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, while the IBLA\u2019s decision in <em>Pack </em>did not technically overrule any \u201cofficial decision,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it was unquestionably \u201can abrupt departure from [a] well established practice\u201d of the agency. <em>Retail Union, </em>466 F.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">In these circumstances, we must conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the regulation was a reasonable one indeed. The ex-, treme prejudice to plaintiffs and others who relied on the BLM\u2019s practice \u2014 the denial of an entitlement expressly created by statute, <em>see </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(c) \u2014 must be justified by at least some statutory or regulatory interest in retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">In this case we can find no such justification. The statute itself certainly does not require the definition of a \u201cqualified\u201d applicant adopted by the agency in this case. And while the regulation was adopted to further the general statutory purpose of equal access to leases through full disclosure of interests, there is no serious contention that this purpose will be furthered by applying the <em>Pack </em>rule retroactively to this case. Plaintiffs have complied with the spirit of the regulations by fully disclosing all interests in the lease; they also believed in good faith that they were complying with its letter as that letter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>spelled out in previous decisions and in the practice of the BLM.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Rather than advancement of the statutory purpose through retroactive application of <em>Pack, </em>we can see only its frustration. More than 400 individuals using Stewart\u2019s filing service alone have been awarded leases on offers rendered \u201cunqualified\u201d by the <em>Pack </em>decision. Since leases are often open to challenge long after they have been issued,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the effect of retroactivity is to cloud title to hundreds of issued leases. This \u201cemerging specter of chaotic, piecemeal title challengefs],\u201d <em>Oil Shale Corp. v. Morton, </em>370 F.Supp. 108, 127 (D.Colo.1973), threatens a disruption of the entire statutory leasing program for the sake .of a new interpretation of an ambiguous and inconsistently implemented regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Finding the prospectivity side of the scale full \u25a0 and the retroactivity side empty, we conclude that the agency abused its discretion by applying <em>Pack </em>to the McDonald and Walsh offer, which was filed before the date of the IBLA\u2019s decision in <em>Pack </em>I.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED.

Moreover, even if <em>Pack </em>were an improper \u201crulemaking,\u201d that would not compel the conclusion that this case was not a proper adjudication. <em>See NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 762-66, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 1428-30, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969) (plurality opinion).

Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969). In <em>Wyman-Gordon, </em>six Justices concluded that the establishment of a rule in a prior NLRB adjudication had been an impermissible exercise in \u201crulemaking.\u201d In so concluding, the six Justices relied heavily on the fact that the NLRB had decided to give the rule prospective effect only. <em>Id. </em>at 765, 89 S.Ct. at 1429 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 775-77, 89 S.Ct. at 1434 \u2014 35 (Douglas, J, dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 780, 89 S.Ct. at 1437 (Harlan, J., dissenting). We do not believe, however, that <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>represents a general prohibition against applying new adjudicatory rules prospectively. First, while the plurality opinion gave great prominence to its view that the earlier proceeding was not an \u201cadjudication,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 762-66, 89 S.Ct. at 1428-30, its statements were dicta since it up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>held the application of the rule in the <em>WymanGordon </em>adjudication itself. <em>See </em>2 K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 7:25, at 123 (1979). Second, neither the plurality nor the dissenting Justices relied on the fact of retroactivity alone: they were also concerned because the NLRB had engaged in a quasi-notice and comment procedure, requesting briefs and argument from selected <em>amici curiae, </em>rather than giving all interested persons an opportunity to comment, <em>cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b), (c), as well as a quasi-publication procedure resembling but not complying with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d). <em>See </em>394 U.S. at 763-65, 89 S.Ct. at 1428-29 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 777, 89 S.Ct. at 1435 (Douglas, J., dissenting). In essence, the Justices were concerned that the NLRB <em>\u201cpurported </em>to make a rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 765, 89 S.Ct. at 1429 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added), while ignoring the APA procedures. Third, the six Justices did not discuss, and thus apparently did not consider, the applicability of any of the precedents concerning the propriety of giving case law rules prospective effect only. By contrast, the three concurring Justices did not even feel the need to cite authority for the proposition that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s opinion should not be regarded as any less an appropriate part of the adjudicatory process merely because . .. the Board did not feel that it should upset the [company\u2019s] justified reliance on previous [cases]\u201d by applying the rule retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 774, 89 S.Ct. at 1434 (Black, J., concurring in the result). Finally, while we do not believe that the six Justices considered the subject, we think that the case for preferring rulemaking to prospective adjudicatory rules was much stronger in <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>than it is in this case. On the basis of its general statutory mandate to supervise elections, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c), the NLRB had established a bright line rule requiring employers to give unions a list of employees once the Board has ordered an election. The Board had previously established a directly contrary rule on the basis of the same mandate. As five of the six Justices specifically noted, the NLRB had never used the APA rulemaking process, a process that might have alleviated the hardships created when it reversed itself on bright line rules. <em>See </em>394 U.S. at 765 n.3, 89 S.Ct. at 1429 n.3 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 779 n.2, 89 S.Ct. at 1436 n.2 (Douglas, J., dissenting). In this case, the Department has promulgated detailed rules and has merely attempted to apply them to particular facts. Thus, we do not believe that, in this case, <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>precludes a decision to apply the adjudicatory rule prospectively only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">. When the <em>Chenery </em>Court\u2019s language is read in context, it is clear that the Court was not articulating a test to determine whether an agency\u2019s adjudicatory rule should be given prospective effect only, but rather a test to determine whether the agency should have been required to proceed by rulemaking rather than adjudication. The very argument of the private party in <em>Chenery </em>was that his conduct should not have been prohibited since the agency had not promulgated a rule on the subject. <em>See </em>332 U.S. at 199-201, 67 S.Ct. at 1579-80. And underlying the court\u2019s entire discussion in <em>Chenery </em>was the assumption that adjudication is always retroactive. <em>See id. </em>at 202, 67 S.Ct. at 1580 (\u201cthe Commission, <em>unlike a court, </em>does have the ability to make new law prospectively through the exercise of its rule-making powers\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 203, 67 S.Ct. at 1581 (\u201cEvery case of first impression has a retroactive effect, whether the new principle is announced by a court or by an administrative agency.\u201d). Nevertheless, we think that the <em>Retail Union </em>court was correct in adopting the <em>Chenery </em>balancing test. <em>Chenery </em>was decided before limiting adjudicatory rules to prospective effect had become a commonplace in Supreme Court jurisprudence. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 533-34, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 2316-17, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975) (collecting cases). Since it is now \u201caccepted\u201d that such limitations are sometimes proper, <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. at 628, 85 S.Ct. at 1737, we think the <em>Chenery </em>Court\u2019s balancing test is the appropriate inquiry for determining whether to impose them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">. <em>See </em>note 18 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">. In <em>Retail Union, </em>the court listed five \u201cconsiderations\u201d to aid in comparing the private party\u2019s reliance interest to the agency\u2019s interest in retroactive application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-7\">(1) whether the particular case is one of first impression, (2) whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from well established practice or merely attempts to fill a void in an unsettled area of law, (3) the extent to which the party against whom the new rule is applied relied on the former rule, (4) the degree of the burden which a retroactive order imposes on a party, and (5) the statutory interest in applying a new rule despite the reliance of a party on the old standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">466 F.2d at 390.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">. Intervenor insists that there were in fact other administrative decisions that supported the <em>Pack </em>rule. None of the decisions he cites, however, deals with the meaning and scope of the words \u201csigned by\u201d in the post-1964 regulation. <em>Union Oil Co. of Cal, </em>71 Interior Dec. 287 (1964), involved in the pre-1964 regulation; pri- or to 1964, there was never any question that accompanying statements were required. In <em>Southern Union Prod. Co., </em>22 I.B.L.A. 379 (1975), the IBLA did not indicate how the offer was signed; the question whether the offer was \u201csigned by\u201d the agent was simply not in issue. In <em>Robert C. Leary, </em>27 I.B.L.A. 296 (1976), a decision handed down shortly after McDonald and Walsh filed their offer, the IBLA did articulate its distinction between an agent and an amanuensis. In that decision, however, the IBLA did not say that an agent could not also be an amanuensis for the purpose of signing,, the offer. Instead, the IBLA merely laid down a test which was fully consistent with Stewart\u2019s practice. The IBLA held that the offeror had to \u201crequest\u201d the stamping of the signature and had to \u201cformulate\u201d the offer himself. <em>Id. </em>at 301. By \u201cformulate,\u201d the IBLA said, it meant only that \u201cthe offeror knew that he was applying for an oil and gas lease for the lands described in the offer and that the description was inserted therein before the signature was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.3. Under the <em>Leary </em>test, there is no reason why an \u201cagent,\u201d such as Stewart, could not act as McDonald and Walsh\u2019s \u201camanuensis\u201d after apprising them of the contents of the offer and being requested to stamp their facsimiles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">. At oral argument, the government denied that this was the BLM\u2019s interpretation, and intervenor Thames has vigorously joined in this denial. We admit to our own concern that there is little evidence in the record of exactly what the BLM\u2019s interpretation was. Nevertheless, what evidence there is forces us to conclude that the BLM required only the offeror\u2019s statement that he intended the facsimile to be his signature. First, there is evidence in the record that Stewart had been affixing its customers\u2019 facsimile signatures since the IBLA\u2019s decision in <em>Arata. </em>During this period, Stewart\u2019s customers were awarded over 400 leases. <em>See Runnells v. Andrus, </em>484 F.Supp. 1234, 1239 (D.Utah 1980). There is absolutely no evidence that the BLM had ever raised any question concerning the propriety of Stewart\u2019s procedure. Second, the Secretary conceded, in the reargument of the <em>Pack </em>case, that Stewart \u201cwas clearly going on the existing precedent\u201d of the BLM. <em>See also Pack II, </em>85 Interior Dec. at 425 &amp; n.1, 38 l.B.L.A. at 58 &amp; n.1 (Frishberg, Ch. A.L.J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Intervenor\u2019s only evidence of a contrary practice is the form of inquiry which the BLM sent to plaintiff McDonald in this case. We agree that the form itself indicates that the BLM\u2019s interpretation of the regulation in March 1977 was the same as the IBLA\u2019s later interpretation in <em>Pack: </em>the BLM\u2019s inquiry was not limited solely to intent, but to whether the affixing of the facsimile was done by an agent or a mere amanuensis. In their response to the BLM\u2019s inquiry, however, neither McDonald nor Walsh followed the form; they submitted separate statements describing Stewart\u2019s procedure. Yet, the BLM upheld their offer against Thames\u2019 protest. Moreover, there is no evidence indicating how long this particular form was used by the BLM (it bears a printed date of March 1977), or whether it was used by some or all state offices. Since there is evidence in the record that the state offices were themselves changing their policy in the period preceding the <em>Pack </em>decision, this March 1977 form may have been as much a departure from established practice as the <em>Pack </em>decision itself. On the record before us, therefore, we must conclude that plaintiffs are correct in their characterization of the BLM\u2019s practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">. We reject the argument that an adjudicatory body must technically \u201coverrule\u201d its own prior decision before a limitation of prospectivity may be imposed. Such limitations have been imposed when individuals have relied on lower court decisions, <em>see United States v. Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 542, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 2320, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975) (\u201cunless we are to hold that parties may not reasonably rely upon any legal pronouncement emanating from sources other than this Court, we cannot regard as blameworthy those parties who conform their conduct to the prevailing statutory or constitutional [i. e., lower-court case law] norm\u201d), and when they have relied on an unconstitutional statute, <em>see Kirchberg v. Feenstra, </em>609 F.2d 727, 735-36 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>450 U.S. 455, 101 S.Ct. 1195, 67 L.Ed.2d 428 (1981). The question in a case involving an administrative agency is simply the reasonableness of the private party\u2019s reliance on the particular legal pronouncement, with the level of authority from which the pronouncement emanated a factor in answering th\u00e9 question. In this case, it is absurd to argue that the BLM\u2019s interpretations of the filing regulations were in no way \u201cauthoritative.\u201d Persons attempting to file lease offers had to deal with the BLM on a day-to-day basis and thus had little choice but to accept most BLM interpretations of the filing regulations. Moreover, the BLM had \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d over filing disputes and, indeed, over this very case. It is difficult to accept the proposition that a body with such responsibilities is incapable of making \u201cauthoritative\u201d decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">. Intervenor Thames argues that the statutory purpose will be defeated because he, as the first \u201cqualified\u201d applicant under the corrected interpretation of the regulation, is \u201centitled\u201d to the -lease under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(c). We do not wish to treat lightly the interests of the party with second priority; indeed, if we could accept Thames\u2019 argument that McDonald and Walsh are not \u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the statute, we would uphold the IBLA\u2019s decision. Thames\u2019 argument, however, begs the question whether McDonald and Walsh\u2019s offer was \u201cqualified.\u201d As we have said, the statute does not compel the conclusion that McDonald and Walsh\u2019s offer was not \u201cqualified\u201d; and under the regulation, as implemented by the agency, similar offers have formerly been \u201cqualified,\u201d more recently \u201cunqualified,\u201d and most recently \u201cqualified\u201d once again'. Under the circumstances, we cannot agree with Thames that any statutory purpose requires his definition of the term \u201cqualified.\u201d Moreover, Thames can claim no prejudice in this case. His offer was not drawn first. Unlike McDonald and Walsh, he can claim no detrimental reliance on any particular agency interpretation of the term \u201cqualified\u201d; instead, he claims a right to take advantage of the confusion created by the BLM\u2019s interpretation. We have no intention of creating any such right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">. While leases are usually not open to attack after they have issued without protest, applicants with second and third priority retain their right to protest if the BLM fails to \u201cofficially notify\u201d them that their offers have been rejected. Apparently, the BLM often fails to send out official notifications. See, e. <em>g., Geosearch, Inc., </em>41 I.B.L.A. 291, 293 (1979); <em>Geosearch, Inc., </em>40 I.B.L.A. 397, 398 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">. The question whether <em>Pack </em>should apply to an offer filed between the dates of decision of <em>Pack I </em>and <em>Pack II </em>is not before us. Nor do we decide the question whether <em>Pack </em>should have been applied to the <em>Pack </em>case itself. On the former question, we note that our assessment of the reasonableness of an offeror\u2019s reliance on <em>Shaffer, Arata, </em>and BLM practice might be somewhat different if the offer were filed subsequent to <em>Pack I: </em>on the other hand, there may be merit in using the date of final decision as the date from which a new rule will be applied. <em>See Runnells v. Andrus, </em>484 F.Supp. at 1240. Resolution of this question might depend in part on examination of the legal status and \u201cfinality\u201d of <em>Pack I </em>while the case was under reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">The question of applying <em>Pack </em>to <em>Pack </em>itself has been answered by the court in <em>Runnells. </em>Without attempting to express any opinion on the propriety of the <em>Runnells </em>court\u2019s conclusion, we do note one additional consideration that might enter the analysis on the issue of retroactivity in a case like <em>Pack: </em>the fairness of denying the benefit of a new rule to the litigant who establishes the new rule. <em>See generally Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
