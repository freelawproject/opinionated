AMC and Avtek Inc. are both Rhode Island corporations; the former manufactured recreational vehicles in that state, while the latter was engaged primarily in the sale of snowmobiles in Vermont. In April of 1973, AMC terminated its operations and liquidated its assets. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>discussed below, certain proceeds from the sale of its inventory, in the amount of $269,-077.91, were eventually paid to the bank in partial satisfaction of an outstanding loan to Avtek Inc. AMC\u2019s creditors filed a petition in bankruptcy some eight months later, on December 21, 1973. Plaintiff, the trustee in bankruptcy of AMC, subsequently brought the present suit, claiming that the payment to the bank constituted a fraudulent conveyance under \u00a7 67(d)(2) of the former Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(2) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court upheld the transfer on two independent grounds and entered judgment for the defendant bank. Plaintiff, represented by new counsel, filed this timely appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Avtek, Inc., the parent of AMC, is in turn a subsidiary of Avtek Corporation (Avtek Corp.). This arrangement between Avtek Inc. and Avtek Corp. resulted from a merger in March of 1972. Prior to that time, Avtek Inc. was an independent company called Rodeo Incorporated (Rodeo). On June 8,1971, Rodeo entered into a revolving loan and security agreement with the bank. As collateral for the bank\u2019s financing, Rodeo granted a continuing security interest in, <em>inter alia, </em>its inventory, contract rights, accounts receivable, and \u201c[a]ll other rights of the Borrower to the payment of money, now existing or hereafter arising.\u201d This agreement authorized the bank to collect directly from a contract debtor of Rodeo. Subsequent to the merger between Avtek Corp. and Rodeo and the creation of Avtek Inc. as a subsidiary of Avtek Corp., the bank agreed to continue financing Rodeo (now Avtek Inc.) under the terms of the 1971 security agreement. As confirmed in a letter agreement dated April 5, 1972, Avtek Inc. in return agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>not to \u201cmake any loans or payments of any kind to Avtek Corp., or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates\u201d without the bank\u2019s prior permission. The revolving loan and security agreement with the bank constituted Avtek Inc.\u2019s sole source of financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">AMC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avtek Inc. on December 8,1972 when the latter purchased all of the stock of a company called Williamseraft of Rhode Island, Inc. and renamed it AMC. Throughout its short-lived period of operation, AMC acquired no independent source of financing and received all operating funds from Avtek Inc. Except for a payroll account funded by its parent, AMC maintained no bank accounts. Avtek, Inc. paid all of AMC\u2019s suppliers and creditors out of and deposited all funds received by AMC into its own bank account in Vermont.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reflection of the disbursements by Avtek Inc. to or for its subsidiary, the intercompany accounts in Avtek Inc.\u2019s balance sheets listed a debt of $479,650 as of January 27, 1973, and of $850,414 as of March 31, 1973. The statement of affairs of AMC, which accompanied the bankruptcy petition, listed Avtek Inc. as a creditor of AMC in the amount of $529,-670.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Both parties stipulated, and the district court found, that this \u201cdownstreaming\u201d of funds to its subsidiary violated Avtek Inc.\u2019s agreement with the bank. In response .to this violation, and in lieu of calling in the loan, the bank executed a second security agreement with both Avtek Inc. and AMC, under which it acquired a security interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>in the inventory and accounts receivable of each company. This agreement, manifested in a letter dated February 2, 1973, was signed by Rodney Hughes, the president of Avtek Inc., and by Charles Shuff, the vice-president of AMC. On March 6, 1973, the Avtek Inc. board of directors adopted a corporate borrowing resolution which authorized and ratified agreements to borrow signed singly by Mr. Hughes. The AMC board of directors adopted an identical resolution that same day with respect to Mr. Shuff. Each company then executed and delivered to the bank U.C.C. financing statements which were subsequently filed. AMC ceased operations and liquidated its assets shortly thereafter. The proceeds from the sale of its inventory ultimately were used \u2014 as described further below \u2014 to repay part of the bank\u2019s outstanding loan to Avtek Inc. The trustee contends that this transfer was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">II,.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Before the district court, both parties concentrated on the question of whether the 1973 security agreement created a security interest in, <em>inter alia, </em>the inventory of AMC. As articulated before us, plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the validity of the 1973 agreement is two-pronged. First, he contends that the agreement only benefited Avtek Inc., by enabling it to continue borrowing from the bank; AMC received no fair consideration for the granting of a security interest, and the agreement was thus a fraudulent conveyance under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(2)(a) (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, he argues that Shuff\u2019s execution of the security agreement was neither authorized by the corporate by-laws nor subsequently ratified. In plaintiff\u2019s view, the corporate borrowing resolution was adopted not to ratify Shuff\u2019s action, of which neither AMC\u2019s treasurer nor its general counsel was aware, but rather in connection with an anticipated direct line of credit between AMC and the bank. Moreover, he contends that the subsequent financing statement was executed for the same purpose; the security agreement thus was not only unauthorized but unperfected as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The district court rejected plaintiff\u2019s first argument, ruling that the downstreaming of funds to AMC provided adequate consideration for AMC\u2019s transfer of a security interest. AMC benefited not only from the bank\u2019s decision not to call the loan, an action that would have deprived Avtek Inc. and hence AMC of their sole source of financing, but also from the bank\u2019s sanctioning of future downstreaming. The court declined to address plaintiff\u2019s second argument, however. Instead, it relied on two other, alternative grounds for rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim. The court found as a factual matter that AMC transferred the proceeds from the inventory sale \u2014 not to the bank, as plaintiff had alleged \u2014 but rather to Avtek Inc., which deposited them in its Vermont bank account. Then, because the outstanding balance of the loan to Avtek Inc. totalled over $2,000,000 at the time, and in accordance with its customary procedure, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>Avtek Inc. in a separate transaction transferred the money to the bank to be applied against the loan. The court concluded that plaintiff \u201chas no cause for complaint under the Bankruptcy Act for these successive transfers.\u201d Since Avtek Inc. was both a creditor of AMC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>a debtor of the bank, each transfer of funds was in partial satisfaction of an antecedent debt. Fair consideration therefore existed in both instances under the terms of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(1)(e) (1970). <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>Alternatively, the court suggested that defendant should prevail even if the proceeds did travel directly from AMC. The 1971 agreement gave the bank a security interest in, and the right to enforce directly, all rights of Avtek Inc. \u201cto the payment of money, now existing or hereafter arising\u201d \u2014 a category which was found to include AMC\u2019s debt to its parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">On appeal, in addition to his several arguments regarding the validity of the 1973 security agreement, plaintiff advances various procedural and substantive objections to the district court\u2019s rulings. The procedural challenges revolve primarily around the court\u2019s finding of successive transfers. Because we believe this finding to be supported by the evidence and dispositive of plaintiff\u2019s objections to the transfer of AMC\u2019s assets, <em>see </em>Part IV <em>infra, </em>we treat plaintiff\u2019s procedural challenges at length before proceeding to his substantive claims. He first alleges that the court erred in admitting evidence on this issue, since the parties had agreed before trial to limit the contested issues to those surrounding the validity of the 1973 agreement. Reference is made in this regard to a pretrial memorandum, signed by both sides and filed with the court at a conference on November 17, 1976, in which the parties designated nine \u201ccontested issues of law and fact.\u201d Seven of those issues, it is true, involved the 1973 agreement, and an eighth simply raised a matter to which the parties had earlier stipulated. However, the final designated issue, which asked whether \u201cthere [was] any transfer of assets from AMC to [the bank] for less than a fair consideration,\u201d would seem to have expanded the contemplated scope of inquiry beyond that described by plaintiff. That such provisions in a pretrial memorandum should be interpreted broadly cannot be gainsaid; even pretrial orders, specifically issued by the district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, are \u201cto be liberally construed to cover any of the legal or factual theories that might be embraced by their language.\u201d <em>Rodrigues v. Ripley Indus., Inc., </em>507 F.2d 782, 787 (1st Cir. 1974), <em>citing </em>6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1527, at 609 &amp; n.47 (1971). In any event, because the memorandum here was never specifically adopted by the court, any purported preclusion of issues therein cannot be viewed as restricting the court\u2019s considerable discretion in this area. <em>See, e. g., </em>6 C. Wright and A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1527, at 608, 613-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Second, plaintiff contends that the finding of successive transfers runs contrary to a pretrial stipulation, filed on September 20,1977, in which the parties agreed \u201cthat the defendant received the proceeds of the sale of inventory ... at some time after March 17, 1973, and before July 1, 1973.\u201d Pretrial stipulations are of course binding upon the signatories. <em>E. g., Romero Reyes v. Marine Enterprises, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 866, 868 (1st Cir. 1974). However, we see no basis for upsetting the court\u2019s conclusion that this stipulation only specified when, and not from whom, the bank received such money. The pretrial memorandum contained a corresponding stipulation stating that the bank \u201cultimately received at least some of the proceeds from the AMC property\u201d; although similarly ambiguous, we think it can be read to buttress the court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s final procedural argument concerns a motion to reopen discovery which he proffered, following the presentation of his case, once the court\u2019s intended reliance on the successive transfer theory became evident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Characterizing this theo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ry as a \u201csurprise\u201d issue which neither party had anticipated, he contends that the court\u2019s denial of such motion was an abuse of discretion. We disagree. Noteworthy is the fact that plaintiff conducted no discovery at all in the present case. In his brief, he ascribes this failure in part to the parties\u2019 agreement in the pretrial memorandum to limit the issues in dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the contrary, the record indicates that the court ordered all discovery to be completed by October 15, 1975 \u2014 a date some thirteen months before the memorandum was filed. In any event, any purported \u201csurprise\u201d on plaintiff\u2019s part as to the advent of this theory would seem unwarranted. Not only was plaintiff long aware that AMC\u2019s receipts regularly were transferred to its parent\u2019s account in Vermont, but in his own complaint he alleged that the proceeds from the inventory sale \u201cwere transferred, either directly or indirectly,. to the Defendant.\u201d This is not a situation, therefore, involving important new evidence that plaintiff in the exercise of due diligence could not earlier have uncovered.' We also note that plaintiff failed to voice an immediate objection to defendant\u2019s reliance on the successive transfer theory in its trial brief, <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra, </em>undertook no informal investigation of this uncomplicated factual question during the several months in which his motion was pending, and made no reference at trial to the court\u2019s denial of the motion five days earlier. We see no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in refusing to permit additional discovery some four and one-half years after the complaint was filed. <em>See, e. g., Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., </em>482 F.2d 1079, 1085-86 (1st Cir. 1973); <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, Inc., </em>460 F.2d 1096, 1105 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The resolution of these procedural issues goes far toward disposing of the present appeal. As we indicated earlier, we find adequate support in the record for the district court\u2019s finding that AMC\u2019s assets moved to Avtek Inc. and then to the bank in two successive transfers. Of course, the district court\u2019s reliance on the successive transfer theory necessitates an examination, not only of the bank\u2019s involvement in this case, but also of the transaction between AMC and its parent Avtek Inc. With respect to the latter issue, if plaintiff were able to demonstrate error in the' court\u2019s finding that this initial transfer was valid, the bank would be entitled to retain the proceeds only if it fell within the proviso of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(6) (1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ever, plaintiff offered little evidence below from which a fraudulent design could be inferred and he has devoted scant attention to this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Two of the statutory provisions pertaining to fraudulent conveyances are at issue. The first, of which mention was made above, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>involves constructive fraud, rendering voidable any transfer made \u201cwithout fair consideration by a debtor who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, without regard to his actual intent . . . .\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(2)(a) (1970). In circumstances such as the present, \u201cfair consideration\u201d is said to exist \u201cwhen, in good faith, in exchange and as a fair equivalent therefor, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is satisfied . . .. \u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>107(d)(1)(e). On appeal, plaintiff fails even to allude to this provision in the context of the initial transfer from AMC to Avtek Inc. He does, however, contend that AMC received no \u201cfair equivalent\u201d in exchange for granting a security interest to the bank through the 1973 security agreement \u2014 an argument that can be transposed to apply to the present inquiry. As such, we find it wanting. The district court, as noted above, found that Avtek Inc. had \u201cdownstreamed\u201d substantial funds to AMC throughout the early months of 1973. As of March 31 of that year, Avtek Inc.\u2019s intercompany accounts listed a debt of $850,414, of which $529,670 remained outstanding at the time AMC filed its statement of affairs in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding. Given this evidence, we have no difficulty upholding the court\u2019s conclusion that AMC received a \u201cfair equivalent\u201d for the transfer of the proceeds to its parent, in the form of a corresponding reduction of this antecedent debt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The second provision involves actual as opposed to constructive fraud, rendering voidable any transfer made \u201cwith actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay, or defraud either existing or future creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 107(d)(2)(d). We have no quarrel with plaintiff\u2019s contention that, where the transferee is in a position to control the bankrupt\u2019s disposition of his property, as here, the intent of the transferee rather than that of the bankrupt is determinative for the purposes of section 107(d)(2)(d). <em>See, e. g., In re Cushman Bakery, </em>526 F.2d 23, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 937, 96 S.Ct. 1670, 48 L.Ed.2d 178 (1976); 4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 67.37(2), at 534 (14th ed. 1978). Neither do we dispute that transactions between a parent and subsidiary, when challenged in a bankruptcy proceeding, must be subjected to close scrutiny. <em>See, e. g., Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>306, 60 S.Ct. 238, 245, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, and recognizing that a trial court\u2019s findings on this issue deserve special deference because of the \u201cpeculiar importance in \u00a7 67(d)(2)(d) cases of the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d 4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>at 545 n.47, we are unable to conclude that the court was clearly erroneous in finding that Avtek Inc. received the proceeds without any intention of hindering, delaying, or defrauding AMC\u2019s creditors. No attempt was made to conceal the transfer in any way; indeed, the sale of inventory could hardly have been shrouded in secrecy. Perhaps more significant is the fact that AMC\u2019s receipts always had been transferred directly to Avtek Inc.\u2019s Vermont account. That the proceeds here were not handled in any special manner, but instead travelled the customary path pursuant to normal business practice, militates against any suggestion of fraudulent conduct. And the fact that, again in accordance with past practice, Avtek Inc. then transferred the proceeds to the bank cuts the same way; had Avtek Inc. been actuated by a fraudulent design, one might reasonably expect it to have secured a more tangible benefit from the transaction. Plaintiff is certainly correct in contending that fraud can be proved circumstantially. <em>E. g., </em>4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>at 537-38. However, he has pointed to no circumstances in the present case tending to reinforce whatever inference of fraud might derive from the presence of a parent-subsidiary relationship alone. Indeed, his principal argument in this regard is that he \u201cwas not given the opportunity\u201d to prove fraud on the part of Avtek Inc. \u2014 an argument that can only be termed fanciful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">For these reasons, we think the district court correctly ruled that the initial transfer from AMC to Avtek Inc. was immune from attack. Plaintiff\u2019s final contentions are that the bank acted with actual fraud itself and that it dominated and controlled Avtek Inc. The allegation of fraud on the part of the bank is not only unsupported on the record but now irrelevant; the propriety of the initial transfer to Avtek Inc. obviates the need to examine the frame of mind of any subsequent recipient of the proceeds. On the other hand, the bank\u2019s alleged control of Avtek, Inc., if accurate, would necessitate such an inquiry. But this contention is unsupported by the record. Again, plaintiff argues that the court, by denying his motion for further discovery, prevented him from offering proof on this issue. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>supra. </em>However, since his own complaint included this allegation of control, he is in no position even to feign surprise. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">. Plaintiff also claimed initially that the transfer was a preference in favor of a particular creditor violative of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96(a) (1970). The parties later stipulated, however, that the transfer occurred more than four months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, thereby rendering this provision inapplicable. Plaintiffs complaint alleged in addition that the bank had breached an agreement to pay to the unsecured creditors of AMC fifty percent of their claims out of proceeds received. This count was dropped at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. Avtek Inc.\u2019s security agreement with the defendant required that any outstanding loan be reduced as money was received. Consequently, Avtek Inc. maintained a \u201cdepository transfer\u201d account in Vermont, by which all deposits were wired down to the. defendant the following day to be applied against the loan. Although Avtek Inc. kept records of receipts from and disbursements to or for AMC, the accounts were not segregated; all deposits stemming from AMC\u2019s operations similarly were sent to the defendant to reduce Avtek Inc.\u2019s loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">. This provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Every transfer made and every obligation incurred by a debtor within one year prior to the filing of a petition initiating a proceeding under this title by or against him is fraudulent \u2014 (a) as to creditors existing at the time of such transfer or obligation, if made or incurred without fair consideration by a debt- or who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, without regard to his actual intent ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(2)(a) (1970). \u201cFair consideration\u201d for the purposes of this section is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">[C]onsideration given for the property or obligation of a debtor is \u201cfair\u201d (1) when, in good faith, in exchange and as a fair equivalent therefor, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is satisfied, or (2) when such property or obligation is received in good faith to secure a present advance or antecedent debt in an amount not disproportionately small as compared with the value of the property or obligation obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 107(d)(1)(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">. The somewhat unusual procedural path travelled by the present case deserves mention in this regard. Following several unsuccessful attempts to reach trial in 1977, the district judge transferred the case to a second judge, before whom trial commenced on April 11, 1979. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). In a memorandum dated April 12, 1979, the court ruled: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s evidence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>show that AMC made any transfer whatsoever to [the bank] .... Therefore the plaintiff has failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case .... \u201d It suggested that defendant renew its motion for summary judgment \u201cbased exclusively upon the [successive transfer] theory advanced on pages 19 and 20 of the trial brief\u201d filed by defendant in open court the previous day. The bank submitted such a motion and a supporting affidavit on April 24, and the trustee filed an objection on May 5 in which he recited his understanding of the pretrial stipulation discussed above. Accompanying plaintiff\u2019s objection was his motion to reopen discovery. In a memorandum dated June 26, 1979, the judge concluded that he had \u201cmisunderstood the posture\u201d of the case and therefore withdrew his earlier memorandum, vacated all proceedings before him, and returned the case to the first judge. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to reopen discovery on October 11, 1979, and the case went to trial five days later. Plaintiff presented no further evidence, relying on that adduced at the earlier hearing for his case in chief and declining the opportunity to present rebuttal evidence on the successive transfer issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">. In particular, he states: \u201cIncident to trial preparation, the parties stipulated in a pretrial memorandum to certain contested issues of law and fact. Discovery was limited to the issues raised thereby.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b62-10\">. This section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">A transfer made or an obligation incurred by a debtor adjudged a bankrupt under this title, which is fraudulent under this subdivision against creditors of such debtor having claims provable under this title, shall be null and void against the trustee, except as to a bona fide purchaser, lienor, or obligee for a present fair equivalent value: <em>Provided, however, . . . </em>That such purchaser, lienor, or obligee, who without actual fraudulent intent has given consideration less than fair, as defined in this subdivision, for such transfer, lien, or obligation, may retain the property, lien, or obligation as security for repayment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(d)(6) (1970). The bank would not profit from the exception for bona fide purchasers since it provided no <em>present </em>value to Avtek Inc. for the proceeds, having received them instead as partial payment for an antecedent debt. Accordingly, its only possible recourse would be the retention of the proceeds \u201cas security for repayment\u201d under the proviso. <em>See generally 4 Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 67.-41(5)-(6) (14th ed. 1978). It being unnecessary to our decision, we express no opinion as to whether the bank falls within this proviso, or as to whether any finding on this issue is possible on the present record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">. In arguing to the contrary, plaintiff relies principally on <em>In re Security Products Co., </em>310 F.Supp. 110 (E.D.Mo.1969). At issue there was a subsidiary\u2019s assignment of an account receivable to its parent, which had immediately reassigned the account to the petitioner bank to secure a note executed by the parent for money loaned to it by the bank. Notwithstanding that the parent had \u201cdownstreamed\u201d operating funds to the subsidiary, <em>see id. </em>at 123, the court ruled that the latter received no consideration for the assignment and it therefore voided the transfer as a fraudulent conveyance. <em>Security Products </em>admittedly can be read as running contrary to the result reached in the instant case. However, a different reading appears the more supportable. For reasons not discussed in the opinion, the petitioner there never sought to uphold the assignment by reference to the parent\u2019s downstreaming; the \u201csole controverted issue\u201d was whether the subsidiary\u2019s corporate identity should be disregarded, such that consideration paid to the parent would constitute consideration to the subsidiary. <em>Id. at </em>111. Accordingly, we see no conflict between the court\u2019s reasoning there and the result reached here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\">. <em>See generally </em>Riemer, <em>Claims Against Bankrupt Corporations Based on Advances by Controlling Stockholders or Parent Corporations, </em>73 Com.L.J. 273 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. In his motion to reopen discovery, which was properly denied for the reasons discussed above, plaintiff made no mention of any desire to investigate the conduct or motivations of Avtek Inc. Instead, he requested further discovery only to determine specifically (1) whether the purchasers of AMC\u2019s inventory issued checks to AMC, Avtek Inc., or the bank, and (2) whether the bank \u201cwas controlling the affairs of Avtek Inc.\u201d at the time of the sale. We also reiterate that plaintiff declined the opportunity to present additional evidence at the second trial. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
