After being refused recognition by UNH, they brought a civil rights action in the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that the refusal by UNH \u2014 a state university \u2014 to recognize their organization violated their first amendment rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a brief hearing, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction. They have appealed this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">We believe that the district court applied incorrect standards in reaching its decision. Our review of the record, however, convinces us that further proceedings are necessary to determine whether or not an injunction is warranted. We therefore remand the case with instructions that such proceedings take place expeditiously, and that the district court then decide whether or not an injunction is warranted in accordance with the standards laid down in <em>Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">The record suggests that CARP, from a formal point of view, is several different organizations with different geographic responsibilities. CARP was initially founded in Japan by student members of the Unification Church. Subsequently, a CARP-U. S. organization was founded with national responsibilities. State CARP organizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>exist, as do local CARP organizations on college campuses. These organizations all bear some relation to the Unification Church, the exact nature of which is disputed in the record. Appellees allege that CARP is the college-based recruiting arm of the Church; appellants claim that CARP is more independent, though they admit an overlap of some members. Similarly, the relationship of the various CARP organizations to each other is in dispute, with appellees claiming that there is really but one well-disciplined CARP entity and appellants asserting significant unit independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Be that as it may, the record suggests that CARP enjoyed some form of recognition at UNH during 1975-1976. During 1977 and 1978, it apparently proselytized without formal recognition. And, in September 1980, appellants formally applied to the UNH Student Organizations Committee (\u201cSOC\u201d) for official recognition as a student organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellants submitted their application on a UNH form. They stated that CARP\u2019s purpose was to \u201crevitalize the founding spirit of Judeo-Christianity and to offer [a] critique and counter proposal to atheistic Marxist-Leninism\u201d. They listed CARP\u2019s officers as \u201cPres. Michael D. Tillman\u201d and \u201cVice Pres. Cathy L. Aman,\u201d and they listed Patrice B. Gans in the \u201cofficer\u201d space without designating a specific office. They said that membership was open to \u201ceveryone\u201d. The form itself required that appellants certify that they would adhere to \u201cthe student rules applying to student organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The application was reviewed by SOC in accordance with UNH rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SOC provided CARP with \u201ctentative recognition\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and appellants met with members of SOC. SOC then took two actions not taken in the ordinary \u201cstudent organization\u201d case: they convened a six-member committee to investigate CARP groups on other college campuses and to research the history of CARP at UNH, and they distributed a questionnaire eliciting UNH student attitudes about CARP. On October 30, 1980, SOC denied CARP official recognition on the ground that the applicants did not have two full-time degree candidates as officers. Whether or not Cathy L. Aman was a fulltime student evidently depended upon whether she would obtain four hours credit for a mathematics course. While Patrice B. Gans was a fulltime student, later evidence at the court hearing suggests that she may not have been a CARP member.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Appellants next told Renee Romano, the Acting Assistant Director of Student Activities, that Aman had received the necessary credits and was a fulltime student. On her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>advice, they reapplied for recognition. Their application, submitted on November 4, 1980, listed Aman and Tillman as CARP officers, stated that \u201canyone following Univ. of N. H.- guideline rules\u201d could become a member, and described CARP as \u201ca student organization dedicated to educating people in ideologies, religious values, and international patriotism\u201d. UNH Vice President for Student Affairs J. Gregg Sanborn testified at the court hearing that the application satisfied formal UNH requirements for recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On November 25, 1980, Vice President Sanborn, the SOC and appellants held what UNH characterizes as a \u201chearing\u201d and appellants as a \u201cmeeting\u201d. Appellant Aman testified that she and Tillman were asked why they thought the application met the necessary recognition requirements. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">I said that I felt the reason why we fulfilled the requirements was that 75 percent of our members were full-time students; and we stated our goal was to encourage Judeo-Christianity and to teach a critique and counter proposal to Marxist-Leninism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Vice President Sanborn then circulated a previously prepared statement which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">Position Statement \u2014 Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles (CARP).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">J. Gregg Sanborn, Vice President for Stu- \u2022 dent Affairs, after consultation with the University of New Hampshire Student Organizations Committee, has made the decision to deny formal University of New Hampshire recognition to the Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">This decision was reached after considerable deliberation and review of the alleged and actual past and present practices of the organization, both on and off the University of New Hampshire campus. Specifically, it is felt the University of New Hampshire should not formally recognize an organization which has a demonstrated history on campus of working against the University\u2019s educational mission. It is the opinion of the University that CARP is primarily a recruitment branch for the Unification Church and past experience has shown students left the University with the encouragement of CARP. It appears the experience of many students after leaving colleges and universities has been negative and possibly harmful. In addition, the Unification Church has openly admitted deceptive practices have been used by the organization. Allegations that CARP has continued its previous practice and philosophy are evident since the organization continues to be accused of exerting total influence over their members\u2019 lives; community service seems essentially non-existant [sic]; the pre-requisite isolation from family and friends is reported to continue; and constant solicitation for money still seems to be a primary project. Individuals have the right to express political and religious viewpoints in public places on campus but the University does not feel obligated to lend its name and resources to a collection of two full-time students wishing to be formally recognized as CARP, a group which has had a questionable past history and, on the University campus, has clearly demonstrated its practices are contrary to the best interests of the University. Present full-time student members of CARP have not been able to demonstrate that CARP\u2019s philosophy and practices are different from previous years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">At the end of the meeting, the members of SOC voted to leave the recognition decision up to Sanborn. He decided against recognition for the reasons mentioned in his prepared statement. Appellants\u2019 tentative organizational status was revoked. Aman and Tillman then appealed to the University president, who supported Sanborn\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>On December 12, appellants filed a complaint with the district court. At a hearing, held on December 23, the facts just described were elicited. There was also testimony that \u201crecognition\u201d by the University carries with it the right to use the University\u2019s name, eligibility to apply for certain student funds, and increased access to University facilities for group functions and to plan, schedule, and participate in official student activities. Appellants pointed out that UNH recognized numerous student religious organizations, some affiliated with major church groups, others not; some engaged in active proselytizing, others not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">UNH presented testimony primarily by Vice President Sanborn that CARP was harmful to the University, engaged in deceptive practices, and did not meet the requirement that three-quarters of its members be fulltime UNH students. Appellants denied each of these claims. The district court agreed with UNH that appellants had engaged in deceptive practices; it found that CARP would interfere with appropriate discipline; and it accepted the claim that three-quarters of its members were not fulltime students. The court refused to issue a preliminary injunction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The facts enunciated so far are sufficient to call into play the principles of <em>Healy v. James, supra </em>\u2014 a case in which the Supreme Court considered the refusal of a state university to recognize a local chapter of the Students for Democratic Society (\u201cSDS\u201d). First amendment rights \u2014 whether of speech or religion <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 are plainly at stake. For one thing, Vice President Sanborn\u2019s letter and his testimony suggest that the organization\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d or views played some role in his decision not to grant CARP recognition. For another, as in <em>Healy, </em>nonrecognition is not simply denial of the \u201ccollege\u2019s stamp of approval\u201d, <em>id. </em>408 U.S. at 182, 92 S.Ct. at 2347, but seems also likely to mean \u201cdenial of use of campus facilities for meetings and other appropriate purposes\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 181, 92 S.Ct. at 2346. Finally, UNH has recognized many other organizations of various religious and political views. Thus, as <em>Healy </em>specifically holds, since appellants \u201cfiled an application in conformity with the requirements, the burden was upon the College administration to justify its decision of rejection\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 184, 92 S.Ct. at 2347, and this burden is a \u201cheavy\u201d one, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\"><em>Healy </em>goes on to specify that the college could not refuse recognition \u201csimply because it finds the views expressed by any group to be abhorrent\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 187-88, 92 S.Ct. at 2349. It suggests that refusal would be proper in three circumstances: First, the state university might prove that the group has a \u201cknowing affiliation with an organization possessing unlawful aims and goals, and a specific intent to further those illegal aims\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 92 S.Ct. at 2348. Second, it might prove that the particular group would be a \u201cdisruptive influence\u201d in the sense that it poses a \u201csubstantial threat of material disruption\u201d. The threat must be one of \u201cconduct\u201d, not \u201cspeech\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 92 S.Ct. at 2349-50. Third, the college might show that the group is unwilling \u201cto be bound by reasonable school rules governing conduct\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 92 S.Ct. at 2351. So far, UNH has not met the burden laid down by <em>Healy, </em>for it has failed to show that it has reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of any circumstance that would allow nonrecognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">First, UNH claimed at the hearing that CARP violated its rule that \u201ca minimum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>three-quarters of the active membership must be full-time students\u201d, which we assume <em>arguendo </em>would qualify as a \u201creasonable school rule\u201d under the third prong of <em>Healy. </em>Its evidence primarily consisted of the fact that Aman and Tillman lived with six other CARP members who were not students at UNH. Yet, Aman and Tillman claim that they wish to form a <em>UNH </em>CARP chapter; their living companions belong to <em>other </em>CARP organizations; and appellants assert that those persons will not be members of CARP-UNH. UNH evidently allows local Catholic, Jewish, Democratic, and Republican organizations, despite the fact that their members might live with any number of Catholics, Jews, Democrats, or Republicans who do not attend UNH. Perhaps the relationship of CARP-UNH to CARP or to the Unification Church is somehow \u201cdifferent\u201d. But, the record <em>so far </em>does not demonstrate that difference; it provides little more than Vice President Sanborn\u2019s opinions and counsel\u2019s mostly unsuccessful efforts to elicit testimony from appellants on cross-examination about a \u201cspecial\u201d relationship among CARP members, chapters and the Unification Church. Above all, UNH raised this claim for the first time during the court hearing; it did not give appellants notice or a fair opportunity to respond to the claim at the campus meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Second, UNH claims that CARP-UNH would be controlled by national CARP or the Unification Church, which we assume <em>arguendo </em>would suffice as a ground for nonrecognition under either the first or the third prong of <em>Healy. </em>UNH rules state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">Only the local members of a student organization may determine its membership, policies, and action, although they may receive guidance from their outside affiliate organizations. Affiliation with an off-campus organization shall not in itself disqualify a student organization from institutional recognition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">UNH Rights &amp; Rules 114. Again, it may be possible to prove that the degree of control exerted over the UNH chapter by outside, or parent, organizations significantly exceeds that contemplated by the rule and allowed in the case of other organizations. But, so far, the record does not come close to demonstrating such control. For the most part, UNH seemed content to show that CARP-UNH would be closely affiliated with the Unification Church, and appellants spent considerable time denying, or minimizing the extent of, any such association. But, to show the existence of such an association is insufficient unless UNH goes further and demonstrates specifically why and how that association would result in a degree of control over the UNH chapter which either violates reasonable rules or standards related to conduct or demonstrates a \u201cspecific intent to further . . . illegal aims.\u201d <em>Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. at 186, 92 S.Ct. at 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Third, UNH has suggested that CARP will violate various rules related to conduct. These may include the rule which forbids a \u201cdisturbance which interferes with the normal operation of the University\u201d; the rule which states that \u201cno student organization is to encourage or require unlawful acts or violation of University rules by its members\u201d; or the rule which requires organizations \u201cto take every reasonable precaution to insure that its activities and participants in its activities conform to the law and to University standards of conduct\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Vice President Sanborn\u2019s statement speaks of past CARP \u201crecruitment\u201d activities, \u201csolicitation for money\u201d, efforts to exert \u201ctotal influence over their members\u2019 lives\u201d and \u201cisolation from family and friends\u201d \u2014 all of which may involve violations of rules or generally acceptable University standards of proper behavior. Perhaps past experience with CARP provides reason to believe that this organization, if recognized, will engage in such <em>conduct </em>inimical to reasonable University standards and directly harmful to members of the University community. Yet, Aman and Tillman have pledged numerous times to live up to all University standards and to obey all University rules. And the University remains free to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>draw or suspend recognition if they fail to do so. <em>See Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. at 194 n.24, 92 S.Ct. at 2353 n.24. Thus, to withhold recognition on this ground, the University must do more than simply make conclusory statements; it must provide evidence \u2014 perhaps drawn from past experience or experience elsewhere \u2014 for believing that CARP-UNH will engage in such activity despite its protestations to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Finally, UNH claims, and the district court found, that Aman and Tillman engaged in \u201cdeceptive practices\u201d. If so, the record does not reveal them. UNH counsel seems to have tried to prove through Aman\u2019s and Tillman\u2019s testimony that CARP was closely linked to Reverend Moon; Aman and Tillman may have sought to minimize the connection, but they did not deny it. They may have understated, or overstated, their points from time to time, or have given confused answers, but given the intensity of a hostile cross-examination, their responses do not constitute \u201cdeception\u201d to the point where it might provide grounds for nonrecognition. The district court also found that they were deceptive in their initial application in using the name of Patrice Gans, who Tillman knew \u201cwas not a University of New Hampshire student when the first application was filed\u201d. In fact, Patrice Gans was a UNH student; she may not, in fact, have wished to become a CARP member; she may have only been trying to help Tillman form the organization. But, according to Tillman, such an \u201caccommodation\u201d was not uncommon at UNH; and a new application was filed, in any event, without Gans\u2019 name. In the absence of any indication that the use of Gans\u2019 name either reflected an intent to deceive or had any material impact on appellants\u2019 application, it alone cannot suffice to justify denial of recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In sum, the record does not clearly indicate that UNH\u2019s asserted grounds for denial sufficiently separate CARP\u2019s protected \u201cspeech\u201d activity from unprotected \u201cconduct\u201d. It does not make clear precisely what past or likely future \u201cconduct\u201d UNH objects to. And, it does not demonstrate that UNH has given CARP a significant opportunity at the campus level to know, and to respond to, the allegations made against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We are ordinarily reluctant to disturb a district court decision not to issue a preliminary injunction. <em>E. g., National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. v. Burke, </em>608 F.2d 819, 823 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Walker v. Providence Journal Co., </em>493 F.2d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>390 F.2d 113,115 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 1807, 20 L.Ed.2d 653 (1968). Yet, where restraints on speech or religion are at issue, appropriately speedy action designed to protect the exercise of constitutional rights is required, <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2689, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <em>see also Keefe </em>v. <em>Geanakos, </em>418 F.2d 359 (1st Cir, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">While we decide that the judgment denying the preliminary injunction should be vacated, we do not think the record is so clear and complete as to warrant immediate issuance of a preliminary injunction. Indeed, the record provides some reason to believe that UNH may be able to obtain evidence sufficient to support its claims. Moreover, there would seem to be little need for decision during the vacation months immediately ahead, but rather a greater need for more factual development in the light of pertinent standards. We therefore remand this case to the district court with instructions to proceed expeditiously to an evidentiary hearing, after which the district court shall determine, in accordance with <em>Healy\u2019s </em>standards, whether an injunction shall issue. We leave to the district court the optimal course of such future proceedings \u2014 whether to take further evidence on a preliminary injunction, proceed to consider a permanent injunction, or hold its own hearings in abeyance to allow for further informal hearings on campus at which both UNH and appellants would have a fair opportunity to offer evidence <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to make arguments. (If on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>basis of evidence produced at an on-campus hearing, UNH concludes that nonrecognition is appropriate, the district court would determine whether that decision was reasonable in light of <em>Healy\u2019s </em>standards.) In any event, mindful of the important first amendment interests at stake and the fleeting nature of academic enrollments, we think it imperative that appropriate action be taken as promptly as possible toward a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-18\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-19\">. The complaint alleges that denial of official recognition has resulted in an \u201cimpairment of freedom of expression, religion, assembly and association\u201d.
