The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Presbyterian/St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center is a three hospital system located in Denver, Colorado. The Center grew out of a July, 1979, merger between St. Luke\u2019s Hospital Association and the Presbyterian Medical Center. Prior to the merger, St. Luke\u2019s Hospital Association operated a single facility \u2014 St. Luke\u2019s hospital. The Presbyterian Medical Center operated two institutions\u2014 one hospital located ten blocks from the St. Luke\u2019s facility, and a second acute-care institution twelve miles away in Aurora, Colorado. <em>See The Presbyterian Medical Center, </em>218 N.L.R.B. No. 192 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">In October, 1979, the Union filed with the Board a petition for certification as the bargaining representative of the registered nurses employed at the St. Luke\u2019s facility of the Medical Center. The Medical Center contested the petition challenging the appropriateness of the bargaining unit. The unit is limited to registered nurses at the St. Luke facility only, rather than all professionals, other than physicians, at all three hospitals. The Medical Center\u2019s position was tied to Congress\u2019 directive that the Board avoid unnecessary proliferation of bargaining units in non-profit health care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">Following five days of hearings, the Board\u2019s regional director found that a separate unit of registered nurses at the St. Luke\u2019s facility was appropriate for collective bargaining purposes. The Medical Center\u2019s request for Board review was denied in January, 1980. Thereafter, a majority of the employees in the unit selected the Union as their representative. On January 24, 1980, the Board certified the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all registered nurses at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">When the Medical Center subsequently refused to bargain with the Union, unfair labor practice charges were filed. Violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (5), were alleged. In answer to the charges, the Medical Center admitted the refusal to bargain, defending instead on the inappropriateness of the unit. The Board overruled the Medical Center objections and ordered the Medical Center to bargain with the Union on request, as well as to post notices to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Board erred in holding that the Medical Center committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain with the St. Luke\u2019s Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals AFT, CFT, AFL-CIO.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\n<em>The Appropriateness of the Bargaining Unit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">For nearly thirty years, non-profit health care institutions were excluded from the operation of the National Labor Relations Act, <em>supra. </em>In 1974, Congress amended the Act extending coverage to large numbers of employees in the industry. <em>See generally, </em>Vernon, <em>Labor Relations in the Health Care Field under the 1974 Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act, </em>70 NW.U.L. Rev. 202 (1975). The elimination of this exemption \u201creflected Congress\u2019 judgment that hospital care would be improved by extending the protection of the Act to nonprofit health care employees.\u201d <em>Beth Israel Hospital </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B., </em>437 U.S. 483, 497, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 2471, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">One area of concern encompassed by the legislation dealt with disputes over bargaining units. Unable to agree on specific legislation, the House and Senate committees considering the amendment chose to address the problem in their respective reports. Each committee wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">Due consideration should be given by the Board to preventing proliferation of bargaining units in the health care industry. In this connection, the Committee notes with approval the recent Board decisions in <em>Four Seasons Nursing Center, </em>208 NLRB No. 50, 85 LRRM 1093 (1974), and <em>Woodland Park Hospital, </em>205 NLRB No. 144, 84 LRRM 1075 (1973), as well as the trend toward broader units enunciated in <em>Extendicare of West Virginia, </em>203 NLRB No. 170, 83 LRRM 1242 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">S.Conf.Rep.No. 988, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 3946, 3950; S.Rept.No.766, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1974); H.Rept.No. 1051, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">Much has been written concerning the committees\u2019 statements in this area. <em>Mary Thompson Hospital, Inc. v.

With most of it we agree. In one statement, we heartily concur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">Congress directed the Board to apply a standard in this field that was not traditional. Proliferation of units in industrial settings has not been the subject of congressional attention but fragmentation in the health care field has aroused legislative apprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-18\"><em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital v. N. L. R. B., supra, </em>at p. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">\n<em>Unit Scope</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">The appropriateness of a bargaining unit depends on both its scope and composition. We here deal with the first consideration\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>whether the bargaining unit should comprise employees solely at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital or at all employer facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Board has declined to accede to Congress\u2019 directive in determining issues of unit scope. In <em>Memorial Medical, </em>230 N.L. R. B. No. 140 n.5 (1977), the Board held that the legislative history of the 1974 amendments demonstrates that concern with bargaining unit proliferation was solely with the composition of units within particular facilities, not with the question of whether the unit\u2019s scope should include one facility or several facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Rather than apply Congress\u2019 directive, the Board has presumed single facility units appropriate \u201cwhere there is no bargaining history in a more comprehensive unit and the degree of functional integration with other facilities is insufficient to negate the separate identity of the facility in which a union seeks representative status.\u201d <em>Samaritan Health Services, Inc., </em>238 N.L.R.B. No. 56 (1978). The presumption is, of course, rebuttable. <em>Id. </em>Among the factors considered are the geographic proximity of the facilities, history of collective bargaining unionization, extent of employee interchange, functional integration of operations, and centralization of management, particularly in regard to control of personnel and labor relations. <em>See e. g., N. L. R. B. v. Groendyke Transport, Inc., </em>417 F.2d 33 (10th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 944, 25 L.Ed.2d 116 (1970); <em>Magic Pan, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>627 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>N. L. R. B. v. Chicago Health and Tennis Clubs, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 331 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S. Ct. 3089, 57 L.Ed.2d 1133 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Consistent with the Board\u2019s views, the regional director applied the presumption here holding that \u201cwhile a systemwide unit may be appropriate, the evidence does not rebut the presumption.\u201d R., Vol. I, p. 4. The Medical Center argues that the application of this presumption is inconsistent with the congressional admonition against undue proliferation of bargaining units in the health care field.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The issue as to what unit is appropriate for bargaining rests in the sound discretion of the Board. <em>Packard Motor Car Co. v. N. L. R. B., </em>330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1947); <em>Newspaper Printing Corp. v. N. L. R. B., </em>625 F.2d 956 (10th Cir. 1980). Nevertheless, we must insure that the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion is not unreasonable, arbitrary, unsupported by the evidence, or in conflict with congressional intent. <em>S. E. C. v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); <em>N. L. R. B. v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Our reading of the legislative history underlying the 1974 amendments confirms the Board\u2019s views that the references \u201ccautioning against undue proliferation in the health care field refer to matters involving unit composition, that is, the types of employees to be represented in a bargaining unit . . . with which any single institution must collectively bargain.\u201d <em>Memorial Medical, supra, </em>at n. 5. We do not agree, however, that this concern necessarily demonstrates congressional insensitivity to proliferation problems caused by mechanical application of the presumption to issues of unit scope. Nor do we believe Congress\u2019 silence in this area blindly constituted ratification of the single facility presumption in health care facilities. In our view, it appears more likely that Congress did not anticipate the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The Board is given broad authority to determine the unit appropriate for collective bargaining under section 9(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(b). Neither the Act nor the legislative history offer conclusive answers to the issue at bar. \u201cBut the absence of specific legislative history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. 303, 310, 96 S.Ct. 523, 528, 46 L.Ed.2d 514 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">It has long been a \u201cfamiliar rule, that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>cause not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers.\u201d <em>Steelworkers v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 201, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2726, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979), <em>quoting Holy Trinity Church v. United States, </em>143 U.S. 457, 459, 12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892). In the construction of labor legislation the principle has \u201cparticular application\u201d. <em>Woodwork Manufacturers v. N. L. R B., </em>386 U.S. 612, 619, 87 S.Ct. 1250,1255, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). This is so because legislation such as that involved here is \u201cto a marked degree, the result of conflict and compromise between strong contending forces and deeply held views on the role of organized labor\u201d. <em>Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. N. L. R B., </em>357 U.S. 93, 99-100, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 1016, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1958); <em>Woodwork Manufacturers v. N. L. R B., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The legislative history here reveals a strong current of congressional concern for the problems engendered by unwarranted unit fragmentation whether it be in composition or scope. As we view it, the Board\u2019s refusal to consider Congress\u2019 directive with regard to scope issues has subjected the health care industry to the very dangers Congress sought to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We hold that the traditional factors used in scope determinations \u201cmust be put in balance against the public interest in preventing fragmentation in the health care field.\u201d <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital v. N. L. R. B., supra, </em>at p. 592. Moreover, the Board must specify \u201cthe manner in which its unit determination^] . . . implement[] or reflect[] that admonition.\u201d <em>N. L. R. B. v. </em>West <em>Suburban Hospital, supra, </em>at p. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We recognize that labor legislation should normally be construed in a liberal manner to effectuate its remedial purposes. However, in our anxiety to aid the congressional purpose of promoting industrial stabilization through collective bargaining, we must guard against extending the scope of the statute beyond Congress\u2019 intent. <em>62 Cases of Jam v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 593, 600, 71 S.Ct. 515, 520, 95 L.Ed. 566 (1951). The Board has failed to recognize Congress\u2019 directive in unit scope determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\n<em>Unit Composition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">We now turn to the question of whether the Board erred in its determination of the unit\u2019s composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In the representation proceeding, the regional director ruled that (a) a unit restricted to registered nurses is presumptively appropriate, and (b) based on the Board\u2019s singularity of interests analysis, the presumption in favor of the registered nurses unit was not <em>overcome </em>by the Medical Center. Inasmuch as the Board erred in accepting the presumption of appropriateness, we must deny enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The use of rebuttable presumptions is tied to various rationale \u2014 judicial economy, regularity and fairness; probability; and public policy. Louisell and Mueller, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 68, pp. 541-542. Yet, the procedural effects may differ. Most affect only the burden of producing evidence. <em>See e. g., </em>Fed.Rules Evid. rule 301, 28 U.S.C.A. Others affect both the burdens of producing evidence <em>and </em>of persuasion. <em>See e. g. Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colo., </em>413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). In those presumptions falling within the first category, \u201cthe presumption <em>disappears </em>upon introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact. [Emphasis supplied], Louisell and Mueller, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 69, pp. 554-555. <em>See </em>Fed.Rules Evid. rule 301, 28 U.S.C.A.; Comm, of Conf.Rep.No.931597, 93d Cong. 2d Sess., <em>reprinted </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 7098, 7099. Rebuttable presumptions falling within the second category \u201cretain their vitality until the trier of fact is persuaded as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact.\u201d Louisell and Mueller, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 69, p. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Our review of the record convinces us that the rebuttable presumption applied in this case shifted <em>both </em>the burdens of producing evidence <em>and </em>persuasion. The regional director specifically held that the presumption was not overcome by the Medical Center\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In our view, there was sufficient evidence adduced to sustain the appropriateness of an all professional unit, excluding physicians. We, of course, focus on the \u201cdisparity of interests between employee groups which would prohibit or impede fair representation of employee interests.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. St. Francis Hospital of Lynwood, supra, </em>at p. 419. A multidisciplinary team approach to patient care is employed by the Hospital. Interaction between registered nurses and other professionals is encouraged. Decentralization of the pharmacy has occurred with the physical relocation of individual pharmacists to nursing stations at patient care units. Social workers at the facility spend one-half their time in the patient care units. This, of course, results in substantial interaction between these professionals and the staff nurses.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Several nurses at the facility observed that they have little contact with nurses from units other than their own. One postoperative nurse observed that she had more contact with physical therapists than nurses outside her specialty. Other specialty nurses supported this view. Christine Tanner, a noted nurse educator, testified that nurses who specialize often have more in common with persons in disciplines related to their specialties than other registered nurses practicing in other specialty areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Certain of the registered nurses work 3:00 p. m.-ll:30 p. m. or 11:00 p. m.-7:30 a. m. This factor alone, however, is not dis-positive. <em>Id. </em>at p. 419. Similarly, the licensing-education requirements, and departmental segregation are not wholly controlling. <em>Id. </em>at p. 419. \u201cThe fact that a state may choose to regulate a particular occupation should not be controlling in the determination of an appropriate bargaining unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In sum, the. evidence presented was sufficient to sustain a finding of the inappropriateness of the proposed unit had it been accepted. If the presumption had simply shifted the burden of producing evidence to the employer, the offer of this contradictory evidence would have neutralized the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In unfair labor practice hearings, such as that presented here, the Board, to the extent practicable, must apply the rules of evidence governing proceedings in the district courts of the United States. N.L. R.A. \u00a7 10(b); 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b); <em>N.L. R.B. v. Process &amp; Pollution Control Co., </em>588 F.2d 786 (10th Cir. 1978). When the Federal Rules of Evidence were adopted, Congress provided that \u201ca presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party against whom it was originally cast.\u201d Fed.Rules Evid. rule 301, 28 U.S. C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Application of the presumption employed here violated the mandate of Federal Rule of Evidence 301.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a presumption cannot be used to alter General Counsel\u2019s burden to establish by a preponderance of evidence that an unfair labor practice has occurred. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Dillon Stores, </em>643 F.2d 687 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>N.L.R.B. v. First Nat. Bank of Pueblo, </em>623 F.2d 686 (10th Cir. 1980); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Silver Spur Casino, </em>623 F.2d 571 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 1973, 68 L.Ed.2d 294 (1981). The Board\u2019s order was impermissibly tainted by the presumption\u2019s application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We do not rest our decision on this ground alone. In our view, any use of a presumption which casts upon the Medical Center the burden of producing evidence of the inappropriateness of the unit violates Congress\u2019 directive of nonproliferation in the health care industry. The legislative history underlying the 1974 amendments expresses concern that egregious unit proliferation such as found in the construction trades, could impede effective health care delivery. We agree with our sister circuits that \u201cthe Board <em>must </em>expressly consider the congressional admonition in making unit determinations,\u201d <em>Mary Thompson Hospital, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., supra, </em>at p. 864, and focus on the \u201cdisparity of interests between employee groups which would prohibit or inhibit fair representation of employee interests.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. St. Francis Hospital of Lynwood, supra, </em>at p. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We hold that requiring health care industry employers to bear the burden of producing evidence that limited bargaining units are more inappropriate than broader bargaining units runs contrary to Congress\u2019 admonition. Rather, the Board must specify \u201cthe manner in which its unit determination in this case implements] or refleet[s] that admonition.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. West Suburban Hospital, supra, </em>at p. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u201cThe power of an administrative . . . board to administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is .. . [only] the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute. [An administrative decision] which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity.\u201d <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 873 n. 12, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2156, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977), <em>quoting Manhattan General Equip. Co. v.

The bargaining unit certified consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">INCLUDED: All full-time and regular part-time registered nurses, including in-service education nurses, cardiovascular specialists, diabetic stroke technicians, hyper-elementation nurse clinician, float pool nurses, certified anesthetists, and all other registered nursing employees at the St. Luke\u2019s facility of the employer located at 601 E. 19th Avenue in Denver, Colorado</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al1\">EXCLUDED: Unit supervisors, assistant unit supervisors, department directors, assistant department directors, patient representatives and other supervisory and managerial employees, and guards as defined in the Act and all other employees of the above facility.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\">. It is settled that \u201can employer may secure judicial review of a unit determination by simply refusing to bargain with a union after its certification.\u201d <em>Osteopathic Hospital Founders Asso. v.

To the extent that <em>N.L.R.B. v.

The decision and order of the Board was entered on stipulation of the parties. This does not, however, change our views. That stipulation, specifically approved by the Board, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">It is agreed that this case shall be in the same posture before the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit as it would have been if the standard procedures had been followed, i. e., after a Complaint had issued, the Employer would have filed an answer defending the allegations on the grounds that the bargaining unit is inappropriate, the Union would have moved for summary judgment, the Employer would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>responded to the motion again asserting the bargaining unit defense, the National Labor Relations Board would have granted the motion for summary judgment, and the Employer would have then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\">. For these same reasons, the Board erred in applying its single facility presumption to the issue of unit scope. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\">. In our case remand is especially justified. Following the decision in this case, the Board reconsidered its prior opinions in the health care industry as regards registered nurse units. <em>See Newton-Wellesley Hospital, </em>250 NLRB No. 86 (1980). <em>See also: National Medical Convalescent of San Diego, </em>254 NLRB No. 163 (1981); <em>Doctor\u2019s Hospital of Montclair, </em>254 NLRB No. 175 (1981); <em>Federick Memorial Hospital, Inc., </em>254 NLRB No. 2 (1981); <em>Addison Gilbert Hospital, </em>253 NLRB No. 141 (1981); <em>Mount Airy Foundation, </em>253 NLRB No. 139 (1981); and <em>Brookwood Hospital Management Corp., </em>252 NLRB No. 107 (1980). An appellate court reviewing an agency decision following an intervening change of policy should remand to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>mit the agency to decide in the first instance whether it should reframe its order to better effectuate the policies underlying the Act it is charged with administering. <em>NLRB v. Food Store Employees, supra, </em>at p. 10, 94 S.Ct. at p. 2080. In this connection we note our disagreement with the Board\u2019s view that the \u201ccommunity of interests\u201d test and the \u201cdisparity of interests\u201d test are essentially identical. It is not the similarity of employees\u2019 training, hours, conditions and activities which determine the appropriateness of the unit. It is, rather, the dissimilarity of interests relevant to the collective bargaining process that determines which employees are not to be included in a proposed unit. The proper approach is to begin with a broad proposed unit and then exclude employees with disparate interests. One should not start with a narrow unit, such as registered nurses, and then add professionals with similar interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
