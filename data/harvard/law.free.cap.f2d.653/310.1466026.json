Liang, </em>493 F.Supp. 104 (N.D. Ill.1980). Plaintiff-appellant Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc. asserts that no evidence supports the award and that the award was obtained by fraud. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Defendant-appellee Paul Liang was a registered securities broker with plaintiff-appellant Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc. (\u201cShearson\u201d) until May 3, 1978. When he was hired in January 1976, Liang filled out a questionnaire stating that he was employed also as a part-time movie projectionist at the Festival Theatre. The New York Stock Exchange approved this outside employment pursuant to its Rule 346.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not indicated on the form was that the Festival Theatre showed only X-rated movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In late April 1978, Liang\u2019s supervisor, William Cohen, learned that Liang intended to acquire a fifty percent interest in the theatre. Liang sought approval for this outside activity, as required by the Exchange Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Soon thereafter, Cohen informed Liang that Shearson\u2019s Compliance Department had rejected his application for approval. Liang asked Cohen to seek reconsideration of the rejection. In a meeting on May 1, Cohen again told Liang that the application had been rejected. On May 3rd, Liang met with Cohen and Donald Law, a Shearson Compliance Officer. Liang was told that he had to disaffiliate himself from either the Festival Theatre or Shearson. Liang responded that he would not give up his outside activity. When he refused to resign, he was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">Immediately after Liang\u2019s termination, Shearson sent a letter to each of Liang\u2019s customers saying that Liang was no longer employed by Shearson. Liang, meanwhile, sought employment at Bache Halsey &amp; Stuart and Dean Witter, two brokerage firms with reputations and facilities comparable to Shearson. Each firm was told by Liang the reason for his separation from Shearson. Each firm, after contacting Cohen at Shearson, declined to employ Liang.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">Liang sought arbitration of his termination pursuant to his employment contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Liang submitted an earnings history from his securities business and claimed about $84,000 in damages. After a hearing, a panel of five arbitrators awarded Liang $50,000, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">After the arbitration, Shearson discovered that Liang had incorporated Liang Insurance Agency and Investments, Inc., an Illinois corporation, in October 1977. Liang had not disclosed this other outside affiliation to Shearson, although there was no evidence that the corporation was active.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">Shearson filed this complaint to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award. The district court granted Liang\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Shearson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Shearson urges first, that there was no evidence to support the arbitrators\u2019 award; second, that Liang\u2019s nondisclosure of his other company is fraud sufficient to vacate the award; and third, that the district court erred in treating Liang\u2019s motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment because Shearson\u2019s exhibits created a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We can set aside an arbitration award only on the grounds set forth in section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. <em>Tamari v. Bache Halsey Stuart Inc., </em>619 F.2d 1196, 1198 n.2 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 873, 101 S.Ct. 213, 66 L.Ed.2d 93 (1980). Lack of evidence to support the award is not among those grounds,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> although some courts have suggested that an arbitral award may be set aside if it is \u201ccompletely irrational.\u201d <em>See, e. g., Storer Broadcasting Co. v. American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, </em>600 F.2d 45, 47 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Swift Industries, Inc. v. Botany Industries, Inc., </em>466 F.2d 1125 (3d Cir. 1972). This Circuit has not decided the issue, <em>see National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Rwy., </em>551 F.2d 136, 142 (7th Cir. 1977), and we need not decide it now, for the evidence adduced here amply supports the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">At the hearing, Liang and Cohen testified that Shearson knew Liang worked at an X-rated movie theatre when he was hired. Cohen also testified that neither he nor Liang\u2019s customers had any complaints about the way Liang handled his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">There was evidence that Shearson did not automatically discharge an employee for violation of Rule 346, but that it depended on the nature of the outside affiliation. Liang testified that his ownership of the theatre would not conflict with his duties during trading hours, and this was not seriously contested by Shearson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the evidence showed that Shearson rejected Liang\u2019s outside activity because it feared potential bad publicity if it became known that one of its representatives was part owner of an X-rated movie theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The arbitrators gave no reasons for their award, but they are not required to do so. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 598, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960); <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 436, 74 S.Ct. 182, 187, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953). Shear-son\u2019s argument that there was no evidence to support a finding that Liang did not breach his contract reduces to an assertion that the arbitrators reached the wrong result from conflicting evidence. We may not vacate the award on that ground. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 567-68, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Shearson\u2019s further reply that Liang\u2019s employment was terminable at will is without merit. It has been held repeatedly that an agreement to arbitrate disputes about employee discharges implies a requirement that discharges be only for \u201cjust cause.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>See, e. g., Int'l Ass\u2019n. of Machinists v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>406 F.2d 1223, 1226-27 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 820, 90 S.Ct. 57, 24 L.Ed.2d 70 (1969). Since the arbitrators had power under the contract to make that determination, their award must be upheld. <em>Amoco Oil Co. v. Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Inti Union, </em>548 F.2d 1288, 1294 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 905, 97 S.Ct. 1697, 52 L.Ed.2d 389 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The district court ruled that Shearson\u2019s discovery of Liang\u2019s other outside affiliation did not warrant vacating the award. It reasoned, first, that Shearson did not show that it could not have discovered the evidence prior to the arbitration; second, that even if it had discovered it prior to arbitration, the evidence would not have been admissible to bolster Shearson\u2019s decision to fire Liang. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> The Arbitration Act does not allow vacation of an award for new evidence. <em>Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild v. Washington Post Co., </em>442 F.2d 1234, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1971). Nor have we found any case explicitly holding that new evidence or nondisclosure of evidence constitutes \u201cfraud\u201d under section 10, as appellant suggests. But even in those few cases involving nondisclosure of evidence or perjury, courts have recognized the applicability of the due diligence requirement. <em>Karppinen v. Karl Keifer Machine Co., </em>187 F.2d 32, 35 (2d Cir. 1951); <em>see Biotronik v. Medford Medical Instrument Co., </em>415 F.Supp. 133, 138-39 n.15 (D.N.J.1976). The district court\u2019s ruling that Shearson had not met the due diligence requirement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">We are less certain of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the arbitrator would not have admitted the evidence of Liang\u2019s other affiliation had it been timely discovered. Arbitrations are not governed by the rules of evidence. We agree, nevertheless, that the evidence does not justify vacating the award even if admissible. The arbitration concerned only Liang\u2019s discharge for his affiliation with the Festival Theatre. Whether Shearson may now have \u201csufficient evidence to justify a discharge of [Liang] for cause if he were now in the employer\u2019s employ is irrelevant to the issues the arbitrator heard and has no bearing upon the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the employer did not have just cause to discharge him\u201d in 1978. <em>Bridgeport Rolling Mills Co. v. Brown, </em>314 F.2d 885, 886 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 821, 84 S.Ct. 58, 11 L.Ed.2d 55 (1963). Therefore, even if the evidence were admitted, it would have been relevant only to Liang\u2019s credibility. Failure to consider credibility evidence is not a ground for vacation of an award. <em>Karppinen v. Karl Keifer Machine Co., </em>187 F.2d at 35; <em>Newark Stereotypers\u2019 Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>397 F.2d 594, 598-99 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 954, 89 S.Ct. 378, 21 L.Ed.2d 365 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Finally, we reject Shearson\u2019s contention that the district court improperly construed Liang\u2019s motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. The district court may properly construe a motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment when it is accompanied by documents. F.R.C.P. 12(b). Neither Shearson\u2019s brief here nor its submissions to the district court discloses any material fact about which it believes there is a dispute. Summary judgment was, therefore, properly entered against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-15\">.
