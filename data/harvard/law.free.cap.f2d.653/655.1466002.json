This order (hereinafter referred to as \u201cRP75-51 Order\u201d) terminated an investigation into the causes of, and possible solutions to, curtailments of natural gas deliveries suffered by customers of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (\u201cTransco\u201d) during the 1974-75 winter season, and approved several factual findings reached by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) after consideration of the testimony and exhibits presented to him. Because we find petitioner lacks standing to bring this suit and because the decision to terminate this investigation instituted pursuant to section 14 of the Natural Gas Act (\u201cNGA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717m(a), is committed to agency discretion, we dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-22\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b713-23\">Transco, a major interstate pipeline, purchases, transports and sells natural gas to distributors in 11 states, including North Carolina. At the time of the events which gave rise to this action, its principal sources of supply lay in the outer continental shelf, an area of small, fragmented reservoirs with relatively short productive lives. During the summer of 1974, it became obvious that Transco\u2019s supplies from these sources would fall far short of its original estimates, necessitating curtailments in planned deliveries to its customers. Accordingly, Transco issued its first curtailment plan in September, 1974, projecting a shortfall of supply over contract demand of 28 percent. Transco continued to revise its estimates of available gas supplies downwards in the fall, and contemporaneously issued a series of revisions to its original curtailment projections, increasing projected non-delivery by 30 Bcf.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between October and December of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-24\">On January 8, 1975, the Federal Power Commission (\u201cFPC\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> invoked its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>tionary authority under section 14 of the Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to investigate Transco\u2019s supply shortage. In its Order Instituting Investigation and Order to Show Cause, Setting Hearing, and Establishing Procedures (\u201cInvestigatory Order I\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the FPC outlined five areas of inquiry: (1) \u201cthe circumstances for the increased curtailment,\u201d (2) \u201ca determination as to the current projections of curtailment for said system,\u201d (3) \u201cthe adequacy of the gas reserves held or controlled by [Trans-co],\u201d (4) \u201cthe change, if any, in the level of production from such reserves, [and] the effect on deliverability of gas from reserves affected by adverse weather\u201d and (5) \u201cthe actions taken to fully reactivate the production from those reserves.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Transco and its principal suppliers presented evidence on these matters at FPC hearings held between January and March, 1975, at which time the proceedings were suspended to allow the parties to obtain additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In the spring of 1975, Transco again revised its deliverability projection, this time upward to include 18 Bcf. of gas which it had previously declared unavailable. On July 1, 1975, the FPC issued an Order Amending Prior Order and Broadening Scope of Investigation (\u201cInvestigatory Order II\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to enlarge the scope of the investigation. The additional areas to be explored were \u201call facts bearing upon the alleged need for any curtailment by Transco to its customers and also to Transco\u2019s efforts to improve deliverability upon its system consistent with its obligations to provide adequate and reliable service to its customers,\u201d as well as \u201call facts bearing upon (1) the enforcement of the provisions of the Natural Gas Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder; and (2) remedial measures to be directed by the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the same order, the FPC removed from the scope of the investigation two of Transco\u2019s suppliers, Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation (\u201cMitchell\u201d) and Cities Service Oil Corporation (\u201cCities Service\u201d) pursuant to the request of a Congressional subcommittee conducting a related investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its Order Amending Order and Requiring Report (\u201cInvestigatory Order IV\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the FPC limited the scope of its investigation to Transco\u2019s 19 largest suppliers in the interest of efficiency \u201c[s]ince the purpose of the investigation is to locate, if possible, additional supplies of gas that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>be brought on stream prior to the commencement of the coming heating season.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After an extensive investigation in which seven people spent six weeks in the field, the FPC staff submitted a report concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">in every case, the inability to satisfy the contract requirements was caused by a combination of mechanical and water problems and/or the inability of the wells to produce due to depletion. Thus, of the DCQ [daily contract rate] rate schedules/fields investigated, it is the conclusion of the technical staff that there were no companies that could not satisfactorily account for not making their respective DCQ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">FPC Report on Investigation and Audit of Transco Producer-Suppliers (\u201cStaff Report\u201d), FPC Docket No. RP75-51 at 5-6; R. 4695-96; II J.A. 5-6. The Staff Report further concluded that there was no evidence of any \u201cshut-in reserves being \u2018withheld from the market\u2019 or that there are any wells capable of delivering in excess of current levels which can be legally or in some cases economically produced.\u201d Staff Report at 6; R. 4696; II J.A. 6 (footnote omitted). This report served as the cornerstone of the hearings which reconvened before an AU in February, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The ALJ issued his Initial Decision in June, 1977. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>The ALJ substantially adopted the factual conclusions of the Staff Report, which he quoted at length in his opinion. He thereby vindicated Transco\u2019s actions during the crisis\u2014 he found that the curtailments were necessary and that Transco had not attempted to manipulate gas supplies for its own profit\u2014 but did not go so far as to conclude that Transco or its suppliers were free from blame for the conditions which led up to the crisis. Indeed, the opinion notes that \u201cthere may have been some lack of diligence in the past in improving gas supplies and some bad management decisions on the timing of offshore repairs[.]\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the ALJ rejected the remedial measures proposed by the FPC staff and NCUC in light of Trans-co\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d efforts to increase future deliverable supplies of natural gas<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201cOrdered, subject to review by the Commission, that this Investigation is terminated.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">NCUC and the FPC staff filed Exception Briefs to this initial decision, arguing that the judge should have recommended remedial actions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Commission, however, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision in a two page order issued in 1979, noting in a footnote that Transco\u2019s supply situation had vastly improved by 1978 and that the 1979 projections were even higher. RP75-51 Order; R. 6982.1; I J.A. 240. NCUC filed an application for rehearing; when the Commission took no action upon it for the statutorily designated time period, NCUC petitioned for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">II. THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">NCUC argues before this court that the RP75-51 Order should be vacated or reversed and remanded for three reasons. First, NCUC contends that the Commission was required to dismiss the investigation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>moot because its decision to terminate the investigation and affirm the ALJ\u2019s findings with respect to Transco\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 behavior was based on Transco\u2019s improved performance in the post-1977 years rather than the factual record underlying the ALJ\u2019s Initial Decision. Second, NCUC pleads in the alternative that even if the appeal is not required to be dismissed as moot, the findings made by the AU and adopted by the Commission were incomplete and. unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Respondent FERC and the intervenors, Transco and Public Service Electric and Gas Company, et al. (\u201cPSEG\u201d),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> argue in their main brief that the investigation is not moot, that the order terminating it was supported by substantial evidence, and that in any case, NCUC has no standing to bring the suit because it is not a party \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Commission\u2019s order. FERC additionally contends that its order terminating the investigation is not subject to judicial review, but is a decision committed entirely to agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In a post-argument memorandum to the court, intervenor Transco changed its position on the aggrievement issue, and argued for the first time that this court should review the merits of the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">III. MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The threshold question before this court is whether the Commission\u2019s order was moot, and therefore should be vacated in accordance with the doctrine enunciated in <em>A. L. Mechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 324, 329-30, 82 S.Ct. 337, 340-41, 7 L.Ed.2d 317 (1961), and followed by this court in <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, </em>606 F.2d 1373,1382 (D.C.Cir.1979). Petitioner argues that both the factual and policy judgments of the AU were affirmed by the Commission not because they were correct, but because the investigation had been rendered unnecessary, or \u201cmooted,\u201d by the \u201csharp change of circumstances ... between initiation of the investigation and its termination five years later,\u201d namely, the end of the \u201cgas crisis\u201d and Transco\u2019s need to curtail deliveries. Brief for Petitioner at 9-10. Respondent and intervenors argue that the end of the gas crisis did not end the utility of ascertaining its causes and possible preventive measures, and thus the investigation was not rendered moot. In its reply brief, the petitioner contends that this response \u201cmisapprehend[s]\u201d the mootness argument: that while \u201c[w]e have at no time contended that the Commission was required to vacate the proceeding as moot if a determination on the merits would serve some appropriate purpose . . . [the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sion\u2019s] stated reliance on the change in Transco\u2019s supply situation during the period of Commission inaction was improper ... if that is what the Commission intended in the order here under review[.]\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner at 9. However, after careful thought, we have come to the conclusion that it is petitioner who mislabelled, if not misapprehended, the \u201cmootness\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Petitioner does not argue \u2014 in fact it contends just the opposite \u2014 that a determination of the factual issues involved in the investigation has been rendered unnecessary by the passage of time or that the factual findings reached by the ALJ and affirmed by the Commission have no collateral effects on the rights of the parties in other administrative and judicial actions. Rather, petitioner\u2019s argument seems to be that the Commission adopted the controversial findings for an improper reason \u2014 its reliance on the \u201cfootnote 5 data.\u201d Footnote 5 of the RP75-51 Order \u201ctake[s] official notice of Transco\u2019s vastly improved supply situation in the past several years as reflected in its Form 16 filings.\u201d RP75-51 Order at 2 n.5; R. 6983; I J.A. 241. Petitioner argues that this footnote was the Commission\u2019s only \u201cindependent rationale for its action\u201d of \u201c \u2018adoptpng] unchanged the Initial Decision,\u2019 \u201d indicating thereby that instead of reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision on its merits, the Commission affirmed it because \u201cthere was no point to continuation of the now-stale investigation of supply on the Transco system[.]\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 13. If the Commission was not going to review the ALJ\u2019s decision on the merits, petitioner argues, the Initial Decision should have been vacated or the proceedings terminated as moot rather than affirmed <em>precisely because the issues involved still had possible collateral consequences. </em>In short, petitioner does not appear to dispute the continued existence of a controversy between itself and the Commission, but rather argues that the Commission decided the dispute incorrectly. This boils down to a \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d rather than a \u201cmootness,\u201d attack on the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Because we read footnote 5, in the context of the whole record, as meaning something quite different from what petitioner contends, we do not find the Commission\u2019s partial reliance on it objectionable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The ALJ concluded that no remedial measures were necessary because Transco\u2019s new management had embarked on an ambitious program to increase supply levels that, according to testimony taken in 1975, would show positive results in the 1978-79 winter heating season.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> NCUC attacked the decision not to order remedial measures by citing to Transco\u2019s increased curtailments in the 1976 and 1977 calendar years.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The later improvements of 1978 in Transco\u2019s supply situation cited by the Commission in note 5 rebutted the petitioner\u2019s exceptions and confirmed the ALJ\u2019s initial prognostications. The material contained in footnote 5 was therefore relevant to the Commission\u2019s decision to affirm the merits of the Initial Decision, rather than an indication that the dispute over the causes and preventive measures investigated was mooted <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> by the improvement in the supply situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>IV. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Section 19(b) of the NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b), confers standing to seek review of Commission action on \u201c[a]ny party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding . . . . \u201d The requirement of aggrievement \u201cserves to distinguish a person with a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation . . . from a person with a mere interest in the problem.\u201d <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), </em>412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2417 n.14, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). To show aggrievement, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to prove the existence of a \u201cconcrete, perceptible harm of a real, non-speculative nature[.]\u201d <em>Public Citizen v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>565 F.2d 708, 716 (D.C.Cir.1977). FERC argues that NCUC has not been aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s order at issue in this case because it does not \u201cimpose an obligation, deny a right, or fix some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.\u201d <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 113, 68 S.Ct. 431, 437, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948). NCUC alleges two sources of aggrievement: first, it claims it has been aggrieved by FERC\u2019s and Transco\u2019s use of the Commission\u2019s order adopting the findings of the underlying investigatory report in related administrative and judicial proceedings; secondly, it claims it has been aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s decision not to recommend remedial measures. We find both arguments unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">A. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Aggrievement in Other Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Petitioner argues that it has been aggrieved by the utilization of the investigative order in three proceedings: (1) an appeal taken by Transco from a judgment obtained by CF Industries and Farmers Chemical Association, currently pending before the Fourth Circuit, (2) administrative compensation proceedings in FERC Docket No. RP72-99 (\u201cRP72-99\u201d) and its associated investigation, FERC Docket No. TC79-6 (\u201cTC79-6\u201d), and (3) an administrative declaratory judgment order filed by Transco, FERC Docket No. TC79-8 (\u201cTC79-8\u201d). However, petitioner has failed to prove either that the order was used to its disadvantage in these proceedings, or if so used, it would be unable to attack the basis of any adverse finding in that proceeding. In the absence of such a showing, we find no aggrievement exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Petitioner\u2019s first claim of aggrievement arises from FERC\u2019s referral of the RP75-51 Order and investigative report to the Fourth Circuit for its use in the resolution of <em>CF Industries, Inc. v. Transco.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, NCUC\u2019s allegations fall far short of those necessary to establish aggrievement. NCUC has not demonstrated how the use of the order and/or report in the <em>CF Industries </em>court proceeding will adversely affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>its rights or obligations in any way.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It has alleged no facts which would indicate that the outcome of <em>CF Industries </em>will affect its rights directly or indirectly in other administrative or judicial proceedings. It is not this court\u2019s job to ferret out or even to speculate as to possible impacts of possible outcomes of existing lawsuits upon future litigation; it is the petitioner\u2019s responsibility to show the specifics of the aggrievement alleged, and this petitioner has not done so. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 518, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2215, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Finally, even if NCUC might be affected in some way by the <em>CF Industries </em>litigation, intervention pursuant to F.R. Civ.P. 24<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> should provide NCUC with an adequate means of protecting its interests during the course of that proceeding. FERC has conceded both at oral argument and in post-argument submissions to this court that if investigative findings of the RP75-51 report and order are utilized in future administrative or judicial proceedings, the basis of those findings may be attacked in these new proceedings. Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument at 5. Given the availability of alternate and more direct forums of judicial review, we see no reason to allow review here and now.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>United States v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad Co., </em>273 U.S. 299, 47 S.Ct. 413, 71 L.Ed. 651 (1927) (ICC investigative report not reviewable until used as <em>prima facie </em>evidence in later proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s second claim of aggrievement arises from the inclusion by reference of the record of the RP75 \u2014 51 proceedings (\u201cRP7551 report\u201d) into the record of the TC79-6 proceedings (\u201cTC79-6 report\u201d) utilized in the compensation proceeding denominated FERC Docket No. RP72-99.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Here again petitioner has failed to show how any of the findings or non-findings of the report challenged in the instant proceedings could conceivably affect the outcome of the curtailment compensation proceedings to which it is a party.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> A speculative injury does not constitute aggrievement. . <em>Cf. Lynchburg </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>336 F.2d 942, 946 (D.C.Cir. 1964) (present aggrievement exists if future aggrievement certain because of \u201cintended influence of the order upon the business operations and management decisions of [petitioner]\u201d). Moreover, NCUC has no answer to FERC\u2019s position, stated at oral argument and again in its Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument at 5, that petitioner can attack any findings that give rise to aggrievement in the compensation proceeding itself to an ALJ or a review court more fully apprised of the relevance and significance of those findings to that proceeding than we are. We can think of no good reason to decide these questions now before it becomes clear whether NCUC will be hurt by the use of the RP75-51 findings in the curtailment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Finally, NCUC claims it was aggrieved by FERC\u2019s reliance on the RP75-51 order in the declaratory judgment action filed by Transco as FERC Docket No. TC79-8. In the first place, FERC rendered its decision in this declaratory judgment action two months <em>before </em>it affirmed the ALJ\u2019s opinion in RP75-51;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the Commission never explicitly relied on the RP75-51 investigative report let alone the challenged order in the TC79-8 proceeding.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, in its decision in TC79-8, FERC expressly excluded from consideration and decision the issues on which the RP75-51 Order or investigation might have had a marginal impact.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Finally, NCUC has been granted leave to intervene in TC79-8, and consistent with FERC\u2019s announced policy, should be allowed to contest there any disputed findings of RP75-51 relevant to that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">In sum, NCUC has failed to show that it has been aggrieved or will be aggrieved by Commission or court reliance on the disputed order in related proceedings; moreover*', this court accepts the Commission\u2019s assurances that NCUC can dispute any findings contained in the RP75-51 Order when and if they are utilized to NCUC\u2019s disadvantage in other Commission or court proceedings. Under these circumstances, we must hold that no aggrievement exists within the meaning of section 19(a) of the NGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">B. <em>Investigative Termination as Aggrievement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Petitioner\u2019s second theory of aggrievement relies on the failure of the RP75-51 Order to recommend remedial measures. It contends that this is the sort of \u201cnegative order\u201d which gave rise to sufficient aggrievement to confer reviewability in <em>City of Chicago v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 162, 90 S.Ct. 309, 24 L.Ed.2d 340 (1969). However, a \u201cnegative order\u201d which \u201cmain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tain[s] the status quo\u201d gives rise to aggrievement only in situations where a party has a right to a departure from the status quo, as the petitioner in <em>City of Chicago </em>did. In this case, no matter what the results of the investigation, FERC had no statutory duty to enact remedial measures. Therefore, the report\u2019s recommendation not to institute specific remedial measures was not of sufficient import to constitute a legally cognizable aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>City of Chicago, </em>the Court held reviewable an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cICC\u201d) discontinuing an investigation into the termination of service by several passenger rail trains. In so doing, it cited the following passage from <em>Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, </em>307 U.S. 125, 142-43, 59 S.Ct. 754, 763, 83 L.Ed. 1147 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">An order of the Commission dismissing a complaint on the merits and maintaining the <em>status quo </em>is an exercise of administrative function, no more and no less, than an order directing some change in status. The nature of the issues foreclosed by the Commission\u2019s action and the nature of the issues left open, so far as the reviewing power of courts is concerned, are the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiKQ\">396 U.S. at 166-67, 90 S.Ct. at 311-12. While the literal words of <em>City of Chicago </em>would seem to offer petitioner succor, a closer look at what was really going on in that case discloses that it dealt with an entirely different situation, necessitating an entirely different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">At issue in <em>City of Chicago </em>was the reviewability of an order terminating an investigation under section 13a(l) of the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d). Under this section, the ICC had the option of investigating the discontinuance or change of passenger rail service for conformity with the statute\u2019s public convenience and necessity standard within 30 days of notification of said discontinuance or change. Though the decision to launch an investigation was undeniably unreviewable, 396 U.S. at 165, 90 S.Ct. at 311, section 14(1) of the ICA mandated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">whenever an investigation shall be made by said Commission, it shall be its duty to make a report in writing in respect thereto, which shall state the conclusions of the Commission, together with its decision, order or requirement in the premises. .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">The Supreme Court interpreted section 14(1) to give affected parties a right to a reasoned decision on the merits of any investigation undertaken.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>By contrast here, Congress did not create a right to a decision in a section 14 investigation nor did it directly link findings reached in section 14 investigations to enforcement actions. Section 14 investigative results can only be utilized in subsequent proceedings, where they can be attacked by parties<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> to the proceeding.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The applicable regulation stresses the flexibility of action left FERC after the conclusion of the investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">Where it appears that there has been or may be a violation of any of the provisions of the acts administered by the Commission or the rules, opinions or orders thereunder, the Commission <em>may </em>institute administrative proceedings, initiate injunctive proceedings in the courts, refer matters, where appropriate, to the other governmental authorities, <em>or take other appropriate action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">18 C.F.R. \u00a7 lb.7 (emphasis supplied). Precisely because any impact of a section 14 investigation is contingent on future administrative action, the Court in <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 618-19, 64 S.Ct. 281, 295, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944), held \u201ccertain findings as to the lawfulness of past rates which Hope had charged its interstate customers\u201d made in the context of a section 14 investigation were not reviewable by the courts, but rather \u201ca preliminary, interim step towards possible future action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618-19, 64 S.Ct. at 295. <em>See also United States v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad Co., </em>273 U.S. 299, 47 S.Ct. 413, 71 L.Ed. 651 (1927) (holding valuation of property after investigation pursuant to \u00a7 19a of the Valuation Act not reviewable because no aggrievement caused; fact that the valuation constitutes <em>prima facie </em>evidence in subsequent actions does not \u201cprevent the report from being solely an exercise of the function of investigation\u201d). These cases clearly demonstrate that the Court does not normally consider purely investigatory findings, not directly linked to agency enforcement proceedings,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> of sufficiently definite impact to give rise to the aggrievement necessary for standing under section 19(a) of the NGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Moreover, petitioner lacks standing because its claimed injury cannot be redressed by an order of this court reversing, remanding, or vacating the Commission\u2019s RP75-51 Order. The vitality of the requirement of redressability has been repeatedly reaffirmed, by both the Supreme Court and this court. <em>See Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); <em>Duke Power Company v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); <em>Physicians\u2019 Education Network, Inc. v. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>653 F.2d 621 (D.C.Cir.1981). Petitioner claims as its sole injury stemming from the termination of the investigation FERC\u2019s refusal to adopt \u201cremedies designed both to alleviate the existing shortage and to prevent recurrence of a similar crisis in the event of another shortage.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner at 6. However, as detailed in Part V of this opinion, FERC is not required to adopt remedial measures even if it affirms an investigative report recommending them. The final decision as to what if any action should be taken with respect to an investigative report rests within the agency\u2019s discretion. We cannot find that it is substantially likely that the agency will implement remedial measures simply because we declare the RP75-51 Order moot, incorrect or incomplete. \u201cOnly specul\u00e1tive in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ferences could lead us to such a conclusion because the record does not carry us that far, and \u2018unadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the judicial power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Physicians\u2019 Education Network, Inc. v. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>Civ. No. 79-2701 (D.D.C. May 12,1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>658 F.2d 621 (D.C.Cir.1979) <em>(citing Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 44, 96 S.Ct. at 1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">V. REVIEWABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As petitioner noted in its reply brief, <em>see </em>Reply Brief for Petitioner at 5, respondent\u2019s reviewability argument is closely tied to its aggrievement argument. The fact that petitioner has not yet been aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s order affirming the Initial Decision is an indication that it is the sort of \u201cnonfinal administrative order []\u201d for which \u201c[jjudicial intervention would be cumbersome and inappropriate.\u201d <em>Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. FERC, </em>628 F.2d 235, 237, 239 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1061, 101 S.Ct. 784, 66 L.Ed.2d 604 (1980). Moreover, as explained above, if a later proceeding does result in actual aggrievement, the opportunity to contest the order or findings will also arise. Therefore, resolution of the issues at this early investigative stage is not necessary to prevent unfairness at the later enforcement stage, and if allowed might lead to the consideration of many issues which need never be considered at all. For such reasons, courts traditionally refuse to rule on interim agency orders. <em>See The National Conference of Catholic Bishops v. Smith, supra, </em>653 F.2d at 541-542. We see no reason to depart from this practice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Review of investigative findings unaccompanied by remedial measures would be similarly wasteful. On the one hand, investigative findings can be overruled or rendered impotent by future agency actions, and on the other, correcting improper investigative findings does not necessarily affect future agency decisions. The applicable statutes commit the decisions to prosecute<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and to institute new regulations<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> to agency discretion; while the agency may, and we assume it does, rely on investigative reports when exercising that discretion, it is under no obligation to follow their recommendations.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Therefore, courts should not ordinarily review orders relating only to the investigative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, to the extent our review of investigative decisions did influence agency actions, we would be intruding into areas committed to agency discretion. As the Court made clear in <em>Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern Railway Co., </em>372 U.S. 658, 83 S.Ct. 984, 10 L.Ed.2d 52 (1963) and <em>Southern Railway Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., </em>442 U.S. 444, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 60 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979), courts should not prejudge issues arising in preliminary agency actions which are relevant to a final agency decision committed either to agency discretion or its primary jurisdiction. Thus this court has held that we cannot review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>FERC\u2019s decisions to accept rate filings, <em>see Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. FERC, supra, </em>or those of the FCC to accept tariff filings, <em>see Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v. FCC, </em>642 F.2d 1221 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1998, 68 L.Ed.2d 311 (1981), because to do so would involve judicial examination of issues, such as the reasonableness of the rates at issue, before the agency which had primary jurisdiction over the question expressed its final opinion. Judicial review at the initial stage, because of its possible effect on final agency decisionmaking, would \u201cundermine the authority of the agency acting within the scope of its discretion.\u201d <em>Papago Tribal Authority v. FERC, supra, </em>at 243. Just as the decision to accept or reject a rate filing is a \u201cnecessary adjunct to the unreviewable decision to suspend and investigate,\u201d <em>id., </em>the decision to accept or reject an investigatory report here is a necessary adjunct to the agency\u2019s unreviewable decision to recommend or decline enforcement or rulemaking proceedings. The same substantive questions are relevant to review of the one as to the other. For this reason, judicial review of the initial investigative findings in contexts other than enforcement or rulemaking proceedings would run the risk of \u201cinvad[ing] the province reserved to the discretion of the agency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">In sum we do not agree with petitioner that the Commission\u2019s order should be dismissed as moot; we find no aggrievement at this time enabling petitioner to challenge the substantive basis of the Commission\u2019s decision to terminate the investigation and to decline to undertake remedial measures; and we do not think its order reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-20\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-15\">.

While we can say that in the majority of cases no legal dispute exists at the investigation stage, the situation is better described as non-final than moot.

FPC, </em>511 F.2d 372 (D.C.Cir.1974), the compensation monies determined by the allocation provisions of the settlement agreement have been placed in an escrow account pending a decision on the legality of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The FPC initially disapproved the settlement, and its decision was appealed to this court in <em>Transco </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>562 F.2d 664 (D.C.Cir.1976), cert. <em>denied, </em>436 U.S. 930, 98 S.Ct. 2830, 56 L.Ed.2d 775 (1978) (\u201cTransco I\u201d). The court there held that it could not determine the legality of the compensation scheme absent information \u201cregarding the duration, shape and causation of the alleged shortage on the Transco system\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">the legality of compensation may well turn, at least in part, on answers to the following sorts of questions .... will compensation be a short-term financial adjustment between customers of the pipeline to keep some of the customers financially afloat until the supply situation stabilizes, or will it be a permanent cross-subsidization?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">562 F.2d at 669. Upon remand, the proceeding was assigned to the same ALJ who had presided over the RP75-51 investigation at issue in this case. He subsequently issued a report expressly incorporating his findings in RP75-51 \u201cwhich are material\u201d into TC79-6. Report to the Commission, FERC Docket No. TC79-6 (Aug. 16, 1979) at 5, <em>reprinted in </em>Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument app. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s allegation that this report \u201clargely duplicated his earlier report,\u201d Supplemental Brief for Petitioner at 5, the TC79-6 report, which was issued after additional hearings had been held and information and briefs submitted, covered different issues and included more detailed statistics on other issues than did the RP75-51 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Following submission of this report, the Commission, in a sudden reversal, <em>approved </em>the challenged settlement. <em>See </em>Order on Compensation, FERC Docket Nos. RP72-99 &amp; TC79-6 (Aug. 4, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument app. D. NCUC did not challenge the TC79-6 report because it assumed the Commission\u2019s reversal rendered harmless any error. Supplemental Brief for Petitioner at 4 n.*. The Commission then changed positions again, granting rehearing on the compensation issue and ordering the case remanded for further hearings. <em>See </em>Order Granting Rehearing and Setting Compensation Issue for Hearing, FERC Docket Nos. RP72-99 &amp; TC79-6 (Dec. 8, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument app. A. The December 8 order did not vacate the August 4 approval of the TC79-6 report. Petitioner, alleging that the report therefore caused or could cause it harm in the renewed proceeding, filed for rehearing of the decision not to vacate, and upon its denial, for review of the challenged orders in this court. <em>See </em>Supplemental Brief for Petitioner at 4 \u2014 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">Because the Commission has not rendered a final decision on the compensation issue, it is as yet impossible to know whether, or how, NCUC has been injured by the Commission\u2019s adoption of the TC79-6 report, let alone its indirect reliance upon the RP75-51 report. Given the Commission\u2019s previous position on the compensation issue, there is at least a serious possibility that no injury will result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b720-13\">. NCUC contests here the allocation of blame for the creation of the curtailment situation, a question that appears of only marginal relevance to the question of fairness and nondiscrimination between <em>customers </em>(none of whom are to blame for the shortage) at issue in the curtailment proceedings. Moreover, to the extent NCUC asks this court to overrule the ALJ\u2019s finding that Transco is remedying the causes of the curtailment on its own,' NCUC appears to weaken its compensation argument, which rests on the premise that compensation is a \u201cshort-term financial adjustment [rather than] ... a permanent cross-subsidization[.]\u201d <em>Transco I, supra, </em>562 F.2d at 669. The court there noted that if the shortage was self-induced and likely to recur absent remedial measures by FERC, the compensation would more likely amount to a discriminatory, and therefore illegal, rate or charge than a temporary, and legal, surcharge or penalty payment. <em>Id. </em>at 668 n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\">. <em>See </em>Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition for the Institution of Proceedings and for a Declaratory Order, Establishing Procedures for Briefing and for Hearing and Granting Interventions (\u201cTC79-8 Order\u201d), FERC Docket No. TC79-8 (Aug. 17, 1979), <em>reprinted in </em>Memorandum Responding to Question at Oral Argument app. C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">.

Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Minneapolis Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>294 F.2d 212 (D.C.Cir.1961), for the proposition that the termination of an investigation gives rise to a legally cognizable injury is also misplaced. The investigation at issue in <em>Minneapolis Gas </em>was instituted pursuant to section 4 of the NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c(e), which empowers the Commission to \u201center upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate[.]\u201d Section 5 of the NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">Whenever the Commission, after a hearing upon its own motion or upon complaint . . ., shall find that any rate ... is unjust [or] unreasonable, . .. the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate . . . <em>and shall fix the same by order. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">(emphasis supplied). The court held that the Commission could not terminate proceedings instituted pursuant to section 4(a) after the ALJ had made findings of fact, reached conclusions, and rendered an initial decision, and exceptions to that decision had been argued to the Commission. (It specifically left open, however, the possibility that the agency had the discretion to terminate the proceedings at an earlier point. <em>Minneapolis Gas Co. v. FPC, supra, </em>294 F.2d at 214.) Because the Commission was required to take specific enforcement action based on the outcome of this investigation, its decision to affirm or reject the ALJ\u2019s decision was reviewable. The court in <em>Minneapolis Gas </em>recognized that to allow the Commission to terminate its proceedings at so late a stage would have provided the agency with an easy method to escape review in cases where it found, after investigation, that rates were reasonable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-14\">It seems to us that the statute requires the Commission to make an early choice between its discretion and the binding necessities of a decisional process. It cannot, we think, pursue one course almost to the end and then protect its last step by reverting to its discretionary power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">294 F.2d at 215.
