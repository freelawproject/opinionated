He appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case. He alleges that there was insufficient evidence showing that the check was in his possession. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">\u201cIn considering a motion for acquittal, the verdict of guilty must be sustained if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, there is substantial evidence to support it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>604 F.2d 1102, 1126 (8th Cir. 1979) (quoting <em>United States v. Frye, </em>548 F.2d 765, 767 (8th Cir. 1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">In the instant case the defendant stated under oath that he signed his name to the check at a grocery store in Blytheville, Arkansas, knowing that the check was \u201chot.\u201d He signed the check in order to help his companion cash it, previous attempts to cash the cheek having failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">The issue of whether Haynes possessed the check is one of fact for the jury. The jury was instructed in accordance with E. Devitt &amp; C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 16.07 (3d ed. 1977). This court has previously approved this instruction, <em>Sewell v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 1289, 1293-94 (8th Cir. 1969), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-17\">The law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession. A person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing, at a given time, is then in actual possession of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-18\">A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention, at a given time, to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-19\">The law recognizes also that possession may be sole or joint. If one person alone has actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is sole. If two or more persons share actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is joint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">It is our view that the jury could properly find that Haynes had actual pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>session of the check when he signed his name to the check and showed his I.D. in order to get the check cashed. In so doing he satisfied the instruction\u2019s requirement of \u201cdirect physical control over a thing, at a given time.\u201d The fact that Haynes\u2019 possession may have been brief does not negate possession of the stolen check. <em>See United States v. Agee, </em>597 F.2d 350, 360 (3d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>442 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2889, 61 L.Ed.2d 315 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\">. The Honorable Elsijane T. Roy, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
