The union seeks review of a decision by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) that the FGIS has no duty to bargain over a union proposal that \u201c[a]ll work in excess of 40 hours per week performed on a Sunday shall be paid at twice the basic rate of pay.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">The employees represented by petitioner are covered under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1191. The statute requires the FGIS to engage in collective bargaining, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7102, 7116, which is defined as \u201cthe performance of the mutual obligation of the representative of an agency and the exclusive representative of employees ... to consult and bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment affecting such employees . . . . \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(12). The statutory term \u201cconditions of employment\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9X\">personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, <em>except that such term does not include policies, practices, and matters </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-20\">(C) <em>to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute [i]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEq\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(14) (emphasis supplied). The sole question in this ease is whether the FLRA correctly determined that the FGIS has no duty to bargain over the union\u2019s proposal that all work in excess of 40 hours per week performed on Sunday be paid at twice the basic rate of pay, because it concerns a matter \u201cspecifically provided for by Federal statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-21\">We have no doubt that the FLRA\u2019s decision was correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Authority properly found that the issue of overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours per week was \u201cspecifically provided for by Federal statute,\u201d <em>viz., 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a), which requires that such work \u201cshall be paid for\u201d at a statutorily specified rate: one and one-half times the employee\u2019s basic rate, or one and one-half times the minimum GS-10 rate, whichever is lower.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>statutory exemption which permits the negotiation of premium pay<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for FGIS employees \u2014 and the union has showed us none \u2014 it is clear that the subject proposed by the union is governed by this provision, As stated in the House Report accompanying the bill which became the CSRA, \u201c[rjates of overtime pay are not bargainable, because they are specifically provided for by statute.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 44 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Petitioner, however, alleges that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as applied to federal employees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> conflicts with and supersedes the overtime pay provision of section 5542(a). Section 7(a)(1) of the FLSA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a <em>rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). We do not find this section of the FLSA to be inconsistent with \u2014 or to supersede \u2014 the overtime pay provision of section 5542(a), and petitioner has shown us no legislative history which might persuade us of an intention to supersede section 5542(a) not oth-</p>\n<p id=\"AlK\">erwise apparent from a plain reading of section 207.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3R\">We therefore hold that section 5542(a) specifically provides the overtime rate of compensation for petitioner\u2019s members, and that the FGIS therefore has no duty under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a) (14) (C) to bargain with petitioner over the latter\u2019s overtime pay proposal.

Section 5542(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-24\">(1) For an employee whose basic pay is at a rate which does not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay <em>is an amount equal to </em>one and one-half times the hourly rate of basic pay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the employee, and all that amount is premium pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(2) For an employee whose basic pay is at a rate which exceeds the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay <em>is an amount equal to </em>one and one-half times the hourly rate of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-10, and all that amount is premium pay.

The court recognizes the possibility that inconsistencies may exist between \u00a7\u00a7 207 and 5542 in certain cases, for example, in computing overtime pay for an employee whose basic pay exceeds the GS-10 rate. <em>Compare </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a)(2) <em>with </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). We do not believe, however, that these minor inconsistencies evince a Congressional intent to make overtime pay negotiable, nor have the agencies whose responsibility it is to reconcile these provisions so found. <em>See </em>Amicus Curiae Brief of the Office of Personnel Management, <em>in </em>Joint Appendix at 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
