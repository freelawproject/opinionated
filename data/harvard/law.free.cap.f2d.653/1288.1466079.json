The trust fund was designed to provide health and welfare benefits to the employees of various contractors engaging in the plumbing and pipefitting industry (\u201ccontractors\u201d). The complaint alleged that Local 525 employees, who were not employees of the contractors, received coverage from the fund without the union making corresponding contributions to the fund. The employer trustees sought damages and removal of the union as the fund\u2019s administrator. The district court accepted jurisdiction under section 502(e) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e), and granted the relief requested, but denied attorney fees. The parties have raised a number of issues on appeal. Since we hold that the district court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to file a supplemental answer and counterclaim alleging settlement of the entire dispute, we do not address the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">On March 21, 1978, a settlement conference was held before the district court. According to the court\u2019s minutes, a \u201csettlement is reached and agreed to by the principals.\u201d The judge ordered counsel to appear and lodge settlement papers on March 23. On that day, counsel for the employer trustees advised the court that his clients would not accept the settlement. On March 27, the defendants moved for leave to file a supplemental answer and counterclaim alleging that the parties, through their respective counsel, had entered an agreement to settle the entire action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-12\">The district court heard oral argument on the defendants\u2019 motion. The employer trustees\u2019 counsel acknowledged that he believed that he had full authority to settle. He represented to the defendants that he had such authority. He also admitted that an accord had been reached. Nevertheless, the district court denied the motion because the case was \u201ctinged with the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-13\">Whether to grant leave to amend is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Jacobson v. Rose, </em>592 F.2d 515, 519 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 930, 99 S.Ct. 2861, 61 L.Ed.2d 298 (1979). Ordinarily, leave to amend should be freely given in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party. <em>Wyshak v. City National Bank, </em>607 F.2d 824, 826 (9th Cir. 1979). If the defendants proved that a binding settlement had been reached,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they had a complete defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>to the employer trustees\u2019 claims. <em>See Autera v. Robinson, </em>419 F.2d 1197,1200-01 &amp; n. 17 (D.C. Cir. 1969). The defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion, because: (1) their motion was timely, (2) the employer trustees were not prejudiced, (3) the settlement constituted a complete defense, and (4) settlement agreements are judicially favored as a matter of sound public policy. <em>Speed Shore Corp. v. Denda, </em>605 F.2d 469, 473 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">The only possible basis for finding that the court did not abuse its discretion is that the purported settlement should not have been enforced because of harm to the public interest. In <em>Jack Winter, Inc. v. Koratron Company, Inc., </em>375 F.Supp. 1, 54 (N.D.Cal.1974), the court noted that even though policy favoring settlements is strong, settlements which subordinate the public interest to private ends should not be enforced. The employer trustees suggest that the public interest was involved because a number of beneficiaries would be affected. This factor does not, however, differentiate this case from class actions where settlements are permissible assuming they are fair. <em>See Miller v. Republic National Life Insurance Co., </em>559 F.2d 426, 428-29 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>Feagan v. Lang, </em>416 F.Supp. 53 (S.D.Fla.1976) indicates that courts should encourage equitable settlement of ERISA pension fund cases, just as settlement is encouraged in appropriate class action cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">This case is not so \u201ctinged with the public interest\u201d that the policy favoring settlements should be overridden. The district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">The defendants also argue that because the matter was subject to binding arbitration the district court erred in holding that it had jurisdiction under ERISA. Regardless of whether the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration or could initially be brought in district court, the parties had the power to settle the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we need not decide this issue. Should the district court find that the parties did not reach a binding settlement, however, the district court may wish to reconsider the arbitration issue in light of the recent authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">The initial question is whether the dispute here involves trust administration or structural violations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the dispute involves structural violations, there would be federal jurisdiction under section 302(e) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e). <em>See Alvares v. Erickson, </em>514 F.2d 156, 165-66 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 874, 96 S.Ct. 143, 46 L.Ed.2d 106 (1975). If on the other hand, the suit is characterized as involving trust administration because of alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, it is a close question whether federal law mandates arbitration of civil causes of action for fiduciary breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">For the district court\u2019s guidance, we will briefly outline the two lines of authority. Under section 302(c)(5) of LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5), arbitration is required whenever \u201ca deadlock on the administration of [the trust] fund\u201d occurs. As interpreted by the majority of federal courts, section 302(c)(5) includes fiduciary violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ERISA, however, provides a civil cause of action for fiduciary breach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One line of authority reasons that because Congress specifically provided that ERISA was not intended to supersede any existing federal law, ERISA \u00a7 514(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d), the arbitration requirement in section 302 of LMRA must be followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, a number of authorities argue that fiduciary claims need not be submitted to binding arbitration because the intent of Congress in enacting ERISA was to provide ready access to the courts with rules advantageous to plaintiffs, and to promote uniformity in the law. These authorities engage in a balancing process,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> weighing the competing interests of the statutory right of access to federal courts against the federal policy favoring arbitration, and conclude that fiduciary responsibility claims are nonarbitrable disputes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">We only decide now that the defendants\u2019 motion to amend should have been granted. This panel retains jurisdiction over the case in the event that further proceedings before this court become necessary. <em>See de Gallardo v. I. &amp; N. S., </em>624 F.2d 85, 88 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>1980); <em>City of Klawock v. Gustafson, </em>585 F.2d 428, 432 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">. The defendants\u2019 motion was renewed before the judge presiding at the trial, and it was again denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">. There is a good possibility that the defendants could have proved that a binding settlement had been reached. The court\u2019s own minutes reflect that a settlement had been reached by the principals. The employer trustees\u2019 counsel admitted that an agreement had been reached. Cases hold that even if counsel misunderstood his authority to bind his clients, the settlement counsel entered into would be binding. <em>See Cia Anon Venezolana de Navegaci\u00f3n </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>374 F.2d 33, 35-36 (5th Cir. 1967); <em>Mungin v. Calmar Steamship Corp., </em>342 F.Supp. 484, 486 (D.Md.1972). If we assumed that lack of actual authority could constitute a defense, the employer trustees would probably, have the burden of proving a lack of authority since under Nevada law an attorney is presumed to have authority to settle his client\u2019s claim. <em>See State of Nevada v. California Mining Co., </em>15 Nev. 234, 243-44 (1880). <em>See also Thomas v. Colorado Trust Deed Funds, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 136, 139 (10th Cir. 1966). Moreover, the failure to have the agreement reduced to writing is not a defense. Although the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>apparently agreed that the settlement would not become binding before court approval, the plaintiffs had a good faith obligation to present the settlement to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">. The <em>Feagan </em>court considered the problem posed here by the employer trustees that a settlement could subject them to personal liability for failure to maximize the fund\u2019s assets. The court responded that if the proposed settlement comports with standards of prudence, the court will approve the settlement. <em>Feagan v. Lang, </em>416 F.Supp. 53, 54-55 (S.D.Fla.1976). On that basis, we reject the employer trustees\u2019 argument that they could avoid settlement because of their fear that they might be charged with a breach of fiduciary duty. <em>See also Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>448 F.Supp. 813, 815 (E.D.Mo.1978) (court rejects argument that settlement violates the provisions of ERISA), <em>vacated and dismissed, </em>594 F.2d 869 (8th Cir. 1979); Nicholson, <em>Collections and Settlement Under ERISA, </em>29 Labor L.J. 364, 367-70 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">. At the time that the parties entered into the settlement, the district court had jurisdiction t\u00f3 decide whether to appoint an arbitrator and the case was properly pending before it. See <em>Ader v. Hughes, </em>570 F.2d 303, 306 (10th Cir. 1978). Consequently, it had the authority to approve and enforce the settlement. <em>See Decanay v. Mendoza, </em>573 F.2d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir. 1978) (\u201ccourts have inherent power ... to enforce a settlement agreement with respect to an action pending before it; the actual merits of the controversy become inconsequential.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">. A structural violation occurs when a trust fund as originally written or amended does not comply with the statutory standards contained in \u00a7 302(c)(5) of LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5). <em>See Alvares v. Erickson, </em>514 F.2d 156, 166 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 874, 96 S.Ct. 143, 46 L.Ed.2d 106 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">. <em>See Turner v.
