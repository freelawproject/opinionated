The NLRB has filed a cross petition for enforcement of its Order. The NLRB held that Welco Industries, Inc. violated Section 8(a)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) by reprimanding and discharging an employee for her use of the grievance procedure. The NLRB ordered Welco Industries, Inc. to cease and desist its violations of the Act and to make the employee whole for any loss of earnings from her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Welco argues that the employee abused the grievance procedure by filing too many grievances to harass the company. In addition, the company argues that the employee was discharged for poor performance. The sole issue in this case is whether substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s decision and Order. Upon review of the entire record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we hold that substantial evidence does support the NLRB\u2019s decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Accordingly, the NLRB\u2019s Order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
