Today we do not review either the propriety of the 1978 regulations or the wisdom of the initial phase-in period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead we judge a more narrow question: whether on December 5, 1980, the Secretary of Labor acted reasonably when he deferred implementation of the regulations until June 21, 1981, and whether he had good cause to take that action without providing prior notice or an opportunity to comment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we find the notice-and-comment question very close, we conclude that, in the special circumstances presented, the Secretary had good cause to dispense with usual rulemaking procedures and that his action was otherwise reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AHP\">Each year, underground fires and explosions claim the lives of some coal miners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Miners who are not killed by the initial explosion or spreading flames may die from inhalation of noxious gases or simple lack of oxygen. In 1969 the National Academy of Engineering concluded that asphyxiation from smoke, carbon monoxide, or carbon dioxide caused twenty-two percent of the 566 mine deaths that occurred between 1950 and 1969.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Responding to this type of information Congress in 1969 required coal mine operators to give all underground miners self-rescue devices that would protect them from poisonous gases for at least one hour.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Regulations promulgated shortly thereafter directed mine operators to supply filter-type self-rescuers to all underground miners.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Filter-type self-rescuers, however, are inadequate to the life-saving task for several reasons. They protect miners only against carbon monoxide, not against smoke, carbon dioxide, or other toxic gases. Even protection from carbon monoxide ceases if carbon monoxide levels exceed one percent of the atmosphere. At higher concentrations of carbon monoxide, the filter-type self-rescuer produces air that is too hot to inhale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Miners react by spitting out the filter-type device and thereupon die from carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition to these problems, filter-type self-rescuers do not supply an independent source of oxygen. Therefore, even if the devices successfully protect miners from carbon monoxide, a low oxygen level may cause miners to lose consciousness and eventually perish in the contaminated mine atmosphere.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Aware of the filter-type device\u2019s limitations, the Bureau of Mines began an extensive testing program to identify a better self-rescuer. In 1977 these efforts culminated in proposed regulations requiring coal operators to equip underground miners with SCSRs rather than filter-type self-rescuers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> SCSRs contain an independent oxygen supply that lasts for an hour or more. Thus, they protect miners from all poisonous gases and give miners sufficient oxygen to attempt escape from a mine struck by a disaster. While SCSRs are much more effective than filter-type self-rescuers, the proposed rules did not contemplate an immediate switch from one device to the other. Instead, the proposed rules indicated that coal operators would have two years from the date of any final regulations to equip their miners with SCSRs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">On November 21, 1978, the Department of Labor issued final regulations requiring the use of SCSRs in coal mines. As promised in the 1977 proposed rules, coal operators were given two years, until December 21,1980, to select, order, and supply SCSRs. 1978 Regulations, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 54246. During this phase-in period, MSHA pledged to field test the SCSRs. <em>Id. </em>at 54244. While MSHA was confident that SCSRs were \u201creliable and safe to use and. store in underground mines,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 54243, the agency wanted to conduct field testing to determine how the use of SCSRs would \u201caffect miners\u201d in actual mining situations. <em>Id. </em>at 54244.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">After promulgation of the final rules, MSHA promptly developed a program for field testing SCSRs. On February 28, 1979, Joseph 0. Cook, MSHA Administrator for Coal Mine Safety and Health, sent Robert B. Lagather, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, an action plan for evaluating SCSRs. The plan envisioned completion of testing well before the December 1980 deadline for implementing the regulations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Two circumstances, however, delayed the field testing program. First, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which had to approve SCSR models before they could be used in the tests, did not approve production model SCSRs until the summer of 1980.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the Joint Industry Health and Safety Committee, representing both a major coal operators\u2019 association and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), would not recommend that their members participate in field testing until MSHA answered safety concerns about SCSRs that had surfaced early in 1980.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Bituminous Coal Operators\u2019 Association (BCOA), the major industry association represented on the Joint Committee, did not finally approve field testing in its mines until November 19, 1980.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ayi4\">MSHA worked ddl&amp;ently to overcome tkese roadblocks. When NIOSH approval for production model SCSRs was not forthcoming, the agency used hand-manufactured models that had been approved in 1979 for a first round of field tests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>calm lingering fears about the safety of SCSRs, MSHA asked the Bureau of Mines to conduct an extensive study of the devices. This study was completed during the summer of 1980 and presented to the Joint Industry Health and Safety Committee the following fall.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And when BCOA continued to withhold approval for field testing throughout the fall of 1980, MSHA initiated tests in mines owned by members of the National Independent Coal Operators Association (NICOA).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Despite delays in the field testing program, MSHA appeared determined throughout the fall of 1980 to complete field testing by December and implement the regulations on schedule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On Novem-</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">ber 5, 1980, Assistant Secretary Lagather wrote to the Joint Industry Committee, noting that the Committee had already received the Bureau of Mines study, and expressed his confidence that field tests could \u201cbe started at . . . affiliated mines [of Committee members] in the very near future.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On November 12, 1980, Robert G. Peluso, MSHA Chief of Special Projects, wrote to representatives of the two manufacturers that had received approval for their SCSRs and asked how many SCSRs they would have on hand by December 21, how many devices they could manufacture during each month after that date, and how they planned to transport finished SCSRs to customers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, on November 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>1980, Assistant Secretary Lagather reported to BCOA that seven mines had been selected for field testing, that testing would begin December 5, 1980, and that testing at three mines would be completed by December 15. While testing at the other four mines would not be completed until January of 1981, Lagather hoped that information from the first three tests would \u201cprovide some guidance in implementating the regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Although Lagather\u2019s November 28 letter implied that he planned to implement the regulations on schedule, MSHA announced a different position shortly thereafter. On December 5, 1980, MSHA published the order that gave rise to this petition for review.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In a few brief paragraphs, MSHA stated that since it had not completed field testing SCSRs, and since only a small number of the devices were available,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it had decided to defer implementation of the regulations until June 21, 1981. This order was preceded by neither notice nor a comment period; MSHA declared that \u201c[i]n view of the imminence of the deadline and the circumstances stated above\u201d it was \u201cimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide advance notice and opportunity for public comment on this amendment.\u201d December 5 Order, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 80502.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The Council of the Southern Mountains (CSM), a representative of miners in Martin County, Kentucky, together with District 12 of UMWA and the Coal Employment Project, petitioned this court for review of the December 5 order. We permitted the American Mining Congress (AMC), an industry association, to intervene. Because the order deferring implementation of the regulations is now in effect,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we have treated this case on an expedited basis. We turn now to the two issues that CSM most urgently presses on appeal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>II. NOTICE AND COMMENT</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">Petitioners\u2019 most substantial claim is that the Secretary improperly issued the December 5 order without prior notice or an opportunity to comment. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires agencies to give \u201c[gjeneral notice of proposed rule making\u201d and to provide \u201cinterested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b), (c) (1976).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This notice-and-comment requirement permits interested parties to criticize projected agency action before that action is embedded in a final rule and allows the agency to benefit from the parties\u2019 suggestions. <em>See National Tour Brokers Association v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 896, 902 (D.C. Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">At oral argument the Government did not dispute that the December 5 order was the type of agency action ordinarily subject to the notice-and-comment procedure.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Government contends, however, that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(B) excuses its failure to follow the notice-and-comment route. That subsection creates a narrow exception, applicable only when an \u201cagency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">We recently admonished agencies that circumstances justifying reliance on this exception are \u201cindeed rare\u201d and will be accepted only after the court has \u201cexamine[d] closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures.\u201d <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Block, </em>655 F.2d 1153, 1157 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1981). We proceed, therefore, to \u201cexamine closely\u201d both the circumstances surrounding the December 5 order and the Secretary\u2019s stated rationale for failing to follow notice- and-comment procedures before issuing that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The Secretary\u2019s justification for dispensing with notice and an opportunity to comment was \u201cthe imminence of the dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>line\u201d for implementing the SCSR regulations. This rationale is one that permits avoidance of APA procedures only in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, an agency unwilling to provide notice or an opportunity to comment could simply wait until the eve of a statutory, judicial, or administrative deadline, then raise up the \u201cgood cause\u201d banner and promulgate rules without following APA procedures. Because of this possibility for abuse, \u201cthe mere existence of deadlines for agency action . . . [can] not in itself constitute good cause for a \u00a7 553(b)(B) exception.\u201d <em>United States Steel Corp. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>595 F.2d 207, 213 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>quoted in American Federation of Government Employees, supra, </em>655 F.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In this case, however, we do not believe MSHA tarried through the fall of 1980, knowing that the SCSR regulations could not be implemented on time, and then postponed the implementation date at the eleventh hour. Instead, we believe that MSHA, recognizing the life-saving importance of the SCSR rules, was determined to implement the rules on time; that the agency believed through the end of November 1980 that on-schedule implementation was possible; and that only at the beginning of December, when it truly was too late to follow notice-and-comment procedures, did the agency concede that effective implementation of the regulations would be advanced by a relatively short-term postponement. Our conclusion is based on five factors that, in combination, render this a special, possibly unique, case.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">First, the circumstances that ultimately forced MSHA to postpone implementation of the regulations were beyond the agency\u2019s control. Field tests were not completed on schedule because of delays in obtaining approval for production model SCSRs and because both mine operators and miners refused to participate in the tests until MSHA answered last-minute safety concerns about SCSRs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Sufficient supplies of SCSRs were unavailable in December 1980 because of delays in obtaining approval for production models and because of industry\u2019s failure to order the devices.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> MSHA\u2019s actions caused neither of these problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Second, MSHA acted diligently both to initiate field testing and to overcome the hurdles created by other parties. The agency developed an action plan for field tests early in 1979.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It did not dawdle at the outset and then attempt a rush in the final months. When roadblocks threatened to hold up the field testing program, MSHA reacted resourcefully. It completed some field tests with hand-manufactured SCSRs,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> requested a comprehensive Bureau of Mines study on the safety of SCSRs,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and performed some field tests in mines that were not owned by members of the resistant BCOA.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Third, the record strongly indicates that, even in November 1980, MSHA intended to implement the regulations on schedule. During the first half of that month a MSHA official wrote to the two manufacturers of approved SCSRs and asked how they intended to transport SCSRs to customers, how many of the devices they would have on hand by December 21, and how many units could be produced each month after that date.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, once it finally received industry\u2019s tardy approval for field testing on November 19, MSHA made immediate plans to complete as many of the tests as possible by December 15.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> And Assistant Secretary Lagather, writing to BCOA about these planned tests, indicated that the regulations indeed would be implemented on December 21.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record that shows MSHA wavering over the implementation date until the December 5 order itself issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Fourth, when the Secretary did postpone the implementation date, he deferred implementation for a relatively short time. If a rule ranks as a substantive regulation,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the limited nature of the rule cannot in itself justify a failure to follow notice and comment procedures. We have recognized, however, that \u201c[t]he more expansive the regulatory reach of [agency] rules, . . . the greater the necessity for public comment.\u201d <em>American Federation of Government Employees, supra, </em>655 F.2d at 1156. Conversely, the limited scope of the December 5 order influences our finding that the Secretary possessed good cause to dispense with prior notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Finally, Government counsel assured this court at oral argument that field testing has been completed, that an evaluation of the tests should be available shortly, and that implementation of the regulations on June 21 of this year is fully anticipated. While these assurances were made after the December 5 order, they contribute substantially to our impression that MSHA has followed a persistent course toward implementation of the regulations without unnecessary delay. Absent these assurances, we might have entertained some doubt about MSHA\u2019s good faith intention, throughout the fall of 1980, to implement the regulations on schedule. And were we not convinced of that determination, we could not excuse MSHA\u2019s eleventh hour decision to defer implementation without affording interested parties prior notice or an opportunity to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">These five factors, taken together, persuade us that the Secretary had good cause to dispense with notice and comment before issuing his December 5 order. We emphasize again, however, that this is an extremely close case. Nothing in this decision diminishes the force of our repeated admonition that \u201cit should be clear beyond contradiction or cavil that Congress expected, and the courts have held, that the various exceptions to the notice-and-comment provisions of section 553 will be narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.\u201d <em>New Jersey v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>626 F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980). We recognize an exception to that rule in this case, but we do so guardedly, based on the totality of the special circumstances presented.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>III. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS</p>\n<p id=\"ANA\">Petitioners also contest the reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s decision to postpone implementation of the regulations. In contrast to the borderline question the notice-and-comment issue presents, we have scant difficulty concluding that the Secretary\u2019s action was reasonable. During the phase-in period numerous parties, including both coal operators and miners, questioned the safety of SCSRs. Against this background the Secretary reasonably determined that field testing should be finished before the regulations were implemented. Completion of the field tests would help the Secretary satisfy any genuine safety concerns raised by parties governed by the regulations; in addition, the test results would enhance his effort to assure the cooperation of all affected parties when SCSRs were finally introduced into the mines.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The unavailability of SCSRs,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> moreover, is a factor relevant to our consideration of the Secretary\u2019s decision to delay implementation. While the Government clarified at oral argument that unavailability of the devices was not an \u201cindependent justification\u201d for the deferral, the fact that very few miners would have received SCSRs by December 21 fortified the Secretary\u2019s decision to delay implementation of the regulations.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As the Government now points out, the unavailability of SCSRs rendered less severe the practical consequences of the Secretary\u2019s decision to defer implementation until field testing was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Finally, we note a point stressed by Government counsel in briefing and arguing this case. As the December deadline approached, MSHA found that guidelines on the storage of SCSRs and the training of miners had not been completed.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> While the Secretary did not rely on this problem in his published notice of deferral, the lack of finished guidelines on these important matters was a factor that could reasonably have influenced the Secretary\u2019s decision to defer implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">We regret that the long effort to equip miners with safe, oxygen-generating rescue devices has been prolonged an additional six months. We do not believe, however, that MSHA has been insensitive to the health and safety of underground miners. Satisfactory deployment of SCSRs will demand the cooperation of both coal operators and miners. To assure that cooperation, and to reassure the concerned parties that SCSRs would not introduce additional dangers into the hazardous mine environment, MSHA reasonably decided to postpone implementation of the SCSR regulations from December 21, 1980, to June 21, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Since we find the Secretary\u2019s December 5 order neither procedurally infirm nor arbitrary and capricious, that order is</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\">.

The record items cited above, however, indicate that ready-to-manufacture SCSRs were not finally approved until June and July of 1980. Moreover, one of the \u201cminor insignificant changes\u201d referred to by CSM\u2019s counsel was a change in the size of the SCSR\u2019s straps. As subsequent tests proved, the straps are an important part of the device and may cause numerous difficulties if not properly designed. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Jerry W. Stengel (Supervisory Physical Scientist, Bureau of Mines) to Robert L.

December 5 Order, <em>supra </em>note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. Only 9000 SCSRs were available for delivery in December 1980. See note 21 <em>supra. </em>Since there are approximately 133,000 underground coal miners in the United States, Brief for the Secretary of Labor at 13 n.9, the number of SCSRs available in December 1980 was woefully inadequate. In their written and oral presentations to this court, petitioners emphasized that manufacturers will remain without incentives to produce SCSRs in quantity until orders are placed for the devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Reluctance to place early orders for SCSRs is understandable. At oral argument, counsel for CSM estimated that SCSRs now cost approximately $550 apiece. If coal operators purchase one SCSR for each of the nation\u2019s 133,000 coal miners, the cost will exceed 73 million dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">. On January 27, 1981, a motions panel of this court stayed the December 5 order. A few weeks later, however, the court vacated the January 27 stay and left the December 5 order in effect pending expedited review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\">. In addition to the issues discussed below, CSM claims that the Secretary impermissibly engaged in ex parte contacts with industry representatives during the fall of 1980. We decline either to vacate the December 5 order because of these contacts or to require MSHA to disclose the substance of the communications in the record presented to this court for review. At the time these contacts occurred, MSHA was not engaged in rulemaking. Rather, it was endeavoring to implement a final rule. Successful implementation of a rule may depend on uninhibited exchanges between the agency and the parties affected by the rule. Moreover, given the limited nature of the Secretary\u2019s December 5 order, the stated reasons for that order, and the circumstances under which the order was made, we do not believe disclosure of the ex parte conversations pointed to by petitioners would aid our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">We find similarly unpersuasive intervenor\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s December 5 action. The Government, we note, does not share intervenor\u2019s view. Brief for the Secretary of Labor at 1 n.l. In any case, we believe that 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(d) (Supp. Ill 1979) clearly gives this court jurisdiction to review the December 5 order. That section authorizes this court to review \u201cmandatory health or safety standard[s] promulgated\u201d by the Secretary of Labor. While the Secretary based his December 5 order on the general grant of rulemaking authority contained in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 957 (1976), the order was in effect an amendment to a mandatory safety standard. Authority to review such an amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ment is implicit in the jurisdictional grant of \u00a7 811(d). Buttressing our position, \u201c[t]he structure of the [Federal Coal Mine Health &amp; Safety] Act .. . makes it quite clear that Congress intended that all legal challenges to the Act, to its enforcement and to any regulations promulgated thereunder be heard by the Federal Courts of Appeals, not by the Federal District Courts.\u201d <em>Bituminous Coal Operators\u2019 Association, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>82 F.R.D. 350, 352 (D.D.C.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. The Act also requires agencies to publish a final rule \u201cnot less than 30 days before its effective date.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d) (1976). Since the December 5 order was effective immediately, the Secretary may have violated this provision of the APA. The Federal Coal Mine Health &amp; Safety Act, however, provides that \u201c[a]ny mandatory health or safety standard . .. shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register unless the Secretary specifies a later date.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a)(5) (Supp. Ill 1979). We need not determine whether this provision excused the Secretary\u2019s failure to abide by \u00a7 553(d), since petitioners focus their fire on the Secretary\u2019s violation of subsections (b) and (c) of that section, not on any violation of subsection (d). <em>Cf. American Federation of Government Employees v. Block, </em>655 F.2d 1153, 1155-1159 (D.C.

Section 553(b)(A) of the APA excepts \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\u201d from the notice-and-comment requirement. Intervenor asserts that the December 5 order fell within this exception since it was an \u201cinterpretative rule.\u201d The Secretary\u2019s published notice, however, did not invoke \u00a7 553(b)(A) and Government counsel told this court at oral argument that the order deferring implementation of the SCSR regulations \u201cwould most likely be considered a substantive rule\u201d since it \u201cdid affect the rights of the parties involved.\u201d We agree with the Government that the December 5 order was a substantive rule since, by deferring the requirement that coal operators supply life-saving equipment to miners, it had \u201c \u2018palpable effects\u2019 upon the regulated industry and the public in general.\u201d <em>National Helium Corp. v.
