The first count alleged that Murphy\u2019s injuries were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendants\u2019 employees\u2019 negligence. The second count sought relief on the theory that the institutional conditions which allegedly facilitated the attack constituted violations of Murphy\u2019s fifth amendment right to due process and eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. At the close of appellant\u2019s case, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of both defendants on the constitutional theory of liability. The court contemporaneously granted the United States\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on the negligence count, but denied the District\u2019s motion for similar relief. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict against the District on the negligence count in the amount of $161,000. The court then granted the District\u2019s motion for a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>(\u201cn.o.v.\u201d), and directed a verdict in favor of the District on the negligence count, thereby denying to appellant as a matter of law relief on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">Appellant now appeals from three of the trial court\u2019s rulings: its decision to direct a verdict in favor of the United States on the negligence count; its decision to direct a verdict in favor of the District on the constitutional count; and its grant of the judgment n. o. v. in favor of the District on the negligence count. We affirm the first two of these rulings, but reverse the third. We find that sufficient evidence did exist to go to the jury on the question of the District\u2019s negligence in allowing the attack to take place. However, because we find that a directed verdict was warranted with respect to one of the theories of liability presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to the jury on the negligence issue, we must remand the case for retrial rather than merely ordering reinstatement of the jury verdict. See p. 646 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AB6\">The criteria for granting a motion for a directed verdict and for a judgment n. o. v. are identical.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In each case, the motion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiS\">should not be granted unless the evidence, together with all the inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom is so one-sided that reasonable men could not disagree on the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Vander Zee v. Karabatsos, </em>589 F.2d 723, 726 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 962, 99 S.Ct. 2407, 60 L.Ed.2d 1066 (1979). When considering such a motion, all evidence must be \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the [non-moving party.]\u201d <em>Alden v. Providence Hospital, </em>382 F.2d 163, 165 (D.C.Cir. 1967). <em>See also Princemont Construction Corp. v. Smith, </em>433 F.2d 1217,1220 (D.C.Cir. 1970). Indeed, in any case \u201cwhere fair-minded people might differ as to the conclusion appropriate,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court must submit the question to the jury. Thus, the question before us is whether reasonable persons could have concluded on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial that either the District or federal defendants were negligently responsible for the attack that resulted in plaintiff\u2019s injuries, or that the District had violated Murphy\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">II. THE CASE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The appellant sued the United States for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671 <em>et seq., </em>which renders the United States liable for injuries \u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the [United States] Government[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The appellant argues that the Attorney General and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons were negligent in two respects: first, in failing to ensure that Murphy was committed to a \u201creasonably safe\u201d institution, and second, in failing to adequately supervise Murphy once he was placed in Lorton Reformatory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find both arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">A. <em>Murphy\u2019s Placement in Lorton Youth Center</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The appellant argues that the section of the Youth Corrections Act (\u201cYCA\u201d or \u201cFYCA\u201d) under which he was sentenced, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 425<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> impose upon the Attorney General a statutory obligation to place offenders such as Murphy in \u201can appropriate correctional facility,\u201d Brief for the Appellant at 12, and that the Attorney General violated this obligation by \u201cperfunctorily\u201d assigning Murphy to Lorton Youth Center. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Lorton, the appellant contends, was inappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>because its inmates were not \u201creasonably secure from harm\u201d \u2014 one \u201ccould reasonably expect that an armed and dangerous gang of inmates would ... be permitted to enter his room and brutally attack him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>If the court shall find that a convicted person is a youth offender, and the offense is punishable by imprisonment . . . the court may . . . sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision. pursuant to this chapter until discharged])]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The appellant first argues that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010-15 of the FYCA, the Attorney General was obligated to evaluate Murphy and commit him to the federal youth center best suited to his needs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This duty, he contends, was violated by Murphy\u2019s \u201cperfunctory\u201d commitment to Lorton without a formal evaluation of his needs and the institution\u2019s ability to meet them. However, we agree with the trial judge: \u201cThere is no [such] statutory responsibility [.]\u201d Tr. 5/9/79 at 439. Congress amended the YCA in 1967 to grant District officials comprehensive control over the \u201cmaintenance, treatment, rehabilitation [and] supervision\u201d of District of Columbia Code offenders such as Murphy by authorizing the District to construct or contract for facilities in which to house them, and granting it complete authority over those offenders sentenced to such local facilities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the judge still technically assigns District of Columbia Code offenders to the custody of the Attorney General when sentencing them pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Attorney General in turn has the legal authority to designate as their place of confinement any appropriate facility,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> local or otherwise, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5025 makes clear that Congress envisioned that the Attorney General would commit them to Lorton in the absence of unusual circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In practice, the sentencing judge recommends commitment of District of Columbia Code offenders to Lorton Youth Center, or asks the Bureau of Prisons to investigate alternative placements. In Murphy\u2019s case, no request for alternative placement was made and the sentencing judge committed him directly to Lorton Youth Center.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>commitment was consistent with the plain thrust of the statutory scheme of placing District youth offenders under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections unless the sentencing court requests otherwise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">But second, even if the Attorney General retains a general obligation under this statutory scheme to assign Murphy to an \u201cappropriate\u201d institution,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> appellant failed to present sufficient evidence of the Attorney General\u2019s breach of this duty to warrant submission to the jury. Violence is unfortunately endemic to American prisons; the appellant could not and does not argue that the mere fact that some inmate assaults occur at Lorton Youth Center makes it an \u201cinappropriate\u201d institutional placement for Murphy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, he argues that the institution is \u201cinappropriate\u201d because the rate of violence is so high as to be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While in some cases the raw number of assaults may be sufficient evidence of unreasonableness, in this case the number of assaults that occurred in the Youth Center and in Dormitory # 3 where Murphy lived in the year of his attack was not so high as to strike this court as <em>per se </em>unreasonable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, the appellant adduced no other evidence at trial tending to prove unreasonableness, e. g., that these numbers were outside the range of violence normally associated with this type of penal institution,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or that any subset of prisoners suffered from an unusual risk of attack.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Moreover, the appellant himself stipulated that he had not feared for his physical safety prior to the attack;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> there was therefore insufficient evidence of an excessive level of inmate assaults for a jury to conclude that \u201cterror reign[ed]\u201d in the institution or even that there was a pervasive risk of harm to inmates like Murphy.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No reasonable juror could have concluded from this barren record that the rate of assaults at Lorton was so excessive that the Attorney General\u2019s placement of Murphy there violated any statutory obligation to place him in an appropriate institution. The question was therefore properly withheld from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">B. <em>The Attorney General\u2019s Duty to Supervise Murphy at Lorton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Appellant\u2019s second theory of federal liability, i. e., that the Attorney General or Director had a duty to supervise his care after commitment to Lorton Youth Center, likewise fails because that alleged duty too no longer exists. It was eliminated by the 1967 amendments to the FYCA. According to appellant, the Director had an obligation under the FYCA to \u201csupervise youth offenders subsequent to their commitment and to insure that the objectives of the FYCA are met with regard to each youth offender.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Brief for the Appellant at 15. However, as we pointed out earlier, Congress in 1967 explicitly transferred responsibility for \u201csupervision\u201d of District Youth Center offenders, including \u201cmaintenance, treatment [and] rehabilitation\u201d from federal to local authorities. It is hard to see how Congress could have made its intent to transfer day-to-day supervision over District of Columbia Code offenders in Lorton Youth Center any clearer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">The appellant also claims that the Director neglected his statutory duty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5016 to periodically reexamine Murphy and report on his progress for purposes of granting a parole or transfer. Even a superficial reading of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5025, however, makes clear that the District now supervises the conditional release and discharge, as well as the treatment and rehabilitation, of District youth offenders committed to its facilities.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In fact, one of the stated purposes of the 1967 amendment was to \u201ctransfer\u201d authority from the \u201cU. S. Bureau of Prisons and the Youth Corrections Division of the U. S. Board of Parole to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia\u201d in order to grant \u201clocal authorities . . . continuing jurisdiction over such offenders, permitting a continuity of treatment which should bring about more effective results.\u201d S.Rep.No.912, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 (1967). The report notes that it changes the then-existing law under which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfH7\">an offender sentenced under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act and committed to a District of Columbia institution is under the supervision of District authorities while in the institution but under the supervision of the Youth Corrections Division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>U.S. Board of Parole for purposes of conditional release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><em>Id. See also </em>H.R.Rep.No.387, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 31, 39 (1967). District parole authorities, rather than the United States Parole Commission, are therefore responsible for making and evaluating the progress reports on which the conditional release and discharge decisions are made.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The 1967 amendment thus eliminates the Federal Government\u2019s responsibility for those very duties whose breach, according to the appellants, constituted negligence. The trial judge correctly concluded that \u201c[a]ny attempt to read the District of Columbia Code in specific provisions with respect to the youth facilities here in the same fashion you read it with respect to the Youth Corrections Act nationally is incorrect .... There is no statutory responsibility^]\u201d Tr. 5/9/79 at 439. His direction of a verdict in favor of the Federal Government on this or any theory of liability argued below was therefore not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">III. THE CASE AGAINST THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">A. <em>The Constitutional Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkU\">Though the appellant\u2019s complaint alleged several violations of fifth and eighth amendment rights, the only argument he presses on this appeal is that the District violated his eighth amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. Specifically, appellant argues that placement in a dormitory at Lorton Youth Center \u201cin which violent prisoner assaults frequently occurred,\u201d and the District\u2019s subsequent failure to take reasonable precautions to protect him from such assaults, violated his constitutional right to be free from an unreasonable risk of assault. Brief for the Appellant With Respect to Appellee D.C. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Supreme Court has laid out the standard of proof necessary to establish an eighth amendment violation. The Court has held that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d of prison authorities to a prisoner\u2019s \u201cserious\u201d medical needs may constitute such \u201cwanton infliction of unnecessary pain\u201d as to be \u201c \u2018repugnant to the conscience of mankind,\u2019 \u201d or incompatible with \u201c \u2018the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 102-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290-91, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). The Court took pains in that opinion to distinguish between \u201cnegligen[ce]\u201d or \u201can inadvertent failure,\u201d which does not invoke constitutional protections, and \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d which does. <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 97 S.Ct. at 291 \u2014 92. The district court here correctly concluded, and the appellant does not now challenge, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">[t]here is no indication . . . from any of the testimony here that the police [sic] officers deliberately did anything or willfully violated any of their responsibilities to protect Murphy[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Tr. 5/9/79 at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">However, as appellant correctly points out, this conclusion does not end the constitutional inquiry because the existence of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d can be inferred from evidence that assaults are sufficiently pervasive to reasonably apprise prison officials of the need for protective measures. Under these circumstances the failure to institute protective measures can rise to the level of a constitutional violation. While a prisoner has no right to demand the level of protection necessary to render an institution assault-free (he is only entitled to \u201creasonable protection\u201d from assaults, <em>see </em>note 18 <em>supra), </em>commitment to an institution where \u201cterror reigns,\u201d or even where the \u201crisk of .. . assault [is] a serious problem of substantial dimensions,\u201d may violate the eighth amendment. <em>See Jones v. Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364 at 1373 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Withers v. Levine, </em>615 F.2d 158, 161 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 849, 101 S.Ct. 136, 66 L.Ed.2d 59 (1980). But to prevail under such a constitutional theory, the prisoner must show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>violence and sexual assaults occur . .. with sufficient frequency that the .. . prisoners ... are put in reasonable fear for their safety and to reasonably apprise prison officials of the existence of the problem and the need for protective measures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><em>Id. </em>Not all prisoners need be subject to this fear. \u201cIt is enough that an identifiable group of prisoners do, if the complainant is a member of that group.\u201d Zd.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">However, we must agree with the district court that no such showing was made here. The sole evidence proffered, again, was the raw number of assaults (twenty) that occurred in Lorton Youth Center I (population 344), and the number (six) in Dormitory # 3 (population 100) where Murphy was housed during the 1976 calendar year, numbers we have already found insufficient in this case to prove unreasonableness. <em>See </em>p. 642 <em>supra. </em>Furthermore, the appellant made no attempt to show that the rate of assaults in this facility exceeded the norm for like institutions or that one identifiable group of inmates was especially susceptible to attack. <em>See </em>notes 19 &amp; 20 <em>supra. </em>Particularly in view of the appellant\u2019s stipulation that he did not fear for his safety prior to the attack,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we cannot find in this record any support for appellant's contention that so escalated a level of violence existed that the prison officials must have been \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the prisoner\u2019s need for reasonable protective measures.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Hence, we uphold the trial court in its refusal to submit the constitutional count to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">B. <em>The Negligence Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">The appellant\u2019s last argument was that the Lorton Youth Center staff\u2019s negligence in three areas proximately caused his injury, thereby rendering the District liable for that injury. He alleged: 1) the staff failed to follow applicable count regulations in ways that facilitated the movement of at least one of Murphy\u2019s attackers into his dormitory wing;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> 2) the staff failed to properly perform and/or record the required room and inmate searches and tool inventories so that no adequate system of tool control existed to prevent inmates\u2019 easy access to weapons such as those which may have been used in Murphy\u2019s assault; and 3) the staff released one of Murphy\u2019s attackers from the Center\u2019s Adjustment Unit, despite a lengthy record of verbal threats of violence and disciplinary infractions, without taking special security precautions to ensure the protection of other inmates, and failed to recommit him following a more recent disciplinary infraction. After the trial court initially denied the District\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on all three theories, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The trial court then granted a judgment n. o. v. against the appellant because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>[p]laintiff failed to present evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found that the conduct of Defendant\u2019s employees was a proximate cause of Plaintiff\u2019s injuries .... [immediately after an inmate count is completed, the inmates are free to move around Youth Center I and mingle in the recreation areas of their respective wings. Given that fact, the failure to prevent all movement of inmates during the count cannot be said to have proximately caused Plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Plaintiff\u2019s other allegations of negligence were not supported by the evidence and thus also cannot sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><em>Murphy v. United States, </em>Civ. No. 78-251 (D.D.C. Apr. 30, 1980) (order granting judgment n. o. v.); R. 92 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We disagree with the court\u2019s decision to grant the judgment n. o. v. on two of the three theories of liability. Though we would not characterize the appellant\u2019s case on any of the three theories of negligence as strong, he did present expert testimony as to the applicable standard of care and the staff\u2019s alleged deviation from that standard in two of the three alleged areas of negligence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We conclude that the jury could have found that expert evidence along with the testimony of Lorton correctional officers sufficient from which to infer that the staff\u2019s negligence proximately caused Murphy\u2019s injury on these two theories of liability. However, we agree with the trial judge and the appellee that the appellant presented insufficient evidence to allow the jury to consider the third theory of liability, that relating to the classification of Vaughn Pugh. Because we cannot determine on which theory of liability the jury relied when finding in favor of the appellant, leaving open the possibility that it may have relied on the impermissible one, the case must be remanded for retrial. <em>See Wilmington Star Mining Co. v. Fulton, </em>205 U.S. 60, 79, 27 S.Ct. 412, 419, 51 L.Ed. 708 (1907); <em>Glass v. Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co., </em>457 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">1. Deviations from the Count Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Prison officials count inmates several times each day to ensure that no one has escaped.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> During such counts, inmates are required to remain stationary in certain areas of the prison, usually their cells, until all inmates are accounted for.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Murphy\u2019s assault occurred sometime during the mid-afternoon count. His theory of liability is that the staff prematurely released inmates from their wings into the porch and communal areas before the institutional count had been cleared, and one of the four guards assigned to guard the dormitory was consequently on the porch with several inmates rather than on patrol inside the dormitory<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> at the time of the attack. Both actions, allegedly in violation of the applicable regulations, permitted at least one of his attackers to leave his wing and cross over to Murphy\u2019s dormitory to perpetrate the assault. Such unauthorized cross-overs, a recognized security hazard,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> were prohibit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ed by institutional regulations.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">No one disputed the fact that on November 28, 1976, the staff allowed the residents of Dormitory # 3 off their wings following the completion of the dormitory count,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> without waiting for the institutional count to clear.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Considerable dispute did exist at trial, however, as to whether this procedure violated the applicable standard of care. The inmate handbook containing the Youth Center\u2019s official regulations said merely that \u201c[a]ll residents must stay <em>in their rooms </em>until the count is cleared by the Dormitory Officer.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s expert witness testified that this meant, or should have meant, that inmates were to remain in their rooms until the institutional count cleared.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The officers on duty testified variously that the expert\u2019s interpretation of the regulation was correct and that the regulation meant only that residents were to stay in their rooms until the dormitory count cleared; after that they could go into the dormitory\u2019s communal rooms or on the porch<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> until the institutional count cleared.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">There was also contradictory testimony over whether the officer who went out on the porch after calling in the count violated his duty to stay inside the dormitory and ensure that inmates also stayed on their wings. According to the appellant\u2019s expert, each officer should have been patrolling one wing of the dormitory to ensure that no inmate left his wing during the count.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Youth Center officers testified, on the other hand, that placing an officer on the porch was the appropriate security technique for ensuring that youths, allowed in the common areas of the dormitory following completion of the dormitory count, did not leave the dormitory prematurely.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">There was thus no question, and the trial judge did not conclude otherwise, that sufficient evidence existed to go to the jury on the issue of whether it was a negligent deviation from the prevailing standard of care<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> to conduct the count as the staff at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Lorton admittedly did on the day of Murphy\u2019s assault. The judge granted the judgment n. o. v. because he found as a matter of law that the failure to prevent movement of inmates off the wings during the count could not be considered a proximate cause of Murphy\u2019s injury given the fact that a few minutes later, when the count was completed, the inmates were legitimately allowed to move around in communal areas of the dormitory and outside in the Youth Center compound. In other words, he appeared to conclude that because the attack could as easily have taken place later when movement was freer, any negligence in allowing out of wing movement before the count procedures were completed merely accelerated the timing of, rather than caused, the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">However, we do not find this reasoning satisfactory as a justification for overturning the jury\u2019s finding of negligent liability. There was testimony that the placement of both the officers<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and inmates<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> was different during count and non-count periods. Thus, even if Murphy\u2019s assailants could have illegitimately entered into his wing during \u201cfree time,\u201d a jury could nonetheless have inferred that the attack would have been more difficult to perpetrate when Murphy was not as likely to be in his room and when dormitory guards were not occupied with the count. The possibility that an attack might have taken place later under different circumstances does not excuse officers\u2019 irregular actions during the count which may have created an unreasonable danger of attack during that period of time and therefore proximately caused the attack.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>2. Tool Control</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Murphy\u2019s attackers stabbed him 16 times and beat him; a doctor testified that the beating may have been administered with a blunt instrument. Tr. 5/8/79 at 333. There is no question but that the inmates should not have had access to such weapons; there is also no question that prison inmates typically strive and often manage to find, steal, or create many such weapons.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Appellant argued that the officials at Lorton Youth Center I did not use their best efforts to prevent inmates from possessing weapons, but in fact violated both their own regulations and the prevailing standard of care by failing to maintain adequate tool control, search, and shakedown procedures. The resultant access to weapons, he claimed, proximately caused his injuries.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The Youth Center had detailed regulations governing tool access, tool return, and tool inventories to prevent inmates from utilizing tools as weapons.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s expert testified that these regulations were adequate;<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> however, he also testified that as far as he could tell from the correctional officers\u2019 preceding testimony, the staff had failed to follow them. He repeatedly stressed the need for,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and in this institution apparent lack of, a tool inventory as the linchpin of an adequate tool control system. Appellant had requested in his interrogatories the records of all tools listed as missing during the years 1973-78. However, the District responded that it had no such records.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> At trial, it was argued that this response meant only that the information did not exist in the form requested; <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>one officer testified that lists of missing tools had been kept for these years but had since been destroyed as obsolete.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Two other officers denied all knowledge of a tool inventory or any other record of tools extant at or missing from the institution.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The court refused to issue a subpoena for any existing tool inventories, in whatever form, at trial.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Hence there was evidence before the jury that no inventory existed and no definitive proof that it did. The absence of such an inventory might well have been relied upon by the jury as evidence of the lack of an adequate tool control program, a program necessary, according to appellant\u2019s expert, to reasonably insure inmates\u2019 safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The expert witness also testified that regular searches and shakedowns of the institution were essential for adequate tool control.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> He specifically stated that for a search to be effective, inmates must be searched along with their rooms.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> However, one correctional officer testified that when he conducted searches at Lorton Youth Center I, he searched only rooms, and allowed the inmate to stand in the hall where it was possible for him to pass contraband to his fellow inmates.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> One correctional officer testified that he did not remember conducting the number of room</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">searches and shakedowns required by the Center\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The attack on Murphy was perpetrated by armed inmates; without weapons of some sort, his attackers could not have inflicted the multiple stab wounds. Evidence existed from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that Lorton Youth Center\u2019s tool control program, designed to keep weapons out of inmates\u2019 hands <em>precisely to forestall this type of attack, </em>had been ignored by several guards in Murphy\u2019s dormitory. Where evidence of the failure to adhere to a reasonable standard of care exists, and the \u201cinjury which has in fact occurred is precisely the sort of thing that proper care on the part of the defendant would be intended to prevent,\u201d not only is the existence of proximate cause a jury question, but \u201cthe court can . . . allow a certain liberality to the jury in drawing its conclusion.\u201d W. Prosser, Law of Torts 243 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">3. The Classification of Pugh</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">The third and final allegation of negligence resulted from the Center\u2019s decision to release one of Murphy\u2019s attackers, Vaughn Pugh, from the Center\u2019s Adjustment Unit.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Appellant argued that Pugh\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>release subjected him to an unreasonable risk of attack. However, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that this theory of negligence was not \u201csupported by the evidence and thus also cannot sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Murphy v. United States, </em>Civ. No. 78-251 (D.D.C. Apr. 30, 1980) (order granting judgment n. o. v.); R. 92 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In contrast to his testimony regarding appellant\u2019s other allegations of negligence, appellant\u2019s expert did not state that anything about the decision to mainstream Pugh violated a \u201cpenological concept.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The process by which the decision was made was admittedly adequate;<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the decision itself was not \u201coff the wall.\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The strongest term of criticism Mr. Miller was willing to utter against the decision was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> As the District\u2019s counsel made clear on cross-examination, the disagreement between Mr. Miller and the officer who had made the decision was one of professional judgment.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We are unwilling to hold under the circumstances here that evidence of a difference in judgment between experts as to the assaultive possibilities of an inmate constitutes evidence of negligence. When a decision requiring a difficult prediction of future behavior is shown to have been made in accordance with proper procedural safeguards and is substantively within a range of reasonableness, the burden of proving negligence cannot be said to have been met<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Appellant presented no evidence to support his claim that the officials negligently classified Pugh aside from the testimony of Mr. Miller. Pugh\u2019s disciplinary reports showed a pattern of verbal, not physical abuse; there was no evidence that he had assaulted an inmate prior to the attack on Murphy. Pugh\u2019s release from the Adjustment Unit followed 90 days of, and behavioral improvement during, treatment; release was conditioned on his participation in a special counseling program.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In short, appellant presented no evidence that Lorton Youth Center\u2019s handling of Pugh was unreasonable, and the trial court could properly direct a verdict against Murphy on that theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">A party moving for a directed verdict or judgment n. o. v. bears a very heavy burden. He must prove that no reasonable person, after viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the other side, could decide for that other side. The appellees successfully carried that burden with respect to most of appellant\u2019s allegations of liability. However, we must agree with the district judge\u2019s initial, rather than his post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>verdict, evaluation of two of the three theories underlying his claim against the District on negligence grounds: \u201cYou just barely made it under the wire.\u201d Tr. 5/9/79 at 429. The case should have been submitted to the jury for resolution of the disputed factual questions determinative of the District\u2019s liability under those theories. Because the original jury\u2019s verdict was tainted<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> by consideration of a theory of recovery that should properly have been withheld from it, we must order a retrial rather than reinstate the jury verdict. The case is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\">.

As Mr. Murphy was not sentenced in the U. S.

This request was accepted by the Bureau of Prisons on December 16, 1976, and Mr. Murphy was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, on December 28, 1976.

We note also another weakness in this theory of liability. The only possible connection between the failure to reexamine and report on Murphy and the attack lies in the remote chance that had the Director conducted the studies, Murphy would have been either paroled or transferred before the time of the attack. However, the appellant made no attempt to show that this occurrence was likely. In fact, the appellant presented evidence tending to prove that up to the time of the attack, Murphy had been progressing well at school, and was participating in a vocational training program, so that no factors indicating a need for a transfer were present. Tr. 5/9/79 at 497-503. Parole was also an unlikely possibility.

Finkelman, </em>268 Mass. 524, 168 N.E. 89 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The majority opinion also suggests that plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence to raise a jury question on the issue of tool control. This will no doubt come as some surprise to plaintiff, not to mention the District, since plaintiff did not argue in his brief on appeal that the district court erred in taking the case away from the jury on this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For plaintiff to prevail on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>issue, it was his burden to prove that a breach of a standard regarding tool control was the proximate cause of his injury. The majority opinion is unable to point to the evidence by which plaintiff met this burden. Instead, it holds that the jury could infer negligence based on this theory because (1) the <em>District of Columbia </em>failed to establish that it maintained a proper tool inventory, and (2) there was evidence that the beating <em>may </em>have been administered with a blunt instrument, although no weapon was admitted into evidence. Appellant\u2019s abandonment of this argument is understandable; the majority makes his case for him only after placing the burden of establishing a sufficient tool inventory on the District and then ignoring the need for evidence connecting the allegedly inadequate tool control with the \u201cinstrument\u201d that \u201cmay\u201d have been used in the attack upon Murphy. In sum, the majority errs by considering an argument not argued by appellant on appeal, and by shifting the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant and ignoring a glaring gap in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">All the reasons stated above illustrate the principle that the violation of any govern-mentally imposed rule of conduct that was not intended to protect the plaintiff against the harm he suffered cannot constitute the basis of a claim of negligence against any alleged violator. That principle applies to the instant Count System. It did not create any duty that the officer owed to Murphy sufficient for a violation thereof to constitute the probable cause of the assault upon him by another inmate. I therefore cannot agree with the reasoning or the result of the court\u2019s opinion and dissent therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Because I believe the district court properly granted judgment n. o. v. for the District of Columbia, I would affirm its judgment in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-11\">. The \u201cCount System\u201d was set forth in the \u201cResident [Inmate] Handbook.\u201d It imposed duties primarily on inmates, and did not require the guards to be at any particular place. Under the practice one officer counted the \u201cB and D side\u201d and the other officer counted the \u201cA and C side.\u201d Tr. 5/7/79 at 104. There was no testimony that the officer in question was not on his \u201cside\u201d at all relevant times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-18\">. Whether the controlling issue is viewed as duty or proximate cause, the important point is that the district court recognized the issue as a legal one for the court to decide. <em>See generally </em>Thode, <em>Tort Analysis: Duty-Risk v. Proximate Cause and the Rational Allocation of Functions Between Judge and Jury, </em>1977 Utah L.Rev. 1 (advocating the duty-risk analysis to ensure that the issues of policy are decided by the court and not by the jury in a misguided application of proximate cause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">. The same conclusion follows a <em>fortiori </em>when the harm allegedly results from the violation of an administrative regulation or procedure rather than a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-4\">. Tr. 5/8/79 at 250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\">. The majority contends that the guard\u2019s presence on the porch during the count facilitated a \u201ccross-over\u201d by one inmate from his wing to Murphy\u2019s. Since cross-overs are always prohibited, the majority suggests that the guard\u2019s alleged misplacement was \u201cevidence of the institution\u2019s violation of its general duty to use reasonable care to protect inmates from assaults by other inmates.\u201d Maj. op. at 648 n.45. The District of Columbia conceded that \u201cthe unauthorized presence of an inmate on a wing other than his own at anytime violates Youth Center regulations separate and distinct from those pertaining to inmate counts.\u201d District of Columbia\u2019s Brief at 14. The majority\u2019s position must fail, however, because appellant\u2019s expert did not testify that the guard\u2019s position on the porch violated his duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent cross-overs. In response to the question, \u201cWhat about the correctional officer being outside until the institutional count cleared?,\u201d he testified: \u201cThat would be highly ... irregular.\u201d Tr. 5/8/79 at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Clearly, the presence of an inmate on a wing other than his own indicates a violation of the regulation against wing-crossing. It does not, however, demonstrate negligence. As the District of Columbia argued: \u201c[T]he mere occurrence of a fellow-inmate assault in violation of prison regulations does not <em>ipso facto </em>establish the jailer\u2019s negligence. If the law were otherwise, the jailer would be an insurer of inmate safety.\u201d District of Columbia\u2019s Brief at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The majority submits that the guard\u2019s presence on the porch necessarily resulted in the breach of the institutional duty to stop crossovers because the guards were required to be in particular places during the count procedure. But, as the majority recognizes, the officer who went onto the porch did so only after the dormitory count had cleared \u2014 the actual counting in the dormitory had ended. This fact foils the majority\u2019s attempt to turn the guard\u2019s presence on the porch into an act of negligence based on a claim that the guard should have been elsewhere during the actual conduct of the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Absent testimony that the guard\u2019s presence on the porch violated his duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent inmate cross-overs, appellant\u2019s case must fail on this theory. It is also worth noting that although appellant claimed he was attacked by four to six persons, only one of the two he identified, Pugh, lived in a different wing. Thus, even if the guards negligently permitted Pugh to enter Murphy\u2019s wing, Murphy\u2019s case might still fail in the absence of testimony indicating that Pugh\u2019s participation was essential to the attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b710-14\">. The Statement of the Facts segment of Appellant\u2019s Brief includes a passing reference to the tool control and inventory procedures as the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert is recounted. In the Argument portion of the brief, however, appellant argues only that the count procedure evidence and the evidence that Pugh should not have been housed with the general prison population were sufficient to withstand a judgment n. o. v. This indicates appellant\u2019s view of the weight of his tool control argument, and led the District of Columbia reasonably to believe that Murphy had abandoned this aspect of his argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
