The District Court for the Southern District of New York (William C. Conner, Judge) ruled that the firm must be disqualified. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>conclude that Judge Conner applied the correct standards of law and reached a result well within his discretion, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The appellant, Charles Glueck, formerly employed as an executive of appellee Jonathan Logan, Inc. (\u201cLogan\u201d), brought this suit against Logan, alleging that he was discharged in breach of his employment contract. Logan promptly moved to disqualify Glueck\u2019s law firm, Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim &amp; Ballon (\u201cPhillips Nizer\u201d). The motion was based on the following undisputed facts. Phillips Nizer represents the Apparel Manufacturers Association, Inc. (\u201cthe Association\u201d), a not-for-profit incorporated trade association of dress manufacturers with more than 100 members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole function of the Association is to negotiate multi-employer collective bargaining agreements on behalf of its members with employees represented by the International Ladies Garment Workers\u2019 Union. One of the Association\u2019s members is R &amp; K Originals, a division of Logan. The division\u2019s president, Manny Eagle, is executive vice-president of the Association and a member of the Association\u2019s negotiating committee. Eagle has had occasion to meet with lawyers from Phillips Nizer and discuss labor matters with them. On these facts, Judge Conner granted appellee\u2019s motion to disqualify Phillips Nizer from representing Glueck in his suit against Logan. <em>Glueck v. Jonathan Logan, Inc., </em>512 F.Supp. 223 (S.D.N.Y.1981). From that ruling, Glueck appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Recognizing the serious impact of attorney disqualification on the client\u2019s right to select counsel of his choice, we have indicated that such relief should ordinarily be granted only when a violation of the Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility poses a significant risk of trial taint. <em>Armstrong v. McAlpin, </em>625 F.2d 433, 444-46 (2d Cir. 1980) <em>(en banc), vacated on other grounds and remanded, </em>449 U.S. 1106, 101 S.Ct. 911, 66 L.Ed.2d 835 (1981); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>590 F.2d 1241, 1246 (2d Cir. 1979). That risk is encountered when an attorney represents one client in a suit against another client, in violation of Canon 5, e. <em>g., Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 1384 (2d Cir. 1976), or might benefit a client in a lawsuit by using confidential information about an adverse party obtained through prior representation of that party, in violation of Canon 4, e. <em>g., Ernie Industries, Inc. v. Patentex, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 562 (2d Cir. 1973). Mindful of our standards, the parties have joined issue on whether Logan is a client of Phillips Nizer by virtue of the firm\u2019s representation of the Association. Glueck contends that members of an incorporated trade association are not clients of the association\u2019s lawyer and emphasizes that the retainer agreement between Phillips Nizer and the Association explicitly negates the firm\u2019s representation of the Association\u2019s members. Logan responds that the members of an incorporated association are the clients of the association\u2019s lawyer and argues that Phillips Nizer\u2019s retainer agreement only assures it the right to charge separate fees for legal work done specifically for an Association member.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">We share Judge Conner\u2019s view that the issue is not whether Phillips Nizer\u2019s relationship to Logan is in all respects that of attorney and client,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>exist sufficient aspects of an attorney-client relationship \u201cfor purposes of triggering inquiry into the potential conflict involved in Phillips Nizer\u2019s role as plaintiff\u2019s counsel in this action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 512 F.Supp. at 227. <em>See Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>580 F.2d 1311, 1318-20 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 955, 99 S.Ct. 353, 58 L.Ed.2d 346 (1978). Having concluded that such inquiry should be made, Judge Conner then applied the strict standards that ordinarily prohibit representation of adverse interests, <em>Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., supra, </em>and determined that, in view of the relationship between the subject of Glueck\u2019s lawsuit and the nature of the services rendered by Phillips Nizer to the Association and its members, Phillips Nizer had not demonstrated \u201c \u2018that there will be no actual or <em>apparent </em>conflict in loyalties or diminution in the vigor of [its] representation.\u2019 \u201d 512 F.Supp. at 226, <em>quoting Cinema 5, supra, </em>528 F.2d at 1387 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We reach the same conclusion, but analyze the issue in a slightly different way. We do not believe the strict standards of <em>Cinema 5 </em>are inevitably invoked whenever a law firm brings suit_against a member of an association that the firm represents. If they Twere, rn\u00e1hy lawyers would be needlessly'disqualified because the standards of Canon 5 impose upon counsel who seeks to avoid disqu\u00e1lificatiqira burden so heavy that it will rarely be met. That burden is properly imposed when a lawyer undertakes to represent two adverse parties, both of which are his clients in the traditional sense. But when an adverse party is only a vicarious client by virtue of membership in an association, the risks against which Canon 5 guards will not inevitably arise. A law firm that represents the American Bar Association need not decline to represent a client injured by an automobile driven by a member of the ABA. <em>See Board of Education v. Nyquist, supra. </em>Moreover, if Canon 5 were applicable to all suits against association members, there would be a temptation to water down the strict standards of Canon 5 and find them met more easily than in cases where the adverse parties are really clients of the same lawyer. In this case, Judge Conner, after finding Canon 5 applicable, applied what amounted to a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and concluded that the subject of Glueck\u2019s lawsuit was substantially related to Phillips Nizer\u2019s representation of the Association. However, <em>Cinema 5 </em>explicitly states that \u201cthe \u2018substantial relationship\u2019 test does not set a sufficiently high standard by which the necessity for disqualification [under Canon 5] should be determined.\u201d 528 F.2d at 1387. We think the standards of Canon 5 should be left as strict as <em>Cinema 5 </em>announced them. We also believe those standards should apply to suits against association members only when the risks against which Canon 5 protects are likely to arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">This approach leads us to use the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ing when Canon 5 should be applied to suits brought by an association\u2019s law firm against an association member. Disqualification will ordinarily be required whenever the subject matter of a suit is sufficiently related to the scope of the matters on which a firm represents an association as to create a realistic risk either that the plaintiff will not be represented with vigor or that unfair advantage will be taken of the defendant. Moreover, although our concern is with the risk of tainting a trial, once that risk appears, it is appropriate to assess the risk that prosecution of a plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit by an association\u2019s law firm will inhibit the free flow of information from the defendant to the firm that is necessary for the firm\u2019s proper representation of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Though structured in a slightly different framework,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Conner\u2019s findings fully justify disqualification under the approach we have outlined. Judge Conner relied upon the risk that the issue of whether Logan had cause to terminate Glueck might well arise in the course of collective bargaining discussions conducted by Phillips Nizer for the Association. He also noted the risk that in preparing for collective bargaining sessions, the law firm might learn of Logan\u2019s policies or past practices bearing on the subject of Glueck\u2019s termination. These risks demonstrate the requisite relationship between Glueck\u2019s lawsuit and the subject matter of Phillips Nizer\u2019s representation of the Association. Because of that relationship, the strict standards of <em>Cinema 5 </em>apply,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we agree with Judge Conner that appellant has not sustained the heavy burden of demonstrating that, under those standards, disqualification can be avoided. The entry of an order of disqualification was well within the proper exercise of discretion by the District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cheng v. GAF Corp., </em>631 F.2d 1052 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>vacated on other grounds and remanded, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1338, 67 L.Ed.2d 327 (1981); <em>Hull v. Celanese Corp., </em>513 F.2d 568 (2d Cir. 1975). The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">. The representation has continued since 1936 when partners of Phillips Nizer represented the Association\u2019s predecessor, Popular Priced ' Dress Manufacturers Group, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Az0\">. We continue to believe that orders <em>granting </em>disqualification remain appealable, <em>Armstrong v. McAlpin, </em>625 F.2d 433, 440^1 (2d Cir. 1980) <em>(en banc), vacated on other grounds and remanded, </em>449 U.S. 1106, 101 S.Ct. 911, 66 L.Ed.2d 835 (1981), despite the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit pretermission of decision on that issue, <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 372, 101 S.Ct. 669, 672 n.8, 66 L.Ed.2d_571 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Afu\">. For example, we are not assessing whether statements made by an association member to an assoc\u2019iation s lawyer are protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>See Philadelphia Housing Authority v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>294 F.Supp. 1148, 1149-50 (E.D.Pa.1969); <em>United States v. Ameri</em>can <em>Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>278 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>F.Supp. 608, 614 (W.D.Pa.1967); <em>Schwartz v.

We have previously held the standards of Canon 5 to be applicable even though the interests adverse to those of a law firm\u2019s client are not those of another client in the traditional sense. <em>Fund of Funds, Ltd. v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>567 F.2d 225, 234 (2d Cir. 1977) (client secures disqualification of law firm, which does not represent client, because of firm\u2019s involvement with another firm disqualified for representing interests adverse to the client). <em>See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Walker, </em>382 F.2d 548 (7th Cir. 1967) (law firm obtaining admission from insured in the course of representing insurer against third-party claim should withdraw from further representation in lawsuit between insurer and insured), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1045, 88 S.Ct. 789, 19 L.Ed.2d 837 (1968); <em>see generally Westinghouse Electric Corp. v.

(discussing ethical obligations of a law firm in the absence of \u201cexpress attorney-client relationship\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 955, 99 S.Ct. 353, 58 L.Ed.2d 346 (1978); <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Con<em>flicts of Interest in the Legal Profession, </em>94 Harv.L.Rev. 1244, 1293 n.47, 1321-23 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b805-12\">. The \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test was formulated in <em>T.C. Theatre Corp. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., </em>113 F.Supp. 265 (S.D.N.Y. 1953), to determine whether a lawyer\u2019s suit against a former client would risk violation of what is now Canon 4\u2019s protection of a client\u2019s confidences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b806-5\">. Judge Conner, in effect, used the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test to determine whether Phillips Nizer had met its burden under Canon 5; we use the test to determine whether Canon 5 is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. We reject the appellant\u2019s contention that the result reached by Judge Conner is foreclosed by <em>Board of Education v. Nyquist, supra. </em>That decision concerned a lawyer who represented male teachers in litigation adverse to the interests of female teachers, under circumstances where the lawyer was supplied to the male teachers pursuant to a legal service program supported in part by the union dues of both the male and female teachers. A disqualification order was reversed for lack of any risk that the lawyer\u2019s loyalty to his male clients would be diminished or that he might gain unfair advantage through access to any privileged information from the female teachers. 590 F.2d at 1247.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b806-20\">. We reject, as did Judge Conner, the appellant\u2019s contention that disqualification should not occur because Logan\u2019s division, R &amp; K Originals, is a member of the Association, rather than Logan itself. The risks identified by Judge Conner are sufficient to warrant disqualification even though only Logan\u2019s division is a member of the Association. Nor do we accept the contention that it will be unduly burdensome for law firms that represent trade associations to inform themselves of the corporate identity of those members of an association that are constituent parts of a non-member corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
