(\u201cCompany\u201d) had violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(5), and 8(d)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), 158(a)(5), and 158(d)(3), by unilaterally changing a term and condition of employment covered by a collective bargaining agreement in force between the Company and the Independent Steelworkers\u2019 Alliance (\u201cUnion\u201d). But although this court affirmed the Board\u2019s finding of an unfair labor practice, we found that the Board\u2019s remedial order was too broad. We remanded the case to the Board for issuance of a more limited order. The Board has now issued a new order. The Company challenges the supplemental order as again being too broad. Rejecting the Company\u2019s argument, we order enforcement of the supplemental order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The Company and the Union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which provided, among other things, for a hospital, medical, and surgical benefit program administered by Blue Cross-Blue Shield (\u201cBlue Cross\u201d). The Company, without bargaining with the Union, and in the face of the Union\u2019s refusal to consent, discontinued the Blue Cross plan and implemented a hospital, medical, and surgical benefit program administered by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\u201cMetropolitan\u201d). The Board found that the Company\u2019s switch in health benefit packages amounted to a unilateral modification of a term and condition of employment which violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(5), and 8(d) of the Act. <em>Keystone Steel &amp; Wire, </em>237 NLRB No. 91 (1978). The Board rejected the Company\u2019s argument that the switch in the health insurance plans was \u201cmerely\u201d a switch in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>administrators, and held that the identity of the plan administrator was sufficiently related to the type, quality, and delivery of benefits to employees as to qualify as a mandatory subject of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Board ordered a three-part remedy. First, it ordered the Company to cease and desist from refusing to bargain regarding the administrator of the health care program. Second, the Board ordered the Company to cease and desist from any \u201clike or related\u201d unfair labor practice and from \u201cotherwise refusing to bargain collectively in good faith\u201d with the Union. Third, it ordered the Company to reinstate Blue Cross as the program administrator, if the Union requested such reinstatement, and to post the appropriate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On review by this court, we affirmed the Board\u2019s conclusion that the switch of the health benefits programs is a mandatory subject of bargaining. <em>Keystone Steel &amp; Wire v. NLRB, </em>606 F.2d 171, 179 (7th Cir. 1979) <em>(\u201cKeystone </em>I\u201d). Rejecting the Company\u2019s argument that its action merely changed administrators, not benefits, we concluded that its action not only changed administrators but also \u201cbrought other changes which have a material and significant effect or impact upon the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Among the effects of the program change were the loss of a labor consultant to help with claims problems and the establishment of a lower payment allowance for certain medical or surgical procedures. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we affirmed the Board\u2019s finding of an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We concluded that the Board\u2019s remedy, however, was overly broad and seemed heavy-handed. <em>Id. </em>at 180. Specifically, we rejected a requirement that, upon request, Blue Cross be reinstated as the program administrator, because the parties had conceded that Blue Cross would have been unable to provide the program for all of the Company\u2019s divisions across the country. <em>Id. </em>We thus remanded the case to the Board for a more limited remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Now, the Board has issued a supplemental remedial order having several aspects. <em>Keystone Steel &amp; Wire, </em>248 NLRB No. 40 (1980). First, the Company must restore all benefits and services that were eliminated by the switch to Metropolitan. Second, the Company may not revoke or lessen any benefits currently enjoyed under the Metropolitan plan. Third, the Company must \u201cmake whole\u201d any employees for any losses caused by the switch. Finally, the Company must post the appropriate notices. To implement the requirement that benefits and services be restored, the Board ordered two specific corrective measures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">(a) Utilization of the same geographical areas used by Blue Cross/Blue Shield for determining its usual and customary charges, or, in the alternative, payment of at least the same level of usual and customary benefits as Blue Cross/Blue Shield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">(b) Provision of a \u201clabor consultant\u201d to handle the health insurance claims of unit employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">248 NLRB No. 40 at 4. The Board emphasized that the Company\u2019s restoration obligations were not limited to just these measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The Company now challenges this supplemental order as being too broad; the Board applies for enforcement. We reject the Company\u2019s arguments and enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">We begin with a review of the Board\u2019s power to fashion remedies for violations of the Act. Section 10(c) of the Act empowers the Board, upon finding that an unfair labor practice has been committed, to correct the effects of the unfair labor practice by requiring the violator \u201cto take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies\u201d of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c). The Board\u2019s power to fashion remedies is broad and discretionary, subject to limited judicial review. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 405, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">\u201c[T]he relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>competence .... \u201d .... \u201cIn fashioning remedies to undo the effects of violations of the Act, the Board must draw on enlightenment gained from experience.\u201d .... The Board\u2019s order will not be disturbed \u201cunless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other then those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0AF\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In developing remedies for specific situations, the Board, drawing on its expertise in industrial relations, must attempt to create \u201ca restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained\u201d but for the unfair labor practices. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). The Board\u2019s choice of remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act is \u201cpeculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the Board\u2019s remedies, \u201ccourts must not enter the allowable area of the Board\u2019s discretion and must guard against the danger of sliding unconsciously from the narrow confines of law into the more spacious domain of policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board\u2019s discretion to fashion remedies is not unfettered, however. The Board\u2019s remedies must be \u201ccalculated to effectuate a policy of the Act,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 349, 73 S.Ct. 287, 290, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953), and must not be punitive, <em>Local 60, United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. NLRB, </em>365 U.S. 651, 655, 81 S.Ct. 875, 877, 6 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The first question, then, is whether the supplemental order does effectuate a policy of the Act. A major policy of the Act is to stabilize industrial relations by fostering collective bargaining agreements equally binding employers and unions. <em>See, e. g., Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448,453-54, 77 S.Ct. 912, 916, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957), and <em>H. J. Heinz Co. v. NLRB, </em>311 U.S. 514, 523-26, 61 S.Ct. 320, 324-25, 85 L.Ed. 309 (1941). Industrial stability depends, in part, upon the binding nature of collective bargaining agreements. Both employer and employee acceptance of any given agreement, and indeed, of the very concept of collective bargaining, depend upon a guarantee that their agreement will not be unilaterally altered. Applied to this case, which involves terms and conditions of employment, the policy behind the Act requires that no change in those terms and conditions be made without the express consent of the employees, through their union.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Where, as here, the employees\u2019 expectation for \u201cno change without consent\u201d is defeated by the unilateral action of the employer, the stability of the bargaining relationship is impaired. The likely effect of such instability is to create perceptions of unfairness and of union weakness;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the reaction to these perceptions may be increased militancy and labor unrest. Thus, we conclude that the Board\u2019s remedy here, correcting a unilateral change in a term or condition of employment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is consistent with an important policy behind the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The next question is whether the Board\u2019s supplemental order is punitive or otherwise beyond the scope of the Board\u2019s authority. To determine the propriety of the supplemental order, we must consider it in light of the defect in the original order. In <em>Keystone I, </em>this court found the unilateral change of program administrators to be an unfair labor practice because the Union did not consent to the change. Although the Metropolitan program offered some additional benefits, it also caused the loss of a labor consultant and it provided lower bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fits for some medical procedures. We found the order requiring reinstatement of Blue Cross to be too broad, but suggested that an order requiring the Company to correct detrimental differences would be more appropriate. <em>Keystone I, </em>606 F.2d at 180. The supplemental order complies precisely with our suggestion. The supplemental order no longer requires reinstatement of Blue Cross, but requires the Company to restore all benefits enjoyed by the employees before the change in administrators, including the labor consultant and any health benefits reduced by the change. The supplemental order also directs the company to \u201cmake whole\u201d any employees who sustained any monetary losses as a result of the Company\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Not only is the Board\u2019s supplemental order fully encompassed within the scope of our remand, but it is also consistent with precedent. The Board\u2019s order here is a traditional \u201cmake whole\u201d order which this court and others typically have upheld in unlawful unilateral change cases where the orders provide both for restoration of working conditions or benefits improperly denied and for monetary compensation for any losses sustained. <em>See, e. g., Fibreboard, </em>379 U.S. at 215-17, 85 S.Ct. at 405-06; <em>Davis v. NLRB, </em>617 F.2d 1264, 1273 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>Zim\u2019s Foodiiner, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>495 F.2d 1131, 1144 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 838, 95 S.Ct. 66, 42 L.Ed.2d 65 (1974); <em>Hinson </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>428 F.2d 133, 136-37 (8th Cir. 1970); <em>NLRB v. Scam Instrument Corp., </em>394 F.2d 884, 887 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 980, 89 S.Ct. 449, 21 L.Ed.2d 441 (1968); <em>NLRB v. Central Ill. Public Service Co., </em>324 F.2d 916, 919 (7th Cir. 1963); and <em>Leeds &amp; Northup Co. v. NLRB, </em>391 F.2d 874, 879-80 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Company argues that here the Board is doing more than restoring benefits lost by the Company\u2019s unilateral action. It complains that under the Board\u2019s supplemental order, in situations where the Metropolitan plan offers greater benefits than the Blue Cross plan, the employees must receive the higher Metropolitan benefits and in situations where the Metropolitan plan pays less, the employees must be \u201cmade whole\u201d for any out-of-pocket loss. In other words, the Company complains that the supplemental order causes employees to receive greater benefits than they would have received had the Company not committed the unfair labor practice. This disingenuous argument must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">When the Company unilaterally changed insurance plans, its action resulted in some favorable and some unfavorable changes to the employees. The Board\u2019s policy in cases of combined favorable and unfavorable unilateral changes is to order a return to the status quo ante with regard to the unfavorable changes, but to not penalize employees by ordering revocation of the favorable changes. <em>See Moody Chip Corp., </em>243 NLRB No. 36, 18 (1979); and <em>North American Mfg. Co., </em>224 NLRB 1252, 1260 (1976). We endorse the Board\u2019s policy. In effect, the favorable change becomes the established condition of employment. An employer can change this condition only as it can change any condition \u2014 by giving notice of the proposed change and by successfully bargaining with the union to secure the union\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The Board\u2019s policy is entirely consistent with the purposes of the Act. The refusal to revoke favorable changes simply ensures that, under whatever formula the Company implements to restore the employees\u2019 health benefits, the Company cannot use the Board\u2019s order as a license to abolish or alter any of the favorable changes resulting from its unlawful conduct without fulfilling its statutory duty to bargain. That some employees ultimately may receive greater benefits than they would have received if the Company had not acted illegally is not, therefore, the result of any defect in the Board\u2019s order. Rather, any potential for greater benefits is due entirely to the Company\u2019s unfair labor practice. Thus, the Board is not impermissibly dictating terms of the parties\u2019 contract. It is merely ordering its traditional remedy of a return to the status quo ante, combined with its traditional refusal to penalize employees by revoking benefits conferred as a result of an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"AXP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The Company also argues that, since the original order did not include a monetary \u201cmake whole\u201d provision, the supplemental order\u2019s inclusion of such a remedy necessarily means that it cannot be \u201cmore limited\u201d than the original remedy, as we ordered in <em>Keystone I, </em>606 F.2d at 180. But this argument is also wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Our objection to the original order was that it ordered the Company, upon request by the Union, to reinstate Blue Cross as the program administrator for all of the Company\u2019s divisions, when such reinstatement would have been economically disruptive, if not impossible. That the Board has now issued its traditional \u201cmake whole\u201d order, although it failed to do so in its initial order, does not run afoul of our concern with the initial order. The Company cites no law, and we know of none, limiting the remedies in supplemental orders to those contained in original orders. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Allied Products Corp., </em>629 F.2d 1167, 1173 (6th Cir. 1980) (\u201cAs a consequence of the remand, the Board expanded its make whole remedy to include [persons previously excluded]. We believe that the Board\u2019s expansion of the remedy is consistent with the Act . . . .\u201d). Thus, we conclude that the subsequent addition of the \u201cmake whole\u201d remedy is proper. The Board\u2019s supplemental order does not flout, but is consistent with, our instructions on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Finally, the Company admits that no employees have filed claims or grievances for monetary losses as a result of the change in health care benefits over three years ago. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the Company will suffer any significant loss as a result of the \u201cmake whole\u201d order. But as we have discussed, even if the Company were to suffer a significant loss, we find the \u201cmake whole\u201d order entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The Company\u2019s last arguments are that the Board\u2019s order requiring the Company to ensure that in no circumstances shall benefits be lower than those currently enjoyed will allow windfalls to employees and will create severe administrative burdens. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">First, contrary to the impression the Company attempts to create, in no case will employees receive any benefits above the cost to the employee of the health services provided. A brief examination of the effect of the Board\u2019s supplemental order on a hypothetical medical procedure costing $500 is useful. If the Blue Cross plan allowed a benefit of $500 but the Metropolitan plan allows a benefit of $400, the Company must \u201cmake whole\u201d an employee for the $100 penalty created by the Company\u2019s change. But if the Metropolitan plan allows $600, the employee does not receive an extra $100; the employee only receives reimbursement for the cost of the care. If both plans allow less than $500, the employee must absorb the difference between the cost and the higher amount allowed. Thus, the employee receives the higher amount allowed by either plan, but under no situation does the higher benefit create a windfall for the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Finally, the Company claims that the cost of maintaining two benefit tables \u2014 the Blue Cross table and the Metropolitan table\u2014 must be \u201csevere\u201d. This argument falls of its own weight, for the Company argues at length that the Metropolitan benefits are better than the Blue Cross benefits \u2014 obviously, the Company already has and maintains two benefit tables. In any event, the Company proffers no specific evidence of any administrative burden and its argument amounts to nothing more than mere paper pleading. Furthermore, any administrative inconvenience must be blamed on the Company\u2019s violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">We have carefully considered all of the other arguments of the parties not specifically discussed in this opinion. We find those arguments either wanting merit or insufficiently important to warrant extended discussion; their discussion would not have altered this result. For the foregoing reasons, the Board\u2019s supplemental order is</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. <em>Cf. NLRB v.
