First Nat\u2019l Bank of Commerce, </em>628 F.2d 480 (5 Cir. 1980), we held that the creditor\u2019s right to receive incidental insurance proceeds and returned premiums constitutes a \u201csecurity interest\u201d that must be adequately disclosed pursuant to the Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a) (1976), and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consideration of appellee\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc was deferred pending the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the issue as presented in <em>Valencia v. Anderson Brothers Ford, </em>617 F.2d 1278 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. granted </em>449 U.S. 981, 101 S.Ct. 395, 66 L.Ed.2d 242 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">The Supreme Court has now spoken in disagreement with our conclusion, holding that \u201cthe term \u2018security interest\u2019 as used in both the revised and unr\u00e9vised versions of Regulation Z does not include an interest in unearned insurance premiums in a transaction such as this.\u201d <em>Anderson Brothers Ford v. </em>Valencia,-U.S.-,-, 101 S.Ct. 2266, 2272, 68 L.Ed.2d 783 (1981) (Burger, C. J., and Stewart, Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">In light of this development, we withdraw our initial reversal and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-13\">. Although Judge Anderson agreed that this understanding of the term \u201csecurity interest\u201d was mandated by this Court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Edmondson v. Allen-Russell Ford, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 291, <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 951, 99 S.Ct. 2180, 60 L.Ed.2d 1057 (1979), he dissented in part on the disclosure issue, concluding that the Bank adequately disclosed a security interest in the proceeds of the property insurance. We also held that the district court correctly concluded that certain taxes and fees were properly delineated in the section of the disclosure form entitled \u201cOther Charges.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-31\">. Although the <em>Valencia </em>decision factually deals only with unearned premiums, it is apparent that its force extends to the other incidental insurance rights at issue in our case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
