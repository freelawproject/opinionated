Without issuing summons, the district court dismissed the complaint, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Stanger appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-30\">Dismissal of a complaint \u201cwith prejudice\u201d for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a dismissal of the action and is appealable. <em>See Scott v. Eversole Mortuary, </em>9 Cir., 1975, 522 F.2d 1110, 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-31\">In <em>Potter v. McCall, </em>9 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1087, 1088, we summarized a long line of cases in this circuit holding that a prisoner bringing a civil rights action is entitled, among other things, to have process issued and served, and an opportunity to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>his complaint to overcome any deficiency unless <em>\u201cit clearly appears . . </em>. that the deficiency <em>cannot </em>be overcome by amendment.\u201d (emphasis added) <em>See also Crawford v. Bell, </em>9 Cir., 1979, 599 F.2d 890, 893; <em>Harmon v. Superior Court, </em>9 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 796, 798. Stanger\u2019s complaint alleged systematic harassment and unauthorized surveillance of his business establishment by the Santa Cruz Police, false arrest, and a conspiracy between the Chief of Police and the named members of the Planning Commission and City Council to deprive him of a license to do business without due process and in violation of his right to equal protection. Unlike the complaint in <em>Worley v. California Department of Corrections, </em>9 Cir., 1970, 432 F.2d 769, this complaint alleges, albeit imperfectly, actions which, if proven, could provide some basis for at least some of the claims made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
