One of the companies, Sean Michaels, Inc. (Sean Michaels), markets the \u201cSean Michaels Bust Expander,\u201d an \u201cexercise device designed to improve and enhance the female user\u2019s bust features.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief at 4. The other, Sara Michaels, Inc. (Sara Michaels), markets the \u201cSara Michaels Protein for the Bust,\u201d a \u201cfood supplement designed to improve and enhance the female user\u2019s bust features through the process of excess caloric engorgement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Each of the consent agreements prohibited the respective company from making representations that the Postal Service had determined were false after investigation and hearing. Sean Michaels was precluded from representing that its product (1) would increase the size of the female user\u2019s breasts, (2) would increase, on the average, the female user\u2019s bustline by <em>BVi </em>inches in 14 days or 5 inches in 21 days,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) is a new invention that utilizes a principle called \u201cpectoral isolation\u201d and differs substantially from other so-called bust developers, and (4) would achieve these advertised results if the user exercises three minutes or less per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">The Sara Michaels consent agreement prohibited that company from representing that its product (1) contains a unique combination of amino acids not readily available in an ordinary balanced diet, (2) would increase the female user\u2019s bustline by 3 to 4 inches in 2 to 3 weeks when used in conjunction with the daily, one-minute exercise program, (3) would cause the female user\u2019s breasts to become \u201clarger, firmer and fuller\u201d when used in conjunction with the exercise program, and (4) makes a material and substantial contribution to the claimed benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Both companies modified their advertising after entering into the consent agreements, but the Postal Service believed that the new advertising continued to include the representations proscribed by the agreements. As authorized by the agreements, the Service sought sanctions <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a Postal Service judicial officer. That officer found that both companies had violated their consent agreements and granted the sanctions. The companies filed a complaint in district court to review the administrative decision. The district court granted the Postal Service\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The question before the judicial officer was whether appellants violated the terms of the consent agreements, see <em>American Consumer, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, </em>427 F.Supp. 589, 591 (E.D.Pa.1977), not whether the representations made in the later advertising were false. The district court concluded that the administrative decision was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d App. at 14. We affirm the district court, but wish to make clear that the consent agreements permit the appellants to represent certain things concerning their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">A. <em>Sean Michaels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In its original determination of the falsity of Sean Michaels\u2019 representations, the Postal Service concluded that \u201cthe average female user of [Michaels\u2019] product may experience some increase in roundness, height and firmness of her breasts.\u201d App. at 33. Although Sean Michaels claims that this is the thrust of its new advertising, the judicial officer could have reasonably concluded that statements such as \u201cI really got big in just 14 days,\u201d app. at 66, and \u201cI just know my bustline increased like mad,\u201d <em>id., </em>accompanied by \u201cbefore and after\u201d pictures implying substantial increases in breast size constituted a violation of the consent agreement. Also, an answer attributed to \u201cSean\u201d in the advertisements to the question, \u201cwhy does yours work for me while others didn\u2019t?\u201d \u2014 \u201c[b]ecause it uses a method we call pectoral isolation,\u201d app. at 65-66\u2014 continues to make the prohibited representation that the product \u201cis a new invention that utilizes a principle called \u2018pectoral isolation\u2019 and differs substantially from other so-called bust developers.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Were the breach of the consent agreement supported only by statements from Sean Michaels\u2019 advertising such as \u201cI went from hopeless to fantastic in less than two weeks,\u201d app. at 66, and \u201cI guess you could say with the Sean Michaels Bust Expander it\u2019s what\u2019s up front that counts,\u201d app. at 65, we may have a more difficult case, since no particular increase is mentioned. And, the statement, \u201cMy busts became rounder, firmer, fuller and had more lift,\u201d app. at 66, is probably outside the scope of representations prohibited by the consent agreement. Since the advertisements did contain representations violative of the agreement, however, we decide that the judicial officer\u2019s determination was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">B. <em>Sara Michaels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">We also conclude that the judicial officer did not act arbitrarily or capriciously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>in determining that the Sara Michaels consent agreement was breached. Like the Sean Michaels\u2019 advertisements, the Sara Michaels\u2019 advertisement includes a \u201cbefore and after\u201d picture that implies a significant increase in the size of the breast will result from the use of the product, app. at 261. We might hesitate to find that the accompanying statement, \u201cIn less than 15 days I went from tragic to terrific using the fantastic Sara Michaels Protein for the Bust,\u201d alone violates the consent agreement, but the advertisement also includes the statement, \u201cI felt my breasts becoming firmer, fuller, and they had more lift.\u201d This violates the plain terms of the consent agreement. Furthermore, two paragraphs of the advertisement, which are set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> support the judicial officer\u2019s determination that the new advertisement represents that the product contains a unique combination of amino acids not readily available in the ordinary diet.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Sean Michaels consent agreement permits that company to represent that its product may increase the roundness, height and firmness of a female user\u2019s breast, but not that it will increase the size of the breast or significantly increase the bust in a short period. The Sara Michaels consent agreement permits that company to represent that excess caloric intake can increase the size of the female breast,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that although excess caloric intake can be achieved through the use of Sara Michaels Protein for the Bust, it is in no way uniquely suited for that purpose. It cannot represent that its product will increase the bust significantly in a short period, or that it will cause the user\u2019s breasts to become \u201clarger, firmer and fuller.\u201d Because the advertising of both appellants includes representations prohibited by the consent agreements, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the administrative decision was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-12\">. For the purposes of these cases it is important to distinguish between \u201cbreasts\u201d and \u201cbust\u201d (or \u201cbustline\u201d). The dictionary defines breast as \u201ceither of two protuberant milk-producing glandular organs situated on the front of the chest or thorax in the human female.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 273 (1961). Bust is defined as \u201ca measure around the female body marking the maximum projection of the breasts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">Unfortunately, appellants\u2019 advertising does not always highlight the distinction. As noted by the Postal Service administrative law judge in his Initial Decision on the falsity of Sean Michaels\u2019 representations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-19\">Although the term \u201cbustline\u201d in the context of patterns for female garments means, as established by [Michaels\u2019] evidence, the measurement around the body at the fullest part of the bust, high under the arm and straight across the back.....in the context of [Michaels\u2019] advertisements the term \u201cbust-line\u201d is obviously designed to convey the meaning \u201cbreast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">Appendix (App.) at 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. The sanctions are those permitted by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005, which allows the Postal Service, after finding that a person is conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false representations, to return to sender mail addressed to such person which relates to the scheme or device and to refuse to pay any postal note or money order drawn to the order of the person making false representations if the note or order is connected to the proscribed activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. The judicial officer improperly included in the list of representations in the subsequent advertising which were outlawed by the consent agreement the statement that \u201cthe Sean Michaels Bust Expander has been issued a patent from the U.S. Patent Office.\u201d App. at 186. The Sean Michaels consent agreement stated that the \u201cPostal Service has not disputed the validity of Letters Patent issued by the United States Patent Office for the Sean Michaels device, and nothing herein shall preclude [Sean Michaels] from making a nondeceptive reference to such fact in its advertising.\u201d App. at 54. This does not affect the validity of the judicial officer\u2019s decision since he did list other representations that do offend the consent agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. Major experts report that protein, with the right combination of amino acids that assimilate easily, is important for the development of any part of the body. Further studies indicate that without the right supply of protein the muscles under the busts can actually become smaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The problem with some protein is simply that it tastes awful. Not being one myself that takes too well to anything that tastes bad, I formulated the Protein so that it actually tastes like a milkshake.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">App. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Our list of statements from the Sara Michaels\u2019 and Sean Michaels\u2019 advertisements that breach the consent agreement is not meant to be exhaustive. Likewise, we have not attempted to list all of the statements in the advertising that do not breach the consent agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">. We reject appellants\u2019 contention that the judicial officer could not determine whether the later advertising violated the consent agreements without some evidence of \u201chow and in what manner women concerned with the appearance of their breasts viewed the advertisements.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief at 4. Although \u201c[wjhether [an] advertisement contains a false representation ... is to be determined by its impact upon those to whom it is directed,\u201d <em>N. Van Dyne Advertising Agency, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, </em>371 F.Supp. 1373, 1376 (S.D.N.Y.1974), that does not mean that the administrative agency is not \u201centitled to \u2018draw upon its own experience in order to determine (even) in the absence of consumer testimony, the natural and probable result of the use of advertising expressions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, </em>577 F.2d 653, 659 (9th Cir. 1978) (quoting <em>Carter Products, Inc. v. FTC, </em>268 F.2d 461, 495 (9th Cir. 1959)). Especially here, where the judicial officer was deciding only whether certain advertising violated a consent agreement and not whether it was false, the absence of consumer testimony did not prevent the officer from finding a breach of the consent agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-16\">. The agreement stated that \u201c[njothing herein shall preclude [Michaels] from making truthful representations regarding the effect of excess caloric intake in increasing body dimensions including the size of the female breast.\u201d App. at 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
