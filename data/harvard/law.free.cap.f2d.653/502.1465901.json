Petroleum Corporation $5,993,938.60 as damages for appellant\u2019s breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">On January 21, 1974, U.S.A. Petroleum Corp. (\u201cUSA\u201d) and The Anaconda Company (\u201cAnaconda\u201d) entered into a written contract under which, between January 21, 1974, and June 30, 1979, Anaconda was to sell crude oil to USA and, for each barrel of crude oil it purchased, USA was to sell to Anaconda 30% No. 2 diesel fuel and 15% No. 6 fuel oil. January 21, 1974 Agreement between U.S.A. Petroleum Corp. and The Anaconda Company at H 4 (\u201ccontract\u201d). In September 1974 USA commenced suit, alleging that Anaconda, by its failure to</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">deliver crude oil to USA, had breached the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Involved here are price regulations promulgated by the Federal Energy Office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties agree that the products which USA was to sell to Anaconda were \u201ccovered products,\u201d as defined in the Price Regulations (10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.31 (1980)), until they were decontrolled: No. 2 diesel fuel on July 1, 1976, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.35 (1980), 41 Fed. Reg. 24516, 24518 (June 16, 1976); No. 6 fuel oil on June 1, 1976, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.35 (1980), 41 Fed.Reg. 13896 (April 1, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">As of the time the contract was executed, until March 1976, USA was a \u201creseller-retailer\u201d under \u00a7 212.31.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During that same period the price regulation applicable to USA\u2019s sale to Anaconda of No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil was 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.93(a) (1976), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">A seller may not charge a price for any item subject to this subpart which exceeds the weighted average price at which the item was lawfully priced by the seller in transactions with the class of purchaser concerned on May 15, 1973, plus an amount which reflects, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, increased costs for the item.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">However, because in May 1973 USA was not selling No. 2 diesel fuel or No. 6 fuel oil in the market that Anaconda represented, and had not produced or sold such products during a one-year period preceding the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>it would have sold these products to Anaconda, the \u201cnew item rule\u201d applied:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aje\">A reseller, reseller-retailer or retailer, offering a new item, shall for the purposes of applying the price rule of \u00a7 212.93 determine the May 15, 1973 selling price for that item as the price at which that item is priced in transactions at the nearest comparable outlet on the day when the item is first offered for sale. For purposes of computing the \u2018increased costs,\u2019 the cost of the item first offered for sale shall be used rather than the May 15, 1973 cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.111(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Although the contract was executed after the price regulations were promulgated, it established a pricing formula for the covered products different from that prescribed by the regulations. Thus, paragraph 4(d) of the contract provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">(d) <em>Price and Payment. </em>The basic purchase price for Products shall be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">(i) No. 2 diesel fuel, $9.87 per barrel . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">(ii) No. 6 fuel oil, $8.66 per barrel . . . If at any time or times during the term of this Agreement the Purchase Price of Crude Oil to be paid by USA exceeds five dollars ($5.00) per barrel then the purchase price for each barrel of Products thereafter made available for delivery to Anaconda shall be increased by an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of such excess.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Because this pricing formula could result in prices in excess of maximum lawful prices for the covered products, paragraph 3(e) of the contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">If, because of any rule, regulation or statute of any governmental agency, or because of any other prohibition or restriction, an increase in the purchase price of Products, computed as provided in sub-paragraph 4(d) below, may not be effected, then in such event or events, the total Purchase Price for Crude Oil to be paid by USA pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be reduced by an equal dollar amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_W\">Contract at H 3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">Thus, under paragraph 3(e), Anaconda would have had to sell crude oil to USA at the contract price reduced by a dollar amount equal to the difference between the full contract price for covered products derived from paragraph 4(d) and the price permitted by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">Trial was had on a bifurcated basis in the district court. The liability trial began on March 19, 1980, and concluded on April 16, 1980, when the jury rendered a general verdict in favor of USA on its breach of contract claim, with the court and parties reserving for the subsequent damages trial the issues of whether the contract, its pricing formula, and prices charged thereunder were illegal and the effect of any such illegality. The issues presented \u00f3n this appeal arise out of the damages trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">Anaconda here urges that the district court erred in two respects, first, by refusing to hold the contract illegal on its face, and second, by failing to instruct the jury on the meaning and application of the price regulations and by instructing the jury it was to ignore those regulations in its determination of the amount of USA\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-22\">We find no merit in Anaconda\u2019s claim that the contract was illegal on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>This claim is grounded upon the provision in paragraph 4(d) of the contract that allowed USA to increase the price to Anaconda of the refined products 110% of the amount by which the price Anaconda charged USA for crude oil exceeded $5.00 per barrel. This permitted \u201cpass-through,\u201d the argument goes, is prohibited by the price regulations which allow only a \u201cdollar for dollar pass-through\u201d under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.93(a) (1976), making the price clause unlawful and rendering the contract illegal on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The district court, reading paragraphs 4(d) and 3(e) together, rejected this contention. Reporters\u2019 Transcript at 3388 (\u201cR.T.\u201d). We do as well, but for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Under the regulations addressing new items, USA could have lawfully sold No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil to Anaconda at a maximum price computed as (1) the base price (price at which the item was priced at the nearest comparable outlet on the day when the item was first offered for sale, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(b)(3) (1976)); plus, (2) increased product and nonproduct<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> costs on a dollar for dollar basis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.93(a). Paragraph 4(d) keyed the price of products under the contract to: (1) a \u201cbasic purchase price\u201d for No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil, $9.87 and $8.66 respectively; plus, (2) 110% of any amount by which crude oil sold by Anaconda to USA exceeded five dollars per barrel. The contract\u2019s \u201cbasic purchase price,\u201d however, is not related to the base price of the regulations. Moreover, the increase in the basic purchase price under paragraph 4(d) is keyed to the amount \"by which crude oil exceeded five dollars per barrel and is not referenced to product and nonproduct cost increases. Thus, the aggregate price computed under paragraph 4(d) of the contract would not necessarily exceed the permissible aggregate price computed under the regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Accordingly, we find that the contract was not illegal on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">We now turn to Anaconda\u2019s contention that USA\u2019s damages were computed without regard to the maximum allowable prices permitted under the regulations, and that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the applicable regulations and in instructing the jury that the pricing regulations were not to be considered in determining the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">USA offered three theories of damages at trial, labeling them Case I, Case II and Case III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">Pursuant to each theory, USA assumed that Anaconda would have delivered 2,900 barrels of crude oil per day to USA and that the contract would have lasted five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">Case I assumed that USA would have sold the Anaconda crude at cost to a third party refiner, either Western Crude Oil Company or Husky Oil Company. USA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>would have purchased the products required under the contract from that refiner and then sold those products to Anaconda at a price calculated under paragraph 4(d) of the contract. Under Case I, USA claimed damages of $10,744,445, the difference between the price calculated under paragraph 4(d) and the price at which USA would have purchased the products from Husky or Western Crude.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Case II assumed that USA would have delivered the Anaconda crude to Sunland Refining Corporation (or a similar refinery). After refining the crude, Sunland would have returned 81% of the delivered crude as refined products: USA would have received 28% of the delivered crude as gasoline, 11% as Bunker C fuel, 27% as diesel oil, and 15% as No. 6 fuel oil. USA derived these figures from a contract that it had entered into with Sunland in January 1974 and which had lasted four months. Damages were premised on the lost profits on USA\u2019s lost sales of No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil to Anaconda, and from lost sales of gasoline and Bunker C fuel to third parties. Under Case II USA claimed damages <em>of </em>$12,127,433.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Case III assumed that the Anaconda crude oil would be refined at Sunland until March 1976, and thereafter at USA\u2019s Ventura refinery. USA assumed that products from its refinery would consist of No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil to be sold to Anaconda; No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil to be sold to third parties; and gasoline to be sold to third parties. In calculating lost profits from the lost sales of these refined products, USA based the prices of No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil sold to Anaconda on paragraph 4(d) of the contract, the price of No. 2 diesel fuel and No. 6 fuel oil to be sold to third parties on its historic prices; and the price of gasoline to third parties on its historic gasoline price plus a five-cent-per-gallon retail profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">It is undisputed that all of these calculations were made without regard to what prices were allowable under the price regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Anaconda argues that, while it was permitted to and did offer abundant evidence that a substantial portion of USA\u2019s calculations of damages assumed prices in excess of those allowed by the price regulations, the district court, by rejecting Anaconda\u2019s requested instructions, and in giving its own, effectively took from the jury the question of the extent to which USA\u2019s recovery of damages was to be limited by the pricing regulations, and, in so doing, held that there was no such limitation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Our careful examination of the record supports Anaconda\u2019s claim that it adduced considerable evidence that USA\u2019s calculations of damages under Cases II and III were based upon assumed prices in excess of those allowable under the price regulations. (R.T. 3261-3335; Anaconda Exh. KP). USA, on the other hand, made no effort to demonstrate its prices were within those allowed by law. Conceding here that its computations were made without regard to the price regulations, USA argues that the burden of persuasion on this issue rested upon Anaconda, citing <em>Longview Refining Co. v. Shore, </em>554 F.2d 1006 (Em.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 836, 98 S.Ct. 126, 54 L.Ed.2d 98 (1977), and that, because \u201cAnaconda did not present specific data from which the jury could reasonably calculate whether there would have been any overcharge, Anaconda was not entitled to have the jury consider the \u2018potential\u2019 or \u2018possible\u2019 impact on damages of the price regulations.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The flaw in USA\u2019s position is that the district court did not take the issue of the impact of the regulations upon USA\u2019s damages from the jury because Anaconda had failed to sustain its burden of persuasion; it did so for another reason, because it apparently believed that, as written, the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>permitted USA to assume any price provided it was set in accordance with the application of the prescription of paragraph 4(d). Indeed, at trial USA contended that it need not take the price regulations into account in computing its damages because paragraph 3(e) of the contract \u201ccured\u201d any violation of the regulations. (R.T. 3351-53). Significantly, USA did not urge that the issue be taken from the jury because of a failure of proof on Anaconda\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">After Anaconda was permitted to offer evidence to show that USA\u2019s assumed prices underlying its damage calculations were violative of the price regulations, the district court deprived it of the right to have the jury consider that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">At the close of testimony, the district court, in granting USA\u2019s motion to strike Anaconda\u2019s defense that the contract was illegal on its face, said (R.T. 3388):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">I think that the illegality defense just has to fall. A proper interpretation of 3(e) of that contract seems to dictate that, and I think that I have to rule that as a matter of law that that defense must fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">At a later point in the same colloquy, USA\u2019s counsel attempted to clarify the court\u2019s ruling (R.T. 3411):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Mr. Blecher: It\u2019s my understanding that your Honor had ruled that because of paragraph 3(e) there could be no \u2014 -under this contract \u2014 no price which exceeded the maximum allowable selling price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALR\">The court responded (id.): \u201cYes. That\u2019s the effect of the ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Anaconda had submitted to the court several proposed jury instructions, Instructions 26-37, in support of its illegality-of-contract defense and contained in these were instructions relating to the price regulations. When the illegality-of-contract defense was stricken, Anaconda argued that certain of the instructions remained relevant on the issue of the impact of the regulations upon USA\u2019s damages. (R.T. 3410). The district court nonetheless rejected the instructions. (R.T. 3423). At the same time, the court, rather equivocally, reserved decision on the extent to which it would allow the jury to consider the price regulations in determin-</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">ing damages. This led to the following exchange between Anaconda\u2019s counsel and the court (R.T. 3424):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Mr. Campbell: Well, your Honor, is it clear that when it comes to the question of what is the amount of damage, which I understand is one of the issues, that I am permitted to argue the evidence as to what we say their damage claim amounts to and what the limits of it are and what the testimony was with respect to those issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">The Court: I am going to listen to the arguments you make and attempt to rule, if there are any objections during the course of the argument. I think that each side has a right to present his theory of his case, but there may be some effort on your part to confuse that with the ruling that I made on the 3(e) paragraph of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">USA presented its first argument on summation. Then, during the defendant\u2019s summation, as its counsel was proceeding to argue to the jury that USA\u2019s assumed prices were in excess of those permitted by regulation, he was interrupted by objection from USA, leading to the following discussion (R.T. 3507-10):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-14\">[USA]: This is the exhibit, KB, that shows that we are not entitled to any damages on the diesel fuel and fuel oil sold to Anaconda for the first, I think, nineteen months of the contract on the theory that the price, as they computed it, would have exceeded the maximum allowable selling price, and that, therefore, it may not be considered an item of damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-15\">I believe that part of the argument, or that part of this exhibit contravenes your Honor\u2019s ruling. That is why I am calling it to your Honor\u2019s attention, before Mr. Campbell gets launched into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-17\">[Anaconda]: The problem is, your Hon- or, that Mr. Blecher either intentionally or for the purpose of getting as much mileage as he can confuses two quite different issues. One is: Can an argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ment be made that when prices exceed regulatory limits that the contract is void and unenforceable and that you, therefore, can\u2019t enforce it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">A separate and entirely different issue is: Even if you say that the contract is not illegal, that exceeding regulatory limits does not void the contract, does not make it illegal, there still remains a question. If you were going to make a claim, what is the proper amount that you can claim. That is where I am going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">The Court: I think I have to permit him to argue that, although I feel that if that argument is made it is necessary for me to instruct this jury that I have ruled that the illegality defense has been ruled out as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Thereafter Anaconda was permitted to argue that, in the calculation of damages, the assumed prices could not exceed the maximum prices allowed by the price regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal summation followed. In the course of his argument plaintiff\u2019s counsel, given the preceding intimations of its disposition on the matter by the district court, was able to state that the jurors \u201chave to accept the judge\u2019s determination of the law. and our prices . . . the prices we computed as those we would have charged had the contract been performed simply are not, as a matter of law, illegal.\u201d (R.T. 3549).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Then, just before instructing the jury, the district court said (R.T. 3556):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">Mr. Campbell, I have changed my mind. I am going to give you ten seconds to make the statement that you asked me to let you make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Anaconda\u2019s counsel then told the jury (R.T. 3556-57):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">There apparently is some confusion with respect to the instructions on illegality and I just wanted you folks to understand that. When we went to the bench during the course of my argument, my understanding of what the arguments will be was that whereas we had argued that because the maximum allowable prices were exceeded, that should make the contract void and unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">It is my understanding that the Court will instruct you that as a matter of law the Court doesn\u2019t agree with that. So we abide by that ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-16\">On the other hand, there is a second issue and, that is: Assuming the maximum allowable prices have been exceeded and the question is: What impact does that have on the fact of damage and the amount of damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-17\">So I just wanted you to know that my argument with respect to prices goes not to \u201cillegality or not illegality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-18\">It goes to the question of whether they were damaged at all and, if so, the amount thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Subsequently, in instructing the jury, the district court said (R.T. 3569):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-20\">The defendant has contended that because of certain legal provisions this contract is illegal and cannot be enforced. I have concluded that as q matter of law this contract is not an illegal contract and you are not to consider that defense in determining whether damages are due <em>and, if so, how much, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-21\">Objection was properly taken by Anaconda\u2019s counsel. (R.T. 3574).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-22\">Since the jury at this point was well aware that the \u201cdefense\u201d of contract illegality was based upon a claim that the contract violated price regulations, this instruction could be interpreted only as directing that in determining the amount of damages, if any, the jury was not to consider whether USA\u2019s assumed prices violated the price regulations. This is particularly so when considered with the argument by USA\u2019s counsel, shortly before, that the jury would have to accept, as a matter of law, \u201cour prices\u201d. (R.T. 3549).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We have noted that the district court relied upon paragraph 3(e) of the contract in rejecting Anaconda\u2019s defense of contract illegality. Because it may well be that this provision also may have led the district court to take the issue of the effect of the price regulations upon the quantum of USA\u2019s damages from the jury,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we shall briefly address the question of the consideration that is to be given that paragraph upon retrial of the damages issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Under paragraph 4(d) of the contract, USA was able to charge the base price of the contract for refined products sold to Anaconda and to increase this price by 110% of the amount by which any increase in price of crude oil sold by Anaconda to USA exceeded $5 a barrel. In the event the price of the refined petroleum products sold to Anaconda by USA exceeded the maximum price allowed by the regulations, under paragraph 3(e) of the contract, the price of those products was reduced to comply with the regulations, and the price USA paid Anaconda for the crude was reduced by an equal amount. The intent of this provision is clear: It sought to insure that USA would obtain the contract price for the covered products sold to Anaconda, no matter what limits were imposed by price regulations. Thus, if the contract price for No. 2 diesel fuel was $16.69 (as USA assumed in each of its damage theories for July 1975), while the maximum allowable price permitted by law was only $14.42, the $2.27 difference would be paid by Anaconda to USA in the form of what Anaconda calls here a \u201ckickback,\u201d reflected in the reduction in the price of crude oil sold by Anaconda to USA. Thus, the unlawful portion of the price for the covered products would be paid by Anaconda and USA would make the same profit whether or not the price of the covered products, as computed under paragraph 4(d), exceeded the price regulations. We view this mechanism as impermissible under Section 210.-62(c) of the price regulations, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">Any practice which constitutes a means to obtain a price higher than is permitted by the regulations in this chapter or to impose terms or conditions not customarily imposed upon the sale of an allocated product is a violation of these regulations.

Over the five years covered by Case III, this five cents per gallon retail profit alone constituted a claim in excess of three million dollars. <em>See </em>USA PX 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The district court excluded Anaconda\u2019s evidence that this lost profit claim was based upon gasoline prices which were violative of the price regulations. Seemingly it did so because the Department of Energy was engaged in an audit of USA and had not issued a Notice of Probable Violation in connection with USA\u2019s gasoline sales. (R.T. 3154-62). Aside from the inference to be drawn from such inaction, there was no evidence that USA\u2019s historic gasoline prices were lawful or had been lawfully computed. As we have noted, USA conceded at trial and here that its calculations were without application of the price regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On this appeal USA urges us to sustain the district court\u2019s ruling, not on the ground that there had been issued no Notice of Probable Violation with respect to USA\u2019s historic gasoline prices to third parties, but rather because the probative value of Anaconda\u2019s proffered evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">The district court erred in excluding the tendered evidence. Putting aside the fact that Anaconda\u2019s offer to show that the Department of Energy had not yet completed its audit investigation was rejected by the district court (R.T. 3179-88), the parties may, in private actions under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 Note; and the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751, et seq., prove pricing overcharges even though no Notice of Probable Violation has preceded such action, under Section 210 of the Economic Stabilization Act, incorporated by reference into the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act. <em>Citronelle-Mobile Gathering, Inc. v.

Anaconda\u2019s proposed Instructions 26 and 27, which might have preserved a proper balancing, had of course been rejected by the court. <em>See </em>p. 16 <em>supra. </em>USA itself had proposed a supplemental Instruction No. 5 which addressed the issue of reducing damages if contract prices exceeded maximum allowable prices under the regulations.

USA later withdrew this proposed instruction \u201c[presuming your Honor rules, as I believe you did, that the Section [sic] 3(e) precludes any argument that the price exceeded the maximum allowable selling price.\u201d (R.T. 3421).

(R.T. 3411). It is noted, however, that in presenting its damage theories USA did not offer any evidence reflecting a factual application of this provision of the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\">. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.62(c), promulgated in 39 Fed.Reg. 6530 (Feb. 20, 1974), became effective January 14, 1974. While not promulgated until after the date of contract execution, the legislation expressly applied retroactively to January 14, 1974, seven days prior to contract execution. Such statements of retroactive application of newly promulgated regulations have been held by this court to be valid and enforceable by their terms. <em>See People of the State of California State Lands Commission v. Simon, </em>504 F.2d 430 (Em.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1021, 95 S.Ct. 496, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974). Moreover, USA did not assume a first sale under the contract until July 1974, well after the effective date of the provision. In addition, a similar provision was in effect on the date of the contract execution: 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.81, which became effective January 14, 1974, 39 Fed.Reg. 1924, 1932 (Jan. 15, 1974) but was deleted September 1, 1974, 39 Fed.Reg. 32262, 32283 (Sept. 5, 1974), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">Any practice which circumvents or results in the circumvention of the requirements of any provision of the regulations of this chapter or any order issued pursuant thereto is a violation of the regulations of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b568-4\">. At trial, USA\u2019s counsel raised an objection to the admission of the evidence on Rule 403 grounds (R.T. 3185), and its assertion of prejudice on this appeal complies with Rules 403 and 103 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>See United States v. Long, </em>574 F.2d 761 (3d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>439 U.S. 985, 99 S.Ct. 577, 58 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978).
