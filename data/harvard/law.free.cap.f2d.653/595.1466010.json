PRATT.</p>\n<author id=\"b653-8\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether a restriction in a drilling permit prohibiting summer drilling in the interest of conservation worked a \u201csuspension of operations and production\u201d that would extend the life of an oil and gas lease under section 39 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Effective February 1, 1966, the Secretary of Interior issued oil and gas lease A-063937 to run for an initial \u201cperiod of ten years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Exhibit (App.Ex.) A at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Near the end of the primary lease term, Copper Valley Machine Works, Inc. (Copper Valley), the designated operator of the lease,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asked the Oil and Gas Supervisor of the United States Geological Survey about \u201cextending the 10-year lease term by drilling across the expiration date.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently Copper Valley filed for the Supervisor\u2019s consideration an application for a permit to drill. On January 30, 1976 the drilling permit application was approved,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">subject to conditions attached to the permit and conditions and requirements described below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-19\">10. The approved application and development plan provides for operation <em>during the winter season only, </em>as approved by the appropriate surface managing agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">(App.Ex. F at 2) (emphasis added). This \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction was considered \u201cnecessary because the lease itself was issued without any stipulations for protection of the tundra/perma-frost environment during the months of summer thaw.\u201d (App.Ex. V at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">A. Subsequent History</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">The events that then led to this dispute are described in a memorandum from the Acting Director of the Geological Survey to the Secretary of Interior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-22\">The well was commenced on January 31, 1976 (the expiration date of the primary term), and reached a depth of 100 feet before having to shutdown for the 1976 summer season. Following the summer shutdown from May to November 1976, operations were recommenced on February 5, 1977, and after reaching a depth of 1,070 feet on March 20, 1977, electric logs were run in the well. After evaluating the electric logs and examining the samples, the Supervisor concluded that the operator had satisfied the \u201cdiligent drilling\u201d requirements of 43 CFR 3107.2-3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and recommended to BLM that the lease be extended to January 31, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_pe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>After the 1977 summer shutdown, the Supervisor advised the operator and the lessee that the lease would expire January 31, 1978, absent a well physically and mechanically capable of production in paying quantities by that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">On January 20, 1978, the operator wrote the Supervisor and requested that the lease be extended for twelve (12) months to compensate for the two periods of summer shutdown in 1976 and 1977. The Supervisor considered this letter to be <em>an application to the Secretary </em>for an extension of lease Anchorage 063937 pursuant to 43 CFR 3103.3-8 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Although acknowledging that Copper Valley had been \u201cunable to conduct operations on a full-time basis since January of 1976 by the imposition of the requirement that operations would be permitted only during the winter months,\u201d (App.Ex. V at 4), the Acting Director recommended that no extension of the lease be granted or recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">On May 22, 1978, the Secretary of Interi- or followed the Acting Director\u2019s recommendation, ruling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeV\">the lease is considered to have expired by operation of law as of midnight, January 31,1978, absent the existence of a well on that date which had been determined by the Supervisor as capable of producing in paying quantities. The reasons for the denial [of extension] are that (1) the lessee accepted the imposed restriction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>drilling could be conducted only during the winter season without complaint until 11 days preceding the lease expiration date and (2) the 2-year lease extension earned by drilling across the end of the primary term of January 31,1976, afforded sufficient additional time, despite the restriction, in which to have completed a well that was physically capable of production in paying quantities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av9\">Memorandum from Acting Chief, Conservation Division to Conservation Manager, Western Region (June 14, 1978), <em>reprinted in </em>App.Ex. V at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">B. Decision of the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"ALH\">On July 17, 1978, Copper Valley was advised of the Secretary\u2019s May 22nd action, and on August 18 sought a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to permit another 12 months of operations was unlawful. Copper Valley relied on section 39 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">In the event the Secretary of Interior <em>in the interest of conservation, </em>shall direct . . . <em>the suspension of operations and production </em>under any lease granted under the terms of this Act, any payment of acreage rental or of minimum royalty prescribed by such lease likewise shall be suspended during such period of suspension or operations and productions; <em>and the term of such lease shall be extended by adding any such suspension </em>.. . <em>thereto.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of the Secretary. <em>Copper Valley Machine Works, Inc. v. Andrus, </em>474 F.Supp. 189 (D.D.C.1979). The court reasoned that drilling permit restrictions, which the lessee had agreed to accept in signing the lease, did not amount to a \u201csuspension of operations and production\u201d because Congress meant to apply that phrase only to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYf\">extraordinary situations where the Secretary orders the suspension of drilling to the surprise of the lessee in order to conserve oil and gas or where the lessee requested and the Secretary assented to a suspension. See H.R.Rep. No. [1737, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1932)] and 76 Cong. Rec. 705 (Dec. 19, 1932).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 192. The court also indicated that Copper Valley\u2019s action was untimely inasmuch as the Secretary\u2019s imposition of the \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction in the drilling permit of January 30, 1976 triggered the 90 day period for seeking judicial review of adverse agency action. <em>Id. </em>(citing 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226-2). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">Copper Valley\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the drilling permit\u2019s \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction, by preventing drilling operations for 6 summer months a year, worked a \u201csuspension of operations and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>duction\u201d \u201cin the interest of conservation\u201d and therefore, under \u00a7 209, mandated an automatic extension of the lease for a period equal to the length of the suspension. The Government responds that the drilling restrictions did not create suspensions within the meaning of \u00a7 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">A. \u201cIn the Interest of Conservation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvPP\">We note at the outset that there is no contention that the \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction was not ordered \u201cin the interest of conservation.\u201d The parties agree that carrying on drilling operations during the summer months would have substantially damaged the permafrost character of the leasehold area. Preventing such damage is obviously in the interest of conservation if that term is to receive its ordinary meaning. While the prevention of environmental damage may not have been the \u201cconservation\u201d that Congress principally had in mind in 1933 when it passed \u00a7 209,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> suspending operations to avoid environmental harm is definitely a suspension in the interest of conservation in the ordinary sense of the word.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And there was no indication that Congress intended that \u201cconservation\u201d be given any interpretation other than its ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>B. \u201cSuspension of Operations and Production\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">1. The Secretary\u2019s \u201cSurprise Theory\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The Secretary asserts that \u00a7 209 \u201cwas designed by Congress to cover only unanticipated interruptions of drilling.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 13. Under this view, whether a \u00a7 209 suspension has occurred depends on whether the \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction was a surprise to Copper Valley. It is in this context that the Secretary emphasizes that the lease gave \u201cnotice that drilling activities would be subject to restriction,\u201d that Copper Valley \u201cdid not protest against the restriction until two years after the permit was issued,\u201d and that Copper Valley \u201ccontinued to pay rent during the thaw months without attempting to assert that the drilling permit condition was a surprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find it unnecessary to consider whether summary judgment was appropriate on the question whether Copper Valley could foresee the suspension of drilling, for we reject as unpersuasive the Secretary\u2019s attempt to narrow the scope of the plain terms of \u00a7 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">As indicated in note 6 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 209 was enacted in a period when the Secretary was suspending the drilling operations of oil and gas lessees in order to alleviate the problem of excess petroleum production. The congressional report explained that the bill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">relieve[s] lessees of coal and oil lands from the necessity of paying prescribed annual acreage rental, during periods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>when operations or production is suspended, in the interest of conservation, either by direction or assent of the Secretary of the Interior, and [provides] that the period of such suspension shall be added to the term of the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">The obvious fairness of such a provision would seem to render unnecessary any extended comment in its support. That which can not be productive of any returns to the lessee, by reason of the direction or assent of the lessor, should not be made a liability by requiring the lessee to pay annual acreage rental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">Where, by reason of the positive directions of the Secretary of Interior, or by mutual assent of the Secretary and of the lessee, production is prohibited from the leased area, the suspension period surely should not be counted as a part of the prescribed term. Hence the provision that such suspension period shall be added to the life of the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">H.R.Rep. No. 1737, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. 2-3 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Because some of the oil and gas lessees who benefitted from the lease extensions and rent moratoriums of \u00a7 209 might have been surprised by the petroleum glut and the Secretary\u2019s ensuing suspensions, the Government contends that the section, which by its terms applies to any Secretary-imposed \u201csuspension of operations and production,\u201d actually applies only to those suspensions that are the product of unanticipated events. To state this contention is to suggest its refutation. The plain meaning of a statute cannot be overcome by speculation as to some unstated purpose. Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 209 suggests, much less establishes, the narrow interpretation the Secretary would have us adopt. Rather, the history is consistent with the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201csuspension\u201d in its unqualified sense: \u201cThe very purpose of the bill is to give some equitable consideration to the many leases where the Department of the Interior, by its order, has prohibited production of oil from the leases.\u201d 76 Cong.Rec. 705 (1932) (remarks of Representative Eaton). It was further explained: \u201cIt seems unfair for the Government to order lessees to refrain from production and then collect rent for the non-production period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1881 (1932) (remarks of Representative Eaton). Precisely the same rationale underlay the decision to extend leases for the period of the suspension. H.R. Rep. No. 1737, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1932). There is no indication that Congress thought it desirable or possible to distinguish between lessees who were surprised by suspensions and those who anticipated them. The Secretary\u2019s speculation, suspect on its own terms, has no support in the legislative history and cannot modify the statute\u2019s plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">We thus find it irrelevant, insofar as extension of the lease is concerned, that Copper Valley paid rent without protest during the two year extension of the ten year primary term. By paying rent Copper Valley protected its rights by eliminating the basis for any contention by the Secretary that it was in default. Whether the lease was extended or not, rent would eventually be due for the full two year period. Now Copper Valley has fully satisfied its rent obligation through the extension period it will receive by virtue of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The Secretary also contends that Copper Valley\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209 could double the term of all leases on Alaskan tundra, contrary to the congressional intent that the term of a non-producing non-competitive lease be limited to 10 years, with the possibility of a single 2-year extension. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(e). Contrary to the Secretary, we perceive no conflict between Copper Valley\u2019s reading of \u00a7 209 and a sensible reading of \u00a7 226(e). Without undertaking to decide that issue, which is not before us, we note that \u00a7 226(e) gives the lessee a minimum number of years in which to develop the resources subject to his lease. Section 209, consistent with this policy, extends the life of the lease to the extent that the lessee is deprived of his full term by the Secretary\u2019s suspension of drilling operations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>in the interest of conservation. Far from undermining \u00a7 226(e), \u00a7 209 effectuates the policy it reflects. The law was intended to apply uniformly throughout the United States and give lessees in Alaska the same full term of enjoyment as lessees in the lower 48 states. If climatic conditions in Alaska cause the Secretary to order a suspension in the interest of conservation it is not to be considered as being any the less a suspension because the reason that prompted its imposition was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">2. The Secretary\u2019s discretion not to invoke a suspension</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Secretary argues in the alternative that notwithstanding the terms of \u00a7 209, \u201cthat section gives the Secretary discretion not to invoke a suspension.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 16. It is in this context that the Secretary emphasizes the second reason given for the denial of extension: Copper Valley had had sufficient time to drill several wells in the area under lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">This position rests upon a misconception of Copper Valley\u2019s request for an extension. The Secretary treated the January 20, 1978 letter as an \u201capplication by [a lessee] for relief from the producing requirements or from all operating and producing requirements of [its lease].\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3103.3-8(a), note 4 <em>supra. </em>However, Copper Valley has never applied for relief from any producing requirements within the meaning of the regulation. Although some language in the regulation might be construed to favor the Secretary\u2019s construction, it is clear that the regulation, when read in its entirety, aims at situations where <em>lessees </em>make</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuD\">applications for suspension of operations or production or both . . . pursuant to this section and to terminate suspensions of this kind which have been or may be granted. As to oil and gas leases, no suspension of operations and production will be granted on any lease in the absence of a well capable of production on the leasehold, except where the Secretary directs a suspension in the interest of conservation. Complete information must be furnished showing the necessity of such relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3103.3-8(a). Here, by contrast, the suspension was not applied for and obtained by the lessee but was <em>ordered by the Secretary. </em>This is not a case where the Secretary was asked to invoke a retroactive suspension, but one where he was asked to recognize that a suspension has been invoked by his action. Whatever relevance dilatory drilling may have when the lessee asks for a suspension, it is not a relevant consideration where the suspension has already been directed by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">3. The Secretary\u2019s Prior Decision in <em>Texaco, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Additional support for the conclusion that \u00a7 209 required an extension in this case appears in <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>68 I.D. 195 (1961), a case neither referred to by the Secretary in his decision nor, it appears, brought to the attention of the district court. In <em>Texaco, </em>the lessee was denied an oil drilling permit in order to preserve potash deposits. The Secretary held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1en\">Inasmuch as the record in this case indicates that <em>the refusal to permit drilling on these leases amounted to an order prohibiting all operations thereon </em>and that the order was in the interest of conservation, the appellant\u2019s application for suspension under \u00a7 39 [30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209] may be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 200 (emphasis added). The \u201cwinter season only\u201d restriction involved here was not a total refusal to permit drilling but did amount to a refusal to permit drilling for a six month period each year. Under the rationale of <em>Texaco </em>this restriction must be interpreted as having caused a six month suspension in each year of Copper Valley\u2019s \u201coperations and production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">In this case the district court relied upon a conclusion that all provisions of the drilling permit issued during the primary term of the lease were incorporated into the lease. Assuming this is so, the statute nonetheless mandates that the lease \u201cshall be extended\u201d for the length of the period in which operations and production are suspended in the interest of conservation. The Secretary\u2019s decision in <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>involved a similar lease, states that no distinction is to be made between those cases where the lease expressly provides for the possibility that operations might be curtailed or prohibited and those cases where the lease does not contain such a provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfHr\">[N]o valid reason suggests itself for distinguishing .. . between leases which do and those which do not contain stipulations or provisions restricting or limiting operations and production under designated conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 199. The source of the Secretary\u2019s authority to impose the drilling restrictions, then, is irrelevant for purposes of deciding whether a lease extension is required under</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">\u00a7 209. All that matters is whether these restrictions, admittedly imposed in the interest of conservation, were sufficient under the statute to constitute a \u201csuspension of operations and production.\u201d If they did, the lease must be extended. And <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>holds that withholding permission to drill is a \u00a7 209 \u201csuspension of operations and production.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, under the Secretary\u2019s own precedent, as well as under our independent evaluation of \u00a7 209, the controlling question is answered contrary to the district court decision and under the statute the lease is extended for a period of time equal to the total period of suspension, i. e., 12 months.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>C. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">After ruling against Copper Valley on the merits, the district court indicated that Copper Valley\u2019s action was also time-barred because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">never sought administrative review of this [\u201cwinter-season only\u201d] restriction pursuant to the prescribed procedure in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 290. Such a review procedure has been set up to lead to a final secretarial decision and trigger the ninety-day statutory judicial review procedure set forth in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">474 F.Supp. at 192. Copper Valley, however, was under no obligation to contest the restriction. It does not contest the authority of the Secretary to impose the drilling restriction and is not obligated to contest restrictions it admits are legally authorized. As 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 recognizes, the Secretary had authority to impose such restrictions and the statute provided that in such event \u201cthe term of such lease <em>shall </em>be extended by adding any such suspension period thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Accordingly, since Copper Valley did not (and does not) contest the authority of the Secretary to impose such drilling restrictions, it was not in the position when the restriction was imposed of \u201ccontesting a decision of the Secretary involving an oil or gas lease.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226-2.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, when the permit was granted with the restrictions, Copper Valley was not required to appeal and obtain an agency decision as to the ultimate consequences of the Secretary\u2019s action, if any, on the term of the lease. It could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>assume that the agency would abide by the provisions of the Act and recognize that the suspension of operations extended the lease at the end of the term thereof. Copper Valley is now seeking review of the refusal to grant the automatic extension of the lease which is called for under the statute. It is not appealing the decision of the Secretary to impose the six months drilling restriction but merely seeks recognition of the extension of the lease that such suspension mandates under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The Secretary diverges from the district court\u2019s opinion to suggest that Copper Valley\u2019s action is time-barred for another reason: Copper Valley should have sought review of the Oil and Gas Supervisor\u2019s letter of September 2, 1977, which informed Copper Valley \u201cthat the lease would expire on January 31, 1978, unless production in paying quantities was developed.\u201d App. Ex. R. Whatever may have been the merit of this position had the Secretary relied upon it below, he in fact did not. Instead, the Secretary decided Copper Valley\u2019s administrative request on the merits. Thus, assuming without deciding that the Supervisor\u2019s September 2 letter was a \u201cfinal order or decision\u201d that \u201cadversely affected\u201d Copper Valley, 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 290.2 (1979), the Secretary failed to treat it as such and cannot do so now. An agency that does not raise the issue in an administrative proceeding waives the applicability of a limitation period prescribed by its regulations. <em>Montship Lines, Ltd. v. FMC, </em>295 F.2d 147, 151 (D.C.Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">It remains only to note that the final secretarial decision occurred May 22, 1978, and that Copper Valley received notice of it in mid-July. The declaratory judgment action of August 18 was within the allotted time.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">D. Disposition of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">In this case the Secretary, far from adequately explaining his departure from the precedent of <em>Texaco, </em>has completely ignored it. Affording different treatment to similar situations is the essence of arbitrary action. The Secretary also has arbitrarily ignored the language of \u00a7 209. Ordinarily this agency conduct would call for a remand for proper application of the appropriate legal standards, if the agency under the law could reasonably adhere to the result its challenged decision has reached. <em>See, e. g. Public Service Commission v. FPC, </em>511 F.2d 338, 355 (D.C.Cir.1975). On the undisputed facts here, however, we conclude that no reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 209 can deny Copper Valley the extension it claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the Secretary should be vacated and the district court in accordance with the foregoing opinion should grant the motion of Copper Valley for summary judgment in its favor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">.

The concurring opinion asserts that \u201cconservation\u201d applies only to the conservation of exploitable natural resources such as oil and gas \u201cand not to more general environmental protection measures which may restrict production.\u201d Concurring Opinion (Conc.Op.) at 607. Under this view, the \u201cwinter season only\u201d drilling restrictions could not have been imposed \u201cin the interest of conservation\" within the meaning of \u00a7 209 and therefore no lease extension is warranted, regardless of whether the drilling restrictions effected a \u00a7 209 \u201csuspension of operations and production.\u201d The concurrence makes two contentions in support of this argument that \u201cconservation\u201d should be construed narrowly: (1) the legislative history focuses on the problem of overproduction of oil and gas, and (2) the Secretary of Interior has adopted a narrow construction of \u201cconservation.\u201d Neither contention bears the weight the concurrence would have it hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">First, the legislative history of \u00a7 209 does not act to limit the plain import of \u201cconservation,\u201d which in this century has always included the preservation of natural resources generally. Congress chose a general phrase \u2014 \u201cin the interest of conservation\u201d \u2014 to define the scope of circumstances under which oil and gas lessees would be given relief from government-imposed suspensions of their drilling operations. That the immediate occasion of the congressional action was a series of suspensions imposed in order to save oil and gas cannot be decisive, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">Congress surely may use the lesson of a particular historical period as the catalyst for a law of more general application. For this reason, among others, the rule is well established that construction of a statute begins with its language; indeed, where there is no ambiguity in statutory language, there may be no need to refer to legislative history at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-13\"><em>Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1335 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Accordingly, absent an affirmative showing that Congress did not intend to give \u201cconservation\u201d its ordinary meaning, we should honor the congressional choice of language unless it produces results so unreasonable or arguably unconstitutional that Congress must be presumed to have used the term in a different sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">There is no such affirmative showing in the legislative history here. The concurrence relies on the proposition that the plain meaning of a statutory term can be altered when the statute or its legislative history reveals an intent to adopt the special meaning that the term has within a particular trade or science. Conc.Op. at 608. While acknowledging the obvious validity of this proposition, we question its application here. This is not a case, such as <em>Corning Class Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), in which the term in question was adopted by Congress, at the suggestion of experts within a particular field, in order to refine a statutory definition. See <em>id. </em>at 198-202, 94 S.Ct. at 2229 (where Congress, at suggestion of industrial relations experts, added \u201csimilar working conditions\u201d to make less vague the equal-pay-for-equal-work concept of the Equal Pay Act, \u201cworking conditions\u201d would be given the special meaning the experts gave it). The mere fact that Congress at that time was primarily concerned with \u201cconservation\u201d in the production of oil, see note 6 <em>supra, </em>Conc.Op. at 607 &amp; nn.1-3, does not justify an interpretation that restricts \u201cconservation\u201d solely to oil. <em>See, e. g., Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Nor are the results of applying its ordinary meaning to \u201cconservation\u201d so unreasonable as to compel us to presume that Congress had a crabbed construction in mind. It was the inequity of depriving oil and gas lessees of drilling time without any extension of their leases that moved Congress to enact \u00a7 209, see p. 602 <em>infra, </em>and a suspension to preserve tundra/permafrost environment is as devastating in its effect on an oil and gas lessee as is a suspension merely to save oil and gas. Applying \u201cconservation\u201d to <em>all </em>natural resources advances the policy of \u00a7 209; this interpretation is not unreasonable or arguably unconstitutional and there is no indication Congress would disapprove of the result it produces. <em>Cf. Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 7, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u2019s protection against violations of \u201cthe Constitution <em>and laws\u201d </em>applies to <em>all </em>federal laws even if <em>principal </em>purpose of \u201cand laws\u201d was to include equal rights statutes; \u201cthe legislative history does not demonstrate that the plain meaning was <em>not </em>intended\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The concurrence contends that we owe great deference to the Secretary of Interior\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209. We agree, but consider that it supports our view rather than that of the concurrence. Perhaps the best evidence of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209 as it affects this case is the argument made on his behalf in the district court and here on appeal. This alone refutes any assertion that the Department of Interior has adhere[d] to the [narrow] mineral conservation rationale,\u201d Conc.Op. at 608, for the Department has taken no issue with Copper Valley on the meaning of \u201cin the interest of conservation\"; it instead has argued that the drilling restrictions does constitute a \u00a7 209 suspension. <em>See, e. g., </em>Secretary\u2019s Brief at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Moreover, the authorities cited to show the Secretary adhering to a narrow meaning of \u201cconservation\u201d are not helpful to the concurrence for they do not involve factual situations which squarely presented the issue of whether conservation should be given its plain meaning, or construed narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Far more to the point are departmental interpretations that advocate giving the same plain meaning to \u201cconservation\u201d that we think is appropriate here. Two instances of such interpretations appear in a July 1975 opinion letter prepared by the Assistant Solicitor of the Minerals Division of Energy and Resources, <em>reprinted in </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief appendix C. The letter concludes that <em>suspensions of operations to permit the completion of environmental studies are cognizable under \u00a7 209. </em>As one example of \u00a7 209\u2019s application the letter cites the 1971 suspension on operations and production on 163 federal oil and gas leases in the Ocala National Forest of Florida \u201cfor the express purpose of allowing sufficient time for the Department to determine whether additional terms and conditions should be imposed <em>to prevent damage to the environment </em>within that national forest.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1 (emphasis added). The Assistant Solicitor considered that this suspension in the interest of conserving nonexploitable natural resources was within the scope of \u00a7 209, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">[t]here is no indication in [the section] that a suspension is to be merely for the conservation of the resources subject to the lease or even of the resources subject to the Mineral Leasing Act. Instead the normal reading is that it should be <em>for the conservation of all natural resources.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1-2. (emphasis added) The Assistant Solicitor continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">When Section 39 [codified at 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209] was added to the Mineral Leasing Act in 1933, the long delays for environmental studies which we now experience were not expected but, nevertheless, Congress provided the means by which the Secretary could see to it that, despite the long delays inevitable in the compliance with NEPA procedures, lessees would not lose any of the time to which they are entitled. Congress has determined that the holder of a noncompetitive oil and gas lease should have a full ten years in which to develop the resources subject to his lease. The Congress has also directed the Secretary to engage in lengthy environmental studies. The only way in which these two purposes of Congress can be effectively reconciled is by authorizing suspension and consequent extension. Accordingly, it is my view that the Department ought in all cases, where the preparation of an environmental impact statement or other environmental studies is required, to suspend operations and thus assure the lessee that he will receive an extension comparable to the period during which operations are prohibited and thus not be deprived of any of the development period which the Congress has granted him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">These interpretations, and others (see note 8 infra), are far more relevant to the scope of \u00a7 209 than are departmental statements not directly addressed to the scope of the term \u201cconservation\u201d (see Conc.Op. at 607 &amp; nn. 2-4). These interpretations indicate at the very least the absence of any consistent departmental adherence to an unnaturally narrow view of \u201cconservation\u201d. They confirm rather than refute our impression that \u201cconservation\u201d should be given its ordinary meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b657-15\">. This conclusion is consistent with <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Morton, </em>493 F.2d 141 (9th Cir. 1974). The court in <em>Morton </em>interpreted \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a)(1), a provision similar to 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209. Section 5(a)(1) authorizes the Secretary of Interior to provide, \u201cin the interest of conservation,\u201d for the \u201csuspension of operations or production.\u201d The court rejected the oil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>company\u2019s argument that \u201cinterest of conservation\u201d is confined to conservation of oil and gas, <em>id. </em>at 145, and concluded the Secretary was empowered to suspend drilling operations to prevent undue harm to the marine environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The court noted that the first portion of \u00a7 5(a)(1) mentioned \u201cconservation of natural resources\u201d and reasoned that the later phrase \u201cin the interest of conservation\u201d was a reference back to \u201cnatural resources.\u201d \u201cIts natural meaning,\u201d the court observed, \u201cwould encompass all such resources, not just oil and gas, sulphur and other minerals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 145. (Section 209 also precedes \u201cin the interest of conservation\u201d with \u201cconservation of natural resources,\u201d a phrase Congress added in 1946. 60 Stat. 957. See note 5 <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The <em>Morton </em>court also relied on the legislative history of the OCS Lands Act, as the Concurring Opinion notes, Conc.Op. at 609 n.7, but that reliance was merely supportive of a plain reading of the statute. That similarly affirmative support for a broad reading of \u201cconservation\u201d is absent in the legislative history of \u00a7 209 is no reason to discard a plain reading of the section. Rather, the relevant consideration is that there is no legislative history to <em>contradict </em>a plain reading. Particularly illustrative of this point is the concurrence\u2019s reliance on an Interior Department opinion in claiming that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">the legislative history shows that Congress intended \u201cconservation\u201d to be interpreted far more broadly in the OCS Lands Act than it was in the Mineral Leasing Act. <em>Suspension of Operations on Oil and Gas Leases, </em>78 I.D. 256, 258-60 (1971) (opinion of Interior Dept. Solicitor). Congress used \u201cconservation\u201d differently in \u00a7 209. [Conc.Op. at 609 n.7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1_\">In light of this claim the <em>Suspension </em>opinion itself is worth examining. The issue presented was whether oil drilling operations suspended under the OCS Lands Act for environmental purposes were \u201csuspended in the interest of conservation.\u201d The opinion reasoned in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD2h\">Although the statute authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations for the suspension of operations in the interest of conservation of natural resources the term \u201cconservation\u201d is not defined in the statute, nor is there any explicit definition of the term in the legislative history of the Act. However, conservation is defined in the dictionary as: \u201c1. A conserving, preserving, guarding, or protecting; a keeping in a safe or entire state; preservation. 2. Official care or keeping and supervision, as of a river or forest * * Webster, <em>New International Dictionary </em>(2d ed. 1943). <em>Even if the term </em>\u201cconservation\u201d <em>should be limited to its use in the mining industry, a similarly broad definition would be applicable: </em>\u201cconservation: conserving, preserving, guarding, or protecting; keeping in a safe or entire state; using in an effective manner or holding for necessary uses, as mineral resources.\u201d U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, <em>A Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms </em>(1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYl\">78 I.D. at 258 (emphasis added). Then, like the court in <em>Morton, </em>the Interior opinion also relied on legislative history, but that language simply confirmed that the Act was to be given its plain meaning. The Interior opinion <em>does not </em>contrast the scope of \u201cconservation\u201d under the OCS Land Act with the scope of \u201cconversation\u201d under \u00a7 209. Neither it nor any legislative history shows that Congress intended \u201cconservation\u201d to mean one thing in \u00a7 209 and something else in a later statute whose language and purpose is in many respects the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">. <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>is consistent with past agency practice. In <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em>19 I.B.L.A. 1 (1975), the Interior Board of Land Appeals recounted that a 20-year oil and gas lease issued effective July 20, 1935 had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">limited the [lessees\u2019] drilling rights to the drilling of wells which were \u201cnecessary to offset drainage from the leasehold through wells on adjoining lands unless and until authorized in writing by [the Secretary of Interior] to drill or produce additional wells.\u201d By letter dated October 23, 1941, the Acting Supervisor of the Casper Office, Geological Survey, informed [the lessees] that the drilling restrictions in the original lease would be terminated effective January 20, 1942. <em>Accordingly, pursuant to section 39 of the Act of February 9, 1933, 47 Stat. 798, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 (1970), the original 20-year term of the lease was extended to January 20, 1962.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeW\"><em>Id. </em>at 2 (emphasis added). This indicates that the Secretary has interpreted drilling restrictions as a suspension of operations under the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. Although the concurrence mainly disagrees with our construction of the phrase \u201cin the interest of conservation,\u201d it also denies that \u00a7 209 mandates a lease extension once a suspension in the interest of conservation has occurred. For this proposition the concurrence claims support from 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.21(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u00a7 221.21. <em>Well-spacing and well-casing program, well operations, required offsets, diligence, compensation in lieu of drilling.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">(b) The lessee shall not begin to drill, red-rill, repair, deepen, plug back, shoot, or plug and abandon any well, make water shut-off or formation test, alter the casing or liner, stimulate production by vacuum, acid, gas, air, water injection, or any other method, change the method of recovering production, or use any formation or well for gas storage or water disposal without first notifying the supervisor of his plan and intention and receiving written approval prior to commencing the contemplated work. <em>The approval by the supervisor of a drilling plan does not constitute a determination or opinion that the lessee will be entitled to an extension of his lease under any extension provisions of the public-land or acquired lands mineral leasing laws if he carries out his plan. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">The italicized language was added to the regulation five years after the Department of Interi- or decided <em>Texaco, Inc., supra. </em>31 Fed.Reg. 2614, 6415 (1966). Although the Secretary cites the regulation only as the proximate source of his authority to impose drilling restrictions, the concurrence contends \u201c[t]he regulation precludes the \u00a7 209 automatic extension argument . . . . \u201d Conc.Op. at 608 n.6. The argument apparently is that the 1966 amendment to \u00a7 221.21(b) modified the Department\u2019s recognition in <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>that a refusal to permit drilling amounted to a \u00a7 209 suspension requiring an appropriate extension of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">In our view the italicized portion of \u00a7 221.-21(b) has no application to this case, making the absence of any reliance on it by the Secretary perfectly understandable. The caption of \u00a7 221.21, which remained the same after the 1966 amendment to subsection (b), indicates that its subject matter is the regulation of ongoing drilling operations, not the <em>suspension </em>thereof. The language of \u00a7 221.21(b) confirms this impression. It lists several drilling-related activities, none of which is to be undertaken unless specified in a \u201cdrilling plan\u201d to be approved by the supervisor. There is no mention of the drilling <em>restrictions </em>at issue in <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>The regulation on its face thus serves to warn lessees not to rely on the mere approval of the lessee\u2019s \u201cdrilling plan\u201d as entitling them to any lease extension under the \u201cextension provisions\u201d of the mineral leasing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">The concurrence presumes that \u201cextension provisions\u201d must refer to the lease extension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>provision of \u00a7 209, but we look for a more reasonable subject of the reference in light of \u00a7 221.21(b)\u2019s total lack of concern with drilling <em>suspension. </em>One possible subject of the reference is 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(e), which provides that any lease on which \u201cactual drilling operations were <em>commenced </em>prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time <em>shall be extended </em>for two years . . . . \u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(e). This statutory provision <em>mandates </em>a lease extension whenever \u201cactual drilling operations\u201d are begun and are in process at the end of the primary term. Certainly the Department would want to inform lessees that mere approval of drilling operations would not constitute a \u201ccommencement\u201d of such operations so as to require an extension of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Supporting this interpretation is the language accompanying the promulgation of the 1966 amendment. The Secretary of the Interior stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">The purpose of the amendment is to <em>make it clear </em>that the approval by the Geological Survey of an oil and gas lessee\u2019s <em>plans to drill a well </em>does not constitute a determination or opinion that the lessee will <em>earn </em>an extension of his lease <em>if he carries out his plan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">31 Fed.Reg. 6414-15 (1966) (emphasis added). This amendment was therefore apparently offered as one of clarification as opposed to one in which Department precedent was being overturned. The complete absence of comments, suggestions, or objections to the amendment further supports this view. The regulation would not seem to provide any authority for the Secretary to depart from the interpretations set forth in <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>68 I.D. 194 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">That regulation 221.21(b) was not meant to have any effect on \u00a7 209 is further confirmed by a 1971 opinion of Interior\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s office. The opinion analyzed the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act provisions governing suspensions of operations on oil and gas leases. The Solicitor concluded that the Act granted <em>by implication </em>an extension when the Secretary has directed a suspension of operations. Of more interest to the problem at hand are the observations made by the Solicitor in arriving at this conclusion. In examining the legislative history of the OCS Lands Act, the Solicitor noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-15\">H.R. 5134, the House version [of the OCS Lands Act] ... incorporated nine sections of the Mineral Leasing Act. One of these sections was section 39 of the Mineral Leasing Act, [30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209] which gives the Secretary specific statutory authority to suspend operations and production on oil and gas leases in the interest of conservation and likewise <em>requires the extension of the term of leases which have been suspended. </em>There is no doubt that the House version of the bill as originally presented <em>would have required </em>the Secretary to extend leases on the Outer Continental Shelf which had been suspended in the interest of conservation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">78 I.D. 256, 262 (1971) (emphasis added). The mandatory, self-executing nature of extensions to be granted under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 would therefore appear to be an Interior Department interpretation of long standing, unchanged by the promulgation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.21(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b662-17\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226-2 provides: \u201cNo action contesting a decision of the Secretary involving any oil and gas lease shall be maintained unless such action is commenced or taken within ninety days after the final decision of the Secretary relating to such matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. We cannot join the speculation that ordering a lease extension in this case will \u201ccreate significant new land title difficulties in areas which have been subject to leasing, make new investment in oil exploration substantially more risky and expensive, and shortchange the United States as lessor, by conferring an unbar-gained-for windfall on the holders of existing leases.\u201d Conc.Op. at 609. The Secretary has not acquainted us with these asserted problems. If conditions in Alaska require a special exception from \u00a7 209\u2019s plain meaning and policy then Congress is free to create one. In any event, were speculation within our province, we would venture that assuring oil and gas lessees, through lease extensions, the full exploration period that Congress has given them would <em>promote </em>new investment in oil exploration and benefit the United States. The United States is not shortchanged in the process; it is merely held to the lease terms specified in its statutory bargain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b663-12\">JOHN H.

The history of the 1933 statute shows that the concept of mineral conservation was advanced repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>by the bill\u2019s sponsors and managers, and was agreed to by opponents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Committee Reports on this and closely related suspension legislation reinforce this understanding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was also Congress\u2019s intention when it amended \u00a7 209 in 1946, an intent shown both by the statutory language and by the legislative history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where, as here, Congress incorporates words with a special meaning in the regulated field, and does so to overcome industry objections to the regulatory program, that congressional choice is entitled to special weight. <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 201-02, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2231, 47 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). The majority reads \u201cconservation\u201d in its modern sense, and inadequately weighs the special meaning of the term \u201cconservation\u201d intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The Interior Department, which had authored and advocated the 1933 and 1946 statutes, interpreted \u00a7 209 to apply only to mineral conservation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This example of contemporaneous construction by the responsible cabinet officer is strong evidence of the original meaning, especially where Congress reenacts the statute consistently with that construction. <em>E. g., United States v. Sheffield Board of Commissioners, </em>435 U.S. 110,131, 98 S.Ct. 965, 979, 55 L.Ed. 148 (1978). The Department acted consistently with this interpretation in subsequent administrative adjudication and rulemaking. The decision in <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>68 I.D. 194 (1961), relies strongly on this mineral conservation rationale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later rulemaking sharply restricted the grant of lease extensions based on drilling permit restrictions imposed for reasons other than mineral conservation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is precisely the sort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>argument Copper Valley advances here, since it contends that the Department\u2019s imposition of winter-only drilling restrictions in the drilling permit operated automatically to extend the lease by the same amount of time drilling was forbidden. The Department\u2019s adherence to the mineral conservation rationale is entitled to respect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>E. g., California v. United States, </em>438 U.S. 645, 675-76 n. 30, 98 S.Ct. 2985, 3001 n. 30, 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">I think a remand appropriate however, for the Secretary and his subordinates relied on legally irrelevant grounds to deny the extension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court should return the case to the Secretary and require him to decide explicitly whether winter-only drilling restrictions are \u201csuspensions\u201d under \u00a7 209, and to state the policy and legal reasons for his choice among plausible interpretations of \u00a7 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">There are sound practical and legal reasons for this approach. We know little more about Alaskan drilling than the fact that it is expensive and difficult. By pronouncing a rule at sharp variance with present practice in Alaska, we may create significant new land title difficulties in areas which have been subject to leasing, make new investment in oil exploration substantially more risky and expensive, and shortchange the United States as lessor, by conferring an unbargained-for windfall on the holders of existing leases. These are cogent reasons for seeking a careful exercise of the Secretary\u2019s expert judgment before deciding the interpretive issue presented here. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-18, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>McLaren v. Fleischer, </em>256 U.S. 477, 481, 41 S.Ct. 577, 578, 65 L.Ed. 1052 (1921). By pronouncing a flat rule before the Secretary has acted, we may significantly impede Alaskan oil development vital to meeting the Nation\u2019s current and future energy needs. I doubt Congress intended that result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-4\">. 78 Cong.Rec. 15363-65 (1932) (remarks of Rep.

The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Gulf Oil v. Morton, </em>493 F.2d 141 (9th Cir. 1974), is misplaced. That decision allowed suspensions under \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a)(1) (1976 ed.), to prevent oil well blowouts in the Santa Barbara channel. That interpretation of the OCS Lands Act is neither controlling nor persuasive on the Mineral Leasing Act extension question here. The language of \u00a7 5(a)(1) differs greatly from \u00a7 209 of the Mineral Leasing Act. Moreover, the court found that the Submerged Lands Act\u2019s broad statutory definition of conservation, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(e) (1976 ed.), was incorporated into the OCS Lands Act. <em>Gulf Oil v. Morton, supra, </em>at 145. That definition includes plant and fish life, as well as mineral conservation. <em>Id. </em>The Mineral Leasing Act incorporates no such definition. Finally, the legislative history shows that Congress intended \u201cconservation\u201d to be interpreted far more broadly in the OCS Lands Act than it was in the Mineral Leasing Act. Suspension of Operations on Oil and Gas Leases, 78 I.D. 256, 258-60 (1971) (Opinion of Interior Dept. Solicitor).

The Secretary\u2019s statute of limitations argument assumes that Copper Valley was not entitled to a mandatory extension under \u00a7 209, and so assumed his conclusion to the issue in dispute here. The Secretary\u2019s argument concerning his discretion to deny a permit to a dilatory driller ignores the mandatory language of the statute. Moreover, in 1935, when Congress abolished the system of prospecting permits and replaced it with noncompetitive leases, like the one involved here, it made previously discretionary extensions for holders of prospecting permits mandatory for the leaseholders.
