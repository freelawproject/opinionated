Local Rule 8(f) provides that unpublished opinions may not be cited in briefs or memoranda as precedents. The District asserts that our decision should not be published and become precedent because \u201cit resolves an important question concerning which there is disagreement in this Circuit, but which was not briefed in this case\u201d \u2014whether, punitive damages may be received in actions brought to redress deprivations of constitutional rights. We do not view our decision as resolving this issue and therefore deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-25\">In his separate opinion in <em>Payne v. District of Columbia, </em>559 F.2d 809, 827 (D.C. Cir.1977), Judge Tamm noted the apparent conflict in this Circuit\u2019s expressions on the availability of punitive damages in constitutional tort actions.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Our <em>per curiam </em>opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ion here states no more than our inability to agree that \u201cto a legal certainty\u201d the assault claim based on defendant Finkelberg\u2019s conduct must fail on amount-in-controversy grounds. The very disagreement to which movant refers indicates the uncertainty. <em>Cf. Columbia Pictures Corp. v. Grengs, 257 </em>F.2d 45, 47 (7th Cir. 1958); <em>Calhoun v. Kentucky-West Virginia Gas Co., </em>166 F.2d 530 (6th Cir. 1948). We therefore do not regard our reference to \u201cthe possibility of exemplary damages\u201d as resolving that such damages may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The District further asserts that in no event could punitive damages be claimed in this case because the officers\u2019 conduct was not intentional. Movant has confused the Fourth Amendment claim pressed by the Loves, as to which no amount-in-controversy issue was presented on appeal, with the assault charge asserted against defendant Finkelberg, and alleged to deprive Pearl Love of her Fifth Amendment rights. We cannot characterize an assault charge as a claim based on carelessness or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-15\"> <em>Compare Hartigh v.
