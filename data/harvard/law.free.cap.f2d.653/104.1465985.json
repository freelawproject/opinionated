(1980) (Regulation Z). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-19\">In April 1979, John and Bridget Henning purchased a mobile home from Colonial Sales and Service, Inc. (Colonial); James Daniels negotiated the transaction with the Hennings in his capacity as Colonial\u2019s president. In connection with the sale, the Hennings signed a \u201cCustomer\u2019s Order and Contract to Purchase\u201d (Customer\u2019s Order) and executed a \u201cSecurity Agreement\u201d for financing both the home and comprehensive fire and theft insurance. In October 1979, the Hennings filed this action, alleging that certain provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z had been violated in the course of the mobile home sales transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-20\">The Hennings, in their original complaint, specifically alleged two violations of the Act: the absence of a subsection \u201c(b)\u201d under numeral \u201c4\u201d in the Security Agreement and Daniels\u2019 failure to check the appropriate box on the Security Agreement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>comprehensive insurance coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They later amended their complaint to allege in the alternative that various errors in the Customer\u2019s Order constituted violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Certain disclosures that must be made in connection with consumer credit sales not under open end credit plans are enumerated in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(l)-(3), (5)-(10). Section 1638(a)(4) additionally requires the disclosure of \u201c[a]ll other charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount of the credit extended but which are not part of the finance charge.\u201d The disclosures required by this section \u201cshall be made before the credit is extended, and may be made by disclosing the information in the contract or other evidence of indebtedness to be signed by the purchaser.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(b). A creditor who violates the disclosure provisions of the Act is liable for twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction (between the limits of $100 and $1000) as well as for court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a). A creditor may successfully defend a suit under the Act, however, if he \u201cshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">A. <em>The disclosure document</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">Although the Hennings contend that the Customer\u2019s Order rather than the Security Agreement was the document on which the required disclosures should have been made, we disagree. The Customer\u2019s Order was used as Colonial\u2019s financing document prior to passage of the Act, and Daniels testified that at the time of this transaction it was used only as a worksheet: figures and information were first entered on the Customer\u2019s Order and then transferred to the Security Agreement. Daniels testified that the two documents were executed simultaneously, that the Security Agreement was the operative financing document, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>had the Hennings failed to execute the Security Agreement, he would have considered the entire transaction cancelled. He further testified that he explained to the Hennings that the Security Agreement was the contract for the extension of credit and that he went over it with them, explaining the data it contained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The Act requires that all disclosures be made prior to the extension of credit and we find that the extension of credit in this case took place upon the execution of the Security Agreement; hence, we look at the errors alleged in that document, rather than those in the Customer\u2019s Order, to determine whether Colonial violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">B. <em>The alleged violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We turn next to the Hennings\u2019 contentions that the omissions on the Security Agreement constituted violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">With respect to the omission of the lower case letter indicating \u201c(b),\u201d we find that no violation occurred. We agree with the district court that, despite the omission, the required disclosures were made \u201cclearly, conspicuously [and] in meaningful sequence.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">With respect to Daniels\u2019 failure to check the appropriate insurance box even though he filled in the correct financial information, we can assume without deciding that this was a technical violation. We do so because we find that Colonial is in this regard entitled to the bona fide error defense of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c). Daniels testified that his failure to check the box was an oversight on his part, although he followed his normal practice of proofreading the Security Agreement prior to its execution. Without commenting on whether this procedure would suffice under other circumstances to afford the bona fide error defense, we find that Daniels\u2019 procedure of proofreading the Security Agreement was one \u201creasonably adapted to avoid\u201d the sort of error with which we are here concerned. <em>See, e. g., Thomka v. A.Z. Chevrolet, Inc., </em>619 F.2d 246, 250-51 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Gallegos v. Stokes, </em>593 F.2d 372, 376 (10th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s entry of judgment against the Hennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">.
