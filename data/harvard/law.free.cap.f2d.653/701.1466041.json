CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The district court proceeding from which this appeal is taken was instituted by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) with the object of overturning a decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) striking from the files, on grounds of \u201cfraud,\u201d DEC\u2019s application for reissue of a patent. Computer Operations, Inc. (COI), DEC\u2019s adversary in ongoing patent infringement litigation, intervened as a defendant. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found for the PTO and COI, and DEC now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Central to the appeal is a question of first impression: whether the PTO is authorized to strike reissue applications on the basis of the \u201cpatent law fraud\u201d criteria reflected in the Commissioner\u2019s Rule 56, or whether Rule 56 is supplanted as regards reissue applications by a narrower \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d standard found in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">The dispute revolves around U.S. Patent No. 3,387,293, which teaches a control format relating to a magnetic-tape data storage and retrieval system for small computers. Issued in 1968 to Thomas C. Stoekebrand, a DEC employee, the patent was assigned by him to DEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">Stoekebrand joined DEC in the fall of 1962 and shortly thereafter became involved with a DEC project to develop and commercialize an existing system known as \u201cLINC tape.\u201d Stoekebrand had participated in the development of the LINC tape system as an employee of MIT Lincoln Laboratories, Bedford, Massachusetts. During the course of the DEC development program, Stoekebrand improved upon the LINC tape format, eventually producing a system that could read and write on tape moving in either direction; it is this \u201cbidirectional capability\u201d which, according to DEC, provided the basis for Stockebrand\u2019s patentable claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DEC has marketed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Stockebrand system under the names \u201cDEC tape\u201d and \u201cMicro tape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In March 1963, DEC prepared an advertisement for the system modelled on LINC tape which it planned to market \u2014 the \u201cMicro Tape Control Type 550,\u201d which could be used in conjunction with up to eight \u201cMicro Tape Transports Type 555.\u201d In May 1963, after DEC\u2019s development program had progressed further, DEC prepared a new advertising brochure to promote a \u201cType 550 Control\u201d with bidirectional capability, to be used with up to four \u201cType 555 Dual Tape Transports.\u201d This brochure described in some detail elements of the system disclosed in the Stockebrand patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On May 15, 1963, DEC entered into an agreement to lease computer equipment, including two Micro Tape Controls and six Micro Tape Transports (to be used together as a system), to Kie Data Corp. However, when this lease commenced in July 1963, these units were still in process of being developed. As a result, DEC loaned Kie Data several conventional \u201cPotter units\u201d to be used in lieu of the DEC tape system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between June 1963 and August 1963, DEC also accepted three other orders for DEC tape devices; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> two of the orders called for delivery on August 15, 1963 (DEC maintains this was the date set for \u201cearliest possible\u201d delivery) and the third set a delivery date of November 1,1963. The delivery dates were not met, however. All three orders were listed as \u201coverdue\u201d in DEC memoranda of January 25 and 28,1964, and the first of the three deliveries appears to have occurred on February 14, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>During the summer and fall of 1963, Stockebrand worked to perfect the DEC tape system. Sometime in the fall of 1963, a DEC tape system was delivered to Kie Data; the exact date of delivery is not known, but the PTO found on the basis of the evidence before it (including entries in Stockebrand\u2019s notebook) that the system was delivered prior to November 1963. According to Stockebrand, the system delivered was his \u201cbreadboard model,\u201d the \u201cprototype\u201d on which he had been running tests. The system suffered various breakdowns and disappointments in performance, and Stockebrand spent much of his time from November 1963 through January 1964 working on the system at Kie Data\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">As early as February 1964, Stockebrand conferred by telephone with Hugo Liepmann, DEC\u2019s patent counsel, concerning the DEC tape invention. He did not, however, at this time or later inform Liepmann of the delivery of the system to Kie Data or of the other orders for DEC tape systems accepted in the summer of 1963. Liepmann and Stockebrand first met on November 5, 1964, four days before the application for patent was filed, at which time they reviewed the application and discussed, inter alia, the preexisting LINC tape system. The application was then dated November 6, 1964 and was filed on November 9, 1964.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The application did not refer to LINC tape by name (although it contained what DEC characterizes as a description of prior art, which discloses certain features of the LINC tape system), nor did it mention the Kie Data delivery or other early commercial activity relating to DEC tape. (Although at least two other DEC employees who assisted in preparation of the patent application were aware that a system had been delivered to Kie Data, this fact was never disclosed to Liepmann or to his successor patent counsel, O\u2019Donnell). As part of the application, Stockebrand signed an oath stating, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">I do not know and do not believe that this invention was ever known or used before my invention or discovery thereof, or ... in public use or on sale in the United States more than one year prior to this application....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Stockebrand restated the above in a \u201csupplemental declaration\u201d filed prior to issuance of the patent. On June 4, 1968, the PTO issued the patent to Stockebrand, and the patent became the property of the assignee, DEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In 1973, DEC learned that COI was marketing a tape system with an option that could read and write DEC tape. Following an exchange of correspondence between DEC and COI on the subject of possible infringement, on July 2,1974 COI instituted an action against DEC, asserting antitrust claims and seeking a declaratory judgment of the invalidity and non-infringement of the Stockebrand patent (hereinafter, \u201cinfringement action\u201d). COI raised issues relating to possible prior art and \u201con sale\u201d bars to the patentability of DEC tape. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 &amp; 103. To bolster its position in the infringement action, on February 3, 1975 DEC filed an application to reissue the patent pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7251; it sought both to amend certain claims that \u201cmight be subject to a construction which covers more than the applicant is claiming as his invention,\" and to disclose to the PTO for the first time information re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>lating to the Kie Data delivery and the LINC tape system, said to have been \u201cdiscovered\u201d in the course of investigating COI\u2019s charges in the infringement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Having been invited by DEC to participate in the reissue proceedings, COI petitioned the PTO to \u201cstrike\u201d the reissue application on grounds of \u201cfraud,\u201d pursuant to PTO Rule 56 (37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56). After further correspondence with DEC and COI, and following receipt of DEC\u2019S responses to two \u201cRequirements for Information,\u201d on November 3,1976 the PTO issued an \u201cOrder to Show Cause\u201d why COI\u2019s petition should not be granted. The Order set forth 13 \u201cgrounds\u201d establishing a \u201cprima facie case of fraud\u201d: seven grounds related to the undisclosed commercial activity and to Stockebrand\u2019s declaration that the invention had not been \u201con sale\u201d in the United States more than one year prior to the date of application (j. e., prior to November 9, 1963, the \u201ccritical date\u201d); three grounds related to the undisclosed advertising materials prepared in the spring of 1963, which were said to be \u201c \u2018prima facie\u2019 available as prior art against the application\u201d; two grounds related to the inadequate disclosure of LINC tape, the \u201cclosest prior art of which [Stockebrand and DEC] were aware\u201d; and one ground concerned the \u201cmischaracterization\u201d of the circumstances leading to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d and subsequent disclosure of the above information.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Following COI\u2019s submission of comments on the Order to Show Cause, on March 2, 1977 DEC filed its response to the Order, which was accompanied by five affidavits, including Stockebrand\u2019s. On April 4, 1978, the PTO issued a decision striking the reissue application under Rule 56, finding that nine of the thirteen grounds of fraud had been established by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d The decision was signed by the Assistant Commissioner for Patents. DEC then brought this suit in the district court, and, as already noted, the district court refused to set aside the PTO action.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On appeal, DEC makes essentially two arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">(1) The PTO proceeded in excess of its statutory authority in striking the reissue application on grounds of fraud; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">(2) The finding that \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of fraud had been presented was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">We examine each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">\n<em>The PTO\u2019s Authority to Strike the Reissue Application Under Rule 56</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Reissue of patents is expressly authorized in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. This statute, which establishes a corrective mechanism for defective patents, creates one of the few avenues for PTO reexamination of an already issued patent. Section 251 provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-14\">Whenever any patent is, through error without any deceptive intention, deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective specification or drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent, the Commissioner shall . . . reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original patent . .. for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-16\">The provisions of this title relating to applications for patent shall be applicable to applications for reissue of a patent. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">The PTO\u2019s striking of DEC\u2019s reissue application was not based on any purported failure to meet the express requirements of section 251, but rather was based on findings of \u201cfraud\u201d made pursuant to the PTO\u2019s Rule 56 (37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56). Rule 56 had been revised as of March 1, 1977, and thus the version in effect when the PTO handed down its decision was different from the version in effect both when the Stockebrand patent was issued in 1968 and when DEC applied for reissue in 1975. Nevertheless, the PTO stated in its decision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>It is considered clear that the striking of this reissue application is necessary, whether considered under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56 as it existed before March 1, 1977, or as it exists at present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The pre-1977 version of Rule 56, in effect since 1949,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided, in pertinent part, simply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">[A]ny application fraudulently filed or in connection with which any fraud is practiced on the Patent and Trademark Office, may be stricken from the files.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">As amended in 1977, the current version of the Rule begins by reciting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">A duty of candor and good faith toward the Patent and Trademark Office rests on the inventor, on each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the application and on every other individual who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor, with the assignee or with anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application. All such individuals have a duty to disclose to the Office information they are aware of which is material to the examination of the application. Such information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Section (d) of the Rule goes on to state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU4\">An application shall be stricken from the files if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that any fraud was practiced or attempted on the Office in connection with it or that there was any violation of the duty of disclosure through bad faith or gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARt\">Notwithstanding the difference in language between the earlier and later rules, there appears to be no dispute that the words \u201cfraudulently\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d in the pre-1977 version of Rule 56 should be read in light of the gloss placed on those words in patent infringement actions: <em>viz., </em>they encompass \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d as well as intentional misconduct, <em>see infra. </em>In this respect, the later version merely makes explicit a standard already implicit in the earlier version.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">DEC challenges the PTO\u2019s use of Rule 56 to strike its reissue application on two grounds. First, DEC argues that the reissue statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251, overrides Rule 56, and requires the PTO to reissue a patent unless there is a showing of \u201cdeceptive intention.\u201d \u201cDeceptive intention,\u201d DEC insists, is a far more restrictive term than \u201cgross negligence\u201d or even \u201cfraud\u201d as understood in patent law. Second, DEC maintains that for the PTO to \u201cstrike\u201d a reissue application, as opposed to \u201crejecting\u201d the reissue claims as would be required were it to find \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d within the meaning of section 251, frustrates the statutorily provided mechanism for review of PTO decisions (including the applicant\u2019s right to institute a civil action in the district court following an adverse decision by the Board of Appeals), which is triggered only by PTO <em>rejections. </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 134, 141 &amp; 145. This \u201cshort-circuiting\u201d of the normal review procedures is said to be especially egregious in cases such as this one where a dispute involving the \u201cstate of mind\u201d of various individuals has been resolved on the basis of a paper record without benefit of demeanor evidence, and is now subject only to limited judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 &amp; 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">A. <em>Validity of Rule 56 as an Exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s Rulemaking Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Rule 56 was promulgated by the Commissioner pursuant to the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>granted by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6, \u201cto establish regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of proceedings\u201d in the PTO. In 1970, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held, in reviewing a denial of a motion to strike an original patent application, that Rule 56 was a proper exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s rulemaking authority, and that the Commissioner was empowered thereunder to strike patent applications for \u201cfraud,\u201d as broadly defined in the patent field. <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d 779, 793, 57 CCPA 1384 (1970). We think there can be no serious doubt, certainly not at this late date, that Rule 56 constitutes in general a valid exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s rulemaking powers under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6, and therefore has the force and effect of law except as it may conflict with other statutory or constitutional provisions. The chief question here is whether, as DEC insists, Rule 56 is \u201cinconsistent with law\u201d insofar as the Commissioner now seeks to apply it not only to original applications but to <em>reissue </em>applications. DEC argues that section 251 establishes a statutory standard which conflicts with and therefore necessarily displaces the broader standard of \u201cfraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Before turning to this question, it is useful to consider first the genesis and purpose of the concept of \u201cfraud on the Patent Office,\u201d which Rule 56 embodies. Only through understanding the nature of this rather unique concept is it possible to form a complete judgment as to the relationship between Rule 56 and section 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The term \u201cfraud\u201d does not appear in Title 35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is a term that has frequently been invoked by courts and litigants in patent cases, however, often with different shades of meaning in each context in which it is employed. <em>Compare Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>382 U.S. 172, 86 S.Ct. 347, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965) (patents \u201cprocured by intentional fraud\u201d may give rise to antitrust claims) <em>with Monolith Portland Midwest Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>407 F.2d 288 (9th Cir. 1969) (award of attorneys\u2019 fees may be entered against party who obtained patent by fraud, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, authorizing such awards in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d) <em>with Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. Chemtronics, Inc., </em>428 F.2d 555 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 956, 91 S.Ct. 353, 27 L.Ed.2d 264 (1970) (patent invalid because procured by fraud). <em>See generally Transitron Electronics Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>649 F.2d 871 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The concept of \u201cfraud on the Patent Office,\u201d as something distinct from common law fraud or deceit, derives primarily from judicial opinions in infringement actions, holding patents \u201cunenforceable\u201d on equitable grounds. A seminal case in this area was <em>Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., </em>324 U.S. 806, 65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed. 1381 (1945). The Court there refused to enforce a patent on behalf of a patentee which had failed to disclose its knowledge that another party to an interference proceeding involving the patent had committed perjury. Finding that, in withholding this information from the Patent Office, the patentee \u201cha[d] not displayed that standard of conduct requisite to the maintenance of [a] suit in equity,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 819, 65 S.Ct. at 999, the Court disposed of the infringement action under the equitable doctrine of \u201cunclean hands.\u201d In reaching this decision, the Court emphasized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. . . . [A] patent is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the right to access to a free and open market. The far-reaching social and economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give the public a paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and that such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>Id., </em>at 816, 65 S.Ct. at 998. Thus, the patentee\u2019s willful concealment of fraudulent conduct, committed in connection with a patent application, justified dismissal of the action for \u201cwant of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Drawing on <em>Precision Instrument, </em>courts have expanded the concept of disabling \u201cpatent fraud\u201d beyond the classical definition of fraud to include \u201ca wide range of \u2018inequitable\u2019 conduct found to justify holding a patent unenforceable.\u201d <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d 779, 793, 57 CCPA 1384 (1970). The less stringent standard necessary to show \u201cfraud\u201d as a defense to an infringement action has been characterized primarily by a relaxation of the traditional requirement of \u201cscienter.\u201d It is not necessary to a demonstration of \u201cfraud on the Patent Office,\u201d as it would have been to a demonstration of common law, fraud, to show that a misrepresentation or omission was intentionally made with a particular deceptive purpose in mind. <em>Compare </em>W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>700-04 (4th ed. 1971). Culpability, however, remains an element of \u201cfraud,\u201d even in the patent law context. <em>See Carpet Seaming Tape Licensing Corp. v. Best Seam Inc., </em>616 F.2d 1133, 1138-40 (9th Cir. 1980). While this court \u201chas not defined the exact standard of wrongful conduct that would disable an otherwise valid patent from enforcement,\u201d we have noted that \u201ccourts considering allegations of fraud in procurement of a patent have held that some element of wrongful conduct \u2014 intentional misrepresentation or inequitable, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct \u2014 is a necessary predicate to rendering a patent unenforceable in the courts.\u201d <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. v. Raychem Corp., </em>538 F.2d 453, 461 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 886, 97 S.Ct. 238, 50 L.Ed.2d 167 (1976). <em>See also Carter-Wallace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Davis-Edwards Pharmacal Corp., </em>443 F.2d 867, 882 (2d Cir. 1971) (\u201cIn order for nondisclosure to constitute inequitable misconduct there must be something more than negligence\u2014 . . . there must be \u2018some element of wrongfulness, wilfulness or bad faith that transgresses the basic concept of doing equity.\u2019 \u201d). Perhaps the most often quoted description of the level of culpability necessary to support a finding of \u201cfraud on the Patent Office\u201d \u2014 a passage quoted with approval in the PTO decision in this case \u2014 is taken from the decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d 779, 795-96, 57 CCPA 1384 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">Good faith and subjective intent, while they are to be considered, should not necessarily be made controlling. Under ordinary circumstances, the fact of misrepresentation coupled with proof that the party making it had knowledge of its falsity is enough to warrant drawing the inference that there was a fraudulent intent. Where public policy demands a complete and accurate disclosure it may suffice to show nothing more than that the misrepresentations were made in an atmosphere of gross negligence as to their truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\"><em>See also </em>Tegtmeyer, <em>Fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office Under Rule 56, </em>58 J. Patent Off. Soc. 550, 561 (\u201cthere must be an element of bad faith or total recklessness to find fraud or inequitable conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">The expansion of the concept of disabling patent fraud has proceeded largely from the courts\u2019 perception of the \u201crelationship between applicants for patent and the Patent Office and their scrutiny of the conduct of applicants in light of that relationship.\u201d <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 793. In <em>Precision Instrument, </em>324 U.S. at 818, 65 S.Ct. at 999, the Court had stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWQE\">Those who have applications pending with the Patent Office or who are parties to Patent Office proceedings have an uncompromising duty to report to it all facts concerning possible fraud or inequitableness underlying the applications at issue. . . . Only in this way can that agency act to safeguard the public in the first instance against fraudulent patent monopolies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The court in <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 793-94, elaborated on this idea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>[Applicants before the Patent Office are being held to a relationship of confidence and trust to that agency. The indicated expansion of the concept of \u201cfraud\u201d manifests an attempt by the courts to make this relationship meaningful.... The highest standards of honesty and candor on the part of applicants in presenting . . . facts to the office are . . . necessary elements in a working patent system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">It is thus well established that a patent is rendered unenforceable by inequitable conduct \u2014 falling somewhat short of common law fraud \u2014 on the part of a patentee in his dealings before the Patent and Trademark Office. A logical corollary of this proposition, and the rationale on which the Rule 56 power to strike applications is based, is that \u201cconduct which will prevent the enforcement of a patent after the patent issues should, if discovered earlier, prevent the issuance of the patent.\u201d <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 792; <em>see also Ex Parte Mallard, </em>71 U.S.P.Q. 294 (Comm\u2019r Pat. 1946). At least as applied to original applications for patent, Rule 56 clearly serves this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">It is the use of Rule 56 in reissue proceedings, however, that DEC attacks. The PTO\u2019s reliance in such proceedings upon findings of \u201cfraud\u201d is said to run counter to the express terms of section 251, which provides that patents shall be reissued to correct certain errors made without \u201cany deceptive intention.\u201d This language, in DEC\u2019s view, reflects a congressional definition of the quantum of misconduct necessary to bar reissuance of a patent (\u201cdeceptive intention\u201d); and as it is greater than the quantum of inequitable conduct sufficient to render a patent unenforceable (\u201cfraud\u201d), the latter standard cannot be imposed by the Commissioner under his section 6 rulemaking power.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">But assuming, arguendo, that \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d within the meaning of section 251 encompasses something significantly different from, and requires a greater showing than, \u201cfraud\u201d as used in Rule 56,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it does not follow that the PTO may not rely on the \u201clesser\u201d showing of fraud as a further basis for refusal to reissue a patent. Section 251 sets forth statutory prerequisites to reissue, in addition to the general conditions relating to issuance of patents found elsewhere in title 35:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there must be an issued patent deemed \u201cinoperative or invalid\u201d; it must be so because of \u201cerror\u201d; and the patentee and applicant for reissue must not be guilty of any \u201cdeceptive inten tion\u201d in connection with the error. <em>See In re Oda, </em>443 F.2d 1200, 1206, 58 CCPA 1353 (1971). If these requisites are not met, section 251 stands as a statutory bar to reissuance of claims, just as sections 102 and 103 might stand as a bar to the issuance of claims. As we have already noted, however, Rule 56 operates independently of the statutorily prescribed conditions for patentability and issuance of claims. The principle that the privileges of a patent monopoly should be denied to applicants guilty of fraudulent behavior before the Patent Office is an equitable one, developed by the Supreme Court and the lesser federal courts. It is scarcely unreasonable that the Commissioner, in exercise of his rule-making authority, should make provision for recognition of this equitable principle in the Patent and Trademark Office. Otherwise the PTO would be obliged to issue claims knowing that they were unenforceable as a matter of law. The question, then, is not simply whether the prohibition of fraud embodied in Rule 56 is a reasonable interpretation of section 251\u2019s \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d terminology, but rather whether, taken as an independent duty imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>applicants, it is \u201cinconsistent with law.\u201d We cannot conclude that this is the case where the courts have determined \u201cfraud\u201d to be a basis of unenforceability of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">DEC relies exclusively on the seemingly mandatory terminology of section 251 \u2014that the Commissioner <em>\u201cshall </em>reissue\u201d patents to correct errors made without deceptive intention \u2014 to argue that, absent a showing of deceptive intention, the Commissioner is absolutely required to act favorably on a reissue application. However, it is clear that an applicant would not be entitled to the reissuance of claims barred under sections 102 or 103, for example, regardless of whether there existed within the claims \u201cerror\u201d made \u201cwithout any deceptive intention.\u201d <em>See In re Wadlinger, </em>496 F.2d 1200, 1202-03 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 1974); <em>In re Doyle, </em>482 F.2d 1385 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1973); cf. <em>Ex Parte Varga, </em>189 U.S.P.Q. 204 (P.T.O.Bd.App.1973). Likewise, section 251 does not mandate that the Commissioner reissue claims procured by \u201cfraud,\u201d even if those claims contain errors that might otherwise be correctable through the reissue process. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.176: \u201cAn original claim, if re-presented in the reissue application, is subject to reexamination, and the entire application will be examined in the same manner as original applications. . . . \u201d <em>See also </em>3 Chisum, <em>Patents </em>\u00a7 15.03[5], at 15-56 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Furthermore, the supposed conflict between section 251 and Rule 56 is, in this instance at least, illusory for another reason. Section 251 deals with \u201cerrors\u201d which render a patent \u201cwholly or partly inoperative or invalid, <em>by reason of a defective specification or drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) When <em>such </em>errors are found to have been made without deceptive intention, the Commissioner \u201cshall reissue the Patent.... \u201d However, the sorts of errors to which the PTO\u2019s findings of fraud were addressed \u2014 DEC\u2019s failure to disclose relevant prior art and allegedly disabling prior sales \u2014 are not the sorts of errors to which section 251 refers. Even had the PTO determined that <em>these </em>errors had been made without deceptive intention, DEC would not have been entitled, at least without proposing amendments to its claims, to have its patent reissued. On the contrary, the PTO would have been compelled to <em>reject </em>the reissue claims; even if the prior art and sales did not bar patentability of the invention, there still would have been no \u201cerrors\u201d rendering the original claims \u201cwholly or partly invalid\u201d due to the applicant \u201cclaiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent.\u201d The requirements of section 251 would simply not have been met.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See In re Clark, </em>522 F.2d 623, 625-26 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). DEC\u2019s contention that the PTO erred by not examining its inadequate disclosure under a \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d standard, rather than a \u201cfraud\u201d standard, is thus somewhat of a red-herring. The more appropriate question is whether the PTO was entitled to consider the inadequate disclosure as a dispositive factor at all \u2014 whether it was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>determine that DEC\u2019S misconduct in this regard disabled DEC from obtaining reissue on <em>other </em>grounds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">As we have already indicated, this question must be answered affirmatively. If one assumes, for purposes of argument, <em>but see </em>Part III, <em>infra, </em>that the PTO\u2019s findings of fraud were well founded, it follows that the Stockebrand patent is unenforceable or invalid. If this determination had been made by a court prior to the PTO\u2019s consideration of DEC\u2019S reissue application, there is little doubt that reissue of the patent would not have been allowed. <em>See In re Clark, </em>522 F.2d at 627 (\u201cReissue is not available to rescue a patentee who had presented claims limited to avoid particular prior art and then had failed to disclose that prior art (the examiner not having acted upon it) after that failure to disclose has resulted in the invalidating of the claims.\u201d). Indeed, even if the PTO had reissued the claims in such circumstances, it is likely that a court would have found them nonetheless unenforceable; this conclusion would surely follow from the prevailing view that fraud practiced in connection with particular claims forever destroys the right of the applicant to have those claims mature into an enforceable patent. <em>See Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 783; <em>Kearney &amp; Treaker Corp. v. Giddings &amp; Lewis, Inc., </em>452 F.2d 579, 595-96 (7th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1066, 92 S.Ct. 1500, 31 L.Ed.2d 796 (1972). This being the case, there seems to be no good reason to prohibit the PTO from conducting its own examination of alleged fraudulent conduct, as part of its reissue proceedings, when, fortuitously or otherwise, it must dispose of the reissue application prior to a judicial determination on the issue of fraud.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, it would be an exercise in futility to require the PTO to reissue claims \u201ctainted\u201d by fraud, only to have those claims held unenforceable by the courts. We conclude, therefore, that the PTO does not exceed its statutory authority when it refuses to reis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>sue a patent on the ground that it was procured by fraud.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">B. <em>Rule 56 Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">DEC contends further, however, that the PTO may not take such action by means of a \u201csummary\u201d procedure \u2014 the striking of an application \u2014 that cuts off the channels of review established in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 134, 141 &amp; 145. This alleged denial of DEC\u2019s right to <em>de novo </em>judicial review is criticized in particular as having eliminated DEC\u2019s opportunity to introduce demeanor evidence on the issue of \u201cfraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that decisions of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents striking applications on grounds of fraud would <em>not </em>be appealable under the above provisions. It is true that the jurisdiction of the Board of Appeals, pursuant to section 134, is limited to PTO decisions \u201cwhich relate, at least indirectly, to matters involving the <em>rejection </em>of claims.\u201d <em>In re Hengehold, </em>440 F.2d 1395, 1404, 58 CCPA 1099 (1971).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, DEC\u2019s \u201cclaims\u201d have not been \u201crejected\u201d in a technical sense. (Furthermore, decisions made by the Board as an \u201cagent\u201d of the Commissioner are not \u201cdecisions\u201d within the meaning of section 141. <em>In re James, </em>432 F.2d 473, 57 CCPA 1371 (1970).) Nevertheless, in determining whether a particular PTO action is appealable to the Board (and hence reviewable either by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals or by the district court in a civil action instituted pursuant to section 145), one must \u201clook both to the language employed [by the agency in taking the action] and the <em>effect </em>thereof,\u201d and consider \u201cboth form and substance.\u201d <em>In re Haas, </em>486 F.2d 1053,1055 (Oust. &amp; Pat.App. 1973). In <em>Haas, </em>the court held that the Board had jurisdiction to review an examiner\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of claims, which \u201camount[ed] to a rejection\u201d because it precluded further consideration of the claims \u201cnot only in this application but prospectively in any subsequent application because of their content.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1056. At least one commentator has pointed to <em>Haas </em>as support for the proposition that PTO decisions striking applications under Rule 56 are appealable. Gholz, <em>Review of Decisions Striking Patent Applications for Fraud, </em>61 J. Patent Off. Soc. 52 (1979). (The PTO\u2019s position is otherwise, <em>see id., </em>at 52). Indeed, the PTO\u2019s failure to label its present action in terms of \u201crejection\u201d may have little practical significance other than to purportedly insulate from the review mechanism mandated by Congress a decision that is highly factual and substantive in nature, and thus particularly appropriate for such review. One might well conclude, based on a reading of the statutory provisions cited above, that Congress intended actions such as this one \u2014 constituting a final adverse disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tion of an applicant\u2019s asserted right to a patent \u2014 to be appealable in the manner provided. <em>See also </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Even assuming, however, that such decisions are not reviewable under section 134, the PTO\u2019s administrative application of the fraud standard to reissue applications is not thereby rendered unsupportable. We have already noted that the Commissioner is empowered to promulgate regulations \u201cnot inconsistent with law\u201d to govern PTO proceedings. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6. Regulations establishing PTO inquiries addressed to possible \u201cfraudulent\u201d conduct are not inconsistent with law simply because decisions made pursuant to them are not reviewable in the same manner as are PTO decisions relating to other matters. Whatever the desirability of more extensive review of the PTO\u2019s \u201cfraud\u201d findings, the possible failure of Congress to have provided for such review cannot be taken to preclude the PTO from acting in the first instance. Moreover, as our disposition of the instant case demonstrates, the courts retain power, under general provisions relating to review of agency action, e. <em>g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 &amp; 706, to correct any serious errors committed by the PTO.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">As for the \u201csummary\u201d nature of the administrative proceedings presently afforded by the PTO \u2014 the absence of provision for live testimony or oral argument \u2014 we think that, while such procedures may be imperfectly tailored, our review would be limited to whether they comported with the requirements of due process. The district court engaged in a thorough treatment of this issue and concluded that DEC was not denied due process under the circumstances of this case. DEC has not disputed this finding on appeal, and we thus consider the matter foreclosed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We next turn to whether the PTO\u2019s findings that \u201cfraud\u201d was committed in connection with the application for the Stockebrand patent, and in connection with the reissue application, can be sustained. The PTO determined that nine grounds of fraud were established by clear and convincing evidence. The district court found that four of these grounds for decision were \u201cparticularly clear\u201d and that each supported the PTO\u2019s determination that fraud had been committed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are unable to find, however, that the PTO has articulated any basis sufficient to support its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">We fully recognize the limited scope of judicial review of agency action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), which provides for setting aside agency actions, findings and conclusions only if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nevertheless, though our review is constricted, we must still determine whether the PTO\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>see also FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 802-03, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2115-16, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978). We are convinced that the PTO\u2019s decision was not based on an examination of the relevant factors and that, particularly in light of the PTO\u2019s burden, articulated in its decision, to establish fraud by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>(see <em>also Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 796 \u2014 97), the finding of fraud on the grounds advanced by the PTO amounts to \u201cclear error\u201d and lacks a \u201crational basis.\u201d We are thus compelled to set aside the PTO\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The deficiencies of the PTO\u2019s analysis are similar with respect to the first eight grounds on which it relied. In general, the PTO concluded that fraud had been committed because DEC and Stockebrand had in their possession information that was not disclosed in connection with the patent application. In each instance, however, the PTO failed to find all the elements necessary to a determination of patent office fraud; its findings did not reflect significant (let alone \u201cclear and convincing\u201d) evidence of \u201cculpable\u201d behavior on the part of the applicant or assignee, nor did they establish that the withheld information was of requisite materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">As we point out in Part II A, an intentional scheme of deception is not necessary to a showing of \u201cfraud on the Patent Office.\u201d Nevertheless, a not insubstantial degree of \u201cwrongfulness\u201d <em>is </em>required to be shown. Applicants for patents do not engage in fraudulent conduct when they make \u201chonest mistakes in judgment\u201d concerning the information material to consideration of their applications, nor does some slight deviation from the requisite standard of care suffice as evidence of fraud. In the PTO\u2019s own discussion of the law governing its decision, it acknowledged that a finding of fraud would be warranted only when an applicant has made misrepresentations with \u201cknowledge of [their] falsity\u201d or \u201cin an atmosphere of gross negligence as to their truth.\u201d Clearly the PTO did not mean to apply in this case some new administratively fashioned standard penalizing innocent or merely negligent nondisclosure. (It could hardly have done so, since all the relevant events occurred during a period when the only relevant codified administrative standard governing the conduct of applicants before the PTO was former Rule 56\u2019s cryptic proscription of \u201cfraud.\u201d) Yet in the discussion of grounds one through eight, the PTO points to little that would indicate the requisite culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">A fraud finding also requires that the withheld information meet a rather high standard of materiality. As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals said in <em>Norton v. Curtiss,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">In patent cases, \u201cmateriality\u201d has generally been interpreted to mean that if the Patent Office had been aware of the complete or true facts, the challenged claims would not have been allowed.... Findings of materiality should not be limited only to those situations where there can be no dispute that the true facts, or the complete facts, if they had been known, would most likely have prevented the allowance of the particular claims at issue or alternatively, would provide a basis for holding those claims invalid. ... It is our view that a proper interpretation of the \u201cmateriality\u201d element of fraud in this context must include therein consideration of factors apart from the objective patentability of the claims at issue, particularly (where possible) the subjective consideration of the examiner and the applicant. Indications in the record that the claims at issue <em>would </em>not have been allowed but for the challenged misrepresentations must not be overlooked due to any certainty on the part of the reviewing tribunal that the claimed invention, viewed objectively, <em>should </em>have been patented. If it can be determined that the claims would <em>not </em>have been allowed <em>but for </em>the misrepresentation, then the facts were material regardless of their effect on the objective question of patentability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">433 F.2d at 794-95 (emphasis in original). The PTO decision cites a similar passage from <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Filtrol Corp., </em>170 U.S.P.Q. 482, 521 (C.D.Cal.1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>179 U.S.P.Q. 209 (9th Cir. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">[a] patent applicant\u2019s duty of disclosure to the Patent Office extends to prior art or other facts known to him which. . ., <em>but for </em>the nondisclosure, <em>would have </em>prevented the patent from issuing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>would have </em>restricted the scope of the claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also Parker v. Motorola, Inc., </em>524 F.2d 518, 535 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 2175, 48 L.Ed.2d 799 (1976); <em>Schnadig Corp. v. Gaines Manufacturing Co., </em>494 F.2d 383, 392-93 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Langer v. Kaufman, </em>465 F.2d 915, 921-22, 59 CCPA 1261 (1972). This standard of materiality is not even mentioned, however, let alone found to have been met, in the PTO\u2019s discussion of the various grounds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">This is not to say that a strict \u201cbut for\u201d test of materiality must be applied in every instance, or that it would necessarily be inappropriate to test the materiality of misrepresentations or nondisclosures against a standard somewhat different from the formulation used in <em>Norton. See True Temper Corp. v. CF&amp;I Steel Corp., </em>601 F.2d 495, 504 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>In re Multidistrict Litigation Involving Frost Patent, </em>540 F.2d 601, 604 n.9 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Timely Products Corp. v. Arron, </em>523 F.2d 288, 297-98 (2d Cir. 1975). Questions of \u201cmateriality\u201d and \u201cculpability\u201d are often interrelated and intertwined, so that a lesser showing of the materiality of withheld information may suffice when an intentional scheme to defraud is established, whereas a greater showing of the materiality of withheld information would necessarily create an inference that its nondisclosure was \u201cwrongful.\u201d <em>See United States v. Standard Electric Time Co., </em>155 F.Supp. 949, 952-53 (D.Mass.1957). To establish fraud, however, the nondisclosed information must be such as to have a likely effect on the scope of allowable claims or the issuance of the patent. It is not enough that the information be simply \u201crelevant\u201d in some general sense to the subject matter of the claimed invention, or even to the invention\u2019s patent-ability. Nevertheless, the PTO, in its discussion of the first eight grounds of fraud in this case, consistently shied away from making any concrete findings concerning the significance the withheld information would have had to an examiner\u2019s consideration and allowance of the Stockebrand claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The PTO\u2019s discussion in support of \u201cGround I\u201d is illustrative of the manner in which it proceeded. Ground I states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">The applicant, Thomas C. Stockebrand, signed the oath for application Serial No. 409,913 on November 6, 1964, when he knew, or reasonably should have known, that the invention was \u201cprima facie\u201d \u201con sale in the United States more than one year prior\u201d to the date of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"API\">The Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision and earlier Order to Show Cause set forth with specificity the facts which the PTO found to establish this ground by clear and convincing evidence. In brief these facts are as follows: DEC leased a DEC tape system to Kie Data in May 1963, to be delivered in July 1963; DEC accepted orders for DEC tape systems from three other companies between May 1963 and August 1963, with deliveries scheduled prior to November 1963; DEC delivered a system to Kie Data before November 1963; prior to the Kie Data delivery Stockebrand reported that the system was \u201cnow running satisfactorily (reading while writing)\u201d, and Stockebrand testified that prior to delivery the system could \u201cread and write\u201d but \u201cbroke\u201d after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>delivery;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Stockebrand was aware of, and participated in, the above orders and deliveries, was told in August 1963 that the prototype system had been \u201csold\u201d and he was \u201clate,\u201d and was \u201cvery upset at the sales department\u201d which had made these arrangements without informing him beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We note at the outset our confusion over the PTO\u2019s \u201cprima facie on sale\u201d terminology. The applicant, Stockebrand, is charged with \u201cfraud\u201d because he signed the application oath while knowing that the invention was \u201cprima facie on sale in the United States more than one year before the application date.\u201d The meaning of <em>\u201cprima facie </em>on sale\u201d is not, however, explained, nor can we readily understand the utility of such a concept in the context of determining whether fraud has been committed. The oath that Stockebrand signed recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">I do not know and do not believe that this invention was ever ... on sale in the United States more than one year prior to this application.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-20\">Stockebrand did not promise the invention was not \u201cprima facie on sale.\u201d The crux of Ground I must be that Stockebrand withheld information \u2014 the facts recounted above \u2014 that was relevant to an examiner\u2019s determination of whether or not the invention was \u201con sale.\u201d But since the PTO stopped short of finding that the invention <em>was </em>in fact \u201con sale\u201d more than one year prior to the application date,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> an essential question becomes whether the undisclosed facts were nonetheless so \u201cmaterial\u201d that failure to disclose them was either in itself fraudulent or rendered the application oath fraudulently misleading. That the undisclosed information would amount to a \u201cprima facie showing\u201d of an \u201con sale\u201d bar avoids the question whether it was significant enough to meet the <em>Norton v. Curtiss </em>\u201cbut for\u201d standard or some other adequate standard of materiality. It is true that at one point the Assistant Commissioner states that \u201c[e]ven if it could be construed that the sales involved an inoperable invention that had not been tested or that the sales were only for experimental purposes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>question would be so close as to impose an obligation to disclose the sales to the examiner for a determination of their effect on patentability.\u201d To say that the matter is \u201cso close\u201d as to impose an obligation of disclosure, however, is little more than conclusory. What should have been undertaken was an explanation of <em>how </em>close a question it was, in terms of the likely <em>effect </em>that the undisclosed information would have had on Stockebrand\u2019s application for a patent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Even were we to hold the findings on materiality marginally sufficient, the PTO\u2019s discussion of Ground I would still be deficient in that it fails to address adequately the question of Stockebrand\u2019s <em>culpability </em>for the lack of disclosure. After reciting the facts relating to the various pre-November 1963 orders for DEC tape and the Kie Data delivery, the PTO goes on to stress Stockebrand\u2019s involvement in and awareness of these activities. It concludes that \u201cit is incredible that Stockebrand would not remember the sales under the circumstances set forth above.\u201d The implication seems to be that this demonstrates that Stockebrand signed the application oath with \u201cknowledge of its falsity.\u201d However, the oath that Stockebrand signed states a legal, or at least complex factual, conclusion: that the invention he sought to patent was not \u201con sale\u201d prior to November 9, 1963. An invention cannot be \u201con sale\u201d until it is operable and \u201creduced to practice,\u201d nor is there an \u201con sale\u201d bar if the invention is \u201csold\u201d and delivered primarily for \u201cexperimental purposes.\u201d <em>DeLong Corp. v. Raymond International, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 1135 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>In re Theis, </em>610 F.2d 786 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979); <em>Timely Products Corp. v. Arron, </em>523 F.2d 288 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, </em>498 F.2d 271 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1057, 95 S.Ct. 640, 42 L.Ed.2d 654 (1974); <em>B. F. Sturtevant Co. v. Massachusetts Hair &amp; Felt Co., </em>124 F.2d 95 (1st Cir. 1941).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> DEC does not maintain, as the PTO decision seems to suggest, that when Stockebrand signed the oath he did \u201cnot remember\u201d the Kie Data delivery had ever occurred, that he developed some sort of selective amnesia.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Its contention is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that the <em>conclusion </em>stated in the oath was <em>true, </em>regardless of the Kie Data delivery and the other orders recounted by the PTO, or at least that Stockebrand reasonably believed it to be true. The PTO\u2019s decision is entirely unresponsive to this contention; if anything it tends to support DEC\u2019s position by expressly leaving open the possibility that the undisclosed \u201csales\u201d involved \u201can inoperable invention that had not been tested or that the sales were only for experimental purposes.\u201d If such were the case, then it could hardly be said that Stockebrand acted wrongfully by stating that there was no \u201con sale\u201d bar to his invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We find fatal the PTO\u2019s failure to determine expressly that Stockebrand acted in bad faith by signing the oath, or at least had sufficient reason to believe the oath was false so that he acted \u201cin an atmosphere of gross negligence\u201d by signing it. The deficiency is especially glaring in light of Stockebrand\u2019s sworn affidavit in which he avers that he did not deliberately conceal information from the PTO and had no reason to believe at the time he signed the oath, and does not now believe, that the oath could not properly be made.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The PTO points to no evidence that would indicate that Stockebrand actually considered the withheld information to be significant to the patentability of his invention yet made a deliberate decision not to disclose it. <em>Cf. Beckman Instruments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chemtronics, Inc., </em>428 F.2d 555 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 956, 91 S.Ct. 353, 27 L.Ed.2d 264 (1970); <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 796-97; <em>see also </em>note 31, <em>infra. </em>Indeed, there is little, if anything, in the PTO\u2019s present decision necessarily inconsistent with the conclusion that Stockebrand made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in deciding that, in light of his substantial work on the system between November 1963 and January 1964, the invention he sought to patent was not reduced to practice, and was not \u201con sale,\u201d prior to the critical date. <em>Cf. DeLong Corp. v. Raymond International, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 1135, 1143 (3d Cir. 1980) (\u201cA reduction to practice \u2018is not achieved until the inventor has sufficiently tested the prototype to prove its utility and to determine that no further refinements are necessary.\u2019 \u201d). As noted by the court in <em>DeLong Corp., </em>622 F.2d at 1146, \u201c[t]he mere misstatement in the patent application that there had not been a prior sale of the invention for more than one year prior to the date of the application, particularly when the circumstances pertaining to the transaction required a sifting of the facts, will not support a finding of fraud. . . . \u201d At most, the PTO has established that Stockebrand was \u201cnegligent\u201d in not exploring, with his patent attorney or others, the possibility that the early commercial activity constituted an \u201con sale\u201d bar. Such negligence is not by itself equivalent to fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Grounds II, IV, and VII suffer, in large part,- from the same deficiencies as Ground I. Ground II charges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">The assignee, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), permitted, or caused, the application to be filed on November 9, 1964, when the assignee knew, or reasonably should have known, that the invention was \u201cprima facie\u201d \u201con sale in the United States more than one year prior\u201d to the date of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Again, the PTO does not attempt to assess the probable impact of the withheld information on the ultimate issue of patentability. DEC\u2019s culpability is made to rest primarily on the fact that three of its officers or employees, in addition to Stockebrand, were aware both of the Kie Data delivery and of the contents of the patent application generally.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> No reasons are advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>why these employees could not reasonably have believed that the application oath was true regardless of the Kie Data delivery. (It is also apparent that the two employees found to have actually \u201cread\u201d the application did so in order to scrutinize that portion of the application describing the invention and setting forth Stockebrand\u2019s claims; they had little reason to be concerned with the contents of Stockebrand\u2019s oath concerning prior sales.) In any event, these employees were at most shown to have been negligent in their supervision of the application process and in inadequately weighing the possibility that the early commercial activity might stand as a bar to patentability.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Grounds IV and VII are, in essence, simply repetitive of Grounds I and II. Ground IV charges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">The applicant, Thomas C. Stockebrand, signed a supplemental declaration for application Serial No. 409,913 on April 23, 1968, when he knew, or reasonably should have known, that the invention was \u201cprima facie\u201d \u201con sale in the United States more than one year prior\u201d to the date of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Ground VII charges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">The applicant and the assignee failed to disclose to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) prior to the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 3,387,293 on June 4, 1968, the fact that they knew, or reasonably should have known, that the invention was \u201cprima facie\u201d \u201con sale in the United States more than one year prior\u201d to the date on the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqsE\">No additional evidence is recited in support of these grounds that might enhance the PTO\u2019s treatment of the issues of materiality and culpability, discussed above with regard to the first two grounds. (The only additional fact recounted in support of Ground IV is that on April 11, 1968 DEC\u2019S patent counsel sent Stockebrand the supplemental declaration with a cover letter informing him that \u201cthis Declaration brings up to date the statements you made when the application was filed, e. g., that the invention was not published or in public use more than a year prior to the date of filing.\u201d Ground VII simply \u201cincorporate[s] by reference\u201d the discussions of Grounds I\u2014 IV.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">Grounds VIII and IX deal with the failure of Stockebrand and DEC, respectively, to bring to the attention of the PTO two advertising brochures published by DEC in spring of 1963, which are said to have been \u201c \u2018prima facie\u2019 available as prior art\u201d against the Stockebrand application. It is established that Stockebrand and various DEC officers and employees knew of the existence and contents of the brochures.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">The PTO accepted, arguendo, DEC\u2019s characterization of the first brochure, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>had a reference date of March 1963, as describing \u201cthe tape system that DEC had <em>planned </em>to build (the Line tape unit) but never did.\u201d On this basis, however, the PTO found \u201cits materiality is clearly and convincingly established,\u201d due to DEC\u2019s stipulation that, at the time the application was filed, \u201cLINC tape was the most pertinent prior art known to Stockebrand, DEC or DEC\u2019s attorneys.\u201d As is developed more fully below, <em>see </em>Part III E, this equation is ill-conceived; to say that a prior invention is the <em>\u201cmost </em>pertinent\u201d prior art does not necessarily establish that invention\u2019s <em>materiality </em>absent an evaluation of <em>how </em>pertinent it is. In this instance, however, the issue is further muddled, because in virtually the next breath the PTO concedes that \u201cthe disclosure in this brochure was quite skimpy standing alone and its materiality questionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The second brochure, dated May 1963, does describe certain aspects of the Stockebrand system. DEC nevertheless contended that the brochure \u201cwas still preliminary in nature\u201d and maintained that it lacked \u201cenough [detail] to disclose the invention.\u201d While accepting, arguendo, DEC\u2019s description of the brochure as \u201cpreliminary,\u201d the PTO concluded that \u201cthe obvious materiality of the brochure .. . cannot be denied.\u201d The PTO did not elaborate on this bare conclusion, and its decision is certainly devoid of any finding that the brochure would likely have been a bar to patentability under sections 102(b) or 103. Our own limited examination of the brochure suggests that there could at least be a reasonable difference of opinion concerning the extent to which the brochure \u201cteaches\u201d the Stockebrand invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">More serious than the truncated discussion of the brochures\u2019 materiality is the absence of any discussion of Stockebrand\u2019s or DEC\u2019s culpability .in withholding the brochures from the PTO. Again, the PTO seems to have simply assumed that since the applicant and the assignee had \u201cknowledge\u201d that these materials existed, their failure to bring the materials to the PTO\u2019s attention amounted to \u201cfraud.\u201d There is no evidence, however, to indicate that Stockebrand or any other DEC employee either 1) believed these brochures significant to the patentability of the invention or 2) were \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in failing to realize that the brochures would be a determinative factor in the examiner\u2019s evaluation of the patent application.' The PTO could hardly make the latter finding, of course, since it made no predicate finding that the advertising materials would have played a dispositive role in the examination of Stockebrand\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The PTO\u2019s discussion of Ground IX, relating to DEC\u2019s failure to disclose the materials, is devoted largely to demonstrating that DEC undertook in the spring of 1963 to generate \u201cstrong customer interest in Micro-tape,\u201d and had established tentative prices for the system as early as March 30, 1963. It is difficult to comprehend what relevance these f\u00e1cts have to the status of the advertising brochures as \u201cprima facie prior art.\u201d While this aspect of DEC\u2019s advertising and sales program might conceivably be pertinent to the question of an \u201con sale\u201d bar, it has no bearing on whether the brochures taught the invention sufficiently to render it unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Grounds XI and XII concern the failure of Stockebrand, DEC, and patent counsel (Liepmann and his successor, O\u2019Donnell) to adequately disclose \u201cLINC tape,\u201d the \u201cclosest prior art of which they were aware.\u201d It is established that Stockebrand was fully aware of the existence of LINC tape, having even played a part in its development, and that he disclosed the central elements of the LINC tape system to patent counsel. The application, however, did not identify LINC tape by name. It did contain a 12-line description which Stockebrand testified described LINC tape \u201cexactly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The PTO\u2019s only discussion of the materiality of LINC tape to the patentability of the Stockebrand invention is its recital of DEC\u2019s stipulation that \u201cLINC tape was the most pertinent prior art known to Stockebrand, DEC or DEC\u2019s attorneys.\u201d This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>cession is not responsive, however, to the issue of \u201cbut for\u201d materiality, as defined in <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>since it is quite possible (and even probable) that the \u201cclosest\u201d prior art will not render an invention unpatentable or restrict the scope of the claims made. Nor did the PTO attempt to explain the effect that full disclosure of LINC tape would likely have had on Stockebrand\u2019s application for patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We can understand the frustration of the PTO at having discovered that it examined the Stockebrand application without having been apprised of materials it would have found \u201crelevant\u201d to that examination. Yet we can point to no source establishing an ironclad duty on the part of applicants for patent, as of June 4, 1968, to bring to the PTO\u2019s attention \u201cthe most pertinent prior art\u201d of which they were aware, even if that prior art was \u201cmore relevant than the prior art cited by the Primary Examiner.\u201d <em>See United States v. Standard Electric Time Co., </em>155 F.Supp. 949 (D.Mass.1957). The dispositive question would have been, at a minimum, whether the prior art was so close as to create a substantial likelihood that it would bar issuance of the patent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, contrary to the PTO\u2019s suggestions, in the context of an inquiry into <em>fraud, </em>\u201cfailures to disclose the most relevant prior art\u201d <em>can </em>\u201cbe excused\u201d by proof that those involved with the application acted in \u201cgood faith.\u201d <em>See International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. v. Raychem Corp., </em>538 F.2d 453, 461 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 886, 97 S.Ct. 238, 50 L.Ed.2d 167 (1976), and cases cited in Part II A, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In this case, the patent application contains, at col. 1, lines 52-64, a brief passage which DEC contends adequately describes LINC tape. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">The data stored on a magnetic tape are often organized into blocks encompassing a number of consecutive storage spaces. These spaces are arranged in parallel data tracks extending along the tape. The location of each block is recorded on the tape in a track separate from the data blocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">With this arrangement, as the magnetic tape advances, a mark track read/write transducer produces signals identifying the blocks moving into a read/write position with the data transducers. These signals are used to schedule the retrieval of information recorded in the tape and, alternatively, the recording of information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">In his deposition, Stockebrand testified, referring to this passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-11\">A. Well, specifically LINC tape is described exactly. The language is such that you could \u2014 it certainly also describes what I call Supertape somewhere else in here, the original TX-2 tape. Though it isn\u2019t specific in the sense that you can\u2019t say, well, it must have been that you were talking about \u2014 if you see what I mean. Certainly the only tape in existence that describes what I personally know about is LINC tape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">The PTO\u2019s response was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvJ\">It appears from the above quotation that Stockebrand was using his knowledge of LINC tape to identify the passage as describing LINC tape. Further, Stockebrand\u2019s knowledge of the original TX-2 tape was apparently also sufficient to enable him to identify the passage as applying to that tape also. However, there is no indication that one not having specific knowledge of either LINC tape or the original TX \u2014 2 tape would recognize the same from the description in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">While the PTO\u2019s comment is not entirely clear, we take it simply to be a finding that the application\u2019s disclosure of LINC tape was not adequate, despite Stockebrand\u2019s ability to associate the description with the preexisting system. .Taken as such, the finding is certainly supportable. It is obvious that the brief description of \u201cprior art\u201d at lines 52-64 of the application was not as complete a disclosure of LINC tape as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>would have been possible. This conclusion is mandated in part by the fact that DEC now seeks to amend certain claims so as to avoid a \u201cconstruction\u201d that might be taken as reading on LINC tape \u2014 a construction that reveals elements of the LINC tape system not ascertainable from the brief description quoted above. Furthermore, as COI pointed out to the PTO, in a comment the PTO found \u201cwell taken,\u201d the description at lines 52-64 does not reveal \u201cthat LINC searched bidirectionally and read and wrote monodirectionally,\u201d that \u201cLINC employed complement obverse block marks in the data tracks,\u201d or that \u201cas of 1962 ... it was a matter of choice to put information in obverse complement form or put in the obverse and use a complementing amplifier to achieve the result when data was stored in two different locations.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Nevertheless, we find nothing in the PTO\u2019s subsidiary findings indicating that the inadequate disclosure amounted to a misrepresentation \u201cmade in an atmosphere of gross negligence.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The PTO does not seem to dispute DEC\u2019s contentions that as of the filing date of November 9, 1964, there was no publicly available description of LINC tape,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that Stockebrand had to rely on his recollection of LINC tape, and that Stockebrand was not even aware of certain features of the LINC tape system (such as the system\u2019s \u201cfortuitous\u201d use of complement obverse numbers as control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>words.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> More important, there \u201cis no attempt to directly confront Stockebrand\u2019s assertion that he did not believe that the undisclosed elements of LINC tape would affect the patentability of his claims. <em>Cf. Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. Chemtronics, Inc., </em>428 F.2d 555 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 956, 91 S.Ct. 353, 27 L.Ed.2d 264 (1970).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> While Stockebrand might have been wrong in this belief (a fact, we point out, that the PTO has yet to determine), this in itself would not necessarily establish his culpability. And while Stockebrand can be faulted, in a general sense, for failing to explicitly refer the examiner to the LINC tape system, thus enabling him to undertake his own examination of LINC tape\u2019s relevance, it is not clear that Stockebrand\u2019s failure to do so was either part of an intentional scheme of deception or so grossly wrongful as to constitute fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">P.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Ground XIII, the only ground relating to the contents of the reissue application, charges as fraudulent conduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">Applicant\u2019s signing of the \u201cPetition, Declaration and Power of Attorney\u201d for reissue application Serial No. 546,238 containing a material mischaracterization or misstatement regarding the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the delivery to Kie Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The \u201cmaterial mischaracterization\u201d thus referred to is the following statement in the application for reissue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">In investigating Computer Operations, Inc.\u2019s charges as to the present patent, the assignee discovered that it had delivered to Kie Data, Inc., Watertown, Massachusetts, a prototype computer system containing a tape transport in accordance with the invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">This is incorrect, the PTO maintains, because DEC, the company \u201cwhich actually made, and was responsible for the delivery,\u201d would certainly have \u201cknown\u201d of the delivery at the time it was made, and thus could not have \u201cdiscovered\u201d it over ten years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">We think this ground borders on being frivolous, and find disturbing the PTO\u2019s reliance on it to establish \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of fraud. The PTO\u2019s dissection of the single word \u201cdiscovered\u201d is an exercise in hypertechnical nitpicking. First, in the context in which the statement was made, it heralds little more than the fact that the Kie Data delivery was \u201cbrought to DEC\u2019s attention\u201d in connection with the infringement litigation, regardless of whether DEC had been aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>delivery at some point in the past,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We note in this regard that the \u201cmemory\u201d of a corporation is dependent on the memories of its individual officers and employees, not all of whom are kept continuously apprised of the company\u2019s entire range of affairs, past and present. Moreover, while it may be \u201cincorrect\u201d to maintain that a company does not \u201cknow\u201d of its own deliveries, and \u201cillogical\u201d to say that information can be \u201cdiscovered\u201d once it has been \u201cknown,\u201d such a position is <em>so </em>\u201cillogical\u201d that it cannot reasonably be inferred that DEC intended the sentence in question to \u201cdeceive\u201d the PTO concerning the extent of DEC\u2019s \u201ccorporate knowledge\u201d of the Kie Data delivery.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\">Moreover, even if one reads DEC\u2019s perhaps euphemistic reference to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Kie Data delivery as a gross misstatement of the facts, the statement\u2019s immateriality is beyond question. The reissue application contains a brief description of the Kie Data delivery and promises that \u201c[d]etailed documentation concerning the foregoing is being assembled by the assignee and will be forwarded to the Patent Office shortly.\u201d This \u201cdetailed documentation\u201d was subsequently filed on September 15, 1975, prior to initiation of the \u201cfraud\u201d proceedings, and contains a lengthy recital of the circumstances surrounding the Kie Data lease. The PTO was thus well positioned, by virtue of materials filed by DEC, to form its own \u201ccharacterization\u201d of DEC\u2019s \u201cawareness\u201d of the lease, and had no reason to rely on the ambiguous one-sentence description in the reissue application or to be misled by any \u201cmischaracterization\u201d the sentence conveyed. In such circumstances, it was at best unnecessary for the PTO to parse the sentence in search of \u201cfraud.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">By this, I did not mean to suggest that sales by DEC were unknown to DEC since, obviously, its acts were known to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">We wish to emphasize, in closing, the limited nature of our decision. We find only that the PTO has failed to set forth any basis to reasonably support its findings of \u201cfraud,\u201d and therefore lacked justification for its action striking DEC\u2019s reissue application under Rule 56. Our decision cannot be taken as a determination that no \u201cfraud\u201d was committed; we are limited, on this appeal, to scrutiny of the agency record and analysis of the reasons advanced by the agency to support its action. <em>See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 549, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1214, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978); <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Nor do we mean to suggest, even on our examination of the present record, that DEC has behaved admirably before the PTO. A more complete disclosure of facts relating to LINC tape and to the Kie Data delivery would certainly have assisted the PTO in performance of its functions, and the present controversy concerning DEC\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d could have been avoided had Stockebrand and DEC chosen to resolve any doubt about the relevance of such facts in favor of full disclosure. It might even be desirable to impose a duty' of \u201cdue diligence\u201d on applicants and their counsel to disclose any \u201crelevant\u201d facts to the PTO, thus ensuring full consideration of such facts by the agency.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> There is a limit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>however, to the extent to which the pertinent requirement that applicants not act \u201cfraudulently\u201d can be used to establish such an affirmative \u201cduty of disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">This case provides a good illustration of the pitfalls of a concentration on an applicant\u2019s alleged fraudulent conduct in preference to a thorough examination of the validity of his patent. The PTO had pending before it serious questions concerning the patentability of the Stockebrand invention in light of prior art and potentially disabling sales. While a determination of patentability would have required resolution of some disputes of a technical nature (such as the date of the invention\u2019s reduction to practice, the applicability of the \u201cexperimental use\u201d exception to section 102(b), and the \u201cobviousness\u201d of Stockebrand\u2019s advances over LINC tape), the inquiry would have been in many ways more straightforward than the one undertaken here. Moreover, it is with regard to such matters, and not with regard to ferreting out \u201cinequitable\u201d conduct, that the PTO possesses unique expertise. The comments of the court in <em>Pfizer, Inc. v. International Rectifier Corp., </em>538 F.2d 180, 196 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1040, 97 S.Ct. 738, 50 L.Ed.2d 751 (1977), directed to the proper conduct of infringement litigation, are at least as germane to proceedings before the PTO: \u201cAn infringement defendant in complex litigation should not be permitted to sidestep the [ ] main issues [of the validity and enforceability of the patent] by nitpicking the patent file in every minute respect with the effect of trying the patentee personally, rather than the patent.\u201d <em>See also Norton v. Curtiss, </em>433 F.2d at 795 (In cases where the \u201cmisrepresented\u201d facts, in and of themselves, would probably render the patent invalid or unenforceable, \u201c[w]hether the claims would also be unenforceable because a fraud was committed in misrepresenting the facts to the Patent Office would really be of secondary importance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We thus vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions that it remand the case to the PTO for further consideration of DEC\u2019S application for reissue. As we have noted, the PTO has not yet made a final determination on the merits of the application, aside from the issue of \u201cfraud.\u201d Nevertheless, as Part II of our opinion suggests, the PTO has authority to renew its Rule 56 proceedings should it think such a course fruitful. We are of the opinion on the basis of our reading of the present record, however, that its efforts would more profitably be directed elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded, with instructions to remand to the Patent and Trademark Office for further consideration.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">. The patent, headed \u201cBidirectional Retrieval of Magnetically Recorded Data,\u201d claims an invention that \u201cprovides rapid and flexible access to the data storage spaces on [a moving] record medium,\u201d through use of \u201cselected digital control words\u201d on a mark track to designate data storage \u201cblocks.\u201d Because the selected control words \u201care located in corresponding positions at the beginning and end of each block and have the property that the signal produced by reading one of them when the medium is moving in one direction is identical with the signal produced by the corresponding word when the medium is moving in the opposite direction,\u201d the location of information can be identified with equal facility during motion of the medium in either direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-19\">While the invention is claimed to be \u201cuseful with data storage media such as drums, tapes and disks, using magnetic, optical or other storage techniques,\u201d the DEC tape system developed by Stoekebrand uses a magnetic tape medium and incorporates various features of \u201cconventional\u201d and \u201cpreviously known\u201d tape storage systems. Data is stored on multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>track tape in the form of \u201cmagnetic spots.\u201d The tape is moved, by tape drive motors, past an electrical device called a \u201cread/write transducer\" which (by transforming the magnetic field into an electrical signal) \u201creads\u201d each spot as either a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0\u201d; the same magnetic spot will be read as a 1 when the tape is moving forward and as a 0 when the tape is moving in reverse. Combinations of l\u2019s and 0\u2019s form binary-coded numbers, interpreted as \u201cdata words.\u201d The DEC tape system shares these features with many preexisting systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">According to the invention, the multiple track tape is organized into \u201cblocks\u201d and one of the parallel tracks is designated as a \u201cmark track\u201d for purposes, inter alia, of identifying the location of each block. This is accomplished by recording an identifying \u201ccontrol word\u201d at the beginning of each block. This method of organization is used in various systems predating Stockebrand\u2019s, including \u201cLINC tape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">As described by DEC, Stockebrand\u2019s major contribution over the previously known systems was his discovery that a \u201creverse block mark\u201d could be placed at the end of each block which would be the \u201ccomplement obverse\u201d of the binary number constituting the \u201cforward block mark,\u201d placed at the beginning of that block. (For example, 010110 and 100101 constitute a pair of numbers each the complement obverse of the other.) With the tape moving in reverse, this reverse block number would be read the same as would the forward block number when the tape was moving in the forward direction; thus the position of the data would be demarcated by an identical signal regardless of the direction of tape movement. This advance allegedly permits more rapid access to data than would have been possible</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">through use of preexisting systems, such as LINC tape, at least absent additional, complex circuitry. i</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\">. According to the affidavit of John T. Gilmore, Jr., co-founder and Vice President of Kie Corporation, and since 1974 an employee of DEC, the computer equipment leased from DEC by Kie in July 1963 was used in connection with a large data processing project that Kie was performing. Gilmore avers that Kie \u201chad a close working relationship with DEC,\u201d that it \u201cwas not uncommon [for Kie] to cooperate with DEC in developing and testing new product applications,\u201d and that Kie was aware that the Micro tape units it was leasing \u201cwould still have to be proven in actual use and that changes might have to be made in them after connection into the system at Kie Corporation in order to ensure satisfactory operation.\u201d Because the Micro tape units \u201cwere still being developed and were not available for use\u201d when the lease began in July, DEC supplied Kie with \u201cits then standard Potter units\u201d which were \u201cused until the Microtape units were available and operating.\u201d During December 1963, Kie began transferring the data stored on the Potter tape units to the Micro tape units, a process that continued through January 1964.

The primary \u201cerror\u201d which DEC sought to cure through reissue was the statement, in claims 1 and 12, that the Stockebrand invention includes pairs of control words, each the complement obverse of the other, \u201cselectively positioned\u201d on the mark track to achieve bidirectional reading and writing of data. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>Since the LINC tape system utilized control words \u201cone or more of which may, in fact, fortuitously be the complement obverse of the other\u201d (but, according to DEC, not \u201c \u2018selectively\u2019 positioned with respect to each other to produce the desired result\u201d), DEC sought to \u201celaborate\u201d on claims 1 and 12 to maintain that the marks are \u201cselectively <em>and correspondingly\" </em>positioned. Insofar as the original claims are, as DEC contends, \u201csubject to a construction which covers more than the applicant is claiming,\u201d thus rendering the patent \u201cpartly inoperative,\u201d the section 251 requisites would seem, on this basis, to be met, provided the original terminology (i. e., \u201cselectively positioned\u201d) was not used with a \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d as to the scope of the claims. (Even so, to the extent the proposed change in terminology is an attempt to distinguish prior art not cited to the examiner (i. e., LINC tape), a finding that the prior art was \u201cfraudulently\u201d withheld might preclude a determination that the original, broader claim was \u201cerror\u201d within the meaning of section 251. <em>See In re Clark, </em>522 F.2d at 626-27; <em>but cf. id., </em>at 628-33 (Miller, J., concurring).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">. As a result of the PTO\u2019s 1977 expansion of its reissue procedures <em>(see </em>note 9, supra), the Office was enabled to reexamine, upon the patentee\u2019s application for reissue, the validity of a patent in light of prior art or other information relevant to patentability not considered prior to the time of the patent\u2019s issuance. It has been widely suggested that courts should take advantage of the new procedure, by staying infringement actions in which the alleged infringer cites such prior art or information as evidence of the patent\u2019s invalidity, in order to allow the patentee to seek \u201creissue\u201d and thus obtain the PTO\u2019s expert determination of the effect of the prior art or information on the patentability of the claims. <em>See </em>Markey, <em>New Patent Office Rules May Aid Patent Litigation, </em>Vol. 9, No. 9, The Third Branch 7 (Sept. 1977) (recommendation by Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals that infringement actions be stayed in favor of reissue proceedings); <em>see also </em>Dunner &amp; Lipsey, <em>The New Reissue Practice, </em>61 J. Patent Off. Soc. 68, 84 n.8 (1979) (cataloguing cases in which requests for such stays have been granted or denied). It may thus become more and more commonplace for the PTO to be required to act on a reissue application prior to a judicial determination of the validity and enforceability of the original patent.

DEC also argues that \u201cRule 56 by its terms does not apply in reissue applications to alleged \u2018fraud\u2019 in the procurement of the <em>original </em>patent, since the alleged \u2018fraud\u2019 was not practiced \u2018in connection with it [the reissue application].\u2019 \u201d We think, however, that fraud in the procurement of claims can reasonably be said to have been practiced \u201cin connection with\u201d an application seeking reissue of the same or similar claims.

We observe that, prior to the PTO\u2019s determination of \u201cfraud,\u201d the examiner assigned to DEC\u2019S reissue application rejected all claims as barred by section 102(b), due to the \u201cadmission that the device was \u2018on sale\u2019 more than one year prior to the filing date of the original patent.\u201d While it is arguable that this fact would have provided support for a finding that the original examiner likewise would have rejected Stockebrand\u2019s claims had he been apprised of the same information, the PTO\u2019s decision does not rely on (and indeed nowhere mentions) the reissue examiner\u2019s action. It is not our function to supply a rationale to support the PTO\u2019s action; the PTO decision must \u201cstand or fall\u201d on the reasoning stated therein.

The concept that an invention must be operable and reduced to practice before it can be deemed \u201con sale,\u201d however, is rooted in scientific reality and simple common sense; certainly this notion could have occurred to Stockebrand, a scientist and inventor. (Indeed, DEC argues that Stockebrand\u2019s lack of experience with patent law cuts the other way \u2014 that as a scientist he \u201cjust did not appreciate that the very activities in 1963 which failed to achieve the intended realization of DEC tape might, nonetheless, be deemed sufficient to preclude his right to a patent. .. . \u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\">. It is true that Stockebrand avers in his affidavit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">At the time I signed the application as well as at the time I signed the supplemental declaration, I do not believe that I specifically considered any acts such as leases, sales, offers for sales, brochures, advertisements, or any such acts or information with specific relation to the documents I then signed, nor do I now believe that I had any reason to believe at this time that I could not properly make the oaths I then signed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">This does not indicate, however, that Stockebrand had \u201cforgotten\u201d that such leases, sales, and the like ever occurred, only that he did not deem them relevant to the papers he was signing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">. The PTO, of course, was entitled to assess Stockebrand\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d (at least to the limited extent that \u201ccredibility\u201d can be determined from a paper record of the sort before the PTO), and to reject his testimony on this basis. As already noted, however, Stockebrand\u2019s affidavit was dismissed as \u201cincredible\u201d solely on the basis of a misapprehension of its contents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b775-13\">. Richard Best, DEC\u2019s Chief Engineer, was found to have been \u201caware of both the sales and the application,\u201d and to have \u201cread the patent application before it was filed.\u201d Ken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Olsen, President of DEC, \u201cknew of the sales\u201d and was \u201caware of ... the filing of the application,\u201d although there was \u201cno testimony or evidence to indicate that Olsen actually read the application. . . . \u201d Donald Vonada, a DEC employee hired in September 1963 to introduce Stockebrand\u2019s invention into production, was \u201cinvolved in the preparation of the application\u201d (by virtue of his having reviewed a draft and made comments in the margin) and, the PTO found, must have known of the sales, because it would be \u201cincredible that DEC would hire Vonada to introduce Stockebrand\u2019s invention into production and not inform him of the various sales made to Kie, AECL, MIT and Ft. Meade.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">. We cannot, however, accept DEC\u2019S position before the PTO that it was exonerated from responsibility for the nondisclosure because \u201cthe disclosure would normally be made, and can be expected to be made, by the inventor.\u201d Here, the inventor did <em>not </em>make the disclosure, either to patent counsel or to the PTO, yet various DEC employees, aware of the sales and of the fact that an application for patent was about to be filed, were in a position to intervene and fill the gap. We certainly would not approve the proposition that a corporate assignee of a patent cleanses itself of all culpability for misrepresentations inserted in a patent application filed on its behalf by purposely keeping its officers in the dark concerning the application\u2019s contents and placing the entire burden of proper disclosure on an inventor not versed in patent law and an attorney kept ignorant of putatively relevant facts. We hold only that on the evidence presented here, DEC was not shown to have acted recklessly or grossly negligently in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. In its brief, the PTO asserts that \u201cthe applicant must disclose the closest prior art of which it is aware <em>which would anticipate the invention or in fact would prevent the patent from issuing\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b779-5\">. It was not established, however, that these similarities would bar patentability of the Stockebrand invention. With respect to LINC\u2019s ability to search bidirectionally and read and write monodirectionally, for example, Stockebrand testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">A. Look, what I\u2019m inventing or is in the patent is built on LINC tape. Clear. It goes beyond it with complement obverse, with symmetry, and one or two other things.... As far as I\u2019m concerned, it was what was added to the prior art, is my invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnB\">The PTO made no finding to the contrary. DEC also contends that the prior art that was considered by the PTO prior to issuance of the Stockebrand patent \u201cclearly sets forth that bidirectional searching was known.\u201d As mentioned <em>infra, </em>Stockebrand denied knowledge, prior to issuance of his patent, that LINC made any use of complementary obverse numbers in the data tracks. DEC argues further that such usage is in any event immaterial and would not render the Stockebrand invention \u201cobvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">COI also maintained before the PTO that the Stockebrand application did \u201cnot disclose the LINC mark track format,\u201d did \u201cnot disclose the technique which LINC employed to read the mark track,\u201d and did \u201cnot disclose the data track format employed by LINC in the prior art system.\u201d Aside from the issue of the materiality of the above to what Stockebrand claimed as his invention, we note that these statements are not entirely accurate. The Stockebrand application <em>did </em>disclose, in general outline at least, 1) the practice of recording the location of each block in a mark track separate from the data tracks, 2) the prior use of a \u201cread/write transducer\u201d to retrieve information recorded on the mark track, and 3) the previous usage of separate data tracks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\">. The PTO makes much of the fact that Vonada, who reviewed a draft of the application for patent prior to filing, pencilled the following comment in the margin adjacent to lines 52-64:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ2\">What did you want to say. There are other systems in the field doing this or there is only ours?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">(In turn, Stockebrand apparently placed a question mark next to Vonada\u2019s comment.) Vonada testified at his deposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">I guess the intent in the writing here was to ask whether he should be more clear about whether he was making a distinction that in general magnetic tape is organized into blocks, or that he\u2019s trying to prescribe specifically DEC\u2019S method of doing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">From this the PTO concluded that Stockebrand and Liepmann were alerted that the description was inadequate. Even so, it seems far-fetched to assert that their failure to accede to Vonada\u2019s rather vague editing suggestion (particularly in light of the fact that the passage already began with the words \u201cThe data stored on magnetic tape <em>are o\u00f1en </em>organized....\u201d) amounts to clear and convincing evidence of fraud. Liepmann avers in his affidavit that it was his \u201crecollection that Vonada was only inquiring whether the passage meant to deal with prior art or with the invention,\u201d and, as such, did not consider it \u201cto call for further description of prior art.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b779-14\">. The record does contain a letter dated May 13, 1966 from Spear, Inc. to a project engineer at Johns Hopkins Medical School, sent in response to an inquiry about LINC tape, to which is attached a lengthy description of LINC tape \u201cin extremely rough form.\u201d The letter states that \u201cthere has never been a formal write-up prepared to describe the tape system in any detail.\u201d The record also contains a one-page, undated advertisement entitled \u201cPlug a Line tape into your PDP-11 Computer,\u201d which includes a sketchy description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">. Although it is not entirely clear from the record, it appears from Stockebrand\u2019s deposition testimony that, while he was associated with the LINC tape project at MIT Lincoln Laboratories, he had primarily a \u201cmaintenance function\u201d and did not contribute to development of LINC\u2019s control format.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\">. In contrast to the lack of such findings in this case, the court in <em>Beckman </em>found that the applicant and the corporate assignee\u2019s patent employees clearly \u201cunderstood the significance\u201d of the withheld prior art \u201cand knew that it presented a serious threat to the validity of the patent they were trying to secure.\u201d 428 F.2d at 564. <em>See also In re Clark, </em>522 F.2d 623, 624 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975) (applicant clearly knew prior art \u201cto be of pivotal importance in determining the patentability of [his] claims\u201d). This conclusion was drawn in part from a memorandum written by a patent liaison employee sent to the company\u2019s manager of engineering, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">A related matter has now come up that creates a rather ticklish situation. As of early 1954, Dr. Richard W. Stow . . . corresponded with our Sales Department ... concerning a glass electrode . .. [which] is similar to the Clark design.... The Stow device is <em>clearly within the scope of claims </em>now in the Clark application .. . Clark and Stow have known about each other\u2019s work....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-s\">(Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the applicant and assignee had \u201cnot only failed to present the Stow device to the Patent Office, but also made affirmative representations in the papers they filed to the effect that there had been no previous inventions displaying the properties that the Clark device had in common with the Stow device.\u201d 428 F.2d at 566. Finally, the court found that the Stow device <em>in fact </em>rendered the Clark patent invalid, as anticipated by prior art. It was on the basis of <em>these </em>findings that the court rejected, as \u201cutterly incredible,\u201d the appellants\u2019 contention that they did not consider Stow\u2019s work relevant. <em>Id</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b781-4\">.
