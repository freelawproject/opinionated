The Tax Court has answered the question negatively in a tax context in <em>Barrett v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 284 (1972), relying on Justice Frankfurter\u2019s formulation in his concurring opinion- in <em>Deputy v. du Pont, </em>308 U.S. 488, 499, 60 S.Ct. 363, 369, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940), that \u201c \u2018carrying on any trade or business,\u2019 within the contemplation of [section 162], involves holding one\u2019s self out to others as engaged in the selling of goods or services.\u201d Appellant argues to us, as he did to the court below, that \u201cothers\u201d cannot include the singular \u201canother.\u201d We agree with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jack B. Weinstein, Chief Judge, that one who holds himself out to another \u2014 here, the bank for which he formerly had worked \u2014 as engaged in the selling of goods or services, is carrying on a \u201ctrade or business\u201d within the meaning of section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore also for purposes of Social Security retirement insurance benefits, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411. Accordingly we affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying review of the determination of the Social Security Administration that, because of his net earnings from self-employment as exclusive consultant to the bank, appellant was not entitled to Social Security retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">The facts are not in dispute. On July 1, 1978, appellant, upon reaching the age of 65, retired from his position as administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tive vice president and senior lender for the Sterling National Bank and simultaneously entered into a consulting agreement with the bank. Pursuant to that agreement, in which appellant was denominated \u201can independent contractor,\u201d he was paid $30,000 per annum to perform \u201cspecial consulting services\u201d for Sterling, and Sterling only. This he did, until the contract was terminated in February 1980, and during that time he did not hold himself out to any individual or institution other than Sterling as available to render banking or other services. The Social Security Administration refused to pay appellant retirement benefits for the period July 1978 through February 1980, finding that his benefits had been completely offset by his excess earnings from self-employment. Grosswald\u2019s contention is that he was not in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d during that period and that therefore his remuneration did not constitute \u201cnet earnings from self-employment\u201d which may be offset against Social Security retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The statutory structure, while seemingly complicated, is really quite simple. Only \u201cexcess earnings\u201d \u2014 not dividends, interest, or other forms of income \u2014 are offset against retirement benefits, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b). \u201cExcess earnings\u201d consist of 50% of either \u201cwages for services rendered\u201d or \u201cnet earnings from any self-employment\u201d that are above certain statutory limits, exceeded here. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 403(f)(3), (5). The Social Security Administration determined, and the parties do not dispute, that Grosswald was not an employee earning \u201cwages\u201d after July 1978. Rather, the statutory issue is whether the $30,000 per annum consulting contract remuneration constituted \u201cnet earnings from self-employment.\u201d That term is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) as the gross income, minus deductions, \u201cderived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by such individual.\u201d For the meaning of \u201ctrade or business,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(c) refers us to the use of the term in section 23 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which corresponds to section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, \u201ctrade or business\u201d is not defined in section 162 or elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code. It is a term of art which has many different applications in the Code and which has had various meanings depending on time and context. <em>See </em>4A Mertens, Law <em>of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 25.08 (1979); 5 Mertens, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Preliminarily, we note in passing the Secretary\u2019s contention that \u201ctrade or business\u201d in the Social Security Act might have a different meaning under that act than it has under the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary argues in his brief that the term \u201cis not defined solely by resort to Tax Court decisions\u201d but rather must be examined \u201cin the Social Security context.\u201d However persuasive such an argument might be in other situations, we are not persuaded by it in this case, where there is an explicit incorporation of the Internal Revenue Code by the Social Security Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(c). Presumably the Secretary makes this argument because the Tax Court decisions, or at least some of them, do run against his position. But however much weight those cases may be entitled to, and they are certainly deserving of our most serious consideration, they are not binding upon us. And, to the extent that they hold that a consultant is not engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d when he is working exclusively for one concern, we disagree with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">The theory that a person can be deemed to be carrying on a \u201ctrade or business\u201d only if he \u201cholds himself out\u201d to the public by offering goods or services originated in Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurring opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Deputy v. du Pont, </em>308 U.S. 488, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940). There, speaking to the difference, for tax purposes, between expenses incurred in conducting a \u201ctrade or business\u201d and those incurred in managing one\u2019s own investments or in other profit-seeking activity, Justice Frankfurter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab7\">To avail of the deductions allowed by \u00a7 23(a) [now \u00a7 162], it is not enough to incur expenses in the active concern over one\u2019s own financial interest. \u201c. . . carrying on any trade or business,\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 23(a), involves holding one\u2019s self out to others as engaged in the selling of goods or services. This the taxpayer did not do. Expenses for transactions not connected with trade or business, such as an expense for handling personal investments, are not deductible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 499, 60 S.Ct. at 369. Several circuit court and Tax Court cases have developed Justice Frankfurter\u2019s language, which, even though it was a single justice\u2019s opinion, has been taken by at least one commentator to constitute the view of the Supreme Court. 5 Mertens, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28.31, at 123 &amp; n.9. In <em>Stanton v. Commissioner, </em>399 F.2d 326, 329-30 (5th Cir. 1968), for example, the court, citing Justice Frankfurter\u2019s language, held that the taxpayer could not deduct certain expenses under section 162 because his \u201cirregular and sporadic\u201d efforts as an inventor did not rise to the level of \u201ctrade or business.\u201d And in <em>McDowell v. Ribicoff, </em>292 F.2d 174,177-78 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 135 (1961), citing the same language, the court held that the taxpayer\u2019s activities as executrix of her aunt\u2019s estate did not constitute a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d On the same reasoning, the Tax Court has held that a professional gambler \u2014 even though he gambled regularly, with a profit motive, and used his winnings to support his family\u2014 was not in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d because he was not holding himself out to' others as engaged in the selling of goods or services. <em>Gentile v. Commissioner, </em>65 T.C. 1 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Tax Court case closest to ours, however, is <em>Barrett v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 284 (1972). That case involved an executive officer whose employment contract provided that upon completion of his full-time services he would be paid $12,000 a year on the condition that he both render advisory and consulting services to the employer whenever reasonably requested and not compete with the employer \u2014 a contract essentially the same as appellant Grosswald\u2019s in the instant case. The issue in <em>Barrett </em>was whether the taxpayer owed self-employment tax under section 1401 of the Code, which, like the Social Security retirement benefits provision at issue here, incorporates by reference the interpretation of the term \u201ctrade or business\u201d as it is used in section 162 of the Code, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(c). The Tax Court looked to the terms of Barrett\u2019s contract and, relying on Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Deputy </em>and the <em>McDowell </em>case, held that, because the noncompetition clause prohibited Barrett from offering his services \u201cto others,\u201d he was not engaged in a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d 58 T.C. at 289-90.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Barrett </em>was distinguished in the subsequent case of <em>Barnett v. Commissioner, </em>69 T.C. 609 (1978), where the Tax Court held that a bank executive who had retired and simultaneously entered into a $1,000 per month consulting contract, which prohibited him from rendering similar services to any business that competed with the bank, was engaged in a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d The court explained that this was because the consulting contract apparently allowed the taxpayer to render services to banks in towns other than the one in which the employing bank was located, and the taxpayer had not proved that he had <em>not </em>held himself out to such other banks. In other words, to prove that he was not engaged in a \u201ctrade or business,\u201d the taxpayer had to demonstrate either that he was contractually prohibited from holding himself out to other banks or that he did not in fact do so. <em>Id. </em>at 613. Appellant Grosswald here clearly falls with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in <em>Barrett </em>rather than <em>Barnett, </em>not only because his contract prevented him from holding himself out to banks other than Sterling, but also because he in fact proved beyond peradventure that he did not do so and that he rendered his services exclusively during the period in question to Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Nevertheless, in our view <em>Barrett </em>was erroneously decided. It makes little sense to distinguish between a person who \u201cholds himself out\u201d to only one employer (and agrees to work for no one else) and a person who \u201cholds himself out\u201d to more than one employer. Justice Frankfurter surely did not intend such a distinction, even though he referred to \u201cothers\u201d in his <em>Deputy </em>opinion; rather, it is clear that he was distinguishing between managing one\u2019s own investments and rendering services or selling goods to one or more others. We simply do not see the logic of the <em>Barrett </em>distinction. Nothing in the Code suggests it. Nothing in the case law of courts other than the Tax Court leads to such a result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">While we cannot say that the theory of <em>Barrett </em>is \u201cas thin as the homoeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had been starved to death,\u201d <em>see Beamsley v. Commissioner, </em>205 F.2d 743, 748 (7th Cir. 1953) (attributed to Abraham Lincoln), we have to say that we find it unpalatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">(a) In general.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Section 162 corresponds to section 23(a)(1)(A) of the 1939 Code. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(b) (references to 1939 Code in other statutes shall be deemed to be references to corresponding sections of 1954 Code); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1066 (1980); <em>Clevenger v.

The fact that Barrett actually had not rendered any consulting services to the company, and had not been requested to do so, was immaterial to its holding, the court said. <em>Barrett v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 284, 289 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\">. Appellant here relies upon <em>Snow v. Commissioner, </em>416 U.S. 500, 94 S.Ct. 1876, 40 L.Ed.2d 336 (1974), which concerns the deductibility under section 174(a)(1) of the Code of \u201cexperimental expenditures .. . paid or incurred . .. in connection with [a] trade or business . ... \u201d It is true that the Court in Snow did refer to Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Deputy v. du Pont, </em>308 U.S. 488, 499, 60 S.Ct. 363, 369, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940), but the Court expressly distinguished section 174(a)(1) from section 162(a), considering that the latter is \u201cmore narrowly written\u201d and that section 174 was enacted \u201cto dilute some of the conception of \u2018ordinary and necessary\u2019 business expenses under \u00a7 162(a) . . . [as] adumbrated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter.\u201d 416 U.S. at 502-03, 94 S.Ct. at 1877-78. Section 162 and the other 60 or so sections of the 1954 Code referring to \u201ctrade or business\u201d were thought, in Justice Douglas\u2019s opinion for the <em>Snow </em>Court, to be \u201cnot helpful.\u201d The reference to <em>Snow </em>under these circumstances seems hardly apposite, much less helpful to appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
