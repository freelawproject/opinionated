(\u201cthe broadcasters\u201d) contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their post-trial application for permission to copy the video and audio tapes introduced into evidence and played to the jury during the criminal trial of <em>United States v. John W. Jenrette and John R. Stowe. </em>We agree and reverse. We leave the door open on remand, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>for innocent third persons who are mentioned on the tapes to file objections to release of those portions of the tapes which would inflict unwarranted injury upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On June 13,1980, an indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging John Jenrette and John Stowe with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jenrette is a former three term Congressman from the Sixth District of South Carolina; Stowe is a private citizen. These charges arose out of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s \u201cABSCAM\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> investigation into possible congressional corruption, in which several high federal, state, and local government officials allegedly agreed to perform governmental favors for certain individuals posing as \u201cMiddle Eastern businessmen\u201d in return for bribes. The \u201cbusinessmen\u201d were actually undercover FBI agents, and the bribe moneys were furnished by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">At trial a principal part of the government\u2019s case consisted of video and audio tapes upon which the FBI agents had surreptitiously recorded the defendants\u2019 statements, conduct, and response to the offers of the \u201cforeign businessmen\u201d. Members of the press and public who attended the trial saw and heard these tapes as they were played in court. Typewritten transcripts of the audio tapes were released to the media after the tapes were played in the courtroom. Transcripts of the conversations recorded on the video tapes, however, were not so distributed. Guilty verdicts were returned on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">After the trial the broadcasters applied to the court for permission to copy, for the purpose of broadcasting to the public, the video and audio tapes which had been introduced at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties to the criminal trial all filed responses to the application; defendant Jenrette opposed it, defendant Stowe took \u201cno position\u201d thereon, and the United States, after initially supporting it, adopted a \u201cneutral position\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>court heard oral argument on the request, issued a brief order denying the application and later filed a memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The district court concluded, after \u201c[b]alancing all arguments both for and against the release\u201d, that \u201cthe potential damage in the event of release of the tapes outweighs any benefit to the public if the tapes are released\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The primary justification for this conclusion was the district court\u2019s fear, articulated in a variety of ways, that it would be difficult to empanel a fair and impartial jury if the tapes were televised and a retrial of the case was required. The court also stated that it would be unfair to the defendants to release the tapes at that time, for the court had yet to rule on their motions to dismiss the indictment because of alleged governmental violations of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d and due process. Finally, the court was concerned that release of the tapes would injure innocent third persons who were mentioned on the tapes. Although the court recognized the public interest in the conduct of public officials,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it concluded that this interest did not overcome those which weighed against the requested release, since the press and public had been given full access to the courtroom during the trial and the case had been widely reported in the press and media.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">The broadcasters appealed from the court\u2019s order and a motion panel of this court granted their motion for expedited review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">As all parties agree, the existence of the common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is indisputable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This right \u201cserves the important function of ensuring the integrity of judicial proceedings in particular and of the law enforcement process more generally.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And although the right was first recognized at a time when records were documentary in nature, it is now settled that the right extends to records which are not in written form, such as audio<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and video <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>It is equally clear, however, that the right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, as we observed in Hubbard:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">the tradition of access is not without its time-honored exceptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Every court has supervisory power over its own records and files, and access has been denied where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes. For example, the common-law right of inspection has bowed before the power of a court to insure that its records are not \u201cused to gratify private spite or promote public scandal\u201d through the publication of \u201cthe painful and sometimes disgusting details of a divorce case.\u201d Similarly, courts have refused to permit their files to serve as reservoirs of libelous statements for press consumption, or as sources of business information that might harm a litigant\u2019s competitive standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\"><em>[Nixon v. Warner Communications, </em>435 U.S. 589, 598, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 1312, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978)] (citations omitted). The public has in the past been excluded, temporarily or permanently, from court proceedings or the records of court proceedings to protect private as well as public interests: to protect trade secrets, or the privacy and reputation of victims of crimes, as well as to guard against risks to national security interests, and to minimize the danger of an unfair trial by adverse publicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">Because of the difficulties inherent in formulating a broad yet clear rule to govern the variety of situations in which the right of access must be reconciled with legitimate countervailing public or private interests, the decision as to access is one which rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-19\">This discretion, however, is not open-ended. Rather, access may be denied only if the district court, after considering \u201cthe relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case\u201d,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and after \u201cweighing the interests advanced by the parties in light of the public interest and the duty of the courts\u201d,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> concludes that \u201cjustice so requires\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court\u2019s discretion must \u201cclearly be informed by this country\u2019s strong tradition of access to judicial proceedings\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In balancing the competing interests, the court must also give appropriate weight and consideration to the \u201cpresumption \u2014 however gauged \u2014 in favor of public access to judicial records.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Any denial or infringement of this \u201cprecious\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and \u201cfundamental\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> common law right remains subject to appellate review for abuse.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-21\">We now consider whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the broadcasters\u2019 <em>post-trial </em>application to inspect and copy the video and audio tapes. The broadcasters argue that the court erred by failing to give sufficient weight to the interests weighing in favor of the application and by failing to follow our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>United States v. </em>Mitchell<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Myers.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The broadcasters contend that <em>Myers </em>is particularly persuasive here, since <em>Myers </em>approved an order allowing the broadcasters to copy the video tapes introduced into evidence in the ABSCAM trial of Congressman Myers on the same day that they were played to the jury. Appellee Jenrette maintains that the district court simply cannot be said to have abused its discretion under the circumstances of this case. We find ourselves in essential agreement with the broadcasters.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The only consideration given by our district court to the interests favoring the application was its recognition that the public has a legitimate interest in learning of the conduct of its elected officials.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But in recognizing this interest, the court also found, in essence, that it had been served by the fact that the trial had been widely publicized and had been open to the public and the press. We think this analysis gives short shrift to the many factors favoring release of the tapes at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">First, the fact that the tapes were admitted into evidence and played to the jury weighs heavily in favor of the application. As we have previously observed, \u201cthe general rule is that \u2018[a] trial is a public event,\u2019 and \u2018[w]hat transpires in the court room is public property.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Second, the tapes had been seen and heard by those members of the press and public who attended the trial. Our cases have recognized that such previous access is a factor which lends support to subsequent access.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Third, the tapes contain only admissible evidence, were introduced for the purpose of proving the guilt of the defendants, and were obviously relied upon by the jury in finding the defendants guilty of the offenses charged. Thus, releasing the tapes will promote the integrity of the judicial process, for such will open at least part of the proceedings to those members of the public who could not attend the trial and will thereby enable them, to some degree, to consider for themselves the merits of the jury\u2019s verdict,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the validity of the investigation that produced the evidence. Fourth, the nature of the trial itself is a factor which provides strong support for the application. As noted above, this case involves issues of major public importance \u2014 a high government official has been charged with, and convicted of, betraying the public trust, and law enforcement agencies have been accused of employing tactics which subvert the constitutional rights of the citizenry. Thus, although the public\u2019s First Amendment right of access to the trial itself was fully respected in this case,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and although the case was reported by the press and broadcast media, we believe that following the trial \u201cthere remains a legitimate and important interest in affording members of the public their own opportunity to see and hear evidence that records the activities of a Member of Congress ... as well as agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Finally, the tapes sought are fully encompassed by the presumption in favor of access to judicial records. In sum, we conclude that the instant facts present a strong case for recognizing the common law right to inspect and copy judicial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">In denying the broadcasters\u2019 application the court relied primarily upon the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ants\u2019 interest in securing a fair and impartial jury should their cases be retried. The court noted that several defense motions were pending before it which the court characterized as \u201cnot frivolous\u201d.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If new trials were granted, the court stated, release of the tapes would jeopardize the defendants\u2019 rights because (1) the broadcasters probably would play portions of the tapes at or near the beginning of any retrial, accompanied by references to the pri- or verdicts and the court\u2019s rulings on the defendants\u2019 motions and (2) the broadcasters probably would not play the tapes in their entirety, due to time restrictions, but would air only selected portions of the tapes in a manner presenting the defendants in the most unfavorable light.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Protecting the rights of Jenrette and Stowe in the event of new trials is a perfectly valid consideration, but our decision in <em>Mitchell </em>makes it clear that restricting the common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is rarely the proper protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>following the conclusion of the Watergate conspiracy trial, the district court refused to allow several television stations and a large manufacturer of phonograph records to copy the audio tapes which-had been introduced into evidence and played to the jury in that case. The court stated that it was \u201cunwilling to \u2018take any action which carries the risk of causing possible prejudice\u2019 \u201d to the convicted defendants should their convictions be reversed on appeal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release the tapes merely to avoid the risk of causing possible prejudice at a <em>\u201chypothetical </em>\u201d second trial.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> First, we doubted whether the risk of potential prejudice at a hypothetical second trial could ever justify infringing upon the common law right of access to judicial records. We noted that this argument, taken to its logical conclusion, could result in the tapes never being released since any conviction is always subject to the possibility of successful collateral attack.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> More importantly, however, we found that the risk of prejudice was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>sufficiently grave in that case to justify the district court\u2019s action. The tapes at issue contained only admissible evidence, and not \u201can inadmissible confession, a list of prior convictions or other prejudicial evidence that, although part of the court\u2019s records, was kept from the jury\u201d.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We also considered it unlikely that listening to the tapes prior to any retrial would \u201crender every listener incapable of \u2018laypng] aside his impression or opinion and renderpng] a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We found support for this conclusion in the conduct of the parties at the trial, noting that neither the defendants nor the government had objected to the release of the tapes at the time the district court issued its opinion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We think <em>Mitchell </em>is fully applicable here. Although the trial court characterized the motions filed by Jenrette and Stowe as \u201cnonfrivolous\u201d, the prospect of a retrial remains speculative. We accordingly still remain wary of sanctioning denial of a post-trial application to copy and inspect judicial records based on the pendency of new trial requests that may ultimately be denied, although they cannot be dismissed at the threshold as frivolous. This is not a case where the court has indicated it is inclined to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Furthermore, should the presently hypothetical second trial become a reality, we find nothing in the record to indicate that there would be significant difficulty in assembling a panel of the \u201cimpartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors\u201d to which the defendants would be constitutionally entitled.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We agree that broadcasting the video and audio tapes might increase the percentage of the potential venire which possesses some knowledge of the facts and issues, and even the evidence, involved in the case. We also acknowledge that the tapes may be broadcast in a manner which does not give \u201cequal time\u201d to the portions Jenrette contends support his claim of innocence. We also think it likely, however, that a significant percentage of the potential jury pool will not see or hear the tapes, or if they do, will quickly forget much of what they saw. In the words of the Second Circuit, we think there is somewhat of a tendency to \u201cfrequently overestimate the extent of the public\u2019s awareness of news\u201d.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">As to those potential jurors who do see and hear the tapes, and upon whom they make a more substantial impression, we doubt, as we did in <em>Mitchell, </em>whether such exposure will render it impossible to secure a qualified jury. As in <em>Mitchell, </em>the tapes at issue here contain only admissible evidence and were played to the first jury. As in <em>Mitchell, </em>we have no record basis for believing the same tapes will not be played in their entirety to any second jury. Thus, broadcasting the tapes will not expose those potential jurors who see or hear them to any legally prejudicial evidence which, as jurors in the second trial, they would be barred from viewing or considering in reaching a verdict. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that the broadcasting of the tapes will be so prolonged or so intensive that it would create more prejudice than the unequalled media publicity which preceded the Watergate trials and which this court en banc held did not deny a fair trial.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Finally, to the extent that some members of the potential jury pool are so affected by the broadcasting of the tapes that they are unqualified to sit under these standards, voir dire has long been recognized as an effective method of rooting out such bias,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> especially when conducted in a careful and thoroughgoing manner.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Chief Justice Burger discusses other therapeutic measures in <em>Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Appellee Jenrette nevertheless argues that the likelihood of prejudice in this case is extremely great. Jenrette points out that this case differs from <em>Mitchell </em>since neither the government nor the defendants there objected to release of the tapes at issue, while here he objects to their release. He also contends <em>Myers </em>is inapplicable because it is factually distinguishable on a number of grounds. According to Jenrette, these factors, some of which were relied upon by the district court, compel the conclusion that the district court properly denied the broadcasters\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">We disagree. <em>Mitchell </em>by no means held that \u201cprejudice exists when a party objects, and does not if one does not\u201d. Rather, <em>Mitchell </em>simply recognized that the conduct of the parties to the trial is evidence which may be considered in determining whether there exists a truly significant risk of prejudice. And the parties\u2019 conduct in this case lends support to our conclusion that the risk is this case does not warrant denial of the broadcasters\u2019 post-trial application, for of the three parties involved, neither Stowe, whose rights in the event of a retrial are at stake,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> nor the government, object to releasing the tapes. Thus, we remain of the view that this case is fairly covered by the holding in <em>Mitchell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">We also find the distinctions drawn between this case and <em>Myers </em>to be inaccurate or unpersuasive. Jenrette contends that <em>Myers </em>does not support the broadcasters\u2019 application because Congressman Myers does not face the possibility of a retrial. Jenrette contrasts this with his case, in which motions for retrials are outstanding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>This purported distinction, however, lends little support to Jenrette\u2019s cause. For although <em>Myers </em>does not address the effect of releasing the tapes on any potential retrial of Myers, it does address the effect of releasing the tapes on subsequent trials of Myers\u2019 three co-defendants which were scheduled to occur, if the defendants did not plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">At the time the trial court granted the broadcasters\u2019 application, three defendants indicted and tried along with Congressman Myers faced future ABSCAM trials on indictments unrelated to the charges brought in <em>Myers. </em>These three defendants argued to the Second Circuit that releasing the tapes would have a prejudicial effect on their ability to secure fair and impartial juries in these subsequent trials. The Second Circuit nevertheless affirmed the trial court\u2019s order, specifically rejecting the argument that broadcasting the <em>Myers\u2019 </em>tapes \u201cpose[d] the kind of risk to fair trials . . . that justifies curtailing the public\u2019s right of access to courtroom evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Thus, given that future trials were almost certain to occur in <em>Myers, </em>while here they remain a mere possibility, the <em>Myers </em>decision not only fails to support Jenrette\u2019s argument but actually weighs against it.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Jenrette also attempts to distinguish <em>Myers </em>on the grounds that Congressman Myers did not assert the defense of entrapment, as did he, and entrapment is a difficult concept for laymen to understand. The significance of this distinction apparently lies in the assumption that the concept will be even more bewildering to laymen after they have seen the tapes at issue here. Another purported distinction between the cases is that the population of New York is less \u201csensitive\u201d to, and less interested in, news concerning the activities of persons in the federal government than the citizens of the District of Columbia. We do not find these arguments persuasive. Acknowledging that Myers did not assert the defense of entrapment, and even engaging in the somewhat dubious assumption that the population of the District of Columbia would be affected to a greater degree than the population of New York by viewing and hearing the tapes, the fact remains that any retrial of Jenrette or Stowe at this stage is speculative. And assuming that the hypothetical retrials become realities, we remain convinced that the trial court possesses sufficient means to combat any threats to the rights of the defendants.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">We thus adhere to our holding in <em>Mitchell </em>that the interest in avoiding the risk of potential prejudice at a <em>hypothetical </em>second trial is seldom of sufficient weight to justify denying access to judicial records which have been displayed in open court. We also conclude that there has been no showing in this case that the risk of prejudice is so grave that it outweighs the interests favoring release of the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Another factor the district court found to weigh in favor of denying the broadcasters\u2019 application was that it seemed \u201cunfair\u201d to the defendants to release the tapes when the court had yet to rule on their nonfrivolous motions to dismiss the indictment for lack of fundamental fairness and due process.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Noting that Jenrette claimed to have been \u201ctargeted by political enemies\u201d, the court considered that the defendants should have the opportunity to make further arguments concerning the release of the tapes if the evidence bore out Jenrette\u2019s contention.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The court stated that, if Jenrette\u2019s claim were true, it could be argued that \u201crelease of the tapes would be used to gratify a private spite\u201d.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Appellee Jenrette urges that the district court acted altogether properly. He points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>out that although the court has yet to rule on these motions, it has held two sets of hearings thereon, and has ordered a significant amount of post-trial discovery into the government\u2019s conduct, including the production of 25 volumes of ABSCAM related material for its own <em>in camera </em>review. These developments, it is urged, further demonstrate the nonfrivolous nature of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The pendency of the fundamental fairness and due process motions, in our opinion, does not outweigh the broadcasters\u2019 right to inspect and copy the tapes. These motions, as we understand them, assert that the indictment should be dismissed because of governmental misconduct, regardless of what the defendants may have done \u2014 that is, regardless of whether the actions of the defendants would otherwise amount to prosecutable crimes. These motions apparently do not challenge the integrity of the tapes \u2014 for example, that they have been doctored in any fashion \u2014 nor do they contend the conduct and statements recorded thereon did not occur or were inaccurately recorded. Furthermore, the tapes have already been seen and heard by the jury and those members of the press and public who attended the trial, and the media coverage thereof has made their contents known to some degree to the public. Under these circumstances, while the media may in a sense be flogging a dead horse, we see no \u201cunfairness\u201d in permitting the public at large to see and hear now what has already been publicly viewed and heard in court, what the defendants do not claim did not occur, and what the jury evidently considered to be weighty evidence of criminal misconduct.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And, under these circumstances, Jenrette\u2019s concern for his reputation and any embarrassment which may flow from the additional disclosure of the tapes is entitled to little weight, for \u201cthe embarrassment . .. anticipate]]!] is largely that which results whenever misconduct or questionable conduct is exposed.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Any \u201cunfairness\u201d to Jenrette which may result from the release of the tapes will be sufficiently countered by the publicity which will surely accompany any dismissal of the indictment, if that should occur. The nature and the extent of the government\u2019s misconduct will undoubtedly be as newsworthy as the criminal activities in which the jury found both Jenrette and Stowe to have engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The district court also grounded its denial of access on the possible injury and invasion of privacy which might be inflicted upon innocent third persons who were referred to on the tapes by either the defendants or the FBI operatives, and who were sometimes held up to public ridicule. The court cited as one example of this potential harm an unsupported remark on a portion of the tapes that another member of Congress was susceptible to taking a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Possible injury to innocent third persons is certainly a factor that may properly be taken into account by the district courts in passing upon applications to copy and inspect judicial records.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> For example, in <em>In Re Application of KSTP Television For Video Tapes in the Case of United States of America v. Ming Sen Shiue,</em><footnotemark><em>57</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a television station callously sought to copy and televise three hours of color videotape that had been introduced into evidence and played to the jury in the federal kidnapping trial of defendant Shiue. Shiue, an electronics expert, had kidnapped and repeatedly raped a woman, who was a church missionary worker and the wife of a clergyman, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>videotaped the entire nine hour ordeal. The court received into evidence only those tapes which recorded the conversations and conduct which occurred preliminary to the actual rapes. These tapes showed the blindfolded victim lying on a blanket on the floor, with her hands and feet bound. The victim, the government, and the defendant all objected to the release of the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">After reviewing the decisions in <em>Mitchell, Nixon, </em>and <em>Myers, </em>Judge Devitt denied the application. He reasoned that releasing the tapes would not advance the public interest, as would the airing of alleged criminal conduct of high public officials in the Watergate and ABSCAM cases, but would rather serve the improper purpose of supporting sensationalism and pandering to prurient interests.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> And in the strongest of language, he refused to release the tapes when to do so would \u201cexpose [the victim] to public humiliation and degradation[,] . . . would ... be unseemly and shameless[,] . . . [and] would constitute an unconscionable invasion of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ambd\">We agree fully with Judge Devitt\u2019s decision, and admit that we find the interest in avoiding injury to innocent third persons to be the most significant interest identified by the district court which weighs against the broadcasters\u2019 application. However, out of all the material contained in the tapes played to the jury, the district court identified only one objectionable remark. This indicates to us that the overwhelming majority of the recordings sought pose no threat of such harm. We also note that none of the innocent third persons involved, including the aforementioned member of Congress, objected in any manner to the broadcasters\u2019 application, either in the district court or in this court. Possibly they were unaware of the reference. We are nevertheless mindful of the harm to innocent third persons which could flow from public dissemination of libelous or other harmful material contained in the tapes. Accordingly, we direct the district court on remand to order the deletion of the reference to the member of Congress and to receive any objections which innocent third persons mentioned on the tapes might make to release of those portions of the tapes which contain objectionable material. Such objections should be considered in light of the principles set forth in this opinion. If the objections are found to be meritorious, the district court may sanitize the objectionable portions of the tapes to remove the offending remarks or order that the identity of the innocent third person be deleted.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">In summary, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the broadcasters\u2019 post-trial application to inspect and copy the video and audio tapes introduced into evidence and played to the jury in the criminal trial of Jenrette and Stowe.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As noted above, the trial raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>issues of major public importance relating to the conduct not only of the defendants but also of government law enforcement agents. The interests supporting the broadcasters\u2019 application, including the presumption of access, weigh heavily in favor of releasing the tapes. The countervailing interests, except as to innocent third persons, whether considered in isolation or in combination, are insufficient, in our opinion, to justify shielding the tapes from public scrutiny. Accordingly, the order of the district court is reversed, and the ease is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">Whoever, being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly asks, demands, exacts, solicits, seeks, accepts, receives, or agrees to receive anything of value for himself or for any other person or entity, in return for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">(1) being influenced in his performance of any official act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">(2) being influenced to commit or aid in committing, or to collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">(3) being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of his official duty [ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">[shall be fined not more than $20,000 or three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZO\">If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-19\">.

Thus, broadcasting the tapes amounts to an impermissible broadcasting of the trial itself. Brief of Appellee John W. Jenrette at 17. To reject this argument, we need only note the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding (and clarification of Estes) that the act of televising a trial does not amount to a per se violation of due process. <em>Chandler v.

Thus, the question whether tapes which were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>played to the jury should be released, if sought, is not before us, and we express no opinion thereon. Our decision does not require the release of such tapes. We note only that substantially different considerations may come into play when the records sought have not previously been made public. <em>See Hubbard, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
