The Board\u2019s order required Gibraltar to (1) cease and desist from interfering with employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights, (2) bargain with the intervenor, International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union (\u201cILGWU\u201d or \u201cUnion\u201d), (3) reestablish operations at Olive Hill, Kentucky, and (4) offer the laid off employees reinstatement and make them whole for any loss of earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">This order was based, in part, upon a finding that Gibraltar had violated Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA by creating the impression that employees\u2019 union activities were under surveillance, coercively interrogating employees about union activities and threatening plant closure if the ILGWU succeeded in its organizing campaign, and otherwise interfering with the employees\u2019 right to organize. The Board also found that Gibraltar had violated Section 8(a)(5), (3) and (1) by failing to bargain in good faith on wages with the ILGWU, closing its Olive Hill plant and transferring work to a facility located in New York, and insisting that any negotiations regarding the effects of the closure take place in New York, over the phone or through the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">At the same time, the Board ordered Case to cease and desist from interfering with its employees\u2019 Section 7 rights. The Board required Case to reinstate a discharged employee, Anita Wilburn, with back pay, finding that her termination had been motivated by anti-union animus. All references in her employment record regarding alleged poor work were to be expunged. In addition, the results of a union representation election which Upper South (a local of the ILGWU) had lost were to be reopened and retabulated. Even if the Union did not carry a majority, Case was to bargain collectively with Upper South.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">This order was based upon a finding that Case had violated Section 8(a)(1) by threatening its employees with loss of work if the Union prevailed in the election, interrogating employees about their Union activities, and coercing other employees into campaigning against the Union. The Board also found that Upper South had attained majority status in an appropriate unit and that Case\u2019s refusal to recognize and bargain with Upper South violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">Three major issues are presented by this appeal. First, did Gibraltar fail to bargain in good faith with the ILGWU and was its subsequent plant closure unlawful under the NLRA? Second, did Case unlawfully discharge Anita Wilburn because of her union support? Third, did Case engage in unlawful anti-union activities, thereby prejudicing the representation election and requiring a bargaining order? Under the law; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>the NLRB\u2019s decision must be upheld if there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaAv\">\u201c[s]ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.\u201d . . .

NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (quoting <em>Labor Board v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Gibraltar manufactures sleeping bags and other quilted materials at a facility located in Brooklyn, New York. In early 1976, Gibraltar began manufacturing sleeping bags in a facility located in Olive Hill, Kentucky. Nevertheless, the lions\u2019 share of Gibraltar\u2019s business remained in New York, where employees had been represented by the ILGWU and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">Gibraltar\u2019s Olive Hill plant consisted of several sewing and quilting machines operated by seventeen employees. During the summer of 1976, the ILGWU began an organizational effort at Olive Hill. On October 12, 1976, the ILGWU was certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of a unit of production, maintenance, shipping and receiving employees, pursuant to an election held on October 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">Case manufactures clothing at a facility located in Olive Hill. It regularly performs subcontract work for Gibraltar. In 1976, Case employed approximately 200 workers. Early that year, Upper South, a local division of the ILGWU, began an organizational effort at the Case plant. Authorization cards were collected and an election was held on November 16, 1976. The employees east ninety-four votes for Upper South and ninety-seven votes against; nine ballots were challenged on the ground that the employees were not members of the appropriate unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">The Board and the Union contend that Gibraltar failed to negotiate in good faith after the ILGWU had been certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the garment workers at Gibraltar\u2019s Olive Hill plant. The Union presented a contract to Gibraltar containing approximately thirty-seven major provisions. Although agreement was had on nearly thirty provisions, Gibraltar and the Union failed to agree on certain \u201ceconomic items\u201d which included wage rates, overtime policy, piece-work rates, and health care benefits. Contract negotiations lasted over a two month period; however, there were only two actual negotiating sessions. The course of events is summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Gibraltar claims it did not refuse to negotiate on \u201ceconomic terms\u201d; rather, it proposed a \u201ctwo-year pass,\u201d that is, a two-year contract embracing the thirty mutually accepted terms but maintaining current wage and benefit levels. Gibraltar asserts that the nature of its operations (much of it being government contract work obtained on a low bid basis), as well as economic necessity and market conditions required a wage/benefit freeze until enough business could be obtained to sustain profitability. The Board, however, found that the company had not negotiated in good faith, noting Gibraltar\u2019s refusal to compromise on the \u201ctwo-year pass\u201d position and interpreting the company\u2019s pre-election activities (for example, interrogation and promise of benefits) as evidence of anti-union animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Upon a thorough review of the record as a whole, we cannot find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings. First, Gibraltar\u2019s pre-election statements and actions were not violative of the NLRA and do not demonstrate a hostile attitude toward the Union. Rather the record shows that Gibraltar\u2019s management viewed unionization as a prelude to increased wages and costs which would in turn prevent the Olive Hill plant from turning a profit. Gibraltar operated a much larger plant in New York, and Mr. Foreman, the president of Gibraltar, believed the Olive Hill work could be performed in New York if a profit could not be earned in Olive Hill. As evidenced by the entire record, Mr. Foreman\u2019s attitude was that of a rational businessman concerned about minimizing costs, a particularly relevant concern for a business that is involved in government contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">There was no evidence of any personal dislike for unions on Mr. Foreman\u2019s part; in fact, Gibraltar was unionized in New York. The record indicates that the company had a history of relationships with both the ILGWU and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">Likewise there is no evidence that certain remarks of a subordinate supervisor created an atmosphere of surveillance at the plant. The suspect statements were abbreviated and ambiguous, occurred only twice, and were made privately to one other employee. Furthermore, we find no evidence that Mr. Foreman threatened plant closure or loss of work if the employees unionized; rather, Mr. Foreman\u2019s informal comments described the effect of a negotiation stalemate and possible strike on plant operations. In this particular instance, his statements did not transgress the free speech limitations articulated in <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">The Administrative Law Judge took notice of a local newspaper article wherein Mr. Foreman was quoted as saying he would not be forced by anyone to do anything regarding the operation of the Olive Hill plant. At the administrative hearing, the reporter who interviewed Foreman was uncertain about the conversation and admitted that he had not reported the full context of Foreman\u2019s comments. Even if the article is accurate, it is at best ambiguous. The article provides no evidence that Foreman refused to negotiate, but only that he would not be told how to operate his company. These statements followed upon the heels of negotiations during which the company opposed union involvement in setting piece-work rates for government contract bids, in itself not an unreasonable bargaining position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">Finally, the record clearly demonstrates that Gibraltar negotiated and eventually agreed with the Union on many proposals. The Union requested and the company provided information on wage rates, job classifications, vacation policies and benefit programs. Gibraltar even made advantageous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>proposals on overtime rates. There also was testimony by the principal ILGWU organizer indicating the company\u2019s willingness to negotiate. Granted, Gibraltar stoutly resisted Union efforts to increase the basic wage package and to involve the Union in setting piece-work rates. Yet, it was no more unfair under the circumstances for the company to maintain this position than it was for the Union to press its demands. This was hard bargaining, the kind countenanced by the NLRA as an inevitable aspect of labor-management relations. It was not unfair bargaining. See <em>NLRB v. United Clay Mines Corp., </em>219 F.2d 120 (6th Cir. 1955). <em>See also McCourt v. California Sports, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1193, 1200 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Fetzer Television, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>317 F.2d 420, 424 (6th Cir. 1963). In short, the evidence clearly shows that a bargaining impasse was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Once negotiations came to an impasse, Gibraltar could temporarily close the Olive Hill plant for bargaining reasons. <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 85 S.Ct. 955,13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965). Furthermore, the company could terminate its business operations for purely economic reasons without transgressing the NLRA. <em>First National Maintenance Corp. v. NLRB, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2573, 69 L.Ed.2d 318 (1981); <em>NLRB v. R. C. Mahon Co., </em>269 F.2d 44 (6th Cir. 1959). As we have indicated, the record does not support the Board\u2019s finding that Gibraltar was motivated by anti-union animus when it closed its Olive Hill plant; rather, the evidence shows a legitimate business reason (/. e., abandoning a non-profitable operation) for Gibraltar\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">However, the Board also found that Gibraltar had failed to negotiate with the Union regarding the effects of closing the Olive Hill plant. Upon review of the record, we believe Gibraltar stood ready and willing to negotiate regarding the effects of its decision to close the Olive Hill plant. On December 20th, Gibraltar wrote Mr. Janis, the principal Union negotiator, expressing a willingness to discuss effects. Given the circumstances, Gibraltar\u2019s desire to pursue discussions in New York does not detract from its expressed willingness to negotiate. Since the Olive Hill plant was closed, and both the Union and Gibraltar had their headquarters in New York, we see nothing unlawful or unreasonable with Gibraltar\u2019s request. As we read the record, the Union has failed to pursue Gibraltar\u2019s suggestion and in fact, has made little or no effort to discuss effects associated with the Olive Hill plant closure. <em>See NLRB v. Royal Plating &amp; Polishing Co., </em>350 F.2d 191, 197 (3rd Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">The Union also claimed Gibraltar violated its duty to bargain by failing to supply information on the company\u2019s costs, profits and losses, customer orders and cancellations, and comparative data on the efficiency of the New York and Olive Hill plants. Union representative Janis requested this information by letter after the Olive Hill plant had been closed. Gibraltar refused to comply with this request, asserting that the information was irrelevant to discussions on the effects of the Olive Hill plant closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">In <em>NLRB v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., </em>351 U.S. 149, 152-53, 76 S.Ct. 753, 755, 100 L.Ed. 1027 (1956), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-12\">Good faith bargaining necessarily requires that claims made by either bargainer should be honest claims. This is true about an asserted inability to pay an increase in wages. If such an argument is important enough to present in the give and take of bargaining, it is important enough to require some sort of proof of its accuracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">However, the Court did not establish a <em>per se </em>rule: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 153-54, 76 S.Ct. at 756. Only recently the Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in <em>Truitt </em>that the duty to supply information turns upon the circumstances of each particular case. <em>Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>440 U.S. 301, 314, 99 S.Ct. 1123, 1130, 59 L.Ed.2d 333 (1979). Thus, although the duty to supply information inheres in the obligation to bargain in good faith, this duty is not unyielding or invariable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>We do not hold, however, that in every case in which economic inability is raised as an argument against increased wages it automatically follows that the employees are entitled to substantiating evidence. The inquiry must always be whether or not under the circumstances of the particular case the statutory obligation to bargain in good faith has been met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>In <em>General Electric Co. v. NLRB, </em>466 F.2d 1177, 1182 (6th Cir. 1972), our court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-6\">[I]f the <em>requested </em>data is <em>relevant </em>and, therefore reasonably necessary to a union\u2019s role as bargaining agent in the administration of a collective bargaining agreement, it is an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8(a)(5) of the Act for an employer to refuse to furnish the requested data. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\"><em>See also NLRB v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., </em>410 F.2d 953, 957 (6th Cir. 1969); <em>NLRB v. J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., Gulistan Div., </em>538 F.2d 1152, 1164 (5th Cir. 1976) (information that is relevant and requested must be supplied). And as our court indicated in <em>NLRB v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., </em>497 F.2d 747 (6th Cir. 1974), the duty to supply information can be measured by the scope of the obligation to negotiate which, in turn, may depend on the actual state of employer-union discussions at any particular point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">At no time during the two month period prior to the Olive Hill plant closure did the Union request information on Gibraltar\u2019s profitability. Only after the two parties reached impasse and Gibraltar lawfully ceased its Olive Hill operation did the Union request financial and wage information. Yet, at this point, the information requested was not relevant to discussions on the effects of the Olive Hill plant closure. Since Gibraltar was under no absolute obligation to negotiate with the Union on its decision to close the Olive Hill plant, <em>First National Maintenance Corp., supra; Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 223, 85 S.Ct. 398, 409, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). (J. Stewart concurring); <em>Levine v.C &amp; W Mining Co., </em>610 F.2d 432, 438 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>NLRB v. Acme Industrial Products, Inc., </em>439 F.2d 40, 42-43 (6th Cir. 1971), nor to continue actual contract negotiations once the Olive Hill operations were lawfully terminated, the requested information could not be compelled on these grounds. <em>Cf. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">As for Case, based upon our review of the entire record, substantial evidence supports some but not all of the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">We do not find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Gene Case, the president of the company, coercively interrogated his employees in violation of the NLRA. Mr. Case\u2019s inquiries into indiviidual employee sentiment and opinion on the subject of unionization were sporadic, occurred in the general work area, and had no discernible effect on employee actions or attitudes. The AU inferred ill-will toward Upper South and individual employees from these isolated events. Such inferences are not supported by the record. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Case knowingly utilized plant supervisors to put pressure on individual employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">On the other hand, there is substantial evidence for the Board\u2019s conclusion that Case had committed an unfair practice by interfering with the union representation election. Mr. Case requested Gibraltar\u2019s president, Mr. Foreman, to speak to Case employees about the election procedures. This, in itself, was not improper. Foreman visited the Case plant on three separate occasions to explain election procedures to the same group of employees. One speech occurred in September and another in November, approximately two weeks before the election. A third speech was given the day before the election. However, the evidence demonstrates that Foreman instructed the Case workforce on more than elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>tion procedures. It is clear that during these speeches Foreman painted a rather glum future for Case employees in the event of unionization. His comments were of a general nature and carried a veiled but strong threat of serious economic repercussions if Upper South won the election. As the AU noted, many of his comments were \u201cbased on unwarranted hypothetical assumptions.\u201d It must also be remembered that Mr. Foreman was well-known to Case employees as one of their company\u2019s principal customers. His statements as to the effect of the ILGWU\u2019s bargaining demands on Gibraltar\u2019s Olive Hill plant tended to characterize unionization as a threat to Case\u2019s business and, in turn, to its employees\u2019 livelihoods. Such a speech violates the rule established in Gissel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-4\">[A]n employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionization or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not contain a \u201cthreat of reprisal of force or promise of benefit.\u201d He may even make a prediction as to the <em>precise effects </em>he believes unionization will have on his company. <em>In such a case, however, the prediction must be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact to convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\"><em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. at 1942 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also NLRB v. Southern Electronics Co., </em>430 F.2d 1391 (6th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">As for Anita Wilburn, we have reviewed the record and find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding of a discriminatory discharge. As noted by the ALJ, Wilburn\u2019s work at the Case plant had been satisfactory; in fact, she had been working at Case for approximately six months without any complaint as to the quality of her performance. When Wilburn returned from a period of maternity leave, she became active in the Upper South unionization effort. Mr. Case and another supervisor asked Wilburn about her feelings toward the company and union. We do not find these questions to be unlawful in themselves. Yet, as noted by the ALJ, it was only after Wilburn continued to express her support for the union in the upcoming election (which included wearing a T-shirt which read \u201cDear Gene: If you bug me, the government will get thee\u201d) that complaints about her work began to materialize. In fact, a few days after Wilburn refused to divulge who had printed the T-shirt she received her first warning. Within a month Wilburn had rapidly received a series of warnings, was suspended, and finally was discharged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-9\">When the record establishes a prima facie case that \u201cthe employer engaged in discriminatory conduct which could have adversely affected employee rights to <em>some </em>extent, the burden is upon the employer to establish that he was motivated by legitimate objectives since proof of motivation is most accessible to him.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>388 U.S. 26, 34 [87 S.Ct. 1792,1797, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027] ... (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\"><em>NLRB v. Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 243 (3rd Cir. 1976). <em>See also NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666 (1st Cir. 1979). Considering all the circumstances surrounding the discharge, a prima facie case of discrimination was proved, and the ALJ properly determined that there was insufficient evidence of a legitimate motivation for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">Finally, we must determine whether the Board\u2019s bargaining order is appropriate on the record before us. Case has asserted before the ALJ and on appeal that the authorization cards signed by Case employees were invalid since the Union procured these cards by misrepresenting their purpose. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s rejection of this claim. In <em>Gissel </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8N\">There is nothing inconsistent in handing an employee a card that says the signer authorizes the union to represent him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>then telling him that the card will probably be used first to get an election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afv\"><em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 606-07, 89 S.Ct. at 1936. Thus there is support for the Board\u2019s conclusion that the authorization cards were valid and indicated majority support for the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">Nevertheless, as we stated in <em>Donn Products, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>613 F.2d 162, 165 (6th Cir. 1980), \u201cThe Supreme Court [has] made it clear . . . that an election remains the preferred method of determining the choice by employees of a collective bargaining representative.\u201d In <em>Gissel, </em>the Supreme Court specified two categories of unfair labor practices that could warrant the entry of a collective bargaining order: (1) \u201c \u2018exceptional\u2019 cases marked by \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018pervasive\u2019 unfair labor practices,\u201d and (2) \u201cless extraordinary cases marked by less pervasive practices which nonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 613-14, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. In our view, however, the conduct here comes within that \u201cthird category of minor or less extensive unfair labor practices, which because of their minimal impact on the election machinery, will not sustain a bargaining order.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. <em>See also Donn Products, supra, </em>613 F.2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">The remarks made by Mr. Foreman to Case employees at the three separate meetings do not, on the record before us, rise to the level of an \u201cexceptional case\u201d involving \u201coutrageous and pervasive\u201d conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his decision, even the ALJ stated that standing alone, Foreman\u2019s pre-election speeches may not have violated Section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">However, even if these speeches and the improper discharge tended to impede the election process and fall within the second category of unfair labor practices, such unfair practices must be considered \u201cin terms of their past effect on election conditions and the likelihood of their recurrence in the future.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. We take this opportunity to repeat and to emphasize the Third Circuit\u2019s observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-9\">In light of the general and highly desirable practice in industrial relations of selecting bargaining representatives through traditional election processes, a rule requiring the Board to set forth a reasoned analysis justifying a bargaining order under <em>Gissel </em>is salutary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\"><em>Armcor, supra, </em>535 F.2d at 244. Our court has consistently refused to enforce bargaining orders where the Board\u2019s decision was tantamount to \u201c \u2018a litany, reciting conclusions by rote without factual explication.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. East Side Shopper, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 1334, 1336 (6th Cir. 1974) (quoting <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 446, 449 (5th Cir. 1970)). <em>See also NLRB v. Essex Wire Corp., </em>496 F.2d 862, 863 (6th Cir. 1972). Particularly applicable to this case is our decision in <em>Donn </em>Products:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMl\">The Board made no findings or detailed analysis as to the residual impact or continuing effect, or the likelihood of recurrence, of any of the unfair labor practices .... [C]ourts are not required to enforce bargaining orders based on conclusory statements unsupported by sufficient facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\"><em>Donn Products, supra, </em>613 F.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">The lack of analysis regarding the residual impact of the unfair labor practices is fatal to the bargaining order directed to Case, especially where we have found that the record does not support many of the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice determinations. In these circumstances, we believe the purposes of the NLRA and the stability of industrial relations will be served best not by a bargaining order, but by the union seeking another election if so desired. <em>See </em>. <em>Donn Products, supra. </em>Our decision to uphold the unfair labor practice charges, based upon Mr. Foreman\u2019s pre-election remarks and Anita Wilburn\u2019s unlawful discharge, as well as the passage of time, should not only deter any possible efforts to subvert the election process, but should fully remove any taint from the prior violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Accordingly, the Board\u2019s findings regarding Gibraltar\u2019s violations of the NLRA are reversed and enforcement of the entire remedial order against Gibraltar is denied. The Board\u2019s findings regarding Case\u2019s violations of the NLRA are reversed in part and affirmed in part; those unfair labor practice findings pertinent to Wilburn\u2019s illegal discharge and Mr. Foreman\u2019s threatening pre-election speeches are affirmed and all others are reversed. The remedial order is partially enforced, to the extent that it requires reinstating Wilburn with appropriate retroactive benefits and relief to make her whole, and expunging her employment record of the warnings, suspension and discharge. The order enjoining Case from further unfair labor practices is enforced to prevent any interference with the employees\u2019 exercise of their Section 7 rights. All other aspects of the remedial order, including the bargaining order issued against Case, are denied enforcement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">. <em>October 19, 1976 </em>\u2014 The Union delivers its contract proposal to Gibraltar, containing thirty-seven provisions.
