Wiggins, a former employee of the United States Postal Service who challenges his dismissal from that agency, seeks to appeal an adverse order of the Merit Systems Review Board (the Board) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) (Supp. Ill 1979). However, this action is a \u201ccase of discrimination subject to the provisions of [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702]; \u201d in such a case the circuit courts have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the employee must instead bring an action in the district courts. In order to protect Wiggins\u2019 proper remedies, we vacate the Board\u2019s order and remand this case to the Board so that it may enter a fresh order on the basis of which Wiggins may bring a timely action in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Wiggins contends that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) confers jurisdiction on the courts of appeals to hear appeals from final judgments of the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 7703(b)(1) as a general rule does indeed grant such jurisdiction. However, section 7703(b)(2) excepts from this jurisdiction \u201ccases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702].\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action is just such a \u201ccase of discrimination.\u201d Wiggins challenges his dismissal by the Postal Service on several grounds, but one of these is the government\u2019s alleged discrimination against him on the basis of his handicap. Wiggins\u2019 claim ultimately rests on section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791 (1976), which the Board is empowered to enforce by virtue of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1) (Supp. Ill 1979). Wiggins\u2019 discrimination claim is thus dearly within the bounds of section 7702, <em>supra </em>at note 2, which by its own terms applies to \u201cany employee . . . who . . . alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by . . . section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Since Wiggins relies for his discrimination claim on section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, he may seek review of the Board\u2019s decision only by filing an action in accordance with section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1976). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(l) (Supp. Ill 1979). Section 717(c) allows the aggrieved employee to file a civil action \u201cas provided in section 2000e-5 of this title;\u201d section 2000e-5(f)(3) places the jurisdiction of actions allowed therein in the district courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore Wiggins\u2019 proper remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lies not in an appeal to this court, but rather in an original civil action filed in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the legislative history of section 7703. Prior to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (the Act), employees who sought to challenge final decisions of the Civil Service Commission were generally required to file their claims in the district courts. However, appeals to such a large number of courts \u201ccaused wide variations in the kinds of decisions which [had] been issued on the same or similar matters;\u201d in order to remedy this problem, the Congress provided in section 7703 that final orders of the Board (which, along with the Office of Personnel Management, has replaced the Civil Service Commission) generally be reviewable by the Court of Claims and the courts of appeals. S.Rep.No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 63 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2723, 2785. But the Congress was careful to except from this change in appellate jurisdiction all eases involving complaints of discrimination. Review in such cases was left to original actions brought in the district courts; this procedure was adopted in order to protect \u201cthe existing rights of employees to trial de novo\u201d in discrimination cases. H.R.Conf.Rep.No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 141 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2860, 2874. As the Senate Report on the Act explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">District court is a more appropriate place than the Court of Appeals for these cases since they may involve additional fact-finding. Furthermore, discrimination complaints involving employees outside the Federal government are now considered by U.S. District Courts. To encourage uniformity in judicial decisions in this area both kinds of cases should continue to be considered by the U.S. District Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">S.Rep.No. 95-969, <em>supra, </em>at 63. The discrimination claim in the case now before us is particularly appropriate for district court consideration, for Wiggins has moved in this court to introduce additional evidence which is not in the administrative record of the Board. Since he is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review, Wiggins may introduce his additional evidence in an original proceeding brought in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In addition to his discrimination claim, Wiggins challenges the procedures under which he was dismissed by the Postal Service. This \u201cmixed\u201d nature of the case raises an important jurisdictional question: does section 7703 require the district court to decide the employee\u2019s non-discrimination claims along with his discrimination claims? We believe that it does, and we therefore decline to retain jurisdiction over Wiggins\u2019 non-discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Our analysis begins with the language of the statute. Section 7702 is not limited to individual <em>claims </em>of discrimination, but is instead extended to any <em>\u201ccase </em>of any employee . . . who alleges that <em>a basis </em>for the action was discrimination .... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(1) (emphasis added). This language echoes descriptions found in the legislative history of the Act. The Senate Report, for example, refers to the district courts\u2019 jurisdiction over decisions and orders of the board \u201cinvolving discrimination complaints.\u201d S.Rep.No. 95-969, <em>supra, </em>at 63. Thus, both the statute and its legislative history define jurisdiction in terms of \u201ccases\u201d which \u201cinvolve discrimination,\u201d and not in terms of \u201cdiscrimination claims;\u201d this suggests that the Congress intended district court jurisdiction to extend to <em>all </em>claims in any case involving a charge of discrimination. Indeed, this interpretation is consistent with the statute\u2019s treatment of mixed cases in previous stages of the process: section 7702 explicitly requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Board in appealable cases alleging both discrimination and non-discrimination claims to decide <em>both </em>issues. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a) (1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We recognize that the Congress sought as a general rule to vest jurisdiction of appeals from Board decisions not involving discrimination claims in the courts of appeals; as noted above, the Congress desired thereby to reduce the \u25a0 wide variations in decisions which had resulted from appeals to district courts. However, this concern must be tempered with the fact that district court decisions in such cases are themselves appealable to the courts of appeals, and must be balanced against the tremendous waste of judicial resources that bifurcation of one case between district and circuit courts would inevitably entail. If an individual appeal from the Board were divided into separate discrimination and nondiscrimination cases, the district and circuit courts each would be required initially to hear the case, and each would be forced to consider the case in the absence of some claims which may be dispositive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the context of these concerns we are convinced that the statutory language should be read literally, that is, to vest initial jurisdiction in the district courts over any \u201ccase\u201d in which an employee alleges discrimination as \u201ca basis for the action.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">If this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, Wiggins will be unable to procure any judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in his case, for the time limit for initiating an action in the district courts has already passed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1976). However, since the question of jurisdiction \u201cwas not obviously settled by prior decisions,\u201d we think it proper to frame our order so as \u201cto save [Wiggins\u2019] proper remedies.\u201d <em>Phillips v. United States, </em>312 U.S. 246, 254, 61 S.Ct. 480, 484, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941). Accordingly, we VACATE the order of the Board and REMAND this case to the Board so that it may enter a fresh order on the basis of which Wiggins may bring a timely action in the district courts. <em>See, e. g., MTM, Inc. v. Baxley, </em>420 U.S. 799, 804, 95 S.Ct. 1278, 1281, 43 L.Ed.2d 636 (1975); <em>Mitchell v. Donovan, </em>398 U.S. 427, 431-32, 90 S.Ct. 1763, 1765, 26 L.Ed.2d 378 (1970); <em>Phillips v.

Wiggins does not contend that his action is not \u201ca case of discrimination,\u201d but he does argue that his action is not \u201csubject to the provisions of section 7702.\u201d For this contention Wiggins relies on section 7702(e), which in certain circumstances allows an employee to file a civil action in the district courts despite the absence of a final, judicially reviewable order. It is true that Wiggins\u2019 action does not fall under section 7702(e), for the circumstances enumerated therein arise only when the employer agency, the Board or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fail to act on the employee\u2019s complaint within a specified period of time; in this case the Board timely issued its decision. However, section 7702(e) is not the <em>only </em>source of reviewable orders under section 7702. It was designed merely to \u201cassure the employee the right to have as expeditious a resolution of the matter as possible.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep.No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 140-41 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S. Co'cie Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2723, 2860, 2874.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-21\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3) (Supp. Ill 1979) provides the rules for both jurisdiction and venue. The section reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-22\">Each United States district court and each United States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter. Such an action may be brought in any judicial district in the State in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or in the judicial district in which the aggrieved person would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office. For purposes of sections 1404 and 1406 of Title 28, the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office shall in all cases be considered a district in which the action might have been brought.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Conceivably the circuit court could hold the appeal on non-discrimination claims in abeyance pending completion of proceedings in the district court on discrimination claims. At best, however, this would alleviate only some of the judicial waste, for the district court would still have no choice but to hear the discrimination claim in isolation from non-discrimination claims which may be dispositive of the case. Moreover, we have found no statutory venue requirement that simultaneous district and circuit court appeals be brought in the same circuit, and this fact would make it difficult at best to coordinate the two cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b278-20\">. Wiggins argues that in the interest of judicial economy the entire case should be heard in the court of appeals, treating his discrimination claims as somehow \u201cancillary\u201d to his non-discrimination claims. We disagree. Although consolidation of the case for hearing by any one court, district or circuit, would avoid a waste of judicial resources, consolidation before the circuit court would ignore both the literal terms of the statute and the reason for placing jurisdiction in the district courts to begin with: the employee is entitled to a <em>de novo </em>hearing on his discrimination claim, and such a factual proceeding is possible only in the district courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
