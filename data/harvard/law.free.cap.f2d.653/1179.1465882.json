Because the record before us is insufficient to support the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary adjudication of the Department\u2019s claims, we reverse the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">The Illinois Department of Agriculture is charged by statute with responsibility for regulating grain dealers, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 301-311 (1979), and grain warehouses, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 114, \u00a7 214.1 et seq. (1979). On January 12, 1978, the Department seized grain in the possession of John Gorenz, doing business as Gorenz Grain Company, who was, it appears, performing the functions of a grain dealer and/or a grain warehouseman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Acting pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 127, \u00a7 40.23 (1979), the Department subsequently sold the grain and retained the proceeds of the sale (approximately $38,000). Section 40.23 empowers the Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-5\">To control surety bonds and trust funds and to establish trust accounts and bank accounts in adequately protected finan- . cial institutions, to hold monies received by the Director of Agriculture when acting as trustee, to protect the assets of licensees for the benefit of claimants, to collect and disburse the proceeds of such bonds and trust funds when acting as trustee on behalf of claimants without responsibility for the management and operation of discontinued or insolvent businesses, such funds or additions thereto in which the State of Illinois has no right, title or interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">On January 23, 1978, Gorenz filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and was adjudicated a bankrupt. On March 8, 1978, Edward Limperis was appointed as trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and, on March 12, 1979, Limperis filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court for an accounting and turnover of the grain proceeds held by the Department. The Department refused to consent to the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">The bankruptcy court denied the Department\u2019s motion and held that the Department was required to surrender the proceeds of the grain sale to the trustee pursuant to Sections 2(a)(21) and 69(d) of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Rule 604 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\">The Department appealed this turnover order to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court on February 13, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">It is well established that the bankruptcy court may summarily adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>cate claims pertaining to property in its actual or constructive possession. <em>Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 327, 86 S.Ct. 467, 471,15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966). If, however, the property is in the actual or constructive possession of a third person asserting a bona fide adverse claim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court cannot summarily determine the rights of that person in the property, unless by that person\u2019s consent. 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, <em>supra, </em>123.04 at 453-56.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-4\">But the mere assertion of an adverse claim does not oust a court of bankruptcy of its jurisdiction. It has both the power and the duty to examine a claim adverse to the bankrupt estate to the extent of ascertaining whether the claim is ingenuous and substantial. Once it is established that the claim is not colorable nor frivolous, the claimant has the right to have the merits of his claim passed on in a plenary suit and not summarily. Of such a claim the bankruptcy court cannot retain further jurisdiction unless the claimant consents to its adjudication in the bankruptcy court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\"><em>Cline v. Kaplan, </em>323 U.S. 97, 98-99, 65 S.Ct. 155, 156, 89 L.Ed. 97 (1944) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">The parties in the instant case agree that the bankruptcy court did not have actual or constructive possession of the grain proceeds. Therefore, the summary turnover order of the bankruptcy court can be sustained only if that court\u2019s preliminary inquiry demonstrated that the Department\u2019s claim to the proceeds \u201cis so unsubstantial and obviously insufficient, either in fact or law, as to be plainly without color of merit, and a mere pretense.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Chamberlin, </em>271 U.S. 191, 195, 46 S.Ct. 467, 469, 70 L.Ed. 897 (1926).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">Here the bankruptcy court held, in its unpublished order dated July 30, 1979, that the Department did not have a substantial claim to the proceeds because its claim was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">[derivative from the debtor\u2019s estate. It is not an adverse claim of a lien or priority creditor whose possession at the time of filing the petition in bankruptcy could defeat summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-11\">Since the State\u2019s role here is that of a custodian, agent or assignee, standing in the shoes of the debtor, its claim here is not adverse (to the estate) so as to defeat summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Such claim is not real or substantial but merely colarable [sic]. <em>Beneficial Finance Co. v. Ray, </em>(5th Cir. 1954) 328 F.2d 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">In affirming the bankruptcy court, the district court, in its unpublished order dated February 13,1980, accepted the bankruptcy court\u2019s characterization of the facts and determined that the Department\u2019s claim to the proceeds rose no higher than that of the farmers for whose benefit the grain was seized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-13\">While it is true that the farmers . .. may have a bona fide legal claim to the $38,-000, they had not taken any steps to perfect that claim prior to the date on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>which the bankruptcy petition was filed. Hence ... at the relevant time they were in neither actual nor constructive possession of the assets in issue. This means that the farmers, at the time of filing, were not adverse claimants and the state, which was holding for their benefit, cannot be deemed a \u201ccustodian for ... adverse claimant[s].\u201d <em>[citing Phelps v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 330, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1728, 1732, 44 L.Ed.2d 201 (1975).]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">But the holdings of both the bankruptcy court and the district court rest on the premise that the farmers had sold their grain to Gorenz and were, therefore, unsecured creditors of the bankrupt for the purchase price. In these circumstances, the Department was viewed as a \u201cmere naked bailee [for a group of creditors],\u201d <em>Phelps v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 330, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1728, 1732, 44 L.Ed.2d 201 (1975), having no substantial claim to the grain (or to the proceeds of its sale by the Department) adverse to the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">The Department argues, however, that the summary record does not show that the farmers had sold their grain to Gorenz. Rather, the Department maintains, Gorenz appears to have been serving as a grain warehouseman (albeit without a license). If so, the farmers would presumably have retained ownership of their grain, and Gorenz would have been a mere bailee for them. Since, in these circumstances, Gorenz would have had no ownership interest in the grain, the trustee in bankruptcy could acquire no such interest, <em>see Cattle Owners Corp. v. Arkin, </em>252 F.Supp. 34 (S.D. Iowa 1966), and the Department, as trustee on behalf of the farmers who retained ownership of the grain,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would have a claim to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>the grain sale proceeds of sufficient merit to avoid the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">The trustee maintains that the Department\u2019s argument is without merit because it is not supported by any evidence in the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trustee fails to recognize, however, that \u201cthe burden of proof in a turnover'proceeding is at all times on the receiver or trustee; he must at least establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. After that, the burden of explaining or going forward shifts to the other party, but the ultimate burden or risk of persuasion is upon the receiver or trustee.\u201d 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, <em>supra, </em>123.10 at 566. <em>See also Maggio v. Zeitz, </em>333 U.S. 56, 68 S.Ct. 401, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">As part of his <em>prima facie </em>case, the trustee must demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence that the property or proceeds in question are a part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. <em>Maggio v. Zeitz, supra, </em>333 U.S. at 64, 68 S.Ct. at 405; <em>Fox Jewel Co. v. Lee, </em>264 F.2d 720 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 815 (1959).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The quantum of evidence necessary to satisfy the trustee\u2019s burden of persuasion will necessarily vary according to the circumstances of individual cases. In the instant case, however, we believe the trustee did not introduce sufficient evidence to establish that Gorenz had title to the grain seized by the Department. The only evidence in the record before us concerning ownership of the grain consists of two pages of an apparently unsigned \u201cStatement of Affairs for Bankrupt Engaged in Business,\u201d attached as an \u201cexhibit\u201d to the brief filed by the trustee in the district court. The second of these pages, entitled \u201cSchedule B-2. \u2014 Personal Property,\u201d lists 105,000 bushels of corn (valued at $189,000) and 5,000 bushels of soy beans (valued at $25,000) as \u201cinventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Perhaps an affidavit from Gorenz stating that he had purchased the seized grain from the farmers would have been sufficient to meet the trustee\u2019s burden of persuasion. But we do not know who prepared the statement before us and we therefore cannot determine whether it was prepared by someone with personal knowledge or otherwise competent to attest to the ownership of the grain. Moreover, it is entirely possible that the grain seized by the Department was not included as part of the grain reported as inventory in the statement. Thus, we believe that this single document does not meet the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s obligation of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the grain seized by the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>partment belonged to Gorenz.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Summary jurisdiction cannot be made to rest solely upon such flimsy documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">But, on the other hand, once the bankruptcy trustee has established a <em>prima facie </em>case by somewhat weightier indicia than appear here, the burden of producing contrary evidence shifts to the party in possession of the disputed property. Thus, in this case, if the trustee had offered clear and convincing evidence that the grain was really part of Gorenz\u2019 estate \u2014 that Gorenz bought it and did not merely store it \u2014 the Department could not resist the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court simply by alleging that the grain was not owned by Gorenz. Rather, the Department would have to produce evidence sufficient to create a more than merely colorable question of fact regarding ownership of the grain.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since, however, the evidence before us is insufficient to support the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, the summary adjudication of the bankruptcy court cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">The judgment of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary turnover order is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">. Because these proceedings were commenced prior to October 1, 1979, the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et <em>seq., </em>(1976), is applicable here. Bankruptcy Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-598, Title IV, \u00a7\u00a7 402, 403 (1978) (set forth in the introduction to 11 U.S.C.A. (1979)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">. The only indication in the summary record before us as to why the Department took possession of the grain held by Gorenz is found in the Department\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, filed in the bankruptcy court on May 15, 1980. The memorandum reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-21\">John A. Gorenz, the bankrupt herein, did business as the Gorenz Grain Company. His business in part consisted of \u2018storing grain for compensation\u2019 as that expression is defined in the Public Grain Warehouse and Warehouse Receipts Act (Warehouse Act), <em>Ill.Rev.Stat. </em>(1977) ch. 114, pars. 214.1 <em>et seq. </em>At no time however was Gorenz licensed pursuant to the Warehouse Act to store grain and was therefore operating in contravention of it. Gorenz\u2019s only license entitled him to \u2018deal in grain\u2019 pursuant to <em>Ill.Rev.Stats. </em>(1977) ch. Ill, pars. 301 <em>et seq. </em>The requirements for a grain dealer\u2019s license are considerably less stringent than a warehousing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>license. However, a grain dealer must post a bond in the statutorily prescribed amount. Gorenz did not maintain his bond. Therefore, on January 21, 1978, the Illinois Department of Agriculture pursuant to <em>Ill.Rev.Stats. </em>(1977) ch. 127, par. 40.5 (Possession Statute) and the regulations formulated thereunder took possession of the grain illegally stored by Gorenz.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">.

Mere possession of the property or proceeds is generally insufficient to create a claim \u201cadverse\u201d to the bankrupt\u2019s estate. Rather, possession must be accompanied by some form of legal or equitable ownership interest in the property. <em>Id. </em>This interest may be asserted by the party in possession either on his own behalf or on behalf of another for whom he holds the property as trustee, custodian, agent or bailee. <em>See Phelps v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 330, 335-36, 95 S.Ct. 1728, 1731-32, 44 L.Ed.2d 201 (1975) (\u201cwhere possession is assertedly held not for the bankrupt, but for others prior to bankruptcy ... the holder is not subject to summary jurisdiction\") (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1238-15\">. As Judge Charles Clark put it in <em>Matter of Meiselman, </em>105 F.2d 995, 997 (2d Cir. 1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQp\">[I]f there is a real and substantial controversy of law or fact as to property held adversely to a bankrupt \u2014 \u2018a contested matter of right, involving some fair doubt and reasonable room for controversy\u2019 \u2014 the bankruptcy court is \u2018without jurisdiction\u2019 to adjudicate the matter, but the trustee must have resort to a plenary suit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">. The district court also found that the Department\u2019s assertion of its authority under \u00a7 40.23 did not divest the bankruptcy court of summary jurisdiction since that provision, as applied here, is \u201ca means for the distribution of certain assets belonging to an \u2018insolvent or discontinued business\u2019 outside of the federal bankruptcy system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">We agree with the district court that any attempt to distribute assets of an insolvent grain dealer to farmer-creditors under \u00a7 40.23 would be superceded by federal bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 ll(a)(21), <em>supra </em>note 3; <em>Emil v. Hanley, </em>318 U.S. 515, 63 S.Ct. 687, 87 L.Ed. 954 (1943); <em>Taylor v. Sternberg, </em>293 U.S. 470, 55 S.Ct. 260, 79 L.Ed. 599 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">The Department also argues that the farmers were not merely creditors of the bankrupt because the seizure of the grain under \u00a7 40.23 operated to impress the grain with a trust in favor of the farmers. Any trust interest created in this manner would arise only upon the Department\u2019s seizure of the assets of the discontinued or insolvent dealer and would attach to the dealer\u2019s general assets. <em>See </em>111. Dept, of Agriculture, Rules and Regulations Relating to Civil Administrative Code, Art. Ill, Reg. I, Rule 3.1.1 (1977) (hereinafter 111. Dept, of Agriculture Regulations) (\u201cWhen a licensed business fails, the director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee shall take possession of the licensee\u2019s current and other assets. In the case of warehouse or grain dealers, this includes grain.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">As such, any interest created by \u00a7 40.23 is no more than an attempt by the legislature to give the farmer-beneficiaries a priority over general creditors, and this priority would be ineffective against the trustee. <em>See Elliott v. Bumb, </em>356 F.2d 749 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 829, 87 S.Ct. 67, 17 L.Ed.2d 66 (1966) (rejecting state\u2019s attempt to impose a \u201ctrust\u201d on funds whose ownership had vested previously in the bankrupt). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 67(c)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(c)(1)(A) (1976) (invalidating, as against the bankruptcy trustee, \u201cevery statutory lien which first becomes effective upon the insolvency of the debtor, or upon distribution or liquidation of his property, . . . \u201d). <em>Cf.

Ford Motor Co., </em>590 F.2d 642 (6th Cir. 1979) (building contract funds held by bankrupt contractor and impressed with statutorily-imposed trust in favor of his subcontractors not part of bankrupt contractor\u2019s estate since contractor never acquired beneficial ownership of the funds).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1239-14\">. The authority of the Department to serve as trustee with respect to grain seized from warehouses is not free from doubt, since \u00a7 40.23, on its face, empowers the Department, \u201cwhen acting as trustee, to protect the assets of licensees [here Gorenz] for the benefit of claimants, ...\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 127, \u00a7 40.23 (1979). The regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 40.23 also speak of claims filed \"against the licensee\u2019s assets.\u201d <em>See </em>111. Dept, of Agriculture Regulations, <em>supra </em>note 7, Art. Ill, Reg. I, Rules 3.1.1\u2014 3.1.5. If the licensee is not a dealer but a warehouseman, the grain in his possession would presumably not be his but the farmers\u2019 assets. Section 40.23 is not explicitly limited to regulation of dealers, however, and Rule 3.1.6 of the regulations provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-15\">If the business failure is a grain warehouseman or a grain dealer then all grain or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>ceiptF from grain in possession or in transit shall be placed in trust by the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture to be used for the benefit of claimants. If the business is a grain warehouse then all grain in the business possession shall if the amount is equal to or more than the outstanding warehouse receipts be used to satisfy warehouse receipt claims. If the amount of grain is less than the amount necessary to satisfy all outstanding warehouse receipts the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, as Trustee, shall convert, through sale, the grain to cash. The money received shall be placed in a trust account to be distributed to claimants on a pro-rata basis to warehouse receipt holders.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">. The trustee also argues that the Department did not raise this issue previously. However, an examination of the briefs filed in the district court shows that this issue was presented to that court. And, although the issue was not clearly presented to the bankruptcy court, the Department did argue there that Gorenz did not have possession of the grain and that his earlier possession was unlawful since he was operating in contravention of the Illinois Warehouse Receipts Act. The Department\u2019s memorandum in support of its notice to dismiss reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-11\">Gorenz stored the grain in question without proper license in contravention of the Warehouse Act. His possession was therefore illegal <em>ab initio. </em>Even this illegal possession terminated when the State pursuant to its Possession Statute took control of the grain two days prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">In any case, the Department\u2019s refusal to consent to the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction obligated the trustee to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case in support of his motion for a summary turnover order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">.

We note that Rule 56 is fully applicable to adversary proceedings in bankruptcy by virtue of Rule 756 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">.
