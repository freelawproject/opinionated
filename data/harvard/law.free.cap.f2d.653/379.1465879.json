I&amp;NS, </em>622 F.2d 1341 (9 Cir. 1980), Supreme Court docket No. 80-485. On March 2, 1981, the Court granted certiorari in <em>Wang </em>and reversed the <em>en banc </em>decision of this court (per curiam). 450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123. Because our decision rested largely on <em>Wang, </em>we permitted counsel to file supplemental memoranda in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case. We reconsider the petition for review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s order of March 2, 1981 in <em>Wang </em>and the supplemental memoranda filed by the parties in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The facts giving rise to the petition for review were set out in our previous opinion, <em>Barrera-Leyva v. I&amp;NS, </em>637 F.2d 640 (9 Cir. 1980), and will not be repeated here. We held that the immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) had abused their discretion in determining that Barrera-Leyva was ineligible for suspension relief because they failed to consider all of the relevant factors, as outlined in prior case law, that bear on extreme hardship. <em>Id. </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In reversing <em>Wang, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the words \u201cextreme hardship\u201d, as used in \u00a7 244 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) \u201care not self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction.\u201d The Court stressed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AND\">the Act commits their definition in the first instance to the Attorney General and his delegates, and their construction and application of this standard should not be overturned by a reviewing court simply because it may prefer another interpretation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">The Court said further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-13\">The Attorney General and his delegates have the authority to construe \u201cextreme hardship\u201d narrowly should they deem it wise to do so. Such a narrow interpretation is consistent with the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d language, which itself indicates the exceptional nature of the suspension remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">While our decision recognized that this court may not substitute its opinion for that of the Attorney General and that the Attorney General\u2019s discretion is broad, we held citing <em>Wang, </em>that \u00a7 1254(a)(1) should be liberally construed to effect its ameliorative purpose. 637 F.2d at 643. We remanded to the Board for further consideration of factors we found relevant. We now conclude that under the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute in reversing <em>Wang,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>our previous conclusion was erroneous. Accordingly we grant the petition for rehearing and affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\">. It may be noted also that <em>Wang </em>involved the denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings to consider a claim of extreme hardship. As we recognized in our opinion (637 F.2d at 642, n.3) the showing required on a motion to reopen (prima facie case) is less burdensome than that required to warrant reversal of a denial of suspension for abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
