The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order of the same date that Childers shall bargain collectively with the Union upon request. The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 242 N.L.R.B. No. 182 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"Amr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The Union won the representation election, eight votes to six. The Board declared three additional Childers employees ineligible to vote in the election on the ground that two (Weiser and Lambing) were \u201csupervisors\u201d under Section 2(11) of the Act, and the third (Emme), as a college student employed for the summer of the election, had an insufficient community of interest with the other employees to vote. Upon consideration of the entire record and the briefs the Court concludes that the Board\u2019s decision as to Weiser and Lambing is supported by substantial evidence. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider its decision as to Emme.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
