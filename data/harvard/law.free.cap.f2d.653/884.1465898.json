RUBIN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Almost a full year has passed since this Court, in <em>Johns v. Department of Justice, </em>624 F.2d 522 (5th Cir. 1980), considered an appeal from an order of a district court refusing to stay the deportation of Cynthia, then a four-year-old child, who, when she was one day old, had been brought to the United States from Mexico, where she had been born. The immigration judge, after a deportation hearing, had concluded that Cynthia had been brought to the United States illegally and had found her deportable. This decision had been affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which, however, had granted Cynthia the privilege of voluntary departure. Pursuant to an INS warrant issued on January 30, 1980, Cynthia had been taken from the Johns and had been placed in an institution under the care of Catholic Services Bureau (CSB), for what was then proposed to be a period of 48 to 72 hours, pending arrangement of air transportation to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">No appeal had been taken from the Board\u2019s final order. Instead, Mark and Eileen Johns, who had brought Cynthia to the United States shortly after her birth and who had reared her as their daughter since then, had filed- suit to enjoin her deportation and for a writ of habeas corpus commanding that she be returned to their custody. Her natural mother, Angela Macias-Rosales, sought to intervene. She contended that the Johns had taken Cynthia illegally and asked that her child be returned to Mexico. The United States had sought dismissal of the proceeding. The district court had denied the Johns\u2019 motion in its entirety and had denied Mrs. Macias-Rosales\u2019 motion to intervene. The Johns had then filed an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Because Cynthia had not been represented in the deportation proceeding, we remanded the case to the district court with instructions to appoint a guardian ad litem</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-9\">to represent Cynthia, to enjoin execution of the deportation order, and to direct the INS to conduct all further proceedings involving Cynthia contradictorily with her guardian ad litem.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">It was apparent to all that, in view of her age, the temporary situation was traumatic to Cynthia and its protraction was undesirable. We had no jurisdiction to determine what her personal welfare required, however, because the only issues before us were whether her deportation should be enjoined and whether habeas corpus should be granted to the Johns. Contemplating further INS action, we ordered it to be completed within sixty days and further ordered subsequent district court proceedings to be completed within thirty days thereafter. To avoid further appellate delay, we retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Events thereafter, unfortunately, perhaps due to no one\u2019s fault or more likely due to the fault of everyone but Cynthia, and to Cynthia\u2019s continued detriment, took the leisurely course we had hoped to avoid. Our opinion was issued on August 1, 1980. On August 6, the district judge appointed Theodore Klein, Esq. and Rebecca Poston, Esq., both members of the Florida bar, as guardians ad litem for Cynthia. On August 22, the Johns filed a motion seeking her release to their custody pending resolution of the case. This was accompanied by psychiatric and psychological reports stating that the Johns were Cynthia\u2019s \u201cpsychological parents\u201d and that she should be returned to their care immediately lest she suffer permanent psychological harm. Cynthia\u2019s mother countered with a motion to deny the Johns\u2019 motion. The INS opposed the Johns\u2019 motion on the grounds, inter alia, that the Johns might flee and that it was doubtful that they provided a desirable home environment. Mr. Klein, as guardian ad litem,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also opposed the Johns\u2019 motion. On September 23, the district judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Meanwhile, on September 5, the federal defendants, represented by the Assistant U.S. Attorney, called the district court\u2019s attention to the passage of time since the entry of this Court\u2019s order and to the failure of either the INS or the guardian ad litem to institute any proceedings. The federal defendants recommended the appointment of a psychiatric and a psychological expert to assist the guardian ad litem. In apparent response to that action, the guardian ad litem petitioned this Court and we granted an additional fifteen days for completion of INS proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">On October 30, Mr. Klein filed a request with the INS District Director for a \u201cstay of deportation.\u201d In the letter requesting the action, he recommended that \u201ccustody\u201d be decided by a Florida court. On November 12, the District Director granted the stay by a letter addressed to Mr. Klein. The letter states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-8\">It is very evident from its decision that the Circuit Court is troubled by the fact that Cynthia Johns was not specifically represented by Counsel during the previous legal proceedings. The Court points out that even though Mr. and Mrs. Johns were frequently represented by Counsel, their interests do not necessarily coincide with those of Cynthia. The thrust of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision is that Cynthia\u2019s interests must be considered before a final decision is made regarding her deportation from the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\">On the basis that the custody of Cynthia Johns will be litigated, and hopefully decided in a Florida Court proceeding, I am granting your request for a Stay of Deportation pending the outcome of those proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Mrs. Macias-Rosales promptly filed a motion requesting the federal District Court to order Cynthia\u2019s deportation or, in the alternative, to declare the INS to be \u201cwithout further authority to detain the child\u201d and to \u201crelease the child forthwith to the natural mother.\u201d The Johns opposed the motion and asked the Court to order the \u201cimmediate release of Cindy\u201d to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Meanwhile, on December 5, the guardian ad litem filed a proceeding in the Family Division of the Florida state trial court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cto determine the legal custody of Cynthia [Johns].\u201d Mrs. Macias-Rosales, opposing his petition, disputed that court\u2019s jurisdiction. From the Family Court\u2019s decision that it had jurisdiction, she appealed. That appeal is now pending in the Florida Third District Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">The federal District Court treated the pleading filed before it as an application for review of the INS order staying deportation, and denied it on the basis that the District Director has discretion to determine whether to proceed with or to stay a deportation, and that no abuse of discretion had been shown. The District Judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeA2\">A determination as to the legal custodian of Cynthia is a factor of the utmost importance as to whether or not she will be deported. For that reason, the Guardian Ad Litem\u2019s report supports the Director\u2019s stay to allow further proceedings to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>termine what is in the best interests of Cynthia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The Johns and Mrs. Macias-Rosales both filed a new appeal from this order, apparently without noting our retention of jurisdiction in the habeas corpus action, Case No. 80-5135. Because the new appeal was separately docketed as Case No. 81-5062, and none of the parties called special attention to it or requested expedited action, the case was handled routinely \u2014 as it should never have been \u2014 and its pendency did not reach this panel\u2019s attention until briefing under the usual schedule was completed. Thus, the litigants, most of all Cynthia, who assuredly is the only completely innocent party, have again been victims of delays in the legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">In March 1981, Cynthia was finally transferred from the CSB institution to the care of a foster family under CSB supervision. She was attended by an INS guard 24 hours a day until July 23, when the CSB succeeded in having the guard removed. She remains in the foster home, her stay indefinite, her future uncertain. Recognizing this, as soon as the case again reached our attention, we suggested oral argument by conference telephone. All parties consented to this procedure and the case was orally argued. We now order the two nominally separate matters consolidated and consider both in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Two INS hearings and a sheaf of ex parte representations by those who contend for Cynthia\u2019s custody leave the history of her separation from her mother and her entry into the United States still disordered. The following facts are culled from the INS hearing and the many documents filed in the various proceedings to which Cynthia has been subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">It appears certain that Cynthia is an alien, of Mexican nationality, and that Angela Macias-Rosales is Cynthia\u2019s natural mother. Mrs. Macias-Rosales is 33 years of age, has two children, a girl about three years old and a boy about two years old, who reside with her in Rosarito, Baja California, where, she now operates a restaurant. Whether she is married to the person who is the father of these children and of Cynthia is disputed. There are representations that this man is married to someone else and cannot obtain a divorce. There is an account that Mrs. Macias-Rosales has two older children, aged ten and eleven, who live with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">In 1975, the Johns went to Tijuana, Mexico, to adopt a child. They met Mrs. Macias-Rosales, apparently as a result of arrangements by intermediaries. They visited her in the hospital where Cynthia was born, and left the hospital with Cynthia the day after the child\u2019s birth. They secured a Mexican birth certificate showing them as her natural and lawful parents, and, representing Cynthia to be their child, entered the United States. They, therefore, appeared to need no visa for her and had none.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Mrs. Macias-Rosales contends that the Johns kidnapped Cynthia. She has been attempting to locate Cynthia and secure the child\u2019s return since the Johns left Mexico or shortly thereafter. The Johns claim that Mrs. Macias-Rosales surrendered Cynthia to them for adoption and that their procurement of a birth certificate was a de facto \u201cinformal\u201d adoption. There is evidence that the Johns knew that this did not suffice as an adoption. There is evidence for and against the parental fitness of both the Johns and Mrs. Macias-Rosales.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">After an INS hearing in California, the Immigration Judge found Cynthia to be deportable, but withheld his final decision for six months. He envisioned that the Johns might be able to adopt Cynthia by proceeding in California state courts and that this might enable Cynthia to remain in the United States. After the six-month period had elapsed, finding that the California courts had taken no action on the merits, the Immigration Judge ordered that Cynthia be deported. Thereafter, the Johns fled with Cynthia to Florida, where they were located several years later. After being located, they failed to report to the INS as they had apparently promised.. The INS, therefore, secured a warrant for Cynthia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>detention and refuses to return her even temporarily to their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The Attorney General has primary responsibility for enforcing the statutes requiring the deportation of persons who are not lawfully in the United States. An alien is deportable if he has entered the United States unlawfully without an immigrant visa, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a), and for a number of other reasons. <em>See, e. g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Aliens who are determined to be deportable, \u201cshall be deported\u201d upon the order of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251. His responsibility in this regard is akin to his responsibility for enforcing the criminal laws: in both situations, he has discretion to refrain from instituting proceedings even though grounds for their commencement may exist. <em>See </em>C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 5.3e(l) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">If the Attorney General has reason to suspect that an alien is subject to deportation, he may arrest the alien, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), or commence deportation proceedings without taking the alien into custody.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Attorney General discharges his responsibility for enforcing the deportation laws through the INS, a division of the Department of Justice, to which hp has delegated many of his responsibilities under the immigration laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Director of the INS, therefore, normally makes the decision to institute deportation proceedings. An immigration judge (formerly called a special inquiry officer) then conducts proceedings to determine the alien\u2019s deportability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1252(h). This is the \u201csole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien\u201d under the sections of law here involved. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The immigration judge is empowered to make all decisions necessary to dispose fully of the case and may order that the alien be deported, that the proceedings be terminated favorably to the alien, or that discretionary relief should be afforded. The immigration judge\u2019s order is final, subject, of course, to further administrative and eventual judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">Deportation orders entered by immigration judges are reviewed initially by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The BIA is a delegate of the Attorney General and exercises the Attorney General\u2019s reviewing authority in deportation cases. The BIA\u2019s decision, absent excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>tional circumstances, is administratively final,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> subject only to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The Attorney General has six months after the order of deportation becomes final in which to effect the alien\u2019s departure from the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(c). During this six month period, the Attorney General has discretion to determine whether the alien should be detained or released on bond or conditional parole. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(c). At the termination of the six months, pursuant to a warrant of deportation issued by the district director, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.2, the alien may be deported. If deportation during this time has not been \u201cpracticable, advisable, or possible or departure of the alien . . . has not been effected within such six month period,\u201d the alien is subject to further supervision although detention is not permitted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(c) &amp; (d). <em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.2(d), containing the Attorney General\u2019s delegation of his supervisory power to the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Deportation is not, however, the inevitable consequence of unauthorized presence in the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Attorney General is given discretion by express statutory provisions, in some situations, to ameliorate the rigidity of the deportation laws. In other instances, as the result of implied authority, he exercises discretion nowhere granted expressly. By express delegation, and by practice, the Attorney General has authorized the INS to exercise his discretion. In fact, not only does the INS, as the Attorney General\u2019s surrogate, exercise his quasi-prosecutorial discretion to commence or not to commence deportation, but even after a final order of deportation has been entered, the District Director exercises discretion to afford aliens relief from deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">If the Attorney General decides that an alien is unlawfully in the country, and should not be permitted to remain, he may permit the alien to depart voluntarily at the alien\u2019s expense, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e), 8 C.F.R. 243.5; <em>Boulamandis v. Brownell, </em>247 F.2d 83 (D.C.Cir.1957), so that the alien\u2019s record will not show that he was involuntarily deported, thus creating a barrier to possible future lawful return. <em>See </em>C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 5.18b (1981); Comment, Suspension of Deportation: Illusory Relief, 14 S.D.L.Rev. 229, 253 (1976). The Attorney General is also authorized to \u201cwithhold deportation\u201d of any alien to any country if the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened there on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">The Attorney General also determines whether (1) to refrain from (or, in administrative parlance, to defer in) executing an outstanding order of deportation,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or (2) to stay the order of deportation. Although such a stay is usually designed to give a deportee a reasonable amount of time to make any necessary business or personal arrangements, both the length of and reason for the stay lie entirely within the discretion of the Attorney General or his delegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">The Attorney General has adopted regulations <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> giving the District Director discretionary authority, either on his own or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the request of a party, to stay an order of deportation for such time and under such conditions as the director thinks necessary. Neither the statute nor the regulations permit an administrative appeal from a decision regarding a requested stay to an immigration judge or the BIA. 8 C.F.R. 243.4. <em>See Matter of Paduano, </em>13 I.N.S. 658 (1971). Although both these forms of discretionary relief were here, requested by the guardian ad litem, the request for deferred action was postponed by the District Director until the termination of the state court proceeding. The district director\u2019s action was limited to granting a \u201cstay of deportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The entry of a final order of deportation or final action on a request for discretionary relief is subject to judicial review. Such review, of course, does not entail the substitution of a court\u2019s judgment for that of the Attorney General or the designees who exercise his power. <em>See, e. g., Foti v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 217, 228, 84 S.Ct. 306, 313, 11 L.Ed.2d 281, 290 (1963). The Attorney General\u2019s order must be affirmed unless there has been an abuse of discretion or a complete failure to exercise discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The forum for judicial review depends, however, on the nature of the challenged action. Jurisdiction to review \u201call final orders of deportation . . . made against aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)]\u201d lies exclusively in the courts of appeals. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1031 \u2014 1042 (The Hobbs Act). Such a petition for review, however, may not be filed more than six months after the date of the final order of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The scope of the term \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d is not, of course, self-defining. Recognizing the desirability, reflected in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, of minimizing multiple review, the Supreme Court held in <em>Foti v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963), that the term includes in addition to the actual order of deportation, all orders closely related to the deportation proceeding and entered during deportation .proceedings conducted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), such as the denial of voluntary departure or adjustment of status. <em>See also Giova v. Rosenberg, </em>379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90 (1964) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">If, on the other hand, ancillary determinations, such as granting a stay of deportation,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are made outside the context of a proceeding under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), jurisdiction to review initially is not given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>courts of appeals. <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, </em>392 U.S. 206, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968). Such ancillary administrative actions are subject to review in declaratory judgment actions, or by requests for injunctions, in the district courts under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, and under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329, an independent grant of jurisdiction, to the district courts, of cases arising under the immigration laws.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>C. Gordon and H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 8.8 (1981); Currie &amp; Goodman, Judicial Review of Federal Administrative Action: Quest for the Optimum Forum, 75 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 32 (1975). <em>See also </em>Comment, Judicial Review of Final Orders of Deportation,. 42 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1155 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The right of the INS to hold an alien in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may also be challenged by application for a writ of habeas corpus. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In such an action, brought initially in the district court, the alien may challenge the legality and constitutionality of his confinement by the INS.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">With these jurisdictional lines in mind, we examine the proceedings before us to</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">determine first, whether the District Court had jurisdiction of the proceedings involved in case No. 81-5062. Five days after the District Director granted what he termed a \u201cstay of deportation,\u201d Mrs. Macias-Rosales filed a motion in the district court requesting that the court either order deportation or declare that the INS is without authority to detain Cynthia and order that the child be released to her natural mother. Shortly after that motion was filed, the Johns filed a pleading<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> urging the court to deny Mrs. Macias-Rosales\u2019 motion and order the immediate release of Cynthia to their custody. The guardian ad litem, arguing in support of the INS action, opposed both of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">The Johns and Mrs. Macias-Rosales are both \u201caggrieved parties\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. They were, therefore, proper persons to appear in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">The district court, treating the two motions as requests to review the entry of the stay, held that the District Director\u2019s action was not arbitrary or capricious, and refused to vacate it. The relief sought by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Mrs. Macias-Rosales was not, however, merely the vacation of the stay nor was it, of course, an attempt to appeal the 1977 deportation order. Her motion was an attempt to secure an order commanding deportation. This was plainly a \u201ccause .. . arising under\u201d the deportation provisions of the immigration laws, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329, of which the District Court had jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We, therefore, consider the order on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Our prior opinion, holding that the initial deportation proceedings were conducted without due process, effectively voided that prior adjudication. Had the deportation order remained in force, there would have been no need for further proceedings contradictorily with Cynthia\u2019s guardian ad litem. Deportation of Cynthia would have followed as a matter of course absent the guardian\u2019s intervention. As a result of our prior mandate, the final order of deportation, entered on December 16,1977, must be considered without force. Cynthia is, therefore, in the same position as any alien who appears deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The prior deportation order being void for want of due process, the District Director had discretion either again to commence a deportation proceeding or not to do so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That discretion is, like prosecutorial discretion, immune from review in the courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While the INS order is framed in terms of a \u201cstay of deportation,\u201d we treat it as a refusal to institute further proceedings and affirm the District Director\u2019s authority to exercise his prosecutive discretion in that manner. We, therefore, affirm the District Court order refusing to vacate the stay.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The APA generally precludes judicial review of the manner in which the Attorney General chooses to exercise his discretionary authority to inquire into the immigration status of an alien who is seeking admission to this country or is here without proper documentation. <em>Nguyen Da Yen v. Kissinger, </em>528 F.2d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir. 1975); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). It would, therefore, be inappropriate for us to instruct the District Director concerning the exercise of his discretion. Because, however, the District Director not only misinterpreted the effect of our prior decree on the deportation order, but also erred in his interpretation of the reasons for that decision, we amplify it, so that his future actions will not be improperly influenced by what may have been a lack of clarity in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Our prior opinion must not be read as instructing the District Director that deportability of a person is to be determined solely by what is in that person\u2019s best interests, whether the person be an adult or a child. None resist deportation save those who think it is in their best interests to remain. Instead our mandate was designed only to assure Cynthia due process by requiring that she be represented by a competent guardian ad litem with fidelity only to her. The effect of our prior judgment was to void the original order of deportation because the proceeding underlying that order deprived Cynthia of the process due her under the Constitution. We did not under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>take to direct how the District Director should proceed so long as he accorded Cynthia due process.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Whether or not Florida courts have jurisdiction over Cynthia, they can in the proceeding presently pending determine only who is entitled to her custody. Save insofar as a custody determination decides whether a person is the \u201cchild\u201d of a citizen, custody is not a statutory factor in determining deportability. <em>See, e. g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(F), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(3); 8 C.F.R. 211.5. It was neither our order nor our. intention that the resolution of these protracted deportation proceedings await Florida court proceedings to determine Cynthia\u2019s custody. <em>Cf. Huynh Thi Anh v. Levi, </em>586 F.2d 625 (6th Cir. 1978) (the presence of the alien children in the United States was concededly lawful but only their custody was contested).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">All parties agree that Cynthia has been harmed by the disruption of her life that has already occurred. They differ only in how they would repair that part of her life. Her life is in limbo at a time when she is most in need of parental affection and guidance. It was not our direction that the District Director\u2019s decision await another indefinitely prolonged period of legal thrust and counterthrust, but only that Cynthia\u2019s due process rights be protected and her status be adjudicated without delay. This has been accomplished in part by the appointment of the guardian ad litem and by his appearance in all proceedings as Cynthia\u2019s representative. It will be assured by his continued representation of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">The Attorney General, as we have noted, has delegated his statutory authority to determine deportability and, if deportability is found, discretion in acting on that decision, to the District Director. That officer has a duty to decide whether to proceed against Cynthia. We perceive nothing in either the statute or the regulations that requires him to go through a sort of abstention process, particularly when the state court will decide only whether it has jurisdiction, and, if so, who should have custody of her.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The issues before him, whether Cynthia is lawfully in this country, whether she should be deported, whether there is a statutory or factual basis for executive compassion and, if so, whether it should be extended to avoid deportation, and related questions, are no more difficult than issues such as moral turpitude,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> legality of entry, validity of marriage,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and fraud and misrepresentation <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that are decided in immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>gration hearings daily.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Important issues affecting Cynthia must be resolved, at least initially, and perhaps exclusively, by the District Director. Delay is an act of injustice to Cynthia, not of mercy. It is also, to a lesser degree, a prolongation of the anxiety and distress that disturbs the lives of Mrs. Macias-Rosales and Mr. and Mrs. Johns.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Because the guardian ad litem was appointed by the District Court and acts under the orders of that court, subject to our review, we do consider it appropriate to remind him that he was appointed to assure Cynthia due process and to safeguard her best interests; and that each of the many experts whose opinions are now in the record, whether consulted by him or, by Mrs. Macias-Rosales, or by the Johns, or appointed to advise this Court, has concluded that prolongation of the present crisis in Cynthia\u2019s life is harmful to her, perhaps irreparably.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We do not consider it necessary, as a matter of law, that the guardian ad litem await state court adjudication of Cynthia\u2019s best interests. We require only that he satisfy himself that the action he recommends is in her best interests and that he then vigorously pursue that recommendation before the administrative agency and the courts. We intimate no opinion concerning the extent of his duties, if any, with regard to proceedings relating to Cynthia\u2019s custody, a matter not within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">The action of the INS in detaining a person is, as we have noted, subject to challenge by petition to the District Court for habeas corpus. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(9). The Johns raised the habeas corpus issue by a motion \u201con behalf of Cynthia.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The denial of that motion served as the basis for their initial appeal to this Court. In our prior opinion finding that the deportation proceeding was conducted in contravention of Cynthia\u2019s due process rights, we did not address the merits of the Johns\u2019 petition for habeas corpus. Mrs. Macias-Rosales has also filed a habeas corpus petition in the same District Court, but that case has been allotted to another judge. In neither case has the District Judge made any findings of fact concerning the merits.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>A petition for habeas corpus in federal court challenges only the legality and the constitutionality of a person\u2019s detention. <em>See United States ex rel. Marcello v. INS, </em>634 F.2d 964, 965 (5th Cir. 1981). So long as the petitioner has standing to raise that issue, it neither requires nor permits the federal court to determine who, among private persons competing to care for another, has the right to custody. We find the record insufficient to determine whether the District Court erroneously denied the Johns\u2019 habeas, corpus petition. Because the record contains only ex parte statements concerning the facts surrounding Cynthia\u2019s birth and entry into this country, we are unable to determine whether she' is now being held illegally or unconstitutionally. This Court cannot review such an issue without the benefit of a final determination by a District Court based on its findings of fact. While a petition for habeas corpus directed at the INS is usually reviewed by reference only to the administrative record, the District Court may, if necessary, conduct a hearing to take evidence concerning illegal action that is not reflected in the record.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Therefore, we remand the case initially appealed for a determination of the merits of the Johns\u2019 habeas corpus application. In order to avoid duplication of effort, and possible inconsistency of results, that proceeding must be consolidated with Mrs. M\u00e1cias-Rosales\u2019 petition and be considered by the same District Judge.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The guardian ad litem should appear in the consolidated proceeding to assure that Cynthia, as a person, is accorded her legal rights. Perhaps redundantly, we stress that each habeas corpus proceeding challenges only the legality of Cynthia\u2019s detention, from each of the petitioners, by the INS, and that in neither habeas proceeding does the federal District Court have jurisdiction to determine who, between Mrs. Macias-Rosales and the Johns, has the right to custody. Each of them is proceeding contradictorily with the INS and not against the other. <em>See also </em>note 32, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">The District Court order issued pursuant to our mandate in case No. 80-5135, appointing guardians ad litem and ordering any deportation proceedings to be pursued contradictorily with them, is maintained in force.

The guardian ad litem has informed us that he will act on the basis of the Florida trial court\u2019s decision, and will not abide an appeal to take further action. His action, however, will not dictate a course to the INS.

In light of our discussion in note 20, <em>supra, </em>we emphasize that the Johns have no legal authority to proceed on \u201cbehalf of Cynthia.\u201d They may prevail in a habeas corpus proceeding only if, based on the findings of the district court, the INS has unconstitutionally or illegally removed Cynthia from their control. Similarly, Mrs. Macias-Rosales can prevail only if she can prove that Cynthia is being illegally or unconstitutionally detained from her control by the INS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\">. The District Court, in Case No. 80-5135, held, without detailing any supporting facts, that the Johns\u2019 petition was \u201cdevoid of any material allegations constituting any sufficient basis for the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d Counsel informed us during oral argument that the District Judge considering the petition filed by Mrs. Macias-Rosales has not held a hearing or ' reached a decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b952-4\">. <em>Cf. Nguyen Da Yen v. Kissinger, </em>528 F.2d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b952-5\">. This does not mean, however, that all INS proceedings must be stayed pending conclusion of the two habeas corpus actions. Of course, until the INS concludes its proceedings, our injunction against Cynthia\u2019s deportation remains in force. Should a new final order of deportation be issued, it will necessarily be subject to judicial review. Should there be an application for such review, the parties should, by appropriate notice, call the court\u2019s attention to the urgency of Cynthia\u2019s situation and seek expedited hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">We are, of course, aware that, because the legal issues in the habeas corpus proceeding and the considerations relating to deportation action are different, there is a potential for inconsistent determinations. This possibility is inherent in the statutory plan. To the extent temporary injunctive relief is essential to judicial consideration of the habeas corpus proceedings, it is, of course, within the district court\u2019s power.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b953-5\">ON REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"Aq76\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The response of the guardian ad litem demonstrates that the opinion is clear and requires no elucidation or interpretation.
