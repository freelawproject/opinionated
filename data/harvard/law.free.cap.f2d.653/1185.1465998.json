McPartlin and his wife Geraldine McPartlin appeal an order of the United States Tax Court dismissing their petition for a redetermination of a tax deficiency. The tax deficiency was determined by respondent Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) with respect to petitioners\u2019 1971 tax return. On April 13,1978, the Commissioner mailed a statutory notice of deficiency to the address appearing on petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>1971 return. Petitioners, who had moved since the filing of their 1971 return, did not receive any notice that the Commissioner claimed a tax deficiency for their 1971 income until early February 1979 and did not actually receive a copy of the notice of deficiency until April 23, 1979. The principal issue presented to this Court is whether the Commissioner\u2019s April 13, 1978 mailing of the statutory notice of deficiency was sent to petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address\u201d so as to, <em>inter alia, </em>trigger the commencement of the jurisdictional 90 day period for filing with the Tax Court a petition for redetermination of the deficiency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tax Court ruled that the Commissioner had sent the notice of deficiency to petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address\u201d and therefore that petitioners\u2019 April 23, 1979 filing of a petition for redetermination was untimely. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Petitioners filed their 1971 tax return jointly, listing their address as 1104 North Lockwood Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. In 1974, the Commissioner, through his Chicago District Office, commenced an investigation into possible civil tax liabilities of petitioners. During the pendency of the civil investigation, Mr. McPartlin was also a subject of a criminal investigation involving, <em>inter alia, </em>petitioners\u2019 1971 tax return. The agent of the Commissioner in charge of that criminal investigation until July 1979 was Agent James Swanson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">In October 1976, petitioners moved from their Lockwood Avenue address to 3440 North Oleander Street in Chicago, Illinois. When they moved, petitioners filed a change of address form with their local office of the United States Postal Service, which for the next year forwarded to petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address all mail addressed to the former Lockwood Avenue address. In 1976, petitioners filed with the Commissioner\u2019s Kansas City, Missouri Service Center<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> two documents bearing their Oleander address: (1) a request for an extension of time to file their 1976 return; and (2) their 1976 tax return itself. Schedule D of their 1976 return indicates that petitioners had sold their home at the Lockwood Avenue address and purchased a new one at the Oleander Street address. On November 15,1977, the Kansas City Service Center mailed to petitioners at their Oleander Street address a \u201cRequest for Verification of Unreported Income\u201d concerning petitioners\u2019 1975 return, a return that bore petitioners\u2019 former Lockwood Avenue address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">In testimony given before the Tax Court, Agent Swanson stated that either during or immediately preceding Mr. McPartlin\u2019s late 1977 criminal trial, he was apprised that petitioners had moved from their Lockwood Avenue address. Apparently, however, that knowledge was never communicated to the agents of the Commissioner assigned to investigate petitioners\u2019 possible civil tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">As a result of the Commissioner\u2019s civil investigation, a tax deficiency of $26,211.13 was determined with respect to petitioners\u2019 1971 income. An additional liability of 50 percent of the determined tax deficiency, $13,105.56, was determined to be due from Mr. McPartlin because of the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Mr. McPartlin\u2019s alleged failure to report the $26,211.13 in 1971 income was fraudulent. On April 13, 1978, the Commissioner sent to petitioners\u2019 Lockwood Avenue address by certified mail a notice of deficiency for their 1971 income, claiming a total liability of $26,211.13 as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>Mrs. McPartlin and $39,316.69 as to Mr. McPartlin. Petitioners never received the notice mailed April 13, 1978, nor does the Commissioner\u2019s file on petitioners contain a return receipt for the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Petitioners\u2019 first notice of an alleged tax deficiency was received in early February 1979 by way of a letter and \u201cNotice of Federal Tax Lien\u201d sent by the Commissioner to Mrs. McPartlin at petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice of deficiency itself was not received by petitioners until their counsel was able to obtain a copy at the Commissioner\u2019s Chicago offices on April 23,1979. On that same date, petitioners mailed to the Tax Court a petition for a redetermination of the deficiency. The petition was received by the Tax Court on April 25, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The Commissioner moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction because it was not timely filed. Petitioners moved for judgment before the Tax Court on the ground that no assessment of taxes for 1971 could be made against them because no notice of deficiency had been properly sent to them within the period of the statute of limitations. After a hearing, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion and denied the petitioners\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">The Commissioner is authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212(a) to send a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer by certified or registered mail. Subsection (b) of section 6212 provides that notice \u201cmailed to the taxpayer at his last known address, shall be sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although section 6212(a)\u2019s language with respect to the giving of notice is precatory, the Commissioner may not assess a tax deficiency until he has given the taxpayer notice thereof. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(c). Taxpayers residing within the United States may within 90 days of mailing of a notice of deficiency petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the tax deficiency. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. Filing within the 90 day period is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the Tax Court hearing a petition for a redetermination. <em>Stebbins\u2019 Estate v. Helvering, </em>121 F.2d 892, 893-94 (D.C.Cir. 1941). During the 90 day period, the Commissioner may not assess the claimed tax deficiency. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>during that period any applicable statute of limitation is tolled. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(a)(1). Once a tax deficiency is assessed, the taxpayer must pay the deficiency and resort to a suit for a refund if he disputes the Commissioner\u2019s determination. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7421 \u2014 22. Hence, the mailing of a notice of deficiency pursuant to section 6212 serves several purposes. Principally, of course, it is to afford the taxpayer notice of any tax deficiency determined by the Commissioner; however, it also serves to otherwise help define the rights of the taxpayer and the power of the Commissioner concerning collection of a deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">As stated, the principal issue in the instant case is whether the Commissioner\u2019s April 13, 1978 mailing of the notice of deficiency was sent to petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212(b). That phrase is defined by neither the International Revenue Code nor the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commissioner. Certain principles, however, have evolved from the substantial body of case law interpreting section 6212(b). In <em>Alta Sierra Vista, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. 367, 374 (1974), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>538 F.2d 334 (9th Cir. 1976), the Tax Court defined \u201clast known address\u201d as \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s last permanent address of a definite duration to which the taxpayer has directed the Commissioner to send all communications.\u201d As a general proposition, the Commissioner is entitled to treat the address of the taxpayer appearing on the return being audited as the taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d absent \u201cclear and concise notification from the taxpayer directing the Commissioner to use a different address.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commissioner must, however, exercise reasonable diligence to ascertain a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address.\u201d <em>Delman v. Commissioner, </em>384 F.2d 929, 932 (3d Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 952, 88 S.Ct. 1044, 19 L.Ed.2d 1144 (1968); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. 543, 550 (1974); <em>Alta Sierra Vista, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. at 374. Whether the Commissioner has properly discharged his obligation to reasonably ascertain a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d is a question to be resolved upon the facts and circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Brien v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. at 550; <em>Lifter v. Commissioner, </em>59 T.C. 818, 821 (1973). Being a factual question, the Tax Court\u2019s resolution thereof will only be reversed if clearly erroneous. <em>Johnson v. Commissioner, </em>611 F.2d 1015, 1019 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">The particular factual circumstances that, when considered together, cause us to reverse the Tax Court\u2019s finding in the instant case include: (1) in 1976, petitioners mailed two documents to the Kansas City Service Center that bore their Oleander Street address; (2) in November 1977, the Kansas City Service Center communicated by mail with petitioners at their Oleander Street address; (3) Agent Swanson of the Commissioner\u2019s Chicago offices was aware in 1977 of petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address; (4) petitioners did nothing to conceal their Oleander Street address from the Commissioner; (5) the Commissioner\u2019s file on petitioners does not contain a return receipt for the notice of deficiency; and (6) the Commissioner\u2019s Chicago offices in early 1979 sent to Mrs. McPartlin a \u201cNotice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Tax Lien\u201d and an accompanying letter at petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Turning first to a discussion of the communications between petitioners and the Kansas City Service Center, we prefatorially note that numerous cases have held that notice of a change of address is not accomplished merely by filing a return that bears an address different than that appearing on the previously filed audited return. <em>E. g., Luhring v. Glotzbach, </em>304 F.2d 556, 558 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Kuebler v. Commissioner, </em>38 T.C.M. 454, 455 (1979); <em>Alta Sierra Vista, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. at 376; <em>Budlong v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 850, 852-53 (1972). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, on the other hand, consistently has held that a return subsequently filed with the same service center as was the audited return affords the Commissioner sufficient notice of the taxpayer\u2019s change of address. <em>Cohen v. United States, </em>297 F.2d 760, 773 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 865, 82 S.Ct. 1029, 8 L.Ed.2d 84 (1962); <em>Welch v. Schweitzer, </em>106 F.2d 885, 887 (9th Cir. 1939); <em>Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Lazy Two T Ranch, Inc., </em>76-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9666 (N.D.Cal. 1976). <em>See generally Weinroth v. Commissioner, </em>74 T.C. 430, 438 (1980). Recently, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, faced with an issue similar to that presented in the instant case, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-6\">Although the adequacy of subsequently filed tax returns alone to provide notification of a change in address is questionable and unclear, notice of ... [the taxpayer\u2019s new address] . . . was afforded and evidenced apart from his 1970 and 1971 income tax returns. Moreover \u201ca taxpayer\u2019s last known address must be determined by a consideration of all relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Lifter v. Commissioner, </em>[59 T.C. 818] <em>supra </em>at 821; and \u201cthe Commissioner is required to exercise reasonable care and diligence in ascertaining and mailing a deficiency notice to the correct address.\u201d <em>Arlington Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>183 F.2d 448, 450 (5th Cir. 1950). The controlling test therefore as to when the statutory time period for filing the petition for redetermination began is whether, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, the IRS acted reasonably in mailing the deficiency notice . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADe\"><em>Crum v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d 895, 899 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">This Circuit has never had occasion to explicitly consider the effect of subsequently filed returns upon the Commissioner\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address.\u201d We find in the instant case, as apparently did the <em>Crum </em>court, that subsequently filed returns must be considered relevant when determining a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address.\u201d This is particularly so when, as in the instant case, a subsequently filed return was filed with the same service center as was the return audited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Kansas City Service Center received notice of petitioners\u2019 change of address, because in 1977 it contacted petitioners\u2019 at their Oleander Street address. Therefore, a check by the agents of the Chicago offices, an office located within the area served by the Kansas City Service Center, with the records of the Kansas City Service Center would have apprised those agents of petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">Further, Agent Swanson of the Commissioner\u2019s Chicago offices was aware of peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>tioners\u2019 Oleander Street address in 1977. The Commissioner argues that Agent Swanson\u2019s knowledge should not be imputed to those agents of the Chicago office assigned to the civil investigation of petitioners\u2019 1971 return. Recently, the Tax Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Weinroth v. Commissioner, </em>74 T.C. 430 (1980). While <em>Weinroth </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in that <em>the taxpayer </em>in <em>Weinroth </em>gave notice to another agent assigned to <em>civil </em>investigations within the same district office as the agent assigned to the taxpayer\u2019s case, we read <em>Weinroth </em>for the proposition, applicable herein, that the fact of any notice to an agent of the same district office as the agent assigned to a taxpayer\u2019s case is entitled to some weight when determining a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">We also deem significant that petitioners did nothing to conceal from the Commissioner their new address. <em>Crum v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d at 899. <em>See also Kennedy v. United States, </em>403 F.Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Mich.1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>556 F.2d 581 (6th Cir. 1977). Petitioners filed their change of address with the Postal Service. After moving to the Oleander Street address, petitioners listed that address on all of their communications with the Commissioner. Accordingly, the instant case is readily distinguishable from our decision in <em>Rappaport v. United States, </em>583 F.2d 298 (7th Cir. 1978), where we held that a notice of deficiency mailed to the address on the audited return was sufficient when the taxpayer had moved without giving a forwarding address and was living under an assumed name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">To reiterate, a taxpayer should not be expected to appreciate the separate responsibilities of a service center and district offices within the service center. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>As the <em>Crum </em>court remarked, \u201c[a]n innocent taxpayer should not be penalized because the tax collector neglects to tell his right hand what his left hand is doing.\u201d <em>Crum v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Although the April 13, 1978 notice of deficiency was sent to petitioners\u2019 former Lockwood Avenue address by certified mail, the Commissioner has no record of a return receipt ever being received. The law presumes delivery of a properly addressed piece of mail. <em>Zenco Engineering Co. v. Commissioner, </em>75 T.C. No. 25 (1980). <em>See Lewin v. Commissioner, </em>569 F.2d 444 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3090, 57 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1978). However, that presumption must be overcome as to a piece of certified mail when no receipt notice is returned. <em>See id. </em>The fact that the Commissioner\u2019s file contains no return receipt for the notice mailed April 13, 1978 fosters the conclusion that fault for the petitioners\u2019 failure to receive notice must rest with the Postal Service or the Commissioner, but, in any event, not with petitioners. Either the Postal Service mishandled the notice or the Commissioner\u2019s agents misplaced the return receipt. When evidence indicates that a notice of deficiency has not been received by the taxpayer due to error of the Postal Service, the notice shall be found insufficient. <em>E. g., Estate of McKaig v. Commissioner, </em>51 T.C. 331 (1968). Moreover, if the Postal Service caused the notice of deficiency to be misplaced, the Commissioner\u2019s failure to receive a return receipt should have apprised him that delivery to petitioners of the notice of deficiency was never attempted. If, on the other hand, the return receipt was sent to the Commissioner it should have informed him that petitioners no longer resided at Lockwood Avenue. In such circumstances, notice is also insufficient. <em>See Johnson v. Commissioner, </em>611 F.2d at 1020; <em>Carbone v. Commissioner, </em>8 T.C. 207 (1947). Thus, whether or not the Commissioner actually received the return receipt, the notice must be found insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">The final factual circumstance that supports the conclusion that the April 13, 1978 notice of deficiency was not sent to petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address\u201d is that the Commissioner\u2019s agents assigned to petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>ers\u2019 case were able to reach Mrs. McPartlin at petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address in early 1979 when they mailed her a \u201cNotice of Tax Lien\u201d and accompanying letter. The record is devoid of evidence that any communication transpired between petitioners and the Commissioner between the April 13, 1978 mailing of the notice of deficiency to petitioners\u2019 former Lockwood Avenue address and the January 23,1979 mailing of a letter and \u201cNotice of Tax Lien\u201d to petitioners\u2019 Oleander Street address. Perhaps petitioners\u2019 1977 or 1978 return or both were filed with the Kansas City Service Center. In any event, the inference that fairly must be drawn from the Commissioner\u2019s ability to communicate with petitioners\u2019 at their Oleander Street address in early 1979 is that he could reasonably have done so in April 1978. <em>See Crum v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the April 13, 1978 notice of deficiency mailed by the Commissioner to petitioners\u2019 Lockwood Avenue address was not mailed to their \u201clast known address\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212(b) and that the Tax Court\u2019s finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous. Further, we find that petitioners\u2019 petition for a redetermination was timely filed before the Tax Court. Mailing of a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d commences the running of the 90 day period during which the taxpayer may petition the Tax Court for a redetermination. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. When notice of a deficiency is not sent to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address,\u201d subsequent actual notice of the determined deficiency will commence the running of the 90 day period. <em>Crum v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d at 901; <em>Kennedy v. United States, </em>403 F.Supp. at 624. <em>See also Alta Sierra Vista, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>62 T.C. at 377; <em>Budlong v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. at 853-54. \u25a0 It is unnecessary for us to decide whether petitioners received actual notice of the determined deficiency as early as upon Mrs. McPartlin\u2019s early February 1979 receipt from the Commissioner of the letter and \u201cNotice of Tax Lien,\u201d as opposed to upon their actual receipt of a copy of the notice of deficiency, since petitioners\u2019 April 25, 1979 petition for a redetermination was filed with the Tax Court within 90 days of February 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Having found the Tax Court to have erred in dismissing petitioners\u2019 petition for a redetermination, we now turn to petitioners\u2019 contention that the Tax Court erred in denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings inasmuch as it asserts a defense of the applicable statute of limitation. The applicable statute of limitation periods are set forth in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501. A generally applicable 3 year period of limitation is found in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a). A 6 year period of limitation is applicable whenever a taxpayer omits from gross income an amount in excess of 25 percent of the gross income reported. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(e). No period of limitation applies to a return filed with a fraudulent intent to evade tax. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(c)(1). The above periods of limitation begin to run upon filing of the pertinent return, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501, and are tolled for any period the Commissioner is precluded from assessing a deficiency by reason of, for example, the mailing of a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d or by the initiation of proceedings before the Tax Court. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">The order of the Tax Court understandably contains no discussion of petitioners\u2019 statute of limitation argument. Because the Tax Court found that it was without jurisdiction to hear the petition for a redetermination, it was unnecessary for the Tax Court to consider petitioners\u2019 statute of limitation argument. Stated differently, it is unreasonable to assume that the Tax Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings for any other reason than its jurisdictional finding. Admittedly it appears at first blush that Mrs. McPartlin is entitled to judgment in the Tax Court due to the expiration of either the 3 or 6. year period of limitation since no fraud is alleged on her part, while Mr. McPartlin, on the other hand, is not entitled to judgment because fraud on his part is alleged. However, we find that those determinations should be made in the first instance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>Tax Court. We therefore remand this matter to the Tax Court for consideration of petitioners\u2019 statute of limitation argument in light of the foregoing discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the finding of the Tax Court that the April 13, 1978 mailing of a notice of deficiency was mailed to petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address,\u201d and that therefore petitioners\u2019 April 25,1979 petition for a redetermination was untimely filed, is clearly erroneous. We hasten to emphatically add, however, that our holding is based solely upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. In light of the above holding, we further find that petitioners are entitled to have their statute of limitation argument considered anew by the Tax Court. Accordingly, we reverse and vacate the order of the Tax Court granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and denying petitioners\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and remand this matter for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">. Petitioners make a due process challenge to the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s notice of deficiency provision, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212. In view of our holding today, we need not reach that constitutional question. <em>But see Lewin v. Commissioner, </em>569 F.2d 444 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3090, 57 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">. Mr. McPartlin was ultimately indicted on tax charges concerning his 1971 income as well as other related criminal charges. The tax charges were dismissed before trial. <em>United States v. McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 833, 100 S.Ct. 65, 62 L.Ed.2d 43 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">.

The \u201cNotice of Federal Tax Lien\u201d erroneously claims Mrs. McPartlin\u2019s total tax liability to be $37,259.84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-8\">\u00a7 6212. Notice of deficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-9\">(a) In general. If the Secretary determines that there is a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitles A or B of chapter 41, 42, 43, 44, or 45, he is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by certified mail or registered mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-10\">(b) Address for notice of deficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-11\">(1) Income and gift taxes and certain excise taxes. In the absence of notice to the Secretary under section 6903 of the existence of a fiduciary relationship, notice of a deficiency in respect of a tax imposed by subtitle A, chapter 12, chapter 41, chapter 42, chapter 43, chapter 44, or chapter 45, if mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address, shall be sufficient for purposes of subtitle A, chapter 12, chapter 41, chapter 42, chapter 43, chapter 44, chapter 45, and this chapter even if such taxpayer is deceased, or is under a legal disability or, in the case of a corporation has terminated its existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-12\">(2) Joint income tax return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-16\">In the case of a joint income tax return filed by husband and wife, such notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the Secretary has been notified by either spouse that separate residences have been established, then, in lieu of the single joint notice, a duplicate original of the joint notice shall be sent by certified mail or registered mail to each spouse at his last known address.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1244-17\">. \u00a7 6213 Restrictions applicable to deficiencies: petition to Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">(a) Time for filing petition and restriction on assessment. Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after the notice of deficiency authorized in section 6212 is mailed (not counting Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last day), the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. Except as otherwise provided in section 6851 or section 6861 no assessment of a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitle A or B, chapter 41, 42, 43, 44 or 45 and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such 90-day or 150-day period, as the case may be, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court. * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">(c) Failure to file petition. If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (a),</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">. The decisions resolving this question may not be easily harmonized. Indeed, cases with nearly identical underlying factual circumstances have spawned quite disparate decisions. <em>Compare Welch v. Schweitzer, </em>106 F.2d 885 (9th Cir. 1939) <em>with Budlong v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 850 (1972) and <em>compare Estate of McKaig v. Commissioner, </em>51 T.C. 331 (1968) <em>with Kuebler v. Commissioner, </em>38 T.C.M. 454 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">. Because other considerations as well indicate petitioners\u2019 \u201clast known address\u201d to be the Oleander Street address at the time of the Commissioner\u2019s April 13, 1978 mailing of the notice of deficiency, we need not decide whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s position merits adoption by this Circuit. We pause to note, however, that a taxpayer should not be expected to appreciate the separate responsibilities of the Commissioner\u2019s service centers and his offices located within the service centers. Crum <em>v. Commissioner, </em>635 F.2d at 900. This is particularly true when the Commissioner has apparently not sought to inform taxpayers by way of the numerous channels of communication at his disposal \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>tax forms and informational publications \u2014 that a change of address should be communicated by a taxpayer at a certain office of the Commissioner. Moreover, in this the age of sophisticated computer information storage and retrieval systems, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s position can hardly be deemed to impose an unreasonable burden upon the Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
