As grounds for relief, Lester alleged that a material witness, who testified on behalf of defendant-appellee that the fire had been deliberately set, falsely and fraudulently stated his qualifications as an expert on arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion as untimely, ruling that Rule 60(b)(6) governs a motion to set aside a judgment for fraud by a nonparty and that such a motion must be filed within one year after the judgment, consistent with the time limitation of Rule 60(b)(3) governing fraud by a party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In essence, the court concluded that although Rule 60(b)(6) states only that the motion be filed within \u201ca reasonable time,\u201d it would be unreasonable, absent special circumstances, to permit reopening of a judgment on grounds of third-party fraud when a similar motion based on fraud by a party would be barred by Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">Under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, as published in 87 F.R.D. 466 (E.D.Mo.1980).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">. The Honorable John F. Nangle, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-12\">. Rule 60(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axk\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: * * (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; * * * or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
