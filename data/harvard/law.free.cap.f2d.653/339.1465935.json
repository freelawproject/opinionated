In its complaint the Federation alleged the invalidity of a FDA regulation that authorizes qualifying food products to bear a label describing these products as \u201csubstitute[s]\u201d rather than as \u201cimitation[s]\u201d. In addition, the complaint alleged that the FDA had unlawfully approved the marketing of food products as cheese substitutes and had unlawfully refused to enforce the regulation against such products.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">The FDA moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and, in the alternative, for summary judgment. After submission of affidavits, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted the FDA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. In its memorandum and order the district court upheld the validity of the challenged regulation and concluded that the FDA\u2019s enforcement of the regulation was committed to the agency\u2019s discretion. For reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-392 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979), establishes criminal penalties for the adulteration or misbranding of any food. Section 403(e) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(c) (1976), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">A food shall be deemed to be misbranded\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\"><em>Imitation of another food </em>(c) If it is an imitation of another food, unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word \u201cimitation\u201d and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The Act, however, contains no provision defining the word \u201cimitation.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">In 1973 the FDA held a notice-and-comment rulemaking proceeding to define the statutory term \u201cimitation.\u201d <em>See </em>38 Fed. Reg. 2138-39 (1973). Eight months after publishing notice of its proposed rulemaking, the FDA promulgated the regulation in issue here and now codified at 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The regulation requires any nutritionally inferior food which is a substitute for and resembles another food to bear a label identifying it as an \u201cimitation\u201d in accord with section 403(c) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(c) (1976). 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e)(1) (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulation defines nutritional inferiority as any reduction, in comparison with the content of the resembled food, in the content of essential nutrients which constitute two percent or more of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (U.S. RDA) of protein or listed vitamins and' minerals. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(eX4) (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, to be free from the imitation labeling requirement, the regulation provides that a substitute food at least nutritionally equivalent to the food it resembles must have a label bearing a common or usual name or an appropriately descriptive term. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e)(2) (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">As already noted, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>the D.C. Circuit upheld the regulation as consistent with the Act and \u201cwell within the zone of reasonableness required of agency rulemaking.\u201d <em>Federation of Homemakers v. Schmidt, </em>539 F.2d 740, 743-44 (D.C.Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-19\">In 1978 the FDA initiated a rulemaking proceeding to establish standards of identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ty for food products, including cheese substitutes. <em>See </em>43 Fed.Reg. 42, 118-42, 141 (1978). The Federation has participated in this proceeding. Should the FDA promulgate regulations that establish standards of identity for cheese substitutes, cheese substitutes would acquire a common or usual name and would thereby qualify for automatic exemption from the imitation labeling requirement. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.-3(e)(3) (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In 1979 the Federation filed two petitions with the FDA seeking, respectively, revocation of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e) (1980) and withdrawal of the proposed regulations adopting standards of identity for cheese substitutes. At the same time, the Federation sought enforcement action from the FDA against producers of cheese substitutes for misbranding. The FDA notified the Federation that it had forwarded the Federation\u2019s letters together with the labels of allegedly misbranded cheese substitute products \u201cto the respective [FDA district offices] in whose area the manufacturers are located \u25a0for their appropriate attention.\u201d After further correspondence, the FDA informed the Federation that budgetary constraints had forced it to set investigative and enforcement priorities and that it had assigned its lowest priorities to \u201cfood economics and food standards.\u201d The FDA accordingly concluded that it \u201cexpect[ed] no actions in the near future concerning the cheese substitute products indicated in [the Federation\u2019s] letters.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Federation thereafter filed its complaint in this action. The Federation principally sought mandatory relief ordering the FDA to enforce the Act and the regulation against manufacturers of cheese substitute products and to prevent the agency from sanctioning the use of labels bearing the words \u201ccheese substitute\u201d or the like rather than \u201cimitation cheese.\u201d The Federation also sought declaratory relief holding unlawful the FDA\u2019s \u201cdecision to exempt from labeling as \u2018imitation\u2019 * * * food products made in semblance of and offered for sale in substitution for any standardized cheese or cheese related product[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">II. <em>The Federation's Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">In urging reversal of the district court judgment, the Federation renews its claims for declaratory and mandatory relief. These claims depend roughly on two contentions: (1) that 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e) (1980) is unlawful under the Act and, in the alternative, (2) that the FDA has violated its own regulation by approving the marketing of products labeled as \u201ccheese substitutes.\u201d Because we reject these contentions, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue either mandatory or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">A. <em>The Unlawfulness of the Regulation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">The FDA enacted 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(e) (1980) pursuant to the Act\u2019s provision authorizing the promulgation of regulations to efficiently enforce the Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a) (1976). The Federation challenges the regulation as exceeding the FDA\u2019s statutory authority and as otherwise inconsistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The Federation contends that the issue of statutory authority, as a question of law, should not be deferred to the FDA. We agree that the FDA possesses no special expertise in addressing legal questions, and that the courts are the final arbiters on issues of statutory construction. <em>See Volkswagenwerk v. Federal Maritime Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>sion, </em>390 U.S. 261, 272, 88 S.Ct. 929, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968). Nevertheless, an agency\u2019s construction of its operational statute is entitled to deference by the courts. <em>Medical Center of Independence v. Harris, </em>628 F.2d 1113, 1117-18 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Blue Cross Association v. Harris, </em>622 F.2d 972, 978-79 (8th Cir. 1980). Ordinarily, this construction will be upheld if it has a reasonable basis in law and does not frustrate congressional policy. <em>Medical Center of Independence v. Harris, supra, </em>628 F.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In <em>Federation of Homemakers v. Schmidt, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 743-44, the D.C. Circuit applied these principles in explicitly rejecting the arguments advanced by the Federation here. The court held that the regulation successfully reconciled the Act\u2019s objective of alerting the public to inferior products with the Act\u2019s proscription against false or misleading labels.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 343(a) (1976). Moreover, the court held that \u201cthe regulation is well within the zone of reasonableness required of agency rule-making.\u201d <em>Federation of Homemakers v. Schmidt, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 743-44. We agree with the D.C. Circuit that the regulation in question is valid for all the reasons adduced in its thoughtful opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">B. <em>FDA Violation of the Regulation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Federation also contends that the FDA has sanctioned and approved the sale in interstate commerce of misbranded \u201ccheese substitutes\u201d, in violation of the Act and the regulation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Federation therefore sought mandatory relief ordering the FDA to initiate enforcement proceedings against the manufacturers of cheese substitutes or declaratory relief establishing the illegality of the FDA\u2019s alleged conduct. The district court held that because the initiation of such enforcement proceedings was committed to the FDA\u2019s discretion by law, the Federation\u2019s factual allegations failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion as to the Federation\u2019s alternative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The executive branch and its departments enjoy a discretion in the initiation of investigative, enforcement, and prosecutorial actions limited only by constitutional strictures and relevant statutory directives. <em>See generally, United States v. Alarik, </em>439 F.2d 1349 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Newman v. United States, </em>382 F.2d 479 (D.C.Cir.1967). As we stated in <em>Terminal Freight Handling Co. v. Solien, </em>444 F.2d 699 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 996, 92 S.Ct. 1246, 31 L.Ed.2d 465 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">Generally those engaged in prosecutorial or enforcement activities are allowed a wide discretion and considerable latitude on when to file charges and against whom charges are to be filed. This is necessarily so for many reasons, some more obvious than others. The resources of those engaged in prosecutorial activities as well as the resources of all agencies of the Government and the country itself are not unlimited. Priorities must be established and the resources available utilized to carry out the primary object of the enforcement activity. * * * However, this general prosecutorial discretion is neither absolute nor unfettered, and where an appropriate statute directs mandatory action, the prosecutorial discretion is thus narrowed and limited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>[Terminal Freight Handling Co. v. Solien, supra, </em>444 F.2d at 708.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">After carefully reviewing the Act, we have found no provision which narrows or limits the discretion of the FDA to investigate, enforce, or prosecute alleged violations of the Act or its regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that the Federation\u2019s complaint which seeks the initiation of investigative, enforcement, or prosecutorial proceedings fails to state a claim upon which either mandatory or declaratory relief can be granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Haleston Drug Stores, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>187 F.2d 418, 420-22 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 815, 72 S.Ct. 29, 96 L.Ed. 616 (1951); <em>Crooker v. Securities and Exchange Commission, </em>161 F.2d 944, 949 (1st Cir. 1947). <em>Cf. Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); <em>Howard v. Hodgson, </em>490 F.2d 1194 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record, the regulation, and each of the Federation\u2019s arguments in this case. We affirm that part of the district court\u2019s memorandum and order upholding the regulation. We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Federation\u2019s request for mandatory and declaratory relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\">.

Circuit noted in its opinion rejecting a challenge to the same regulation in issue here, \u201cuntil promulgation of the challenged regulation, a definition [of the word \u201cimitation\u201d] had evolved only indirectly from infrequent cases involving [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(c) (1976)].\u201d <em>Federation of Homemakers v.

This subsection of the regulation provides that a food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation and which complies with all applicable requirements shall not be deemed to be an imitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. The FDA stated that it was \u201cnot aware of any situations where we have accepted the term \u2018Cheese Substitute\u2019, unqualified, as an appropriately descriptive name for products which substitute for and resemble cheese. We have not, however, objected to such names as \u2018_cheese substitute, made from vegetable fat or_\u2019, if the product met the [nutritional equivalency] provisions of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.-3(e).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. The court held that neither legislative history nor the Act\u2019s undefined use of the term \u201cimitation\u201d in \u00a7 403(c), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(c) (1976), demonstrated the regulation\u2019s inconsistency with congressional objectives. <em>Federation of Homemakers v. Schmidt, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 743.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">. We note some inconsistency in appellants\u2019 contention. On the one hand, appellants maintain that \u201cno determination has been made that [cheese substitutes] are not \u2018nutritionally inferi- or to [the] food\u2019 for which they substitute\u201d in violation of the regulation. On the other hand, appellants argue that the regulation was \u201cinchoate\u201d because the FDA had failed to adopt a standard of nutritional equivalency or because no such standard existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">. We note parenthetically that, although the Act empowers the FDA to investigate violations, the FDA itself does not prosecute violations of the Act. The Act provides for the FDA\u2019s reporting of violations to the United States for all enforcement proceedings. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 336-337 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b400-19\">. Moreover, even if we could construe the complaint as setting forth allegations establishing some invasion of the Federation\u2019s rights, mandatory or declaratory relief might be deemed inappropriate in this case because the FDA, in a pending rulemaking proceeding, is considering the issue of the labeling of cheese substitute products.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
