In essence, the court found that the functions performed by the supervisory trainees required greater skill, effort, and responsibility than the work performed by the clerks in the Internal Services Department. The court also concluded that, even assuming the supervisory trainees and clerks performed substantially equal work for unequal pay, the Company\u2019s training program constituted a \u201cfactor other than sex,\u201d a lawful basis for the wage differential under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(l)(iv).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">On appeal, the EEOC challenges these findings as clearly erroneous and contrary to law. After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the work performed by the supervisory trainees required greater skill, effort, and responsibility than that performed by the clerks in the Internal Services Department. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of UUIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">I. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-14\">UUIC, a nationwide insurance company, principally writes policies for factory-franchised new car dealers and motorcycle operators. In the late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s, UUIC\u2019s business in these areas grew substantially. From 1967 to 1972, the Company nearly doubled its insurance volume and became the largest writer of automobile agency insurance in the nation. Also, during this period, UUIC developed a computerized system for producing insurance policies. To implement this system, the Company established eleven new regional offices throughout the country and extensively reorganized the Internal Services Department in its home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>As a result of the Company\u2019s rapid growth, computerization, and reorganization, management officials determined that UUIC had an immediate need for additional supervisors in the Internal Services Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1967, therefore, UUIC developed and implemented a management training program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">After implementation of the training program, two tracks existed for advancement toward supervisory positions in the Internal Services Department: (1) a \u201ctraditional track,\u201d in which employees assumed entry-level positions as grade V clerks and became eligible for a managerial position upon attaining the grade IX level; and (2) a \u201cfast track,\u201d in which employees directly achieved supervisory positions after successfully completing the Company\u2019s two-year management training program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Virtually all of the clerks in the Internal Services Department were female; all but one of the thirty participants in the management training program were male. The EEOC charges that, irrespective of the difference in their job titles, the female clerks and the male supervisory trainees performed substantially equal work; thus, the Company\u2019s payment of lower wages to the female clerks constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">To establish a violation of the Equal Pay Act, the EEOC must demonstrate that an employer compensated employees of one sex at a lower rate than it paid to employees of the opposite sex for \u201cequal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility\u201d under similar working conditions. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">Whether two jobs entail equal skill, equal effort, or equal responsibility requires a practical judgment on the basis of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Skill includes such considerations as experience, training, education, and ability. Effort refers to the physical or mental exertion necessary to the performance of a job. Responsibility concerns the degree of accountability required in performing a job. Application of the Equal Pay Act depends not on job titles or classifications but on the actual requirements and performance of the job. In all cases, therefore, a court must compare the jobs in question in light of the full factual situation and the broad remedial purpose of the statute. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.114r-.132 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">In the present case, the district court compared the supervisory trainee and clerk positions and, among other differences, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-17\">26. Qualifications to be hired in the starting nonsupervisory Internal Services position were as follows: high school diploma, typing at 40 wpm, mathematical ability, coding ability, data perception, and writing ability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-19\">28. The necessary qualifications needed by persons to be selected for the supervisor training program were clearly defined and reduced to writing in 1970 as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>(a) Maturity \u2014 at least 22 years of age and realistic appraisal of own ability and potential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-4\">(b) Motivation \u2014 desire to learn and make a career of our business, and need the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-5\">(c) Education \u2014 at least high school graduate with emphasis on math, business, accounting, and human relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-6\">(d) Experience \u2014 general office with emphasis on detail and/or supervision, or counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-7\">(e) Performance \u2014 record of consistency, established in the community with no obvious tendency or potential for moving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-8\">(f) Personality \u2014 self-assured, friendly, neat in appearance, ability to command attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-10\">36. Regular Internal Services Department clerks were required to be able to type. The trainees in the Internal Services Department were not required to be able to type. If a trainee could type, then the trainee did his or her own typing when the job function required it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-11\">37. The supervisor trainees became involved in and helped analyze supervisory problems and company policies. The trainees also made recommendations to management on solving problems. Regular clerks did not become involved in these aspects of UUIC\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-12\">38. The trainees were required to demonstrate an ability to adapt easily to changing job situations and requirements and an ability to learn to supervise new and complex jobs in a relatively short period of time, whereas the clerks were not required to demonstrate these skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-13\">39. Supervisor trainees were required to learn and understand all functions of the Internal Services Department. The regular clerks were required to learn only the specific job to which the clerk was assigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdL\">40. If the supervisor trainees, at any time, did not exhibit an aptitude for the supervisory aspects of the work, they were terminated. Clerks were not required to exhibit an aptitude for the supervisory aspects of work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-16\">41. Clerks were allowed more time than trainees to learn the specific job to which the clerk was assigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-17\">42. The supervisor trainees were expected to gain a comprehension of the reasons for the clerical work being done in Internal Services Department and the interrelationship of that work to other jobs in the company. The clerks were not expected to comprehend those subjects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-18\">43. The supervisor trainees were required to learn the various jobs of the department from the viewpoint of understanding, not only the job content, but also the difficulties and frustrations of personnel in each job so as to be able to effectively supervise and motivate the clerks working on these jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-19\">44. The supervisor trainees were required to learn the interrelationship of the various departments in the company and to be able to coordinate activities in the Internal Services Department with the activities of other departments in the company, whereas clerks did not have these responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-21\">52. Supervisor trainees were given training that was not given to regular employees in the Internal Services Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-22\">53. Supervisor trainees were periodically evaluated during their training by supervisors and managers in the Internal Services Department. The evaluation system for trainees differed from that for clerks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-24\">57. The trainees rotated between positions in the Internal Services Department. Although the length of time allotted for each trainee to learn the functions of the various departmental jobs was the same, time actually spent varied depending upon the particular trainee\u2019s aptitude. The training program rotation differed from normal personnel assignments, which, generally, were (a) not rotating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>and (b) were for the purpose of producing work rather than training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-6\">59. In addition to the formal classroom-type training school, trainees were given additional training, dealing with supervisory skills, to which clerks in the Internal Services Department were not exposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-7\">60. Supervisor trainees attended meetings of the supervisors of the Internal Services Department, which meetings would vary in number and duration depending on the need for such supervisory meetings. These supervisory meetings were not generally open to non-supervisory employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">On the basis of these findings, the district court made its ultimate finding that the work performed by the supervisory trainees required substantially greater skill, effort, and responsibility than the work performed by the clerks in the Internal Services Department. The court therefore concluded that UUIC did not violate the provisions of the Equal Pay Act by paying its trainees higher wages than its regular clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a discrimination action, we must make an independent determination of the court\u2019s ultimate finding of discrimination or nondiscrimination, but we remain bound by the court\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Strecker v. Grand Forks County Social Service Board, </em>640 F.2d 96, 99 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc). <em>See Shultz v. American Can Co. </em>\u2014 Dixie <em>Products, </em>424 F.2d 356, 360 n.6 (8th Cir. 1970). Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we cannot characterize the district court\u2019s subsidiary findings as clearly erroneous. Nor can we say that the district court erred as a matter of law in its ultimate finding that the supervisory trainees and the clerks did not perform substantially equal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">On appeal, the EEOC challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion, arguing that the district court\u2019s own subsidiary findings of fact contradict its ultimate finding that UUIC did not discriminate on the basis of sex. In particular, the Commission singles out findings 35 and 48 as substantiating a violation of the Equal Pay Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-13\">35. The supervisor trainees spent most of their training time learning the work performed by the regular clerks in the Internal Services Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-15\">48. A number of female employees in the Internal Services Department were also given informal training in supervisory skills, but were not officially admitted to the training program or paid a salary as high as that of the trainees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHan\">Read in context, however, these two findings do not establish that the supervisory trainees and clerks performed substantially equal work. Although the supervisory trainees spent most of their training time \u201clearning\u201d the work performed by entry-level clerks in the Internal Services Department, the focus of the two jobs differed fundamentally. The clerks\u2019 job emphasized proficiency at carrying out a particular task. The clerks remained responsible for only that job to which they had been initially assigned. The trainees\u2019 job, in contrast, required only a basic understanding of the mechanics of that task and how it related to other jobs in the Company. Once the trainees \u201clearned\u201d a job, the manage'ment training program mandated a rotation to another job.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, trainees had to \u201clearn\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>the job in a shorter time period or face termination. Finally, the training program required the trainees to exhibit an aptitude \u2018 for and receive training in supervisory skills. Although some female clerks also performed supervisory-like duties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> these supervisory duties do not necessarily establish that the clerks performed substantially equal work as the supervisory trainees. For purposes of the Equal Pay Act, the overall job, not individual segments of the job, determine whether two groups of employees perform substantially equal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Thus, our independent review of the district court record convinces us that the supervisory trainees performed work requiring greater skill, effort, and responsibility than the clerks in the Internal Services Department. As the Commission failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we need not rule on the Company\u2019s affirmative defense that its management training program constitutes a \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d justifying the difference in wages paid to the trainees and the clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">. The Secretary of Labor originally filed this action in 1975, naming UUIC, Epperson Underwriting Company, Lumbermen\u2019s Underwriting Alliance, and E. M. Lynn, d/b/a Lynn Insurance Group, as party-defendants. In 1979, however, the EEOC assumed the Secretary\u2019s role as plaintiff after Congress and the President transferred enforcement of the Equal Pay Act from the Department of Labor to the Commission.

Subsequently, the Commission stipulated to the dismissal of Epperson Underwriting Company and Lumbermen\u2019s Underwriting Alliance as defendants. <em>See </em>Amended Standard Pre-Trial Order No. 2 Including Stipulation of Uncontroverted Facts, <em>Marshall v.

According to the district court\u2019s findings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-10\">3. * * * UUIC initiated a supervisor\u2019s training program because it determined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-11\">(a) that its traditional concept of developing managers from within would not satisfy its increasing needs for managers who could understand and advance in a new technological environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-12\">(b) that the clerks working in the Internal Services Department had little business experience and little or no educational background beyond high school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">(c) that most of the clerks evidenced a lack of present or potential managerial and supervisory skills;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-20\">(d) that the salary structure of the Internal Services Department was competitive with the salary structure of like businesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-21\">(e) that such a salary structure did not generally attract people with high managerial potential and attracted virtually no males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-22\">4.

In 1970, the Company expanded the training program and reduced it to writing. Most of the trainees entered the program after 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">. Citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hodgson v. Security National Bank of Sioux City, </em>460 F.2d 57 (8th Cir. 1972), the Commission claims that the Company\u2019s rotation of trainees was functionally indistinguishable from the movement of entry-level clerks in the normal course of employment. The rotation program in <em>Hodgson, </em>however, differs significantly from the one before us now.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-16\">The \u201ctrainees\u201d did not rotate through various departments of the Bank in order to acquire detailed knowledge and comprehension of the Bank\u2019s whole operation, but rather, the rotation was confined to various paying-and-receiving windows. None of the male employees during the period here in question followed the specific rotation of the Bank\u2019s written management training program. The female tellers, too, followed a random rota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>tion among the various paying-and-receiving windows. The rotation of male, as well as female, personnel appears to have been geared to the personnel needs of the Bank, and not to training requirements. <em>[Id. </em>at 61.] <em>Hodgson </em>differs from the present case in oth-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AElZ\">er respects as well. In that case, the male trainees were unaware that any training program existed and male applicants for employment received only assurances of advancement if \u201ceverything worked out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, trainees applied directly to the management training program and the Company informed them that the program included rotation between positions in the Internal Services Department and that, upon completion of their training, they would be placed in a supervisory position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1304-17\">.
