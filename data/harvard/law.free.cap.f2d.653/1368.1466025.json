By order filed April 13, 1977, a hearing officer for the Department of Labor denied Gurule\u2019s claim for benefits. Gurule appealed that decision to the Board. The Board vacated the hearing officer\u2019s order and remanded the case for a determination of the number of years Gurule was employed in coal mines in light of 20 CFR \u00a7 440.414(b)(4) and for reconsideration of any effects that the Black Lung Reform Act of 1977, with its implementing regulations 20 CFR Part 727, may have on Gurule\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-15\">On October 20, 1978, the hearing officer found that Gurule had twelve years of coal mine employment, that blood gas results and other medical evidence indicated total disability due to pneumoconiosis and that benefits should commence on March 1, 1975.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-16\">Gurule appealed to the Board contending that the onset date of March 1, 1975, was not supported by substantial evidence and incorrect as a matter of law. Gurule asserted that benefits should begin December 1, 1973, the month his claim was originally filed as provided by 20 CFR \u00a7 725.503(b). The Director, in response to Gurule\u2019s contention, claimed that February 1, 1975 was the proper benefit onset date because a blood gas study dated February 6,1975, was the first medical evidence indicating the existence of total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">On November 23, 1979, the Board affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s determination of Gurule\u2019s entitlement to black lung benefits, but vacated the March 1, 1975 onset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>date. Applying regulations 20 CFR \u00a7 725.-503(b) and 20 CFR \u00a7 727.303(b), the Board concluded that the proper onset date was January 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">The Director petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s final order pursuant to 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contending that the Board exceeded its scope of review by selecting January 1, 1974 as the benefit onset date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">The Board\u2019s scope of review is governed by the substantial evidence standard as provided by statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by procedural regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">Initially, the Board found that Gurule filed his claim for benefits on December 21, 1973 and that claims filed between July 1, 1973 and December 31, 1973 were considered \u201ctransition period\u201d claims. 30 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 925(a). Next, the Board applied 20 CFR \u00a7 725.1(c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to Gurule\u2019s December 21, 1973 filing date and characterized the claim as a section 415 or Part C claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">The Board then determined that Part 725 of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s implementing regulations was applicable to Part C claims, which were considered under Section 435 of the Act and Part 727 of the implementing regulations. 20 CFR \u00a7 725.2(b). <em>See also </em>20 CFR \u00a7 727.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-14\">In concluding this winding regulatory/statutory trail, the Board recognized that Gurule\u2019s benefit onset date would be properly determined by combined application of 20 CFR \u00a7 725.501 and 20 CFR \u00a7 725.503(b). The two subsections are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-15\">725.501 Payment provisions generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-16\">The provisions of this subpart govern the payment of benefits to claimants whose claims are approved for payment under section 415 and part C of title IV of the act or approved after review under section 435 of the act and part 727 of this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-17\">725.503(b) Date from which benefits are payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-18\">In the case of a miner who is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, benefits are payable to such miner beginning with the month of onset of total disability. <em>Where the evidence does not establish the month of onset, benefits shall be payable to such miner beginning with the month during which the claim was filed, </em>or the month during which the claimant elected review under Part 727 of this subchapter. [Emphasis supplied],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>After\" establishing this framework, the Board proceeded to review the record to decide whether substantial evidence supported the hearing officer\u2019s March 1975 benefit onset date determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">The record indicated that x-rays taken in November, 1973 and September, 1975, showed no signs of pneumoconiosis. Additionally, pulmonary function studies performed in October and May, 1974, produced values too high to establish total disability due to pneumoconiosis. The only indicia of total disability due to pneumoconiosis was found in blood gas results obtained by Dr. Goldberg on February 6, 1975.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> [R., Vol. IV, pp. C-l-2],</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">The Board found these blood gas results, pC02-26.5 and p02-48.3, to be well within the criteria for establishing total disability pursuant to 20 CFR \u00a7 727.203(a)(3). [R., Vol. I, p. 18]. In fact, the Board stated that \u201cThese values are clearly indicative of a severe respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d However, the Board found that even though the blood gas study detected significant pneumoconiosis, a single blood gas study was insufficient to establish the benefit onset date. In finding that the evidence did not establish Gurule\u2019s onset date the Board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-6\">It is well recognized that pneumoconiosis is often a latent, progressive and insidious disease and therefore evidence establishing total disability due to pneumoconiosis may relate backward in time to establish an earlier onset date in the <em>absence of </em>earlier contradictory like evidence. <em>See Begley v. Mathews, </em>554 F.2d 1345 (6th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 985, 97 S.Ct. 1684, 52 L.Ed.2d 380 (1977). Thus, it was <em>impossible for the hearing officer to have determined from the record </em>in this case <em>that the claimant was not totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis </em>as manifested by a diffusion defect and therefore, not entitled to benefits <em>during the period of time immediately preceding the date of the blood gas study. </em>The Board holds, therefore, that the medical evidence of record in this case does not establish the date of onset of total disability due to pneumoconiosis as required by Section 725.503(b) of the regulations. [R., Vol. I, p. 20]. [Footnote omitted]. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">Upon finding that the evidence did not establish the month of onset, the Board applied 20 CFR \u00a7 727.303(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-10\">A claim filed under section 415 of the act which is reviewed under this part shall for all purposes be considered as if it was filed on January 1, 1974, under part C of title IV of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">The Board thus concluded that where the evidence does not establish the month of onset, section 415 dictates a determination that benefits shall be payable beginning with the month the claim was \u201cfiled\u201d, January 1, 1974. 20 CFR \u00a7 725.503(b) and 20 CFR \u00a7 727.303(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">On review, the court of appeals must scrutinize the Board\u2019s decisions for errors of law and for adherence to the substantial evidence standard governing the Board\u2019s review of the administrative law judge\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Director, Officer of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>629 F.2d 1327 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">We first turn to the issue whether the Board adhered to the substantial evidence standard of review. The Director contends that \u201cthe Board made a factual determination itself that the blood gas study findings were \u2018clearly indicative of a severe respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u2019 On the basis of that factual determination, the Board then related the findings back from February 6, 1975 until January 1, 1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>making a second factual determination that this was a \u2018relatively short time\u2019.\u201d [Pet. Br. p. 11]. In our view, the Director\u2019s interpretation of the Board\u2019s reasoning ignores and misconstrues the actual basis for the Board\u2019s decision. The Board did not \u201crelate back\u201d the blood gas study results to the date of filing as the Director maintains. <em>See Begley v. Mathews, </em>544 F.2d 1345 (6th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 985, 97 S.Ct. 1684, 52 L.Ed.2d 380 (1977) and <em>Paluso v. Mathews, </em>573 F.2d 4 (10th Cir. 1978). Instead, the Board relied on <em>Begley </em>and <em>Paluso </em>for the proposition that pneumoconiosis is a \u201clatent, progressive and insidious disease\u201d making exact onset date determinations difficult when only one test exists indicating total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Applying that proposition, the Board determined that it was impossible to use February 6, 1975, the date of a blood gas study indicating severe respiratory or pulmonary impairment, to establish an onset date because total disability had to exist prior to the blood gas study date in light of the diffuse nature of the disease and its advanced state, as demonstrated by the blood gas results. Thus, the Board simply found that the hearing officer\u2019s onset date determination was not supported by substantial evidence. In the absence of an onset date, 20 CFR \u00a7 725.503(b) and 20 CFR \u00a7 727.303(b) became operative. Thus, the Board simply applied the Secretary of Labor\u2019s implementing regulations to arrive at an onset date. As we stated in <em>Paluso, supra, </em>\u201cAny doubts which arise as to when black lung caused total disability are to be resolved in favor of those good faith claimants.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision was in keeping with the spirit of that policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">The Director declines to address any of the regulations used by the Board in its section 415 or \u201ctransition\u201d claim analysis. Instead, the Director prefers to characterize the Board\u2019s decision as \u201cfactual determinations\u201d and to generally assert \u201cde novo\u201d review, encouraging this court to conclude that because the Board determined an onset date, it necessarily made a factual determination in excess of its scope of review. As we view it, the Director has, for whatever reason, failed to recognize that the onset date arrived at by the Board was accomplished pursuant to application of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s own regulations. The Board did not make a factual determination in arriving at the January 1, 1974 benefit onset date. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board did not violate the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-7\">Next, we must determine whether the Board committed errors of law in its application of the regulations. In reviewing rulings of the Board, this court generally must defer to the Board in its role as interpreter of the Act. <em>National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>600 F.2d 1288 (9th Cir. 1979). <em>See Smith v. Califano, </em>597 F.2d 152 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 481, 62 L.Ed.2d 406 (1979). Additionally, resolution of statutory construction issues in Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act cases by the Benefits Review Board are to be affirmed if a reasonable legal basis supports the Board\u2019s conclusions. <em>Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Kininess, </em>554 F.2d 176 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 299, 54 L.Ed.2d 190 (1977). After careful reading and cross referencing, we conclude that the Board correctly and cogently applied the entangled morass of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor in their application to black lung benefit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">For the above mentioned reasons, we hold that the Board did not exceed the scope of its review in determining that January 1, 1974 was the proper benefit onset date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">WE AFFIRM THE BOARD\u2019S DECISION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">.
