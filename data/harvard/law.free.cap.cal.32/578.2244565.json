Across the \u201c Ranchito,\u201d at the time of the commencement of this action and previously, there ran a certain <em>zanja </em>or watercourse, partly artificial and partly natural, known as the \u201c <em>Zanja de San </em>Samuel,\u201d through which flowed water taken from the San Gabriel River to lands owned by the defendants, Colimas, Passons, and others. The water flowing through this <em>zanja </em>xyas used for irrigation. Plaintiff in 1866 placed across this <em>zanja </em>on the \u201c Ranchito \u201d a water gate for the purpose of turning water ont of the same to irrigate his lands. The defendants claimed that he had no right to do so, and that they were entitled to the use of the water, and entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>upon the \u201c Ranchito \u201d and removed the water gate. Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants in the Court below, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-7\"><em>Glassed &amp; </em>Chapman, for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-8\">The facts found, and the admissions of the pleadings show conclusively, that the plaintiff was the owner and possessor of the land on which was the <em>zanja </em>referred to. Hence, <em>prima facie, </em>the plaintiff had the right to the reasonable use of the water therein for irrigating his said lands. (Angel on Watercourses, Secs. 5, 8, 142 ; Washburn on Easements, pp. 238-9, 234-5.) The interference by defendants with <em>this prima facie </em>right of plaintiff is declared in the findings and admitted by the pleadings. Thereby the burden is cast upon the defendants to <em>avoid </em>the consequences of this interference. The only matter sufficiently pleaded or set up for this purpose is the alleged concession to defendants of the exclusive right to this <em>zanja, </em>which allegation is not found to be true. As to the pleadings, see <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Saulsby, </em>21 Cal. 50 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>21 Cal. 11; <em>Piercy </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>10 Cal. 22, and Id. 303; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>15 Cal. 411. The evidence equally fails to establish any defense or justification under the authority of alleged Water Commissioners. None of the acts requisite for the establishment of such a claim have been proven. As to what some of these requisites are, see Wash, on E. pp. 327-8; Angel on W. C. Secs. 475-7; <em>Bensley </em>v. <em>M. Lake W. C. </em>13 Cal. 313.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-9\"><em>V. H.

It is charged that the defendants unlawfully entered upon said lands and tore down the gate of a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tain <em>zanja, </em>or ditch, crossing the same and used <em>by </em>the plaintiff for the purpose of irrigation. The general denial contained in the answer must be disregarded, for the complaint was sworn to. The plea of a former action pending requires no attention, fot there was no evidence tending to prov\u201ee it. There were two defenses stated in the answer, however, with reference to which evidence appears to have been taken at the trial, and those defenses are made topics of discussion and controversy here. The first of these defenses admits that \u201c The Eanchito,\u201d the <em>locus in quo, </em>is the property of the plaintiff, and that the <em>zanja </em>mentioned in the complaint crosses the said place; and it is averred that .the <em>zanja </em>is a servitude <em>thereon; </em>that said servitude is vested in the defendants, and that the plaintiff has no right or title to the ditch nor to the use of the water running in it. In the statement of the second defense the defendants \u201c <em>admit </em>that the defendant Colimas is a Water Commissioner, or <em>Zanjero </em>for the District of Nietos, in which the <em>zanja </em>is situate, duly chosen and qualified; and they allege that said Colimas, in the rightful discharge of the duties of his office, removed from the said <em>zanja </em>one or more water gates which said plaintiff had, without right, and contrary to law, erected on said water ditch-, and by means of which plaintiff or his agents were wrongfully diverting the water from said <em>zanja </em>and these defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">First-\u2014The gist of the action is the alleged entry upon the Eanchito. The removal of the gate from the <em>zanja </em>is not any part of the cause of action, but is mere-matter of aggravation. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>3 T. R. <em>292; 2 </em>Hil. on Torts, 221.). Failing to prove the gist there could be no recovery by the plaintiff for the injury to the zanja <em>(Eames </em>v. <em>Prentice et als., </em>S Cush. 337; <em>Carpentier </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>28 Cal. 484), and a special defense not justifying the real <em>gravamen </em>of the action would be no justification in effect. Now the first plea admits that the title to and possession of the <em>locus in quo </em>were in the plaintiff, and seeks to justify the entry of the defendants thereon on the ground simply that they had the right to an existing watercourse thereon for the purposes of irrigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>But it does not follow from defendants\u2019 ownership of the easement alleged, that they had the right to enter upon the \u201c Banchito \u201d at will, or irrespective of occasion. If the defendants \u00d3wned the easement, they had the right to enjoy it. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Truckee Turnp. Co., </em>24 Cal. 474.) As ancillary \"to a reasonable enjoyment of it, they had the right to enter upon the \u201c Banchito \u201d for the purpose of keeping the <em>zanja </em>in repair, or freeing- it from obstructions prejudicial to the easement. But aside from these and analagous purposes, the defendant had no right to enter upon the lands affected by the servitude. To hold otherwise would be to clothe the defendants with rights not involved in the servitude, nor deducible from it. <em>(Atkins </em>v. <em>Boardman, 2 </em>Met.) The plea in question states the easement and stops. It should have kept on and averred, if such was the fact, that the defendants\u2019 enjoyment of the easement was impeded by the gate named in the complaint; and that the entry complained of was made for the purpose of removing the obstruction; and that nothing was done either to the gate or land except what was necessary to accomplish that result. (2 Ch. Pl. 569.) The plea, then, is substantially defective. It neither justifies the entry upon the \u201c Banchito \u201d nor the demolition or removal of the gate of the <em>zanja, </em>assuming that to be the gist, or of the gist, of the action. Further, the matters omitted in the plea are not found by the referee to have existed as facts, nor was there any evidence tending to prove that the defendants had an exclusive right as alleged to all the water running in the <em>zanja, </em>however the supply might be in excess of defendants\u2019 needs; nor was there any evidence that the defendants entered upon the <em>locus in quo </em>as owners of the easement and fur the purpose of removing an impediment to its beneficial enjoyment. To the contrary, the evidence was that the defendant Colimas \u201c took up the gate for the reason that he was <em>Zanjero </em>\u201d\u2014that is, on the ground of official duty, and not on the ground of personal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Second\u2014The second special defense is also fatally defective. In the first' place, it is not pleaded as a defense to the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>cause of action\u2014the entry upon the Ranchito\u2014but to the removal of the water gate, a matter of aggravation, as we have seen. In the second place, the plea is not interposed for the benefit of all the defendants, but for the protection of Colimas only. Nor do the other defendants justify as having entered upon the land, or acted in the removal of the gate, in aid of Colimas as <em>\u201cZanjero </em>or Commissioner.\u201d In the third place, under the statutes of this State, a Water Commissioner has no power, as such, to repair or to remove an obstruction from a watercourse. That duty, if devolved upon any one, is cast upon another \"and distinct functionary called an \u201c overseer,\u201d who is the executive officer of the statute system. (2 Hitt, par. 7,278.) In the fourth place, the plea does not aver that Colimas was a Commissioner, it simply \u201c admits \u201d it. But the complaint does not charge it. In the fifth place, it is not averred that the removal of the gate, which Colimas attempts to justify, is the removal mentioned in the complaint. In the sixth place, the averments are mainly of conclusions of law. To all this it may be added that the defense, as presented in the evidence, is as imperfect as the statement of it in the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with leave to the defendants to amend their answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
