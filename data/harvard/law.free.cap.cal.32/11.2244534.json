It was not competent for respondent to prove by parol or any other kind of evidence <em>dehors </em>the mortgage, that the property described in the complaint was the same as that described in the mortgage, unless there had been some issue upon it or some foundation laid for it in the pleadings. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Vallejo, </em>29 Cal. 386, the answer set up the facts disclosing the latent ambiguity, and contained proper averments of the facts showing the true intention of the parties. The plaintiff therefore had an opportunity to prepare his evidence to meet those issues and averments; but' in the case at bar there is no ambiguity. The Court shoulc| have excluded the mortgage on the ground of variance in the ; matter of description alone. What we contend for is, that they should either have been confined to the description in their mortgage, or they should have laid the foundation for correcting or explaining that description in their complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-9\"><em>Creed Haymond, </em>for Respondent. A description of the property mortgaged contained in a pleading is not required to follow that in the mortgage. A tract of land may be described in many ways, and where two descriptions are given, the only question is one of identity\u2014a question of evidence and not of pleading. In such case the variance is only an apparent one, and vanishes before the proof of identity. <em>(Worthington </em>v. <em>Higler, </em>4 Mass. 196; <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>10 Cush. 241 ; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Hogeboom, </em>21 Barb. 399.) If there was a variance the evidence did not injure the defendant. There was a latent ambiguity in the mortgage which was supplied by averment in the complaint. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Vallejo, </em>29 Cal. 386.) If there was a variance it devolved on appellant to show that he was misled thereby to his prejudice. <em>(Catlin </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>10 How. Pr. R. 321; <em>Catheal </em>v. <em>Talmadge, 1 </em>E. D. Smith, 575.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b13-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>By the Court, Shafter, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b13-6\">This was an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage bearing date May 16, 1865, executed by the defendants, John and Michael O\u2019Reilly, to the plaintiff. The defendant Cox, who appeals from the judgment, was made a party on the ground that he claimed some lien on the premises, \u201c which lien is subsequent to the lien of the plaintiff.\u201d The answer of Cox begins with a detailed confession of what is charged against him, in a general way, in the complaint. That is to say, the answer alleges that the O\u2019Reillys mortgaged to Cox on the 10th of June, 1865, all the land, mining claims and property described in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint\u2014but concludes with a denial that the O\u2019Rei11\u20143 ever mortgaged the lands described in the complaint to the plaintiff. This was the only issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-7\">The mortgaged premises were described in the complaint as \u201c all that certain piece or parcel of land and property situated in Greenwood Mining District, near St. Louis, in the County of Sierra and State of California, known and designated as the claims of O\u2019Reilly Brothers, and bounded by Cedar Grove Ravine, the claims of the Greenwood Company, the 1 Clipper Ship Claims,\u2019 and the summit of the dividing ridge between Slate and Canon Creeks.\u201d The plaintiff offered a mortgage made to him by the O\u2019Reillys bearing date May 16th, 1865. The appellant objected to its introduction on the ground that the description of the property in the complaint was not the same, either in form or substance, as the description contained in the mortgage. The objection was overruled and the appellant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-8\">First\u2014The ruling was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-9\">It will be observed that the mortgage was not set out in <em>hcec verba, </em>but was stated according to its effect as apprehended by the pleader, and thus the possibility of literal variances is precluded. There are two independent descriptions of the mortgaged property given in the complaint. The first is by a name, to wit: \u201cKnown and designated as the mining claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>of O\u2019Reilly Brothersthe second is by boundaries. There are two corresponding descriptions in the mortgage. The description therein by name, is literally identical with that given in the complaint, and the description by boundaries is not contradictory to the description by boundaries in the complaint, but is identical with it, so far as it goes. In the complaint the land is bounded on four sides by visible objects, but in stating them no reference is made to cardinal points. In the mortgage the land is bounded on the north by one of the four objects named in the complaint, on the south by another, and on the east by another. The two descriptions, though not equally complete, are the same <em>pro tanto. </em>The western boundary, left open in the mortgage, is supplied by averment in the complaint. The latter, in short, discloses the particular character of the boundary, the existence of which is implied in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">It is further alleged in the complaint that the mortgage contained a covenant for an attorney\u2019s fee of ten per cent in the event of foreclosure; and it appears the mortgage offered in evidence contained no such provision. The judgment recovered by the plaintiff allows nothing for attorney\u2019s fees, and conceding that the discrepancy between the pleadings and the proof amounted to a variance, the judgment should not be reversed on that ground, for the Court below was not, and we are not satisfied that the variance misled the appellant to his prejudice. (Prac. Act, Sec. 71.) Immaterial variances are to be disregarded on the trial or whenever the question may be presented. This is a most beneficial provision, and should be literally construed and carried out. <em>(Wolcott </em>v. <em>Meach, 22 </em>Barb. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">Second\u2014The plaintiff offered a witness \u201c to prove that the property described in the complaint and that described in the mortgage were the same.\u201d The evidence was objected to by the appellant on the ground that it was irrelevant to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">The only issue, as we have already seen, was as to whether the O\u2019Reillys ever gave the plaintiff a mortgage of the land described in the complaint. If they did, then it stood admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that the subsequent mortgage to Cox covered that and not other or different land. As it appeared on inspection that the description by name contained in the mortgage was identical with the description by name given in the complaint, the plaintiff might, perhaps, have safely rested his case upon this single correspondence between his pleadings and proof. If so, then the extrinsic evidence offered to prove a further correspondence was simply redundant. But though the plaintiff was not obliged, on this view of the matter, to put in the evidence, still the evidence was not irrelevant, for it bore directly upon the question of whether the plaintiff had or had not a mortgage on the lands described in his complaint. The witness testified \u201c that he knew the Greenwood Mining District, and that there was but one set of mining claims there known as the \u2018 O\u2019Reilly Brothers Claims\u201d and that they were, in fact, bounded by the monuments named in the complaint. By this evidence the premises mortgaged were the more fully identified with the description given of them in the plaintiff\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">Mr. Justice Sanderson expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
