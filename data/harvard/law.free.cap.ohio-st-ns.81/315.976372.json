In his petition for an injunction against said trustees, the lot-owner copies the petition for the ditch and the names of the several petitioners, eight in number,. in which is a full description of the termini and route, and it is then alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Charles G. Palmer, one of the petitioners, is the owner of the land on which the ditch commences, being the east half of the northwest quarter of section <em>20; </em>that on this land is a low tract of about ten acres, and a small portion of the north end of the east half of the east half of the southwest quarter of said section owned by L. A. Beard, consisting of about five acres, which could be benefited by the proposed ditch, and that there are no other lands to be reclaimed for agricultural purposes, or that in any wise need surface drainage, and that plaintiff\u2019s property already has adequate and sufficient drainage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">The plaintiff further states, that .substantially along the line of the proposed ditch is township ditch No. 12, which extends across the low part of the lands of the plaintiff, following a natural watercourse, and from thence across the lands of J. D. Weigle and into the lands of said Palmer, the same being a tile ditch, adequate in capacity to properly drain lands of the plaintiff, and other lands affected thereby; and that this old ditch is ample to drain the lands of Palmer, Beard and Weigle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">The further allegation is made by the plaintiff below, that while old ditch No. 12 is adequate to drain lots and land affected thereby, the trustees are attempting to entertain jurisdiction over the proposed improvement, in causing the construction of a tiled ditch of much greater depth and capacity, not for the purpose of reclaiming lands and providing for surface drainage, but to provide cellar drainage for lots and lands in said village, and that it departs from the natural watercourse at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Mill street and runs along a public alley through high grounds, where there is no natural watercourse, to center of Lynn street, many rods from the natural watercourse and on high grounds where the ditch will be a great depth, for purposes of cellar drainage, <em>et cetera.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">It is also alleged that the trustees, under pre\u2022tense of a township ditch, have invaded the village and threatened to assess the lot-owners abutting on the ditch for the purpose of providing a sewer for said village, greatly enhancing the cost for the improvement, so that said lots will be assessed $133.50 for the construction and $14.05 costs of location, <em>et cetera, </em>which assessment will be oppressive and far in excess of benefits; and that the trustees are without jurisdiction in the premises, and other allegations are made in reference to the intentions of the trustees of an illeg'al character, which will inflict injury upon the said lot-owners, and an injunction is prayed for, restraining the trustees from further proceedings with said ditch and from making the proposed assessments.

Many of the allegations of the petition were met by a general denial contained in the answer to which the demurrer was sustained. This general denial follows the affirmative matter in the answer, and a close construction of these pleadings would suggest that the demurrer challenging the sufficiency of the answer should have been overruled, provided the trustees had jurisdiction under the statute to entertain the petition for the\u2019 ditch and grant its prayer. If jurisdiction were conceded, the issues made by the petition for injunction and the denials in the answer should have been tried and determined in favor of the plaintiff before he was entitled to an injunction to stop further proceedings. Keeping in mind the averments of the petition, we find the answer admits the filing of the ditch petition with the trustees, and that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>proceedings were had thereon, and relating thereto, that said board had heard and determined said petition, and had found that the ditch prayed for was necessary, and that the same would be conducive to the public health, convenience and general welfare, and therefore proceeded to locate the same substantially on the route described.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It further appears in the answer that the lands mentioned, both within and without said village, are in need of drainage, and that it is necessary, in order that the said lands lying outside of said village may be drained, that a ditch must pass substantially as located in said proceeding through and across said, village to reach a sufficient outlet; that the proposed ditch follows the line of ditch No. 12 in part, and that the remainder of it is located as near thereto' as would best answer the purpose of said ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The trustees further say that prior to the granting of said petition, the owners of lands within the village of Pioneer, which are affected by this ditch, applied to the council of said village and requested that it provide for the necessary drainage within said corporation for said lands, and that the council refused to do so, and that the council requested said trustees to assume jurisdiction over the matter of drainage, and requested them to locate and cause to be constructed the ditch described, and that said council by resolution duly passed and recorded on its journal, granted to said tr\u00fastees, prior to the location of said, ditch, the right to use all of the streets and alleys within the village through which said ditch was thereafter located. This is not all of the defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>for the answer says that prior to the action of said trustees complained of, the board of commissioners of that county, in a proceeding had in reference to the location and construction of a ditch whereby it was proposed to drain the lands within the village, refused to grant a petition therefor. They say as to the matter of tiling, that at the ditch hearing, certain landowners made request in writing for a tiled ditch through their lands, and the requests were granted and size of tile fixed, and the depth in the ground was also fixed, and that the expenses of the improvement were apportioned according to.law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The allegation in the petition \u2022 that the ditch proceeding was being used to provide a sewer for the village and furnish cellar draining is denied by the answer. The anticipation of this alleged sewer, furnishes many authorities for the brief, but the denial takes it out of this discussion of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Hence, the proceeding was that of an ordinary township ditch, commencing on lands outside the village, and following in part an old ditch (No. 12) through the village to a creek as an outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">By sustaining a demurrer to the answer, the circuit court has said that it \u2014 embracing general denials and all \u2014 constitutes no defense to the petition for injunction. The ground selected by counsel for this view, though not stated in the judgment entry, is the absence of jurisdiction in the township trustees to entertain and grant the petition. If this is true, the petitioners for the ditch are in an unfortunate situation. The village council would not act in providing the drainage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>within the corporation, and the commissioner's-refused the prayer of a petition for the route now in question for some reason not of record; and now it is said the township trustees have no jurisdiction to <em>invade </em>the village by their ditch proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The question is to be determined by our statutes pertaining to the subject, and cases cited from other states construing their laws are of little aid to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We think our statutes are plain and free from ambiguity, and seem to recognize that in some instances township trustees and county commissioners may have concurrent jurisdiction to locate and construct a ditch, as may be made to appear later in our investigation. The provisions for county ditches are found in Chapter 1, Title VI, Revised Statutes, and for township ditches in Chapter 2 of the same title.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Section 4511, Revised Statutes, provides: \u201cThe trustees of any township may, whenever in their opinion the same will be conducive to the public health, convenience or welfare, cause to be established, located and constructed as hereinafter provided, any ditch <em>within such township, </em>and for that purpose may cross a railroad, turnpike road, or do any other thing necessary or proper to promote said purpose.\u201d The next section defines the meaning of the word \u201cditch,\u201d \u201cto. include a drain or watercourse,\u201d and says that a petition for such improvement \u201cshall be held to include any side, lateral, spur or branch ditch, drain or watercourse necessary to be constructed to secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the object of the improvement whether the same is mentioned therein or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The subsequent sections provide the mode of procedure, for claims for compensation and damages, for appeal, <em>et cet. </em>Section 4552 makes provision for altering, deepening and widening, boxing or tiling of the ditch. The entire Chapter 2 is devoted to township ditches, and its provisions are clear and contain no obstacle to full jurisdiction where the proposed ditch is within the township. In this instance it commences on low lands \u2014 farm lands outside of the corporate limits. That territory claimed better drainage, and the route through the village to the creek was considered practicable and the best for the purposes in view. Of that fact the trustees are made the judges, subject to right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Does the fact that a village is on the route oust jurisdiction which otherwise would be perfect? The village is in and forms a part of the township, and its citizens take part in electing the trustees and other officers of the township, and are under their jurisdiction in many governmental particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">But it is said that the case of <em>Village of Pleasant Hill et al. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, 71 </em>Ohio St., 133, sustains the holding of the circuit court on the demurrer in this case. We think it does not. The ditch under consideration in that case was wholly within the village, and its drainage being amply-provided for by the municipal code, action by the commissioners was not necessary to full relief. But proceedings for a township ditch could not be entertained by a village council to drain lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>outside of the corporation, \u00a1such as farm lands in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Again, it is urged for defendant in error, that while no lack of jurisdiction appears in the statutes providing for and regulating the location and construction of township ditches, there are certain sections in the statutes vesting authority in county commissioners to locate and construct ditches, which should be considered as defeating the jurisdiction of trustees in this case, and Sections 4447, 4483, 4484 and 4485 are cited with Section 4493.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">These sections are part of Chapter 1, which is applicable to county ditches, or those located by county commissioners. This resort to Chapter 1, to limit the authority of trustees clearly conferred by Chapter 2, needs more than mere statement for its justification. But what are these sections? The first mentioned confers jurisdiction on commissioners of counties to locate and construct county ditches. Section 4483 authorizes a municipal council by resolution to authorize the mayor to present a petition signed by him officially, and a bond to the county commissioners, to locate and construct a ditch described in the resolution, or such council may authorize the mayor to sign officially a petition and bond for a ditch, to be presented by parties interested, whose lands are without the limits of the corporation, whenever the improvement will be conducive to the public health, convenience or welfare, of the whole or any portion of the inhabitants of the corporation; and in such case the commissioners shall count the municipal corporation as an individual petitioner, and may direct the engineer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>locate the improvement in accordance with the petition, whether wholly within, or wholly without, or partly within and partly without, the limits of the corporation. In such case the section instructs the engineer as to his duties and authority while acting under either kind of petition. Section 4484 continues the same subject, permitting the engineer, commissioners, or a jury, if one be called, to treat the benefited territory within the corporation as a single parcel of land, <em>et cet. </em>Section 4485 provides for notice to the corporation, where the mayor has not signed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">And Section 4493 provides that on the written application of twelve or more resident landowners of the township, the trustees, if in their opinion the interest of. the township demands it, may cause the petition and bond hereinbefore provided for to be filed on behalf of the township, and that in such case, the same proceedings shall be had as mentioned in the preceding sections. Considering all of them, we find the different modes of presenting to the county commissioners a petition for a ditch. where a municipality or township is interested. In one case as under Section 4483, the council by resolution may authorize the mayor to present a petition signed by him officially, for a ditch described in the resolution, or the council <em>may </em>authorize the mayor to sign a petition officially, to be presented to the commissioners by parties interested whose lands are without the corporate limits. These are the steps by which a municipal corporation may present a petition, and 4493 describes how township trustees may apply to the commissioners for a ditch where at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>twelve landowners resident of the township ask such trustees in writing to make the application. In this event the township trustees become the sufficient petitioner, as the municipal corporation becomes a petitioner under Section 4483.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">But we should not conclude that- these are the only steps by which county commissioners obtain jurisdiction to locate and construct a ditch which may affect the lands within or without the corporate limits. These sections provide who, in addition to the persons- mentioned in Section 4450, may apply for a ditch and how the same may be signed and presented. If the municipal authorities do not desire to petition; if the township trustees are not requested in writing by at least twelve landowners of the township to petition the commissioners, of course these two classes of authorities can not become petitioners, but the persons mentioned in Section 4450 may still apply for a ditch which may affect the corporation or township.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The law giving jurisdiction to township trustees to locate and construct a township ditch contains no provision whereby a municipal corporation may present a petition, but under Section 4514, authorizing it to be signed by \u201cone or more persons owning lands adjacent to the line of the proposed ditch,\u201d lot-owners in the village, if the lots are adjacent to the line, may join with landowners without the village in making the application to the trustees. It is a weak argument to say that, as in special instances and in special ways, a municipality or trustees of townships may petition the commissioners, if no one else does, trustees have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>no general jurisdiction because the same provisions are not found in the township ditch law whereby a village may petition the trustees. The lack of such provisions does not defeat jurisdiction, if the rules prescribed by the statute are observed and followed. This township ditch law seems complete of itself, and we are not to discount its authority on the ground that the county commissioners may hear other parties not named in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We are of opinion that the demurrer should have been overruled, and the circuit court erred in not so deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-8\">Summers, C.
