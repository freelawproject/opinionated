This is true in this state, section 12 of the act of March 8, 1831 (29 O. L., 144, S. &amp; C, 429), being almost an exact duplicate of the act of 30th George II.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>But it is contended that as the clause, \u201cmoney, goods, merchandise or effects, whatsoever,\u201d was omitted from section 7076, Revised Statutes, at the time of the revision, and the phrase, \u201canything of value,\u201d substituted therefor, a radical legislative change in definition was thereby intended, and real property made the subject of false pretenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">But this by no means follows. The code commissioners had no authority to legislate, and their power to change was very limited and did not extend to matters of substance. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>39 Ohio St., 338; 72 O. L., 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">Where all the general statutes of a state, or all on a particular subject, are revised and consolidated, there is a strong presumption that the same construction which the statutes received, before revision and consolidation, should be applied to the enactment in its revised and consolidated form. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>39 Ohio St., 336; <em>State </em>v. <em>Eno, </em>131 Ia, 621; <em>State </em>v. <em>Black, </em>75 Wis., 493; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>80 N. Car., 397.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">The New Jersey statute uses the words \u201cmoney, wares, merchandise, or other valuable thing,\u201d and it was held that the legislature intended to denounce as a crime the obtaining by deceit of every valuable thing of a personal nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thatcher, </em>35 N. J. L., 445.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">Under the English statute, as well as the act of March 8, 1831, the offense of obtaining property by false pretenses stood upon the same ground as larceny. The owner might also be induced by fraud, trick or device to part, not only with the possession, but with the title as well, and then the offense would not be larceny, but obtaining by false pretenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>102 Cal., 23; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>110 Cal., 602; <em>Miller &amp; Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>78 Ky., 15; <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>People, </em>224 Ill., 626; <em>People </em>v. <em>Laurence, </em>137 N.

Car. (11 Ired.), 477; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>114 Cal., 437; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodrun, 4 </em>Pa. L. J., 207; <em>State </em>v. <em>Layman, </em>8 Blackf. (Ind.), 330; 2 Bishop on Criminal Law (4 ed.), section 455; 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (8 ed.), section 1204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\">A reference to 60 O. L., 20; 60 O. L., 341; 66 O. L., 29; 69 O. L., 67'; 68 O. L., 87, referred to in section 6794, will disclose that all related to personal property. That the phrase as used in section 6794 included things savoring of realty, and not the realty itself. <em>Ball </em>v. <em>White, </em>39 Ohio St., 650.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The phrase \u201canything of value\u201d is found in section 6856, Revised Statutes, defining the crime of larceny. The words \u201cgoods or chattels\u201d are not mentioned therein. Yet, it is common knowledge that real estate is not the subject of theft.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The same phrase \u201canything of value\u201d is found in sections 6835 and 6842, yet no one will contend that real estate is the subject of burglary or embezzlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\">The offense charged in the indictment is, in fact, selling the land without having title to the same, and should .have been framed under section 7079, Revised Statutes. <em>Kerr </em>v. State, 36 Ohio St., 614.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\">Therefore, as ' held by the circuit court, no offense was charged under section 7076. If so, then it is clear that the phrase \u201canything of value\u201d as defined in section 6794 can have no application.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-9\">Spear, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYA\">The indictment was found and prosecution conducted under section 7076, Revised Statutes, which is: \u201cWhoever, by any false pretense, with intent to defraud, obtains from any person anything of value, or procures the signature of any person, as maker, indorser, or guarantor thereof, to any bond, bill, receipt, promissory note, draft, or check, or any other evidence of indebtedness, and whoever sells, barters, or disposes of, or offers to sell, barter, or dispose of, any bond, bill, receipt, promissory note, draft, or check, knowing the signature of the maker, indorser, or guarantor thereof to have been obtained by any false pretense, shall, if the value o'\" the property or instrument so procured, sold, bartered, or disposed of, or offered to be sold, bartered, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>disposed of, is thirty-five dollars or more, be imprisoned in the penitentiary not more than three years, nor less than one year, or, if the value is less than that sum, be fined not more than one hundred nor less than ten dollars, or imprisoned not more than sixty nor less than ten days, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">It was the opinion of the court of common pleas that the terms of the foregoing section are sufficiently comprehensive to embrace, as a thing of value, the conveyance of real estate, and so overruled the demurrer to the indictment. The circuit court, however, was of the opposite opinion, holding that the statute does not embrace or relate to real estate; in other words that the procuring of title to real estate by false pretense's cannot be punished under our statute; arid the foregoing states the principal question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We find ourselves in accord with the conclusion reached by the court of common pleas. It can hardly be urged with any show of reason that the term \u201canything of value\u201d is not in itself sufficiently comprehensive to embrace things which savor of real estate, but it is urged that, taking the present statute in connection with the statute as it stood before the adoption of the section in its present form, it could not have been the intention of the general assembly to make any radical change in meaning. It is true that the language employed prior to the revision of 1880 related to transactions affecting personal property, and did not contain terms the equivalent of \u201canything of value,\u201d and had it been sought to punish frauds relating to real estate under the statute as it. then stood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>answer would have been that the alleged offense did not come within the purview of the statute. The words \u201canything of value\u201d were made to take the place of \u201cmoney, goods, chattels, merchandise, or effects whatsoever,\u201d and the change is one of substance. The claim in support of the contention that the present statute cannot be held to cover fraudulent transactions relating to real estate is that the change was the work of the codifying commission, which had no authority to make changes in matters of substance, and that, as held in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>39 Ohio St., 336, where the statutes have been revised and consolidated, a strong presumption follows that the same construction that would have been given to the statute before revision should be given to the revised and consolidated statute. But there is a possibility of carrying this presumption to unreasonable lengths, and indeed the same case is authority for the proposition that \u201cwhere one or more sections are repealed and re-enacted in a different form, the fair inference is, in general, that- a change in meaning was intended,\u201d and \u201cif it be clear from the words that a change in substance was intended, the statute must 'be enforced in accordance with its changed form.\u201d We think it would be unreasonable to apply the presumption first stated to the present case. Manifestly there was good reason for an enlargement of the scope of the statute. Frauds in relation to deals in real estate were becoming common, and- the importance of a change in the statute was plain. Nor is it accurate to treat the change in the statute as the work of the codifying commission. Their codification was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>submitted to, considered by, and adopted by the law making body of the state, the general assembly. It should not receive any less respect because the change may have been recommended by three commissioners learned in the law instead of being proposed in the first instance by some single member of the general assembly, and after all is said, the enactment receives its vigor and force as law by reason of its enactment by the general assembly, no matter from what source the inspiration came. Not only is there a change of phraseology in the statute, but there is manifestly a radical and far reaching change in the scope of the act itself. This rendering of the statute finds support, also, in the language of section 6794, where it is provided that in the interpretation of part four (the penal part of the statute) \u201cthe term \u2018anything of value\u2019 includes * * * things which savor of the realty, and are, at the time they are taken, a part of the freehold, whether they be of the substance or produce thereof, or affixed thereto * * * and every other thing of any value whatever.\u201d It would seem strange if it were the intention to include within the protection of the statute the inferior things of value, such as farm produce, and at the same time to exclude from such protection the farm itself. The vigilant counsel have called attention to a number of authorities, several from other states, bearing with more or less pertinency upon the question in issue, which will be found cited in the reporter\u2019s notes. We have not deemed it necessary to review them, the question being one affecting only the scope and purpose of our own statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The objection that, even if the statute be broad enough to embrace the fraudulent obtaining of title to real estate, nevertheless the indictment is bad for uncertainty, has not been overlooked. We do not think the point well taken. The test is, has the accused party been apprised in the indictment of the charge against him so that he may know what he is expected to meet and will be required to answer? This test, we think, is substantially and fully met by the averments of the indictment, and that there is. in the language of the statute of jeofails, \u201csufficient matter alleged to indicate the crime and person charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">This conclusion requires a reversal of the judgment of the circuit court and' an affirmance of the judgment of the court of .common pleas, and it will be so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-8\">Summers Davis and Si-iauck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
