Cities are not authorized to go to the aid of state laws. Freund on Police Power, Section 142, p. 133. This principle is well set forth in the following case condemning an ordinance requiring a daily record and report of each transaction by dealers who buy and re-pack loose cotton, by reason of the frequent thefts of loose cotton (like our statute Section 4390 as to pawnbrokers). <em>Long </em>v. <em>Taxing District, 7 </em>Lea (75 Tenn.), 134.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">If a calling is legitimate, interferences with it, not required by the public health, morals or safety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>are not authorized by the police power. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>58 Ohio St., 599; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>70 Ohio St., 207, nor merely because it may be thought undesirable or even in a way harmful. <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Netcher, </em>183 Ill., 104, 55 N.

The only abuse to which it is liable is under the usury laws; and any supposed omission of the legislature to guard adequately against this does not authorize a city to repair the omission. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Macon, </em>111 Ga., 162, 36 S.

Section 1536-100, Revised Statutes; <em>Marmet </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Ohio St., 63. This being the case, a judicial decision sustaining the validity of the regulation of the business of pawnbroker at once becomes in point and is valuable in construing a regulation governing the business of salary loan broking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">The business of pawnbroking has from time immemorial been the subject of various and sundry regulations, many of them of exactly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>same nature as the one to which the plaintiff in error takes exception in the present case. <em>Launder </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>111 Ill:, 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-4\">We further find that the right to make such regulations as the one in question here, governing pawnbrokers, is universally conceded by the courts throughout the United States. <em>Kansas City </em>v. <em>Garnier, </em>57 Kans., 412; <em>Grand Rapids </em>v. <em>Brandy, </em>105 Mich., 670; <em>St. Joseph </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>128 Mo., 588; <em>Kuhn </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>30 Ill. App., 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">While the right of the state to prohibit occupations is undoubtedly' limited to those which are actually harmful, yet the right of the state to require licenses and to regulate is not restricted to those occupations which are immoral, vexatious or injurious to society but it extends to all occupations of every kind, except where the power of the state to exact the license or to impose the regulation is expressly limited by the constitution of the United States or by the constitution of the state itself. <em>Building &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>109 Ga., 80; <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>110 Ill., 186; <em>Price </em>v. <em>People, </em>193 Ill., 114; <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall., 36; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tolman, </em>106 La., 666; <em>State </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>52 Mo., 418; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Macon, </em>111 Ga., 162; <em>Ex parte Mirande, </em>73 Cal., 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">In various other jurisdictions there is abundant authority for the regulation of businesses which in themselves are not harmful by the enactment of requirements more onerous than the one with which we are concerned in the present case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubarry, </em>46 La.

The term is not used in the constitution. The police power is included in the legislative power, but there are in the constitution express limitations upon some of the powers comprised in the legislative power, and the term police power is used to designate that power from others and is helpful in ascertaining its scope and the limitations upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>All of the legislative power of the state is vested in .the general assembly. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>11 Ohio St., 534, 542. <em>State </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>39 Ohio St., 399, 407. But it is a delegated power and is limited by the scope of the purposes for which it was granted, as well as by the express limitations of the constitution. <em>The Cincinnati, W. &amp; Z. Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>The Commissioners of Clinton County, </em>1 Ohio St., 77, 84, 86. The purpose for which it was granted is indicated by the opening declaration, \u201cWe, the people of the State of Ohio, grateful to Almighty God, for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare, do establish this 'Constitution.\u201d And Section 20 provides, \u201cThis enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people; and all powers, not herein delegated, remain with the people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Chief Justice Shaw said, in <em>Commonzvealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush., 53, \u201cRights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment as shall prevent them from being injurious, and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law as the legislature, under the governing and controlling power vested in them by the constitution, may think necessary and expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Drainage Commissioners, </em>200 U. S., 561-592, Mr. Justice Harlan says: \u201cWe hold that the police power of the state embraces regulations designed to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, as well as regulations designed to promote the public health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the public morals or the public safety.\u201d And in <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>United States, </em>157 U. S., 160, Mir. Justice Brewer says: \u201cWhile it may be conceded that, generally speaking, among the inalienable rights of a citizen is that of the liberty of contract, yet such liberty is not absolute and universal. It is within the admitted power of government to restrain some individuals from all contracts, as well as all individuals from some contracts. It may deny to all the right to contract for the sale of lottery tickets; to the minor the right to assume any obligations, except for the necessaries of existence, to the common carrier the power to make any contract, relieving himself from negligence; and, indeed, may restrain all engaged in any employment from any contract in the course of that employment which is against public policy. The possession of this power by government in no manner conflicts with the proposition that, generally speaking, every citizen has a right freely to contract for the price of his labor, services or property.\u201d In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>State of Ohio, </em>77 Ohio St., 214-216, where the constitutionality of .statutes regulating junk dealers and dealers in secondhand articles is considered, Davis, J., says: \u201cIt is almost an axiom that anything which is reasonable and necessary to secure the peace, safety, morals and best interests of the commonwealth may' be done under the police power; and this implies that private rights exist subject to the public welfare.\u201d And again, \u201cthe general power of the legislature to determine what is necessary for the protection of the public interests b\u00e9ing clear, judicial inquiry is necessarily limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>determining whether a particular regulation is reasonable, impartial and within the limitations of the constitution. The legislature is the judge of the mischief and the remedy, and of what shall be state policy, subject to the restrictions just mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The right to labor, to contract, to do business or to engage in any of the common occupations of life is one of the inalienable rights of the citizen, <em>(Butchers Union Slaughter-House and Live-Stock Landing Company </em>v. <em>Crescent City L.-S. L. &amp; S.-H. Company, </em>111 U. S., 746, Mr. Justice Bradley, 762, M1* Justice Field, 756) and may be regulated, therefore, by the state only to promote the public welfare, and this brings us to the question, what possible public good can be subserved by regulating brokers in chattel mortgages and in salary loans, and if the business is subject to regulation under the police power, are the provisions of the ordinance unreasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Usury laws are of ancient origin, and while the utility of such legislation is still open to question, such laws are in force in this state, and in a majority of the states, and we think it too late to question the power of the state to enact them. One of the ways in. which such laws are circumvented \"is by a commission to a broker. The class that obtain such loans comprises the most needy and improvident, and consequently the most susceptible to fraud and extortion, and surelv legislation to prevent such evasions, or fraud and extortion, may rest upon the same grounds as usury laws. And it would not be profitable to consume space by setting forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the almost numberless instances of laws imposing restraints upon the right to contract or regulations of occupations, or of the conduct of business that have been upheld by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The legislature may delegate to municipal corporations the right to exercise the police power to effect the purposes of its organization, but the extent of the grant and the reasonableness of its exercise are questions for the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In <em>Stoutenburgh </em>v. <em>Hennick, </em>129 U. S., 141, 147, Chief Justice Fuller says: \u201cIt is a cardinal principle of our system of government,' that local affairs shall be managed by local authorities, and general affairs by the central authority; and hence while the rule is also' fundamental that the power to make laws cannot be delegated, the creation of municipalities exercising local self government has never been held to trench upon that rule. Such legislation is not regarded as a transfer of general legislative power, but rather as the grant of the authority to prescribe local regulations, according to immemorial practice, subject of course to the interposition of the superior in cases of necessity.\u201d In the present case the grant is in general terms, so that the question arises as to the reasonableness of the regulations prescribed by Section 5 of the ordinance. The authority given is to regulate and license chattel mortgage and salary loan brokers. The ordinance is so entitled, but its provisions are more comprehensive and embrace persons engaged in the business of loaning money upon chattel mortgages, or other personal property as security, and most of the regulations prescribed relate to such trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>actions rather -than to those of brokers. But we do not think it necessary, in the present case, to consider the validity or the invalidity of the ordinance in these respects for' the plaintiff in error obtained a license and objects only to the requirements of the fifth section. His objections to these requirements are that compliance would destroy his business, because borrowers of this class are so sensitive in respect to publicity that they will forego a loan rather' than expose their necessities to , the public; and that it invades the right of privacy. The requirements of the fifth section are not much more exacting, and will not give as much publicity as do most registration acts, and compliance with them will not destroy the business if it is legitimate. Publicity is recognized as one of the most effective preventatives of many harmful practices. If some such ordinance had been in force in Venice, Shy lock never would have stipulated for the pound of flesh. We do not think the requirements are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">The only provision of the constitution that occurs to us upon which is based the contention that the ordinance invades the right of property, is Section 14 of the Bill of Rights, which provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; .and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the person and things to be seized.\u201d The search or seizure there referred to, is' a search or seizure under authority of law. The ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>in question makes no provision for a warrant nor does it prescribe anything within the spirit of that declaration and inhibition historically considered. In <em>Marmet </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Ohio State, 63-69, where the constitutionality of a license law was under consideration, Spear, J., said of a similar objection, that if it made the law void then a like infirmity attached to many other laws then in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Objection was made to a similar requirement respecting pawnbrokers, in <em>St. Joseph </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>128 Mo., 588, and it was held that the ordinance did not violate a similar requirement of the constitution of that state, or the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States. And in <em>Launder </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>111 Ill., 291, a similar requirement respecting pawnbrokers was held not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Having found the power to exist in the state, its delegation to the municipality, and the objectionable regulation, prescribed by the ordinance, not unreasonable, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-9\">Crew, C. J., Spear, Davis, and Price, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
