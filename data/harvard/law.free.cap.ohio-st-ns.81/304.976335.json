Thomas, his next of kin and only heirs at law. On July 30, 1902, the will of said Robert Masters was duly admitted tc probate by the probate court of Hocking county and Mary Masters, his widow, was appointed executrix thereof. Prior to his death, but after the making and execution of his will, Robert Masters sold and conve3^ed lot number twelve, which <em>hy </em>item first of said will he had devised to \u2019his wife, Mary Masters, for and during her natural life. Thereafter the testator Robert Masters acquired by purchase, and at the time of his death owned and was seized of, the following described parcels of real estate: Being ten feet off of the north side of lot number fifteen of Watkins\u2019 addition to the village of Murray City, Hocking county, Ohio. Also that strip of land lying between the west boundary of said ten feet off of said lot number fifteen and the stream known as Snowforlc, and extending from said west boundary of said ten feet to the stream, said strip being in Flocking county, Ohio. Also twenty feet off of the south side of lot number sixteen of Watkins\u2019 addition to the village of Murray City, Flocking county, Ohio. Also that strip of land lying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>between the west boundary of. said twenty feet off of the south side of said lot number sixteen and the stream known as Snowfork and extending from said west boundary of said twenty feet to the said stream, said strip being in Hocking county, Ohio. Mary Masters having formally elected to take under the will of her deceased husband, claimed, as devisee, a life estate in the premises last above described, and in her lifetime collected and appropriated to her own use rents and profits arising therefrom to the amount of $651.00. Mary Masters died February 7, 1905, and subsequently plaintiff in error; O. W. FI. Wright, was duly appointed administrator of her estate. On July 14, 1906, the defendants in error herein brought suit in the court of common pleas of Flocking county against said O. W. H. Wright as administrator of said Mary Masters,. to recover said sum of six hundred and fifty-one dollars so received and collected. by her as rental from said after-acquired property. In said action Frances Spencer refusing to join as plaintiff was made a defendant. By way of answer to the petition of plaintiffs in said action the administrator pleaded three several defenses: First, that Robert Masters did not die intestate as to the property described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, but that under and by the provisions of his will said property passed to, and became the property of, Mary Masters for and during her natural life. The second defense was. a plea of <em>estoppel. </em>The third defense went out on demurrer and is not here involved. Plaintiffs replying to the second defense denied specifically the several matters relied upon as creating an estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>so far as the same were pertinent and well pleaded. The trial in the court of common pleas resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendant O. W. IT. Wright, administrator. This judgment was reversed by the circuit court, and we are now asked to reverse this judgment of the circuit court and to affirm the judgment of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-6\"><em>Mr. O.

If it was a mistake, Mrs. Masters could have filed a petition to set aside her election. But she died before anyone claimed, or discovered any mistake; and it would be injustice now to disturb the relations and situation of the parties as they mutually placed themselves. Mrs. Masters was estopped by her action, in the absence of fraud or mistake, after she elected.

The same rule pertains in every state of the United States except where the rule has been changed by legislative act. The exact time when- the rule was changed in. Ohio by the enactment of Section 5969, Revised Statutes, we are unable to say, but we are able to say that it was passed after the year 1836, which is manifest from the case of <em>Lessee of Reynolds </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>7 Ohio (part 2), 39.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">The distinction of the construction of devises of after-acquired property since the enactment of Section 5969 is that after-acquired property may now pass without a re-publication of the will, if such is the clear intention of the testator from the language used in the will. <em>Applegate </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>31 Mo., 169; 1 Jarman on Wills (5 Am. ed.), 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">At common law rule, property acquired after making a will did not pass under a general disposition \u201cof all my real estate.\u201d <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Havens, </em>1 Sand.

The general clause in his will conferring on the devisee, the wife, the power of sale of any or all of his real estate, is also for a specific purpose, to pay debts if necessary. This conferred to the devisee a naked power of sale, nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\">We have yet to learn that a naked power of sale confers title. <em>Bane et al. </em>v. <em>Wick et al., </em>19 Ohio, 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The second defense pleaded by the plaintiff in error is acquiescence on the part of the heirs at the probating of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">The defendants in error as the heirs and residuary legatees of Robert Masters acquiesced when the will was read, and they still acquiesce in all the provisions of the will as it reads, and as it is; they are not responsible for the misdirections given by the probate judge to the widow. The fact is, that both parties labored under a mistake. Mrs. Masters believed that the testator had given her a life estate in all his real estate, and the defendants in error were of the same opinion. Where two parties labor under a mutual mistake, neither party can lose any rights thereby. <em>McAfferty </em>v. <em>Conover\u2019s Lessee, 7 </em>Ohio St., 99; <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>Platt, 47 </em>Ohio St., 366.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-6\">Crew, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atm\">The soie controversy between the parties hereto is as to who is entitled to receive the rent arising from certain real estate purchased by the testator, Robert Masters, after he had made and executed his last will and testament. The amount of the rent \u2014 -six hundred and fifty-one dollars \u2014 arising from said property is not in dispute, and it is admitted that Mary Masters, widow of testator, in her lifetime collected and appropriated said rent to her own use, she claiming the right thereto, as devisee of a life estate in said after-acquired property, under the will of her deceased husband. Upon the record now before us one of the questions presented is: Did this real property acquired and purchased by Robert Masters after the making and execution of his last will and testament, by force of the provisions of said will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pass to and become the property of Mary Masters for and during her natural life? We are clearly of opinion that this must be answered in the negative. It is well known that at common law a testator could transmit by devise only such lands as were owned by him at the time of executing his will, and after-acquired real property was not permitted to pass by testamentary devise unless, after the acquisition of such property; there was' a re-publication of the testator\u2019s will. This rule of the common law has, however, been so far modified by statute in this state that' property acquired by a testator subsequent' to the execution of his will, shall pass thereby, if, from the will itself, it shall appear with sufficient clearness that such was the intention of the testator. Section 5969, Revised Statutes, provides that: \u201cAny estate, right or interest in lands * * * acquired by the testator after the making of his will shall pass thereby in like manner as if held or possessed at the time of making the will, if such shall clearly and manifestly appear by the will to have been the intention of the testator.\u201d The language of this statute clearly indicates its limitation, and shows it to have been the purpose of the legislature to restrict its operation to those cases where the intent of the testator to pass after-acquired property is clearly and sufficiently disclosed in his will. Hence, in every instance the question involved becomes one of construction, and the intent of the testator must be sought in the will itself. The will under consideration in the present case makes no reference whatever in any of its provisions to after-acquired property. The property therein devised by item one to Mary Masters during her life is defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>nitely designated and specifically described, and there is in the provisions of said will no hint or suggestion anyjvhere of a purpose on the part of the testator to give her more than the property thus specifically described. This will contains no residuary clause, and there is in it no clause, either general or specific, under which the property in controversy would or could pass to Mary Masters as devisee, even if the testator had owned the same at the time he executed said will. While the presumption is,- where one has made a will, that he did not intend to die intestate as to any part of his property, yet this presumption against partial intestacy neither requires nor authorizes the court to make for the testator a new will, or to include in the will made by him property not comprehended by its terms. It is, however, insisted by counsel for plaintiff in error in his brief, that the language employed in item three of this will, taken and considered in connection with the other provisions thereof, show it to have been the intention of testator .that his wife, Mary Masters, should take by said will all the real property of which he should die possessed; but by what logic such conclusion is, or may be, properly reached, we are not told. Item third reads as follows: \u201cI do hereby nominate and appoint my wife executrix without bond of this my last will and testament, hereby authorizing and empowering her to compromise, adjust, release and discharge in such manner as she may deem proper the debts and claims due me; I do also authorize and empower her, if it shall become necessary in order to pay my debts, to sell by private sale or in such manner, upon such terms of credit or otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>as she may think proper, all or any part of my real estate and deeds to purchasers to execute, acknowledge and deliver in fee simple.\u201d This provision, while it confers upon Mary Masters as executrix the power to sell part or all of testator\u2019s real estate if necessary to pay debts, does not purport to give to her any title to, interest in, or control over said real estate, except such as may be necessary to the proper execution of the power so conferred. We. are, therefore, upon a consideration of all the provisions of the will of said Robert Masters, of opinion that Mary Masters, his widow, did not, under the devise to her in said will, take any title to the property described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition which was acquired by testator subsequent to the execution of his will. It follows therefore necessarily, that as devisee, she was not entitled to collect and receive the rents and profits arising therefrom. As to the second defense <em>pleaded </em>\u2014 estoppel\u2014there being no conflict or dispute in the evidence introduced at the trial upon this issue, the question here presented becomes one of law, and without now attempting to review or discuss this evidence at length, we think it sufficient to say upon this branch of the case, that assuming as established every fact which this evidence tends to prove, it wholly fails to sustain or make out the defense pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the circuit court reversing the judgment of the court of common pleas affirmed, and final judgment entered for defendants in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-7\">Summers, Spear, Davis, Shauck and Price, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
