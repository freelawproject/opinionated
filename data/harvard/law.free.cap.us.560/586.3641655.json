S. C. \u00a7 2412(d), provides in pertinent part that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party . . . fees and other expenses ... in any civil action . . . brought by or against the United States . . . unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We consider whether an award of \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 2412(d) is payable to the litigant or to his attorney. We hold that a \u00a7 2412(d) fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to a Government offset to satisfy a pre-existing debt that the litigant owes the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">This case arises out of proceedings in which a Social Security claimant, Ruby Willow Kills Ree, prevailed on a claim for benefits against the United States. Respondent Catherine Ratliff was Kills Ree\u2019s attorney in those proceedings. The District Court granted Kills Ree\u2019s unopposed motion for a \u00a7 2412(d) fees award in the amount of $2,112.60. Before the United States paid the fees award, however, it discovered that Kills Ree owed the Government a debt that predated the District Court\u2019s approval of the award. Accordingly, the United States sought an administrative offset against the fees award to satisfy part of that debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The Government\u2019s authority to use administrative offsets is statutory. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 3711(a), 3716(a) (authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are unsuccessful to \u201ccollect the claim by administrative offset\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress has subjected to offset all \u201cfunds payable by the United States,\u201d \u00a7 3701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts, see \u00a7 3701(b), unless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute, see \u00a7 3716(e)(2). No such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>exemption applies to attorney\u2019s fees awards under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset, see 31 CFR \u00a7 285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January 2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) operated by the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS). See Brief for Petitioner 4 (explaining TOP\u2019S extension to cover so-called \u201c \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 \u201d payments that include attorney\u2019s fees payments the Treasury Department makes on behalf of federal agencies).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In this case, the Government, relying on the TOP, notified Kills Ree that the Government would apply her \u00a7 2412(d) fees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal debt. Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the grounds that \u00a7 2412(d) fees belong to a litigant\u2019s attorney and thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a litigant\u2019s federal debts. The District Court held that because \u00a7 2412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the prevailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to challenge the Government\u2019s proposed offset. See No. CIV. 06-5070-RHB, 2007 WL 6894710, *1 (D SD, May 10, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. 540 F. 3d 800 (2008). It held that under Circuit precedent, \u201cEAJA attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded to prevailing parties\u2019 attorneys.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 802. The Court of Appeals recognized that its decision did not accord with a \u201cliteral interpretation of the EAJA,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and exacerbated a split among the Courts of Appeals, compare <em>id., </em>at 801-802, with, <em>e. g., Reeves </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>v. <em>Astrue, </em>526 F. 3d 732, 733 (CA11 2008); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Astrue, </em>510 F. 3d 1246, 1249-1251 (CA10 2007); <em>FDL Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>967 F. 2d 1578, 1580 (CA Fed. 1992); <em>Panola Land Buying Assn. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>844 F. 2d 1506, 1510-1511 (CA11 1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. 965 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Subsection (d)(1)(A) directs that courts \u201cshall <em>award to a prevailing party </em>. . . fees and other expenses . . . incurred by that party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have long held that' the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in fee statutes is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, <em>e. g., Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001). This treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the \u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019\u201d that each <em>litigant </em>\u201cbear [his] own attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 602 (citing <em>Key Tronic Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994)). Nothing in EAJA supports a different reading. Cf. <em>Arthur Andersen LLP </em>v. <em>Carlisle, </em>556 U. S. 624, 630, n. 4 (2009) (where Congress employs \u201cidentical words and phrases within the same statute,\u201d they are presumed to carry \u201cthe same meaning\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, other subsections within \u00a7 2412(d) underscore that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries its usual and settled meaning \u2014 prevailing litigant. Those other subsections clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the \u201cprevailing party\u201d must apply for the fees award and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201csho[w]\u201d that he \u201cis a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award\u201d by, among other things, submitting \u201can itemized statement <em>from any attorney . . </em>. <em>representing or appearing in behalf of the party\u201d </em>that details the attorney\u2019s hourly rate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see also Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(l)(A)\u2019s use of the verb \u201caward\u201d renders \u00a7 2412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing party\u2019s attorney and thus protects the fees from a Government offset against the prevailing party\u2019s federal debts. See Brief for Respondent 11-19 (arguing that subsection (d)(l)(A)\u2019s use of the word \u201c \u2018award\u2019 \u201d \u201cexpressly incorporates a critical distinction\u201d between the right to an \u201c\u2018award\u2019\u201d of fees and the right to \u201c\u2018receiv[e]\u2019\u201d the fees). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The transitive verb \u201c \u2018award\u2019 \u201d has a settled meaning in the litigation context: It means \u201c[t]o give or assign <em>by </em>sentence or judicial determination.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 125 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (\u201cto give <em>by </em>judicial decree\u201d (emphasis added)). The plain meaning of the word \u201caward\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) is thus that the court shall \u201cgive or assign by... judicial determination\u201d to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (here, Ratliff\u2019s client Kills Ree) attorney\u2019s fees in the amount sought and substantiated under, <em>inter alia, </em>subsection (d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Ratliff\u2019s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny. According to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses \u201cthe noun \u2018award\u2019 \u201d to mean a \u201c \u2018decision,\u2019 \u201d requires us to construe subsection (d)(1)(A) (which uses \u201caward\u201d as a verb) to mean that \u201c[o]nly the prevailing party may receive the <em>award </em>(the decision granting fees), but only the attorney who earned the <em>fee </em>(the payment asked or given for professional services) is entitled to receive it.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16,15 (emphasis in original; some internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). This argument ignores the settled definitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>above, and even the definitions Ratliff proffers, because each makes clear that the verb \u201caward\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) means to \u201cgive <em>by </em>the decision of a law court\u201d or to \u201cgrant <em>. ..by </em>judicial decree,\u201d not simply to \u201cgive a decision\u201d itself. <em>Id., </em>at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). We thus agree with the Government that under the statutory language here, the \u201cjudicial decision is the <em>means </em>by which the court confers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is not itself the <em>thing </em>that the court gives (or orders the defendant to give) to the party.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 4 (emphasis in original; citing <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>482 U. S. 755, 761 (1987) (explaining that \u201c[i]n all civil litigation, the judicial decree is not the end but the means\u201d)). This settled and natural construction of the operative statutory language is reflected in our cases. See, <em>e. g., Scarborough </em>v. <em>Principi, </em>541 U. S. 401, 405 (2004) (\u201cEAJA authorizes the <em>payment </em>of fees <em>to </em>a prevailing party\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Ratliff\u2019s final textual argument \u2014 that subsection (d)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cattorney fees\u201d itself establishes that the fees are payable to the prevailing party\u2019s attorney, see Brief for Respondent 19-22 \u2014 proves far too much. The fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party fees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right does not establish that the statute \u201cawards\u201d the fees directly to the attorney. For the reasons we have explained, the statute\u2019s plain text does the opposite \u2014 it \u201cawards\u201d the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects them to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has outstanding federal debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In an effort to avoid EAJA\u2019s plain meaning, Ratliff argues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the SSA and the Government\u2019s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases, render \u00a7 2412(d) at least ambiguous on the question presented here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor. Again we disagree. Even accepting \u00a7 2412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our conclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are thus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding federal debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">To begin with, \u00a72412(d)(l)\u2019s provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards. As noted above, subsection (d)(1)(B) requires the prevailing party to submit a fee application showing that she is otherwise \u201celigible to receive an award\u201d and, as a complement to that requirement, compels the prevailing party to submit \u201can itemized statement <em>from any attorney . . </em>. <em>representing or appearing in behalf of the party\u201d </em>that details the attorney\u2019s hourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case. (Emphasis added.) This language would make little sense if, as Ratliff contends, \u00a72412(d)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d language effectively refers to the prevailing litigant\u2019s attorney. Subsection (d)(1)(B) similarly makes clear that the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (not her attorney) is the recipient of the fees award by requiring the <em>prevailing party </em>to demonstrate that <em>her </em>net worth falls within the range the statute requires for fees awards. And E AJA\u2019s cost provision further underscores the point. That provision uses language identical to that in the attorney\u2019s fees provision to allow prevailing parties to recover \u201cthe reasonable expenses of expert witnesses\u201d and \u201cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\u201d necessary to prepare \u201cthe party\u2019s case,\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A), yet Ratliff does not argue that it makes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide the relevant services.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Nor do the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies establish that subsection (d)(1)(A) fees awards are payable to prevailing parties\u2019 attorneys. It is true that the SSA makes fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>awards under that statute payable directly to a prevailing claimant\u2019s attorney. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) (providing that where a claimant \u201cwho was represented before the court by an attorney\u201d obtains a favorable judgment, \u201cthe court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of\u201d the benefits award and may certify the full amount of the statutory fees award <em>\u201cfor payment to such attorney </em>out of, and not in addition to, the amount of\u201d the claimant\u2019s benefits award (emphasis added)). But the SSA\u2019s express authorization of such payments undermines Ratliff\u2019s case insofar as it shows that Congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so. Given the stark contrast between the SSA\u2019s express authorization of direct payments to attorneys and the absence of such language in subsection (d)(1)(A), we are reluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence supporting such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Ratliff contends that Congress\u2019 1985 amendments to \u00a7 206(b) of EA JA supply just such evidence, at least in Social Security cases. See \u00a73(2), 99 Stat. 186, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412, p. 1309 (Saving Provision). The 1985 amendments address the fact that Social Security claimants may be eligible to receive fees awards under both the SSA and EAJA, and clarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must follow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double recovery of fees for the same work. Section 206(b) provides that no violation of law occurs \u201cif, where the claimant\u2019s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S. C. \u00a7 406(b) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d)], the claimant\u2019s attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\u201d According to Ratliff, the fact that \u00a7 206(b) recognizes, or at least assumes, that an attorney will sometimes \u201creceiv[e]\u201d fees under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d) suggests that we should construe subsection (d)(1)(A) to incorporate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>same direct payments to attorneys that the SSA expressly authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">This argument gives more weight to \u00a7 206(b)\u2019s reference to attorney \u201creceipt]\u201d of fees than the reference can bear. Section 206(b)\u2019s ensuing reference to the attorney\u2019s obligation to \u201crefun[d]\u201d the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant, which reference suggests that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place, alone undercuts Ratliff\u2019s reading of \u201creceives\u201d as implying an initial statutory payment to the attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And Ratliff\u2019s reading is in any event irreconcilable with the textual differences between EAJA and the SSA we discuss above. Thus, even accepting Ratliff\u2019s argument that subsection (d)(1)(A) is ambiguous, the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambiguity in favor of treating subsection (d)(1)(A) awards as payable to the prevailing litigant, and thus subject to offset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The Government\u2019s history of paying EAJA awards directly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a different conclusion. The Government concedes that until 2006, it \u201cfrequently paid EAJA fees in Social Security cases directly to attorneys.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 13. But this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsection (d)(l)(A)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d language or the Government\u2019s rights and obligations under the statute. As the Government explains, it most often paid EAJA fees directly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party had assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney (which assignment would not be necessary if the statute rendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the first instance). The fact that some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising given that it was not until 2005 that the Treasury Department modified the TOP to require offsets against \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d payments such as attorney\u2019s fees awards. And as Ratliff admits, the Government has since continued the direct payment practice only in cases where \u201cthe plaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and assigns the right to receive the fees to the attorney.\u201d Brief for Respondent 28 (boldface deleted). The Government\u2019s decision to continue direct payments only in such cases is easily explained by the 2005 amendments to the TOP, and nothing about the Government\u2019s past payment practices altered the statutory text that governs this cas\u00e9 or estopped the Government from conforming its payment practices to the Treasury Department\u2019s revised regulations. For all of these reasons, neither EAJA nor the SSA supports Ratliff\u2019s reading of subsection (d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Our eases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988, which contains language virtually identical to the EAJA pro vision we address here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> buttress this conclusion. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>most recent cases applying \u00a7 1988(b)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d language recognize the practical reality that attorneys are the beneficiaries and, almost always, the ultimate recipients of the fees that the statute awards to \u201cprevailing part[ies].\u201d See, <em>e. g., Venegas </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>495 U. S. 82, 86 (1990). But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (contractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically confer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of the fees award the statute confers on the prevailing litigant. As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would be unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees language like that in \u00a7 1988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys with a statutory right to direct payment of awards. Hence our conclusion that \u201cthe party, rather than the lawyer,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 87, is \u201centitle[d] to receive the fees\u201d under \u00a7 1988(b), <em>id., </em>at 88, and that the statute \u201ccontrols what the losing defendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff must, pay his lawyer,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 90; see also <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Jeff D., </em>475 U. S. 717, 730-732, and n. 19 (1986) (explaining that the \u201clanguage of [\u00a7 1988]... bestow[s] on the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 (generally plaintiffs) a statutory eligibility for a discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d and does <em>not </em>\u201cbesto[w] fee awards upon attorneys\u201d themselves (emphasis deleted; footnote omitted)). These conclusions apply with equal force to the functionally identical statutory language here.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> Section 3701 defines an administrative offset as \u201cwithholding funds payable by the United States\u201d to the debtor. \u00a7 3701(a)(1).

That is not accurate. As we have explained, Social Security claimants and attorneys normally enter into contingent-fee agreements that are subject to judicial \u201creview for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht </em>v. <em>Barnhart, </em>535 U. S. 789, 809 (2002). Where the court allows a fee, \u00a7 406(b) permits the Commissioner to collect the approved fee out of the client\u2019s benefit award and to certify the fee for \u201cpayment to such attorney out of\u201d that award. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A). In such cases, the attorney would \u201crefun[d]\u201d the fee to the client in the event that the attorney also receives a (larger) EAJA award, because the attorney \u201creeeive[d]\u201d the SSA fee from the client\u2019s funds. Similarly inaccurate is Ratliff\u2019s suggestion that our construction of EAJA \u00a7206(b)\u2019s reference to \u201crefun[d]\u201d would preclude attorneys from collecting any fees from a prevailing party until both SSA and EAJA payments are awarded. Our construction does not alter or preclude what we have recognized as courts\u2019 common practice of awarding EAJA fees at the time a court remands a case to the Social Security Administration (Administration) for benefits proceedings. Such awards often allow attorneys to collect EAJA fees months before any fees are awarded under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 406(b), because \u00a7 406(b) fees cannot be determined until the Administration enters a final benefits ruling. See <em>Shalala </em>v. <em>Schaefer, </em>509 U. S. 292, 295-302 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> Section 1988(b) provides that in actions covered by the statute and subject to exceptions not relevant here, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b646-8\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"abz-dedup-0\">with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">I join the Court\u2019s opinion because I agree that the text of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and our precedents compel the conclusion that an attorney\u2019s fees award under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d) is payable to the prevailing litigant rather than the attorney. The EAJA does not legally obligate the Government to pay a prevailing litigant\u2019s attorney, and the litigant\u2019s obligation to pay her attorney is controlled not by the EAJA but by contract and the law governing that contract. That conclusion, however, does not answer the question whether Congress intended the Government to deduct moneys from EAJA fees awards to offset a litigant\u2019s preexisting and unrelated debt, as the Treasury Department began to do only in 2005 pursuant to its authority under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). In my view, it is likely both that Congress did not consider that question and that, had it done so, it would not have wanted EAJA fees awards to be subject to offset. Because such offsets undercut the effectiveness of the EAJA and cannot be justified by reference to the DCIA\u2019s text or purpose, it seems probable that Congress would have made, and perhaps will in the future make, the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In enacting the EAJA, Congress found \u201cthat certain individuals, partnerships, corporations, and labor and other organizations may be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights in civil actions and in administrative proceedings.\u201d \u00a7 202(a), 94 Stat. 2325, note following 5 U. S. C. \u00a7504, p. 684 (Congressional Findings). As we have often recognized, \u201cthe specific purpose of the EAJA is to eliminate for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Jean, </em>496 U. S. 154, 163 (1990); see also <em>Scarborough </em>v. <em>Principi, </em>541 U. S. 401, 406 (2004) (by \u201cexpressly authorizing] attorney\u2019s fees awards against the Federal Government,\u201d Congress sought \u201c\u2018to eliminate the barriers that prohibit small businesses and individuals from securing vindication of their rights in civil actions and administrative proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>brought by or against the Federal Government\u2019\u201d (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96-1005, p. 9 (1979))); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>490 U. S. 877, 883 (1989) (the EAJA was designed to address the problem that \u201c \u2018[f]or many citizens, the costs of securing vindication of their rights and the inability to recover attorney fees preclude resort to the adjudicatory process\u2019 \u201d (quoting S. Rep. No. 96-253, p. 5 (1979))). EAJA fees awards, which average only $3,000 to $4,000 per case, have proved to be a remarkably efficient way of improving access to the courts for the statute\u2019s intended beneficiaries, including thousands of recipients of Social Security and veteran\u2019s benefits each year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brief for Respondent 4-5; see also <em>Jean, </em>496 U. S., at 164, nn. 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The EAJA\u2019s admirable purpose will be undercut if lawyers fear that they will never actually receive attorney\u2019s fees to which a court has determined the prevailing party is entitled. The point of an award of attorney\u2019s fees, after all, is to enable a prevailing litigant to pay her attorney. See, <em>e. g., Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>491 U. S. 274, 285 (1989) (\u201cWe . .. take as our starting point the self-evident proposition that the \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 provided by [42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988] should compensate\u201d for \u201cthe work product of an attorney\u201d); <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983) (\u201cWhere a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee\u201d). We have accordingly acknowledged that in litigants\u2019 motions for attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthe real parties in interest are their attorneys.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht </em>v. <em>Barnhart, </em>535 U. S. 789, 798, n. 6 (2002). Subjecting EAJA fees awards to administrative offset for a litigant\u2019s debts will unquestionably make it more difficult for persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>of limited means to find attorneys to represent them. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants\u2019 Representatives et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>25 (hereinafter NOSSCR Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In its arguments before this Court, the Government resists this self-evident conclusion, but each of the three reasons it proffers is unpersuasive. First, the Government suggests that because EAJA fees awards are limited to those circumstances in which the Government\u2019s position is not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), no lawyer can rely on an EAJA fees award when deciding to take a case, so the possibility of an offset eliminating the award will play no additional role in the lawyer\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reply Brief for Petitioner 16-17. But it is common sense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not receive a fees award will inevitably decrease the willingness of attorneys to undertake representation in these kinds of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Second, the Government contends that any disincentive the fear of administrative offset may create is mitigated in the Social Security context by the Social Security Act\u2019s independent provision authorizing a fees award payable directly to the attorney. See <em>id., </em>at 17-18 (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A)). But as the Government acknowledges, the \u201cEAJA\u2019s fee-shifting provisions are potentially more generous than [the Social Security Act\u2019s] in at least three respects\u201d: (1) A court may not award attorney\u2019s fees under the Social Security Act, but may under the EAJA, when the claimant wins only a procedural victory and does not obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>any past-due benefits; (2) fees under the Social Security Act are limited to a percentage of benefits awarded, while EAJA fees are calculated under the lodestar method by examining the attorney\u2019s reasonable hours expended and her reasonable hourly rate; and (3) in contrast to the Social Security Act, fees may be awarded under the EAJA in addition to, rather than out of, the benefits awarded. Brief for Petitioner 6-7. EAJA awards thus provide an important additional incentive for attorneys to undertake Social Security cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Finally, the Government argues that lawyers can easily determine at the outset whether a potential client owes the Government a debt and can then assist the client in establishing a written repayment plan that would prevent an offset. Reply Brief for Petitioner 18. At oral argument, however, the Government acknowledged that it was not aware of any instance in which this has happened in the five years since it began subjecting EAJA fees awards to administrative offset. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13. It is not difficult to understand why. Helping a client establish a repayment plan would be a time-consuming endeavor uncompensated by any fee-shifting provision, and a client who needs such assistance is unlikely to have the funds to pay the attorney for that service. If the Government is instead suggesting that a lawyer can simply decline to represent a prospective client once she knows of the client\u2019s debtor status, that suggestion only proves my point. Cf. NOSSCR Brief 25 (describing deterrent effect of offsets on representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In the end, the Government has no compelling response to the fact that today\u2019s decision will make it more difficult for the neediest litigants to find attorneys to represent them in cases against the Government. I \u201cfind it difficult to ascribe to Congress an intent to throw\u201d an EAJA litigant \u201ca lifeline that it knew was a foot short____Given the anomalous nature of this result, and its frustration of the very purposes behind the EAJA itself, Congress cannot lightly be assumed to have intended it.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>490 U. S., at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The Government suggests that it is possible to glean such intent from the fact that Congress did not expressly exempt EAJA awards from administrative offset under the DC I A. Reply Brief for Petitioner 19-20; 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3716(c)(1)(C) (specifying certain federal payments that are not subject to administrative offset); see also 31 CFR \u00a7 285.5(e)(2) (2009) (identifying payments that are not subject to administrative offset because of a statutory exemption). If \u201capplication of the offset program to such awards will make it more difficult for Social Security claimants or other litigants to find attorneys,\u201d the Government contends, the \u201cprovisions that govern the offset program indicate that Congress is willing to bear that cost.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. The history of these provisions indicates otherwise. For more than two decades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cconsistently paid\u201d EAJA fee awards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party. <em>Stephens ex rel. R. E. </em>v. <em>Astrue, </em>565 F. 3d 131, 135 (CA4 2009); see also <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Security, </em>578 F. 3d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. <em>ante, </em>at 591, n. 3, 597. \u201cIn fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system for attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099 forms directly to the attorneys who received awards, noting the awards as taxable attorney income.\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>565 F. 3d, at 135. Not until 2005, when the Treasury Department extended the offset program to cover \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d federal payments, including \u201cfees,\u201d did the Commissioner cease paying EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys and adopt the position that the awards were appropriately considered the property of the prevailing party. <em>Id., </em>at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Bryant, </em>578 F. 3d, at 446; <em>ante, </em>at 589-590, 597. Congress therefore had no reason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fees awards (in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset program when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would want E A JA fees awards to be offset for a prevailing litigant\u2019s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate the DCIA\u2019s purpose of \u201cmaximiz[ing] collections of delinquent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick action to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all appropriate collection tools.\u201d \u00a7 31001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321-358. This purpose would be better served if claimants are able to find attorneys to help them secure the benefits they are rightfully owed in the first place, thereby making available a source of funds to permit repayment of the claimants\u2019 Government debts at all. See NOSSCR Brief 32; see also 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3716(c)(3)(A) (after initial $9,000 annual exemption, Social Security benefits are subject to administrative offset).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">While I join the Court\u2019s opinion and agree with its textual analysis, the foregoing persuades me that the practical effect of our decision \u201cseverely undermines the [EAJA\u2019s] estimable aim. . . . The Legislature has just cause to clarify beyond debate\u201d whether this effect is one it actually intends. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>556 U. S. 1, 44 (2009) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> The EAJA makes fee awards available to challenge Government action under a wide range of statutes, but, as respondent notes, the vast majority of EAJA awards are made in these two contexts, with Social Security cases representing the lion\u2019s share. Brief for Respondent 4-5; Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants\u2019 Representatives et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>22-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\"> In its brief, the Government downplays the frequency with which fees awards under the EAJA are made. At oral argument, respondent\u2019s counsel represented that EAJA fees awards are made in 42% of Social Security cases in which the claimant prevails and in 70% of all veteran\u2019s benefits cases filed. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. The Government did not contest the number for Social Security cases but suggested that the percentage of veteran\u2019s benefits cases resulting in EAJA awards is closer to 50% or 60%. <em>Id., </em>at 52. Under either estimate, these are hardly vanishing odds of success for an attorney deciding whether to take a client\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
