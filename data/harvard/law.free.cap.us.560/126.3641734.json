S. C. \u00a7 4248. We have previously examined similar statutes enacted under state law to determine whether they violate the Due Process Clause. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U. S. 346, 356-358 (1997); <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this case presents a different question. Here we ask whether the Federal Government has the authority under Article I of the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment program or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a government \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>enumerated powers.\u201d <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). We conclude that the Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact \u00a74248 as \u201cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d the powers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the Government of the United States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The federal statute before us allows a district court to order the civil commitment of an individual who is currently \u201cin the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,\u201d \u00a74248, if that individual (1) has previously \u201cengaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation,\u201d (2) currently \u201csuffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder,\u201d and (3) \u201cas a result of\u201d that mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is \u201csexually dangerous to others,\u201d in that \u201che would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 4247(a)(5)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In order to detain such a person, the Government (acting through the Department of Justice) must certify to a federal district judge that the prisoner meets the conditions just described, <em>i. e., </em>that he has engaged in sexually violent activity or child molestation in the past and that he suffers from a mental illness that makes him correspondingly dangerous to others. \u00a7 4248(a). When such a certification is filed, the statute automatically stays the individual\u2019s release from prison, <em>ibid., </em>thereby giving the Government an opportunity to prove its claims at a hearing through psychiatric (or other) evidence, \u00a7\u00a74247(bMc), 4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner \u201cshall be represented by counsel\u201d and shall have \u201can opportunity\u201d at the hearing \u201cto testify, to present evidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross-examine\u201d the Government\u2019s witnesses. \u00a7\u00a7 4247(d), 4248(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">If the Government proves its claims by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d the court will order the prisoner\u2019s continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>commitment in \u201cthe custody of the Attorney General,\u201d who must \u201cmake all reasonable efforts to cause\u201d the State where that person was tried, or the State where he is domiciled, to \u201cassume responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment.\u201d \u00a7 4248(d); cf. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to assume that responsibility, the Attorney General \u201cshall release\u201d the individual \u201cto the appropriate official\u201d of that State. \u00a7 4248(d). But if, \u201cnotwithstanding such efforts, neither such State will assume such responsibility,\u201d then \u201cthe Attorney General shall place the person for treatment in a suitable [federal] facility.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>cf. \u00a7 4247(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Confinement in the federal facility will last until either (1) the person\u2019s mental condition improves to the point where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appropriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be released; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be transferred to the custody of that State. \u00a7\u00a74248(d)(l)-(2). The statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric and judicial review of the individual\u2019s case, including judicial hearings at the request of the confined person at 6-month intervals. \u00a7\u00a7 4247(e)(1)(B), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In November and December 2006, the Government instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case. Three of the five had previously pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography, see 507 F. Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n. 2 (2007); \u00a72252A(a), and a fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vigil, </em>No. 1:99CR00509-001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); \u00a7\u00a7 1153,2243(a). With respect to each of them, the Government claimed that the respondent was about to be released from federal prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>others. App. 38-40, 44-52. During that same time period, the Government instituted similar proceedings against the fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial. See <em>id., </em>at 41-43; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Catron, </em>No. 04-778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27, 2006); \u00a7 4241(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil-commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 528. They claimed that the statute denies them substantive due process and equal protection of the laws. <em>Ibid. </em>They claimed that it violates their procedural due process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerousness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid. </em>And, finally, they claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by Article I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 528-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The District Court, accepting two of the respondents\u2019 claims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with respondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id., </em>at 551-559 (citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers, 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530-551. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on this latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278-284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof question, nor did it address any of respondents\u2019 other constitutional challenges. <em>Id., </em>at 276, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its request, limited to the question of Congress\u2019 authority under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since then, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that same question, each deciding it in the Government\u2019s favor, thereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Volungus, </em>595 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tom, </em>565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The question presented is whether the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18, grants Congress authority sufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other provisions of the Constitution \u2014 such as the Due Process Clause\u2014 do not prohibit civil commitment in these circumstances. Cf. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U. S. 346; <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for argument\u2019s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated powers, may enact such a statute as well. On that assumption, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress legislative power sufficient to enact \u00a7 4248. We base this conclusion on \u00f1ve considerations, taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>First, </em>the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress broad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200 years ago, this Court stated that the Federal \u201c[Government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers,\u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 405, which means that \u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of\u201d those powers, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, \u201ca government, entrusted with such\u201d powers \u201cmust also be entrusted with ample means for their execution.\u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary and Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution\u2019s grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied by broad power to enact laws that are \u201cconven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ient, or useful\u201d or \u201cconducive\u201d to the authority\u2019s \u201cbeneficial exercise.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 413, 418; see also <em>id., </em>at 421 (\u201c[Congress can] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved in the constitution . . . \u201d). Chief Justice Marshall emphasized that the word \u201cnecessary\u201d does not mean \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 413-415 (emphasis deleted); <em>Jinks </em>v. <em>Richland County, </em>538 U. S. 456, 462 (2003) C\u2018[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Necessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be \u2018 <em>\u201cabsolutely </em>necessary\u201d \u2019 to the exercise of an enumerated power\u201d). In language that has come to define the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\u201d <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 421.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We have since made clear that, in determining whether the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute, we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means that is rationally related to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power. <em>Sabri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d to describe the necessary relationship); <em>ibid, </em>(upholding Congress\u2019 \u201cauthority under the Necessary and Proper Clause\u201d to enact a criminal statute in furtherance of the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that because \u201cCongress had a rational basis\u201d for concluding that a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the statute falls within the scope of congressional \u201cauthority to \u2018make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\u2019 to \u2018regulate Commerce . . . among the several States\u2019\u201d (ellipsis in original)); see also <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S. 549, 557 (1995); <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., </em>452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal statute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, \u00a78, must also \u201cnot [be] prohibited\u201d by the Constitution. <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 421. But as we have already stated, the present statute\u2019s validity under provisions of the Constitution other than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue that is not before us. Under the question presented, the relevant inquiry is simply \u201cwhether the means chosen are \u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power\u201d or under other powers that the Constitution grants Congress the authority to implement. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>at 37 (Scaua, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>312 U. S. 100, 121 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We have also recognized that the Constitution \u201cad-dresse[s]\u201d the \u201cchoice of means\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cprimarily ... to the judgment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone.\u201d <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U. S. 534, 547-548 (1934).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">See also <em>Lottery Case, </em>188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903) (\u201c[T]he Constitution ... leaves to Congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power\u201d); <em>Morrison, supra, </em>at 607 (applying a \u201cpresumption of constitutionality\u201d when examining the scope of congressional power); <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 410, 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly about the creation of federal crimes beyond those related to \u201ccounterfeiting,\u201d \u201c[tjreason,\u201d or \u201cPiracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas\u201d or \u201cagainst the Law of Nations,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Art. I, \u00a78, els. 6, 10; Art. Ill, \u00a73, nonetheless grants Congress broad authority to create such crimes. See <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 416 (\u201cAll admit that the government may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of Congress\u201d); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>95 U. S. 670, 672 (1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to enact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its enumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the general welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish post offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturalization, and so forth. . Art. I, \u00a7 8, els. 1, 3, 4, 7, 9; Arndts. 13-15. See, <em>e. g., Lottery Case, supra </em>(upholding criminal statute enacted in furtherance of the Commerce Clause); <em>Ex parte Yarbrough, </em>110 U. S. 651 (1884) (upholding Congress' authority to enact Rev. Stat. \u00a75508, currently 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 241 (criminalizing civil-rights violations) and Rev. Stat. \u00a7 5520, currently 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 l'973j (criminalizing voting-rights violations) in furtherance of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments); <em>Sabri, supra </em>(upholding criminal statute enacted in furtherance of the Spending Clause); <em>Jinks, supra, </em>at 462, n. 2 (describing perjury and witness tampering as federal crimes enacted in furtherance of the power to constitute federal tribunals (citing <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 417)); see also 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1691 <em>et seq. </em>(postal crimes); \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(bankruptcy crimes); 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324-1328 (immigration crimes).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the enforcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance of its enumerated powers, \u201ccan cause a prison to be erected at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States, and direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment under the laws of the United States shall be confined there.\u201d <em>Ex parte Karstendick, </em>93 U. S. 396, 400 (1876). Moreover, Congress, having established a prison system, can enact laws that seek to ensure that system's safe and responsible administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>by, for example, requiring prisoners to receive medical care and educational training, see, <em>e. g., </em>18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4005-4006; \u00a7 4042(a)(3), and can also ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and visitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for example, creating further criminal laws governing entry, exit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to ensure discipline and security, see, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 1791 (prohibiting smuggling contraband); \u00a7751 <em>et seq. </em>(prohibiting escape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR \u00a7 541.10 <em>et seq. </em>(2009) (inmate discipline).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Neither Congress\u2019 power to criminalize conduct, nor its power to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct, nor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prisoners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Congress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of those things in the eourse of \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d the enumerated powers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the Government of the United States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18 \u2014 authority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Second, </em>the civil-commitment statute before us constitutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related mental-health statutes that have existed for many decades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute\u2019s constitutionality. See, <em>e. g., Walz </em>v. <em>Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New York, </em>397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (\u201c[N]o one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use . . . \u201d); cf. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S., at 612-614 (legislative history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect to Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can nonetheless be \u201chelpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme,\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>545 U. S., at 21; <em>Walz, supra, </em>at 678, and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the new statute and pre-existing federal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental-health care to federal prisoners, and has long pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>vided for their civil commitment. In 1855, it established Saint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in the District of Columbia to provide treatment to \u201cthe insane of the army and navy ... and of the District of Columbia.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857, it provided for confinement at Saint Elizabeth\u2019s of any person within the District of Columbia who had been \u201ccharged with [a] crime\u201d and who was \u201cinsane\u201d or later became \u201cinsane during the continuance of his or her sentence in the United States penitentiary.\u201d Act of Feb. 7,1857, \u00a7\u00a75-6,11 Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212-213 (1881). In 1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes, Congress provided for civil commitment in federal facilities (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of <em>\u201call </em>persons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in <em>any </em>court of the United States\u201d and who are or \u201cshall become\u201d insane \u201cduring the term of their imprisonment.\u201d Act of June 23,1874, eh. 465,18 Stat. 251 (emphasis added). And in 1882, Congress provided for similar commitment of those \u201ccharged\u201d with federal offenses who become \u201cinsane\u201d while in the \u201ccustody\u201d of the United States. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis added). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress created a national, federal civil-commitment program under which any person who was either charged with or convicted of any federal offense in any federal court could be confined in a federal mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">These statutes did not raise the question presented here, for they all provided that commitment in a federal hospital would end upon the completion of the relevant \u201cterms\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment\u201d as set forth in the underlying criminal sentence or statute. \u00a7\u00a72-3,18 Stat. 252; see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940\u2019s that proviso was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In 1945, the Judicial Conference of the United States proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil-commitment system. The Judicial Conference based its proposals upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>what this Court has described as a \u201clong study by a conspicuously able committee\u201d (chaired by Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members includ\u00e9d Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation \u201cwith federal district and circuit judges\u201d across the country as well as with the Department of Justice. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>219 F. 2d 376, 380-384 (CA8 1955) (describing the committee\u2019s work). The committee studied, among other things, the \u201cserious problem faced by the Bureau of Prisons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no state will assume responsibility for their custody.\u201d Judicial Conference, Report of Committee To Study Treatment Accorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged With Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report), App. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in which the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the problem of \u201c \u2018paranoid\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018threatening\u2019 \u201d individuals whom no State would accept. <em>Id., </em>at 9, App. 71. And it noted that, in the Bureau\u2019s \u201c[ejxperience,\u201d States would not accept an \u201cappreciable number\u201d of \u201cmental[ly] incompetent\u201d individuals \u201cnearing expiration\u201d of their prison terms, because of their \u201clack of legal residence in any State,\u201d even though those individuals \u201cought not... be at large because they constitute a menace to public safety.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong, 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (statement of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from Bennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee Report, App. 83-88. The committee, hence the Judicial Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact \u201csome provision of law authorizing the continued confinement of such persons after their sentences expired.\u201d Committee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the Judicial Conference report, Congress modified the law. See Act of June 25,1948,62 Stat. 855,18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241-4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74244-4248. It provided for the civil commitment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally incompetent at any time after their arrest and before the expiration of their federal sentence, \u00a7\u00a74241, 4244, 4247-4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards, \u00a7\u00a74242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose prison term is about to expire, it specified the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cWhenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to expire has been examined [and]... in the judgment of the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner is insane or mentally incompetent, and ... if released he will probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property, or other interests of the United States, and that suitable arrangements for the custody and care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to ... the court for the district in which the prisoner is confined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner to be examined . . . and shall. .. hold a hearing .... If upon such hearing the court shall determine that the conditions specified above exist, the court may commit the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative.\u201d \u00a74247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The precondition that the mentally ill individual\u2019s release would \u201cprobably endanger the safety of the officers, the property, or other interests of the United States\u201d was uniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his \u201crelease would endanger the safety of persons, property or the public interest in general \u2014 not merely the interests peculiar to the United States as such.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>410 F. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also <em>Royal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>274 F. 2d 846, 851-852 (CA10 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057,18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4241-4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it altered the provision just discussed, regarding the prisoner\u2019s danger to the \u201cinterests of the United States,\u201d to conform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpretation of that language, <em>i. e., </em>it altered the language so as to authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to the other conditions, the prisoner\u2019s \u201crelease would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another.\u201d \u00a7 4246(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Congress also elaborated upon the required condition \u201cthat suitable arrangements ... are not otherwise available\u201d by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative placement in state facilities, as we have set forth above. See <em>ibid.; supra, </em>at 130-131. With these modifications, the statutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once they have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal crime. \u00a7\u00a7 4241(d), 4246; see also \u00a7 4243(d). They continue to provide for the <em>continued </em>civil commitment of those individuals when they are \u201cdue for release\u201d from federal custody because their \u201csentence is about to expire.\u201d \u00a7 4246. And, as we have previously set forth, they establish various procedural and other requirements. <em>E. g., </em>\u00a7 4247.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before us. \u00a7 302,120 Stat. 619,18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4248. It differs from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Notably, many of these individuals were likely already subject to civil commitment under \u00a74246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But cf. H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from its specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, \u00a74248 is similar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. \u00a74246. In that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework, which has been in place since 1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>Third, </em>Congress reasonably extended its longstanding civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually dangerous persons who are already in federal custody, even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of their criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Government is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal custodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger federal prisoners may pose. Cf. <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U. S. 307, 320 (1982) (\u201cIn operating an institution such as .[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is necessary for the State to restrain the movement of residents \u2014 for example, to protect them <em>as well as others </em>from violence\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one \u201cwho takes charge of a third person\u201d is \u201cunder a duty to exercise reasonable care to control\u201d that person to prevent him from causing reasonably foreseeable \u201cbodily harm to others.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7319, p. 129 (1963-1964); see <em>Volungus, </em>595 F. 3d, at 7-8 (citing cases); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>S. A., </em>129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8 1997) (\u201c[Congress enacted \u00a74246] to avert the public danger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and dangerous detainees\u201d). If a federal prisoner is infected with a communicable disease that threatens others, surely it would be \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for the Federal Government to take action, pursuant to its role as federal custodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes) to release that individual among the general public, where he might infect others (even if not threatening an interstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3). And if confinement of such an individual is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d thing to do, then how could it not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>be similarly \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d to confine an individual whose mental illness threatens others to the same degree?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 4248 is \u201creasonably adapted,\u201d <em>Darby, </em>312 U. S., at 121, to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement constitutionally enumerated authority, see <em>supra, </em>at 135-136). Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct,\u201d \u00a7 4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, at 22-23. And Congress could also have reasonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference\u2019s report) that a reasonable number of such individuals would likely <em>not </em>be detained by the States if released from federal custody, in part because the Federal Government itself severed their claim to \u201clegal residence in any State\u201d by incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R. Rep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7-11, App. 69-75; cf. <em>post, </em>at 154 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Here Congress\u2019 desire to address the specific challenges identified in the Reports cited above, taken together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the conclusion that \u00a7 4248 satisfies \u201creview for means-end rationality,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>that it satisfies the Constitution\u2019s insistence that a federal statute represent a rational means for implementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority. <em>Sabri, </em>541 U. S., at 605 (citing <em>McCulloch, 4 </em>Wheat. 316). See <em>Jinks, </em>538 U. S., at 462-463 (opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.) (holding that a statute is authorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause when it \u201cprovides an alternative to [otherwise] unsatisfactory options\u201d that are \u201cobviously inefficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Fourth, </em>the statute properly accounts for state interests. Respondents and the dissent contend that \u00a74248 violates the Tenth Amendment because it \u201cinvades the province of state sovereignty\u201d in an area typically left to state control. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>York </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992); see Brief for Respondents 35-47; <em>post, </em>at 164-165, 176-180 (Thomas, J., dissenting). See also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>406 U. S. 715, 736 (1972) (\u201cThe States have traditionally exercised broad power to commit persons found to be mentally ill\u201d). But the Tenth Amendment\u2019s text is clear: \u201cThe powers <em>not delegated to the United States </em>by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The powers \u201cdelegated to the United States by the Constitution\u201d include those specifically enumerated powers listed in Article I along with the implementation authority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by definition, these powers are not powers that the Constitution \u201creserved to the States.\u201d See <em>New York, supra, </em>at 156,159 (\u201cIf a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power to the States . . . .\u201d \u201cIn the end ... it makes no difference whether one views the question at issue in these cases as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to the Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Constitution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the States under the Tenth Amendment\u201d); <em>Darby, supra, </em>at 123-124; see also <em>Hodel, </em>452 U. S., at 276-277, 281; <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wirtz, </em>392 U. S. 183, 195-196 (1968); <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Yellowley, </em>272 U. S. 581, 596 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Nor does this statute invade state sovereignty or otherwise improperly limit the scope of \u201cpowers that remain with the States.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 164 (Thomas, J., dissenting). To the contrary, it requires <em>accommodation </em>of state interests: The Attorney General must inform the State in which the federal prisoner \u201cis domiciled or was tried\u201d that he is detaining someone with respect to whom those States may wish to assert their authority, and he must encourage those States to assume custody of the individual. \u00a7 4248(d). He must also immediately \u201crelease\u201d that person \u201cto the appropriate official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of\u201d either State \u201cif such State will assume [such] responsibility.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And either State has the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the individual, which will prompt the individual\u2019s immediate transfer to state custody. \u00a7 4248(d)(1). Respondents contend that the States are nonetheless \u201cpowerless to <em>prevent </em>the detention of their citizens under \u00a7 4248, even if detention is contrary to the States\u2019 policy choices.\u201d Brief for Respondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the most natural reading of the statute, see \u00a7\u00a74248(d)(l)-(e), and the Solicitor General acknowledges that \u201cthe Federal Government would have no appropriate role\u201d with respect to an individual covered by the statute once \u201cthe transfer to State responsibility and State control has occurred.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In <em>Greenwood, </em>350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a challenge to the current statute\u2019s <em>predecessor </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>to the 1949 statute we described above, <em>supra, </em>at 140-141. The petitioners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that the statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty. See Brief for Petitioner in <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>O. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18-29. But the Court rejected that argument. See <em>Greenwood, supra, </em>at 375-376. And the version of the statute at issue in <em>Greenwood </em>was <em>less </em>protective of state interests than the current statute. That statute authorized federal custody so long as <em>\u201csuitable </em>arrangements\u201d were \u201cnot otherwise available\u201d in a State or otherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for Petitioner in <em>Greenwood, supra, </em>at 25 (\u201cWhat has really happened is that the Federal government has been dissatisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally incompetent who have been released by the Federal authorities\u201d). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, \u00a74248 requires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant States to take custody of the individual without inquiring into the \u201csuitability\u201d of their intended care or treatment, and to relinquish federal authority whenever a State asserts its own. \u00a7 4248(d). Thus, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the statute at issue in <em>Greenwood </em>did not invade state interests, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>neither does \u00a74248.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>Fifth, </em>the links between \u00a7 4248 and an enumerated Article I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the statutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the cautionary instruction that we may not \u201cpile inference upon inference\u201d in order to sustain congressional action under Article I, <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S., at 567, respondents argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress\u2019 authority can be no more than one step removed from a specifically enumerated power. See Brief for Respondents 21-22; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our precedents. Again, take <em>Greenwood </em>as an example. In that case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was accused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at 369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was the power to \u201cEstablish Post Offices and post Roads.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized in <em>McCulloch,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201cthe power \u2018to establish post offices and post roads\u2019... is executed by the single act of <em>making </em>the establishment. ... [F]rom this has been inferred the power and duty of <em>carrying </em>the mail along the post road, from one post office to another. And, from this <em>implied </em>power, has <em>again </em>been inferred the right to <em>punish </em>those who steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">And, as we have explained, from the implied power to punish we have <em>further </em>inferred both the power to imprison, see <em>supra, </em>at 136-137, and, in <em>Greenwood, </em>the federal civil-commitment power.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multiple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in <em>Sabri </em>we observed that \u201cCongress has authority under the Spending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Clause to appropriate federal moneys\u201d and that it therefore \u201chas corresponding authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars\u201d are not \u201csiphoned off\u201d by \u201ccorrupt public officers.\u201d 541 U. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that, in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of \u201ctaxpayer dollars,\u201d Congress has the <em>additional </em>prophylactic power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the stolen funds have not been \u201ctraeeably skimmed from specific federal payments.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 605-606. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in furtherance of Art. I, \u00a7 8, els. 11-13, to award \u201cpensions to the wounded and disabled\u201d soldiers of the armed forces and their dependents, 98 U. S., at 351; and from that implied power we further inferred the \u201c[i]mplied power\u201d \u201cto pass laws to . . . punish\u201d anyone who fraudulently appropriated such pensions, <em>id., </em>at 346. See also <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>11 Wall. 493, 506-507 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Indeed, even the dissent acknowledges that Congress has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power, and also the additional power to imprison people who violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the additional power to provide for the safe and reasonable management of those prisons, and the additional power to regulate the prisoners\u2019 behavior even after their release. See <em>post, </em>at 169-170, 173-174, n. 12. Of course, each of those powers, like the powers addressed in <em>Sabri, Hall, </em>and <em>McCulloch, </em>is ultimately \u201cderived from\u201d an enumerated power, <em>Hall, supra, </em>at 346. And, as the dissent agrees, that enumerated power is \u201cthe enumerated power that justifies the defendant\u2019s statute of conviction,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 174, n. 12. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single specific enumerated power \u201cthat justifies] a criminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 169, in <em>all </em>cases because Congress relies on different enumerated powers (often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>power) to enact its various federal criminal statutes, see <em>supra, </em>at 136. But every such statute must itself be legitimately predicated on an enumerated power. And the same enumerated power that justifies the creation of a federal criminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied federal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justifies civil commitment under \u00a7 4248 as well. See <em>supra, </em>at 142-143. Thus, we must reject respondents\u2019 argument that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a single step between an enumerated power and an Act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on Congress a general \u201cpolice power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor General repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, \u00a74248 is narrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small fraction of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-25 (105 individuals have been subject to \u00a7 4248 out of over 188,000 federal inmates); see also Dept, of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, W. Sabol, H. West, &amp; M. Cooper, Prisoners in 2008, p. 8 (NCJ 228417, Dec. 2009) (Table 8). And its reach is limited to individuals already \u201cin the custody of the\u201d Federal Government. \u00a7 4248(a); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (\u201c[Federal authority for \u00a74248] has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on the fact that this person has entered the criminal justice system . . . \u201d). Indeed, the Solicitor General argues that \u201cthe Federal Government would not have .. . the power to commit a person who ... has been released from prison and whose period of supervised release is also completed.\u201d Id., at 9. Thus, far from a \u201cgeneral police power,\u201d \u00a74248 is a reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government\u2019s legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison system.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">To be sure, as we have previously acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201cThe Federal Government undertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>two senses; first, because the Framers would not have conceived that <em>any </em>government would conduct such activities; and second, because the Framers would not have believed that the <em>Federal </em>Government, rather than the States, would assume such responsibilities. Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution were phrased in language broad enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal Government\u2019s role.\u201d <em>New York, </em>505 U. S., at 157.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in drafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through time. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years ago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of \u201ca constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. \u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We take these five considerations together. They include: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause, (2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena, (3) the sound reasons for the statute\u2019s enactment in light of the Government\u2019s custodial interest in safeguarding the public from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4) the statute\u2019s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the statute\u2019s narrow scope. Taken together, these considerations lead us to conclude that the statute is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution consequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its application denies equal protection of the laws, procedural or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>substantive due process, or any other rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit with respect to Congress\u2019 power to enact this statute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b198-7\">Justice Kennedy,</author>\n<p id=\"AXc\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The Court is correct, in my view, to hold that the challenged portions of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4248 are necessary and proper exercises of congressional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Respondents argue that congressional authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one step removed from an enumerated power. This is incorrect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has sufficient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope of federal authority, the analysis depends not on the number of links in the congressional-power chain but on the strength of the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal formulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of federal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the constitutional inquiry. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S. 549, 566-567 (1995). The inferences must be controlled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson warned, congressional powers become completely unbounded by linking one power to another <em>ad infinitum </em>in a veritable game of \u201c \u2018this is the house that Jack built.\u2019\u201d Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston (Apr. 30,1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B. Oberg ed. 2004); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>451 F. 3d 615, 628 (CA10 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is to withhold assent from certain statements and propositions of the Court\u2019s opinion. The second is to caution that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Constitution does require the invalidation of congressional attempts to extend federal powers in some instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The Court concludes that, when determining whether Congress has the authority to enact a specific law under the Necessary and Proper Clause, we look \u201cto see whether the statute constitutes a means that is rationally related to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 134 (suggesting that <em>Sabri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The terms \u201crationally related\u201d and \u201crational basis\u201d must be employed with care, particularly if either is to b\u00e9 used as a stand-alone test. The phrase \u201crational basis\u201d most often is employed to describe the standard for determining whether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental liberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause. Referring to this due process inquiry, and in what must he one of the most deferential formulations of the standard for reviewing legislation in all the Court\u2019s precedents, the Court has said: \u201cBut the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.\u201d <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em>348 U. S. 483, 487-488 (1955). This formulation was in a case presenting a due process challenge and a challenge to a State\u2019s exercise of its own powers, powers not confined by the principles that control the limited nature of our National Government. The phrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The operative constitutional provision in this case is the Necessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held that the <em>Lee Optical </em>test, asking if \u201cit might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct\u201d an evil, is the proper test in this context. Rather, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Necessary and Proper Clause, application of a \u201crational basis\u201d test should be at least as exacting as it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more so. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its opinion referring to \u201crational basis\u201d are predominantly Commerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases. See <em>ante, </em>at 184-135 (citing <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>545 U. S. 1 (2005); <em>Lopez, supra; Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., </em>452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">There is an important difference between the two questions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear. <em>Raich, Lopez, </em>and <em>Hodel </em>were all Commerce Clause cases. Those precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not a mere conceivable rational relation, as in <em>Lee Optical. </em>\u201c \u2018[Sjimply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.\u2019\u201d <em>Lopez, supra, </em>at 557, n. 2 (quoting <em>Hodel, supra, </em>at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Commerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based on empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferential, this may well be different from the rational-basis test as <em>Lee Optical </em>described it.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Court relies on <em>Sabri, supra, </em>for its conclusion that a \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d is all that is required for a power to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause\u2019s reach. See <em>ante, </em>at 134. <em>Sabri </em>only refers to \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d in a parenthetical describing the holding in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316 (1819); it certainly did not import the <em>Lee Optical </em>rational-basis test into this arena through such a parenthetical. See <em>Sabri, supra, </em>at 612 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cA statute can have a \u2018rational\u2019 connection to an enumerated power without being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated power\u201d). It should be remembered, moreover, that the spending power is not designated as such in the Constitution but rather is implied from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the power to lay and collect taxes and other specified exac-tions in order, among other purposes, \u201cto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1; see <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>483 U. S. 203, 206 (1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been much discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to the Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the analytic approach in those precedents should be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A separate concern stems from the Court\u2019s explanation of the Tenth Amendment. <em>Ante, </em>at 143-144. I had thought it a basic principle that the powers reserved to the States consist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remaining after taking account of powers granted to the National Government. The Constitution delegates limited powers to the National Government and then reserves the remainder for the States (or the people), not the other way around, as the Court\u2019s analysis suggests. And the powers reserved to the States are so broad that they remain undefined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps imperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and the States alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is correct in one sense to say that if the National Government has the power to act under the Necessary and Proper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the States. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the Constitution inform which powers are properly exercised by the National Government in the first place. See <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S., at 580-581 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also <em>McCul-loch, supra, </em>at 421 (powers \u201cconsistent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional\u201d). It is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper Clause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is not one properly within the reach of federal power.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to hold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on the exercise of congressional power are the Constitution\u2019s express prohibitions. The Court\u2019s discussion of the Tenth Amendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing from the federal system are of no import when defining the limits of the National Government\u2019s power, as it proceeds by first asking whether the power is within the National Government\u2019s reach, and if so it discards federalism concerns entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">These remarks explain why the Court ignores important limitations stemming from federalism principles. Those principles are essential to an understanding of the function and province of the States in our constitutional structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted within its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the federal detention of prisoners does not endanger third parties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State to take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so it is incumbent on the National Government to act. This obligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in tort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an unstable and dangerous person) that endangers others. Having acted within its constitutional authority to detain the person, the National Government can acknowledge a duty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does not prejudice the States and their citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">I would note, as the Court\u2019s opinion does, that \u00a7 4248 does not supersede the right and responsibility of the States to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil confinement. The federal program in question applies only to those in federal custody and thus involves little intrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">This is not a case in which the National Government demands that a State use its own governmental system to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>plement federal commands. See <em>Printz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the National Government relieves the States of their own primary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the safety and well-being of their citizens. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which the exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and duties traditionally committed to the State. See <em>Lopez, supra, </em>at 580-581 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of authority ' over a small class of persons already subject to the federal power. Importantly, \u00a7 4248(d) requires the Attorney General to release any civil detainee \u201cto the appropriate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or was tried if such State will assume responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment,\u201d providing a strong assurance that the proffered reason for the legislation\u2019s necessity is not a mere artifice.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b203-7\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"ALu\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">I am concerned about the breadth of the Court\u2019s language, see <em>ante, </em>at 151-153 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), and the ambiguity of the standard that the Court applies, see <em>post, </em>at 166 (Thomas, J., dissenting), but I am persuaded, on narrow grounds, that it was \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for Congress to enact the statute at issue in this case, 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248, in order to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d powers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitution, see Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from federal prisoners who suffer from \u201ca serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d and who, if released, would have \u201cserious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5), (6), 4248(d). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>this law, if neither the State of a prisoner\u2019s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was tried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner's \u201ccustody, care, and treatment,\u201d the Federal Government is authorized to undertake that responsibility. \u00a7 4248(d). The statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will assume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a dangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy federal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to any State.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I entirely agree with the dissent that \u201c[t]he Necessary and Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that \u2018carr[y] into Execution\u2019 one or more of the federal powers enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 159, but \u00a74248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary and proper means of carrying into execution the enumerated powers that support the federal criminal statutes under which the affected prisoners were convicted. The Necessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional authority for most federal criminal statutes. In other words, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congressional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of the powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and proper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do that it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the operation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal prison system.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">All of this has been recognized since the beginning of our country. The First Congress enacted federal criminal laws,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> created federal law enforcement and prosecutorial positions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>established a federal court system,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided for the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal crimes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and gave United States marshals the responsibility of securing federal prisoners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The only additional question presented here is whether, in order to carry into execution the enumerated powers on which the federal criminal laws rest, it is also necessary and proper for Congress to protect the public from dangers created by the federal criminal justice and prison systems. In my view, the answer to that question is \u201cyes.\u201d Just as it is necessary and proper for Congress to provide for the apprehension of escaped federal prisoners, it is necessary and proper for Congress to provide for the civil commitment of dangerous federal prisoners who would otherwise escape civil commitment as a result of federal imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Some years ago, a distinguished study group created by the Judicial Conference of the United States found that, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>disturbing number of cases, no State was willing to assume the financial burden of providing for the civil commitment of federal prisoners who, if left at large after the completion of their sentences, would present a danger to any communities in which they chose to live or visit. See <em>ante, </em>at 138-139; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U. S. 366, 373-374 (1956). These federal prisoners, having been held for years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any State; it was a matter of speculation where they would choose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was enthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Congress <em>carte blanche. </em>Although the term \u201cnecessary\u201d does not mean \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d or indispensable, the term requires an \u201cappropriate\u201d link between a power conferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by Congress. See <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819). And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce compliance with that limitation. <em>Id., </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The law in question here satisfies that requirement. This is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court to think of a rational basis on which Congress might have perceived an attenuated link between the powers underlying the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil commitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to Congress\u2019 constitutional powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress had the constitutional authority to enact 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> See, <em>e. g., </em>ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112 (\u201cAn Act for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> \u00a735, <em>id., </em>at 92 (\u201c[Tjhere shall be appointed in each district a meet person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district,... whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority of the United States\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> \u00a7 1, <em>id., </em>at 73 (\u201cAn Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a79, <em>id., </em>at 76-77 (providing that the federal district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over \"all crimes and offences that shall be cognizable under the authority of the United States, . . . where no other punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, is to be inflicted\u201d); see also J.

S. 452, 457 (1991). In our system, the Federal Government\u2019s powers are enumerated, and hence limited. See, <em>e. g., McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (\u201cThis government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers\u201d). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless the Constitution authorizes it to do so. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000) (\u201cEvery law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the Constitution\u201d). The States, in turn, are free to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not withhold from them. Arndt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This constitutional structure establishes different default rules for Congress and the States: Congress\u2019 powers are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d while those that belong to the States \u201cremain ... numerous and indefinite.\u201d The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Constitution plainly sets forth the \u201cfew and defined\u201d powers that Congress may exercise. Article I \u201cvest[s]\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Congress \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d \u00a7 1, and carefully enumerates those powers in \u00a78. The final clause of \u00a7 8, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Congress \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\u201d As the Clause\u2019s placement at the end of \u00a78 indicates, the \u201cforegoing Powers\u201d are those granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that section. The \u201cother Powers\u201d to which the Clause refers are those \u201cvested\u201d in Congress and the other branches by other specific provisions of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress\u2019 authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in <em>McCul-loch, </em>which has stood for nearly 200 years as this Court\u2019s definitive interpretation of that text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 421.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">McCulloch\u2019s summation is descriptive of the Clause itself, providing that federal legislation is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 authority under the Clause if it satisfies a two-part test: First, the law must be directed toward a \u201clegitimate\u201d end, which <em>McCulloch </em>defines as one \u201cwithin the scope of the [Cjonstitution\u201d \u2014 that is, the powers expressly delegated to the Federal Government by some provision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a necessary and proper fit between the \u201cmeans\u201d (the federal law) and the \u201cend\u201d (the enumerated power or powers) it is designed to serve. <em>Ibid. McCulloch </em>accords Congress a certain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit under this second inquiry. The means Congress selects will be deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>are \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cplainly adapted\u201d to the exercise of an enumerated power, and \u201cproper\u201d if they are not otherwise \u201cprohibited\u201d by the Constitution and not \u201c[injconsistent\u201d with its \u201cletter and spirit.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Critically, however, <em>McCulloch </em>underscores the linear relationship the Clause establishes between the two inquiries: Unless the end itself is \u201clegitimate,\u201d the fit between means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no matter how \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d an Act of Congress may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything other than \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d one or more of the Federal Government's enumerated powers. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This limitation was of utmost importance to the Framers. During the state ratification debates, Anti-Federalists expressed concern that the Necessary and Proper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited power. See, <em>e. g., </em>Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist supporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge, explaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any freestanding authority, but instead made explicit what was already implicit in the grant of each enumerated power. Referring to the \u201cpowers declared in the Constitution,\u201d Alexander Hamilton noted that \u201cit is <em>express ly </em>to execute these powers that the sweeping clause... authorizes the national legislature to pass all <em>necessary </em>and <em>proper </em>laws.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, at 245. James Madison echoed this view, stating that \u201cthe sweeping clause . . . only extend[s] to the enumerated powers.\u201d 3 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 455 (1836) (hereinafter Elliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification conventions indicate that this understanding was widely held by the founding generation. <em>E. g., id., </em>at 245-246 (statement of George Nicholas) (\u201cSuppose [the Necessary and Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every power, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>they should have power to make laws to carry that power into execution; would that have increased their powers? If, therefore, it could not have increased their powers, if placed at the end of each power, it cannot increase them at the end of all\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Roughly 30 years after the Constitution\u2019s ratification, <em>Mc-Culloch </em>firmly established this understanding in our constitutional jurisprudence. 4 Wheat., at 421, 423. Since then, our precedents uniformly have maintained that the Necessary and Proper Clause is not an independent fount of congressional authority, but rather \u201ca <em>caveat </em>that Congress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the specifically granted \u2018foregoing\u2019 powers of \u00a78 \u2018and all other Powers vested by this Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kinsella </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Singleton, </em>361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter Coal Co., </em>298 U. S. 238, 291 (1936); see <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U. S. 706, 739 (1999); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter\u2019s Lessee, </em>1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816); see also <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>545 U. S. 1, 39 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (stating that, although the Clause \u201cempowers Congress to enact laws . . . that are not within its authority to enact in isolation,\u201d those laws must be \u201cin effectuation of [Congress\u2019] enumerated powers\u201d (citing <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 421-422)).</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Section 4248 establishes a federal civil-commitment regime for certain persons in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the Attorney General demonstrates to a federal court by clear and convincing evidence that a person subject to the statute is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a court may order the person committed until he is no longer a risk \u201cto others,\u201d even if that does not occur until after his federal criminal sentence has expired or the statute of limitations on the federal charge against him has run. \u00a7\u00a74248(a), (d)-(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">No enumerated power in Article I, \u00a7 8, expressly delegates to Congress the power to enact a civil-commitment regime for sexually dangerous persons, nor does any other provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other branches of the Federal Government with such a power. Accordingly, \u00a74248 can be a valid exercise of congressional authority only if it is \u201cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d one or more of those federal powers actually enumerated in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Section 4248 does not fall within any of those powers. The Government identifies no specific enumerated power or powers as a constitutional predicate for \u00a74248, and none are readily discernable. Indeed, not even the Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Clause \u2014 the enumerated power this Court has interpreted most expansively, see, <em>e. g., NLRB </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937) \u2014 can justify federal civil detention of sex offenders. Under the Court\u2019s precedents, Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as sexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity may have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on interstate commerce. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S., at 617-618; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S. 549, 563-567 (1995). That limitation forecloses any claim that \u00a7 4248 carries into execution Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power, and the Government has never argued otherwise, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 21-22.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">This Court, moreover, consistently has recognized that the power to care for the mentally ill and, where necessary, the power \u201cto protect the community from the dangerous tendencies of some\u201d mentally ill persons, are among the numerous powers that remain with the States. <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a consequence, we have held that States may \u201ctake measures to restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill\u201d \u2014 including those who are sexually dangerous \u2014 provided that such commitments satisfy due process and other constitutional requirements. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U. S. 346, 363 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil-commitment laws that States have enacted under their <em>pa-rens patriae </em>and general police powers. Indeed, it is clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government\u2019s arguments urging its constitutionality, that \u00a7 4248 is aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence, not toward \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d any enumerated power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 587 (entitled \u201c[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual exploitation and violent crime\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00a7 102, <em>id., </em>at 590 (statement of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated \u201cto protect the public from sex offenders\u201d); Brief for United States 38-39 (asserting the Federal Government\u2019s power to <em>\u201cprotect the public from harm </em>that might result upon these prisoners' release, even when that harm might arise from conduct that is <em>otherwise beyond the general regulatory powers of the federal government\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual offenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a despicable act with untold consequences for the victim personally and society generally. See, <em>e. g., Kennedy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>554 U. S. 407, 455, n. 2, 468-469 (2008) (Auto, J., dissenting). But the Constitution does not vest in Congress the authority to protect society from every bad act that might befall it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (\u201c\u2018The question is not what power the Federal Government ought to have but what powers in fact have been given by the people\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936))).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In my view, this should decide the question. Section 4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress\u2019 power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress may act under that Clause only when its legislation \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d one of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Section 4248 does not execute <em>any </em>enumerated power. Section 4248 is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The Court perfunctorily genuflects to <em>McCulloch\u2019s </em>framework for assessing Congress' Necessary and Proper Clause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty it helps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor of a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that \u00a74248 is a \u201c\u2018necessary and proper\u2019\u201d adjunct to a jumble of <em>unenu-merated </em>\u201cauthorit[ies].\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 149. The Court\u2019s newly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause\u2019s plain text or with two centuries of our precedents interpreting it. It also raises more questions than it answers. Must each of the five considerations exist before the Court sustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What if the facts of a given ease support a finding of only four considerations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice, <em>which </em>three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this shift from the two-step <em>McCulloch </em>framework to this five-consideration approach warrants an explanation as to why <em>McCulloch </em>is no longer good enough and which of the five considerations will bear the most weight in future cases, assuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not, why all five are required.) The Court provides no answers to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">I begin with the first and last \u201cconsiderations\u201d in the Court\u2019s inquiry. <em>Ante, </em>at 133. The Court concludes that \u00a7 4248 is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority because that authority is \u201cbroad,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and because \u201cthe links between \u00a74248 and an enumerated Article I power are not too attenuated,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 146. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies, <em>McCulloch\u2019s </em>straightforward two-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">First, the Court describes Congress\u2019 lawmaking power under the Necessary and Proper Clause as \u201cbroad,\u201d relying on precedents that have upheld federal laws under the Clause after finding a \u201c \u2018rationa[l]\u2019 \u201d fit between the law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>an enumerated power. <em>Ante, </em>at 134 (quoting <em>Sabri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that this Court\u2019s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of latitude in selecting the means for \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d an end that is \u201clegitimate.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, <em>e. g., Jinks </em>v. <em>Richland County, </em>538 U. S. 456, 462-463 (2003) (citing <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these cases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit between means and ends matters only if the end is in fact <em>legitimate </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>only if it is one of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference owed to Congress in selecting means to further a legitimate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch\u2019s first step and fails carefully to examine whether the end served by \u00a7 4248 is actually one of those powers. See Part III-A-2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Second, instead of asking the simple question of what enumerated power \u00a74248 \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d at <em>McCul-loch\u2019s </em>first step, the Court surveys other laws Congress has enacted and concludes that, because \u00a7 4248 is related to those laws, the \u201clinks\u201d between \u00a74248 and an enumerated power are not \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d; hence, \u00a74248 is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority. <em>Ante, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>at 146. This unnecessarily confuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme, would result in an unwarranted expansion of federal power.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed authority to \u201ccriminalize conduct\u201d that interferes with enumerated powers; to \u201cimprison individuals who engage in that conduct\u201d; to \u201cenact laws governing [those] prisons\u201d; and to serve as a \u201ccustodian of its prisoners.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 137, 142. From this, the Court assumes that \u00a7 4248 must also be a valid exercise of congressional power because it is \u201c\u2018reasonably adapted\u2019\u201d to <em>those </em>exercises of Congress\u2019 incidental \u2014 and thus unenumerated \u2014 authorities. See <em>ante, </em>at 143 (concluding that \u201c\u00a74248 is \u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>ante, </em>at 149 (concluding that \u201cthe statute is a \u2018necessary and proper\u2019 means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others\u201d). But that is not the question. The Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact any law simply because it furthers <em>other laws </em>Congress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every federal statute \u201ccarries] into Execution\u201d one or more of the Federal Government's <em>enumerated </em>powers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal sentence satisfy this test because each helps to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d the enumerated powers that justify a criminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction. For example, Congress\u2019 enumerated power \u201c[t]o establish Post Offices and post Roads,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 7, would lack force or practical effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact criminal laws \u201cto punish those who steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d <em>McCulloch, supra, </em>at 417. Similarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that prisoners could escape or demand their release on the grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined them. See, <em>e. g., Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U. S. 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>(1976). Civil detention under \u00a74248, on the other hand, lacks any such connection to an enumerated power.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">After focusing on the relationship between \u00a7 4248 and several of Congress\u2019 implied powers, the Court finally concludes that the civil detention of a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d under \u00a74248 carries into execution the enumerated power that justified that person\u2019s arrest or conviction in the first place. In other words, the Court analogizes \u00a74248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await trial. But while those laws help to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of criminal sanctions on the inmate, \u00a74248 does not bear that essential characteristic for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">First, the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d contains no element relating to the subject\u2019s crime. See \u00a7\u00a7 4247(a)(5)-{6). It thus does not require a federal court to find any connection between the reasons supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power with which that person\u2019s criminal conduct interfered. As a consequence, \u00a74248 allows a court to civilly commit an individual without finding that he was ever charged with or convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence. \u00a7\u00a7 4248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical: The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals against whom \u00a74248 proceedings have been brought fit this description.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Tr. of Oral Arg. 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Second, \u00a74248 permits the term of federal civil commitment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>oner\u2019s sentence expires or the date on which the statute of limitations on an untried defendant\u2019s crime has run. The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a person at a time when the Government would lack jurisdiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that executes an enumerated power.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The statute this Court upheld in <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast. That statute authorized the Federal Government to exercise civil custody over a federal defendant declared mentally unfit to stand trial only \u201c \u2018until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4246 (1952 ed.)). Thus, that statute\u2019s \u201cend\u201d reasonably could be interpreted as preserving the Government\u2019s power to enforce a criminal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.), however, authorizes federal detention of a person even <em>after </em>the Government loses the authority to prosecute him for a federal crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Third, the definition of a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d relevant to \u00a74248 does not require the court to find that the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumerated power in the future. Although the Federal Government has no express power to regulate sexual violence generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscribing such conduct in special circumstances. All of these statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a connection to one of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers \u2014 such as interstate commerce, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 2252(a)(2) \u2014 or that limit the statute\u2019s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has plenary authority, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 2243(a). Section 4248, by contrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that the person is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d and presents a risk \u201cto others,\u201d \u00a7 4247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this sexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way that interferes with a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>law that executes an enumerated power or in a geographic location over which Congress has plenary authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a criminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under \u00a74248.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The remaining \u201cconsiderations\u201d in the Court\u2019s five-part inquiry do not alter this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">First, in a final attempt to analogize \u00a74248 to laws that authorize the Federal Government to provide care and treatment to prisoners while they await trial or serve a criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement of Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government has a \u201ccustodial interest\u201d in its prisoners, <em>ante, </em>at 149, and, thus, a broad \u201cconstitutional power to act in order to protect nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(and other) communities\u201d from the dangers they may pose,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>ante, </em>at 142. That citation is puzzling because federal authority derives from the Constitution, not the common law. In any event, nothing in the Restatement suggests that a common-law custodian has the powers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause \u201cbodily harm to others,\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 319, p. 129 (1963-1964), that duty terminates once the legal basis for custody expires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201c(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\">\u201c(b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7315, at 122.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Once the Federal Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction over a prisoner ends, so does any \u201cspecial relation[ship]\u201d between the Government and the former prisoner.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>For this reason, I cannot agree with Justice Auto that \u00a74248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress\u2019 power \u201cto protect the public from dangers created by the federal criminal justice and prison systems.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 157 (opinion concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant\u2019s \u201csexually dangerous\u201d propensities are not \u201ccreated by\u201d the fact of his incarceration or his relationship with the federal prison system. The fact that the Federal Government has the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of punishing him for a federal crime \u2014 sex-related or otherwise \u2014 does not provide the Government with the additional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that person.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Second, the Court describes \u00a74248 as a \u201cmodest\u201d expansion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedigree. <em>Ante, </em>at 137. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice could serve as a substitute for its constitutionality \u2014 and the Court admits that it cannot, <em>ibid. </em>\u2014 the Court overstates the relevant history.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Congress\u2019 first foray into this general area occurred in 1855, when it established St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital to provide treatment to \u201cinsane\u201d persons in the military and the District of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Congress was acting pursuant to <em>enumerated </em>powers when it took this step. See Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 17 (granting Congress plenary authority over the District of Columbia); Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to \u201cmake Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\u201d). This enactment therefore provides no support for Congress\u2019 claimed power to detain sexually dangerous persons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commitment of \u201cinsane\u201d persons charged with or convicted of a federal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a7 5-6, 11 Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212-213 (1881); Act of June 23,1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7,1882, 22 Stat. 330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did not authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the \u201cterm\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment,\u201d \u00a7\u00a72-3, 18 Stat. 252; see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569, 570-571 (1916); Act of May 13,1930, ch. 254, \u00a76, 46 Stat. 271, and thus shed no light on the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive regime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill persons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4246,4247 (1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in <em>Greenwood, </em>but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal Government could rely on that statute to detain a person in the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing criminal sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>As already noted, <em>Greenwood </em>upheld the commitment of a federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial on the narrow ground that the Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction over the defendant \u2014 its \u201cpower to prosecute for federal offenses\u2014 [wajs not exhausted,\u201d but rather \u201cpersist[edj\u201d in the form of a \u201cpending indictment.\u201d 350 U. S., at 375; see <em>supra, </em>at 171. The Court was careful to state that <em>\u201c[t]his </em>commitment, and therefore the legislation authorizing commitment <em>in the context of this case, </em>involve[d] an assertion of authority\u201d within \u201ccongressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\u201d <em>Greenwood, </em>350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstakingly limited its holding to \u201cthe narrow constitutional issue raised by th[at] order of commitment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The historical record thus supports the Federal Government\u2019s authority to detain a mentally ill person against whom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But it provides no justification whatsoever for reading the Necessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power to authorize the detention of persons without a basis for federal criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding \u00a74248\u2019s impact on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States. First, the Court and both concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the power to enact \u00a7 4248 because a long period of federal incarceration might \u201cseve[r]\u201d a sexually dangerous prisoner\u2019s \u201cclaim to \u2018legal residence\u2019 \u201d in any particular State, <em>ante, </em>at 143 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the prisoner without any \u201chome State to take charge\u201d of him upon release, <em>ante, </em>at 154 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); see <em>ante, </em>at 156 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that many federal prisoners, \u201cas a result of lengthy federal incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any State\u201d). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional authority to \u201ctake charge\u201d of a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>prisoner released within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that powers not delegated to the Federal Government are \u201creserved\u201d to the States, and to the people). In addition, the assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise that authority is, in my view, implausible. The Government stated at oral argument that its \u201cdefault position\u201d is to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR \u00a7 2.33(b) (2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue that a State has the power to refuse such a person domicile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that, in the absence of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4248, a State would take no action when informed by the BOP that a sexually dangerous federal prisoner was about to be released within its jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted in recent decades to protect communities from sex offenders,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of such an occurrence seems quite remote. But even in the event a State made such a decision, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that decision, and its consequences, to the state government alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Next, the Court submits that \u00a74248 does not upset the balance of federalism or invade the States\u2019 reserved powers because it \u201crequires accommodation of state interests\u201d by instructing the Attorney General to release a committed person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried if that State wishes to \u201c \u2018assume ... responsibility\u2019 \u201d for him. <em>Ante, </em>at 144 (emphasis deleted), 145 (quoting \u00a7 4248(d)). This right of first refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (\u201cIt is not the usual course that the State does take responsibility\u201d). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assurance that \u00a74248 preserves the principle of dual sovereignty \u2014 the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the Constitution \u2014 as the Necessary and Proper Clause requires.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 421; <em>Printz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress has the authority to provide for the civil detention of sexually dangerous persons, Congress \u201cis acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution,\u201d and \u201cmay impose its will on the States.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>501 U. S., at 460; see Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248\u2019s right of first refusal is thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of legislative grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Nevertheless, 29 States appear as <em>amici </em>and argue that \u00a7 4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not object to Congress retaining custody of \u201csexually dangerous persons\u201d after their criminal sentences expire because the cost of detaining such persons is \u201cexpensive\u201d \u2014 approximately $64,000 per year \u2014 and these States would rather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief for Kansas et al. 2; <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[S]ex offender civil commitment programs are expensive to operate\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 4 (\u201c[T]hese programs are expensive\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 8 (\u201c[T]here are very practical reasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex offender civil commitment program____ One such reason is the significant cost\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Congress\u2019 power, however, is fixed by the Constitution; it does not expand merely to suit the States\u2019 policy preferences, or to allow state officials to avoid difficult choices regarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the Federal Government power over \u201ccertain enumerated objects only,\u201d the Constitution \u201cleaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.\u201d The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The purpose of this design is to preserve the \u201cbalance of power between the States and the Federal Government... [that] protects] our fundamental liberties.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>469 U. S. 528, 572 (1985) (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U. S., at 181. It is the States\u2019 duty to act as the \u201cimmediate and visible guardian\u201d of those liberties because federal powers extend no further than those enumerated in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 17, at 169 (A. Hamilton). The Constitution gives States no more power to decline this responsibility than it gives them to infringe upon those liberties in the first instance. <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992) (\u201cFederalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Absent congressional action that is in accordance with, or necessary and proper to, an enumerated power, the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>protect citizens from violent crime, including acts of sexual violence, belongs solely to the States. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S., at 618 C\u2018[W]e can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime\u201d); see <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 426 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress has \u201cno general right to punish murder committed within any of the States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Not long ago, this Court described the Necessary and Proper Clause as \u201cthe last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional action.\u201d <em>Printz, supra, </em>at 923. Regrettably, today\u2019s opinion breathes new life into that Clause, and \u2014 the Court\u2019s protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, see <em>ante, </em>at 148 \u2014 comes perilously close to transforming the Necessary and Proper Clause into a basis for the federal police power that \u201cwe <em>always </em>have rejected,\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.

Other arguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have been lodged elsewhere. See, <em>e. g., Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>545 U. S. 1, 61 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the Necessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an \u201c\u2018obvious, simple, and direct relation\u2019\u201d to an exercise of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers and must not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty). But I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the analysis employed at <em>McCulloch\u2019s </em>second step, see <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, 4 </em>Wheat. 316 (1819), while the Court\u2019s decision today errs by skipping the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\"> <em>McCulloch </em>makes this point clear. As the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 146, <em>McCulloch </em>states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress\u2019 enumerated power to establish post offices and post roads \u201chas been inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,\u201d and, \u201cfrom this implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417. Contrary to the Court's interpretation, this dictum does not suggest that the relationship between Congress\u2019 implied power to punish postal crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to satisfy review under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead, <em>McCulloch </em>directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress\u2019 enumerated power \u201c\u2018to establish post offices and post roads.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(explaining that \u201cthe right to . . . punish those who rob [the mail] is not indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office and post road,\u201d but is \u201cessential to the beneficial exercise of th[at] power\u201d). More importantly, <em>McCulloch\u2019s </em>holding, as well as the holdings of this Court\u2019s subsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution one or more enumerated powers. <em>Id., </em>at 422 (upholding Congress\u2019 incorporation of a bank because it was a \u201cmeans ... to be employed only for the purpose of carrying into execution <em>the given powers\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); see <em>Sabri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U.

The Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to \u201cnearby (and other) communities.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 142. Moreover, the hospital was a <em>state </em>institution.
