The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted \u00a7 1132(g)(1) to require that a fee claimant be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d before he may seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>trary to \u00a7 1132(g)(l)\u2019s plain text. We hold instead that a court \u201cin its discretion\u201d may award fees and costs \u201cto either party,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>as long as the fee claimant has achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits,\u201d <em>Ruckelshaus </em>v. <em>Sierra Club, </em>463 U. S. 680, 694 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In 2000, while working as an executive assistant to the president of textile manufacturer Dan River, Inc., petitioner Bridget Hardt began experiencing neck and shoulder pain. Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with carpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her wrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working in January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability benefits from Dan River\u2019s Group Long-Term Disability Insurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers the Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a claimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and underwrites any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally approved Hardt\u2019s claim, telling her that final approval hinged on her performance in a functional capacities evaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal tunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in October 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt\u2019s medical history, observed her resulting physical limitations, and ultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount of sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance concluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the meaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability benefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance reversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally disabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore entitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt began experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves, including tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physicians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condition that increased her pain and decreased her physical capabilities over the ensuing months.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Administration for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. Her application included questionnaires completed by two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt\u2019s symptoms and stated the doctors\u2019 conclusion that Hardt could not return to full gainful employment because of her neuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the Social Security Administration granted Hardt\u2019s application and awarded her disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her Plan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month period. Reliance explained that under the Plan\u2019s terms, only individuals who are \u201ctotally disabled from all occupations\u201d were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that, based on its review of Hardt\u2019s records, Hardt was not \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by the Plan. Reliance also demanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset the disability benefits she had received from the Social Security Administration. (The Plan contains a provision coordinating benefits with Social Security payments.) Hardt paid Reliance the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She gave Reliance all of her medical records, the questionnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Administration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her physicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this material with another functional capacities evaluation. When Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation, it did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuropathic pain, even though it knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that Hardt had been diagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December 2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January 2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid because Hardt\u2019s efforts were \u201csubmaximal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 37a. One evaluator recorded that Hardt \u201crefused multiple tests ... for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation, Reliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation counselor to help it resolve Hardt\u2019s administrative appeal. The physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he reviewed some, but not all, of Hardt's medical records. Based on that review, the physician produced a report in which he opined that Hardt\u2019s health was expected to improve. His report, however, did not mention Hardt\u2019s pain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt\u2019s attending physicians had completed as part of her application for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabilitation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study (based on Hardt\u2019s health in 2003) that identified eight employment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After reviewing the physician\u2019s report, the labor market study, and the results of the 2003 functional capacities evaluation, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate Hardt\u2019s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this decision in March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt sued Reliance in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance violated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long-term disability benefits. See \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The court first rejected Reliance\u2019s request for summary judgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that \u201cRe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>liance\u2019s decision to deny benefits was based on incomplete information.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most prominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations to which Hardt had submitted had \u201cassessed the impact of neuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the reviewing physician\u2019s report \u201cwas itself incomplete\u201d; the basis for the physician\u2019s \u201cmedical conclusions [wa]s extremely vague and conelusory,\" <em>ibid., </em>and the physician had \u201cfailed to cite any medical evidence to support his conclusions,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 43a, or \u201cto address the treating physicians\u2019 contradictory medical findings,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 44a. The court also found that Reliance had \u201cimproperly rejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 45a, and had \u201cfurther ignored the substantial amount of pain medication Ms. Hardt\u2019s treating physicians had prescribed to her,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 46a. Accordingly, the court thought it \u201cclear that Reliance\u2019s decision to deny Ms. Hardt long-term disability benefits was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47a.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The District Court then denied Hardt's motion for summary judgment, which contended that Reliance\u2019s decision to deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In so doing, however, the court found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d in the record that \u201cMs. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to her neu-ropathy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48a. Although it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cit would be unwise to take this step without first giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the District Court\u2019s view, a remand to Reliance was warranted because \u201c[t]his case presents one of those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed to comply with the ERISA guidelines,\u201d meaning \u201cMs. Hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the court instructed \u201cReliance to act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s application by adequately considering all the evidence\u201d within 30 days; \u201c[otherwise, \u201d it warned, \u201cjudgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 49a.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Reliance did as instructed. After conducting that review, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term disability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Hardt then moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 1132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under the three-step framework that governed fee requests in ERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that framework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant is a \u201c\u2018prevailing party.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 15a-16a (quoting <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., </em>115 F. 3d 1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee claimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds to step two and \u201cdetermin[es] whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is appropriate\u201d by examining \u201cfive factors.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors suggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court \u201cmust review the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs requested and limit them to a reasonable amount.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 17a (citing <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Applying that framework, the District Court granted Hardt\u2019s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a prevailing party because the court\u2019s remand order \u201csanctioned a material change in the legal relationship of the parties by ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to which [Hardt] was entitled.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. The court recognized that the order did not \u201csanctio[n] a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>result on remand,\u201d but found that it \u201cquite clearly expressed the consequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its reconsideration in an expeditious manner.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 19a. Accordingly, the remand order \u201csignif [ied] that the court was displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance] had initially given to [Hardt\u2019s] claim, but was inclined to reserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a proper review of all of the medical evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court next concluded that a fees award was appropriate under the five-factor test, see <em>id., </em>at 22a-25a, and awarded $39,149 in fees and costs, <em>id., </em>at 25a-30a.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Reliance appealed the fees award, and the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court\u2019s order. According to the Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one in<em>quiry </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>she failed to establish that she was a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon, </em>under which a fee claimant qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d only if he has obtained an \u201c\u2018enforceable judgmen[t] on the merits\u2019\u201d or a \u201c \u2018court-ordered consent decre[e].\u2019 \u201d 336 Fed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting 532 U. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that because the remand order \u201cdid not require Reliance to award benefits to Hardt,\u201d it did \u201cnot constitute an \u2018enforceable judgment on the merits\u2019 as <em>Buckhannon </em>requires,\u201d thus precluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party status. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of two aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. First, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that \u00a7 1132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, did the Court of Appeals cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rectly identify the circumstances under which a fee claimant is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1)? We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. 1142 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Whether \u00a7 1132(g)(1) limits the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is a question of statutory construction. As in all such cases, we begin by analyzing the statutory language, \u201cassuming] that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Gross </em>v. <em>FBL Financial Services, Inc., </em>557 U. S. 167, 175 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory language according to its terms. <em>Carcieri </em>v. <em>Salazar, </em>555 U. S. 379, 387 (2009); <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>555 U. S. 113, 118 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Section 1132(g)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cIn any action under this subchapter (other than an action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in this provision. Nor does anything else in \u00a7 1132(g)(l)\u2019s text purport to limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Instead, \u00a7 1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cto <em>either </em>party.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">That language contrasts sharply with \u00a7 1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA actions under \u00a7 1145 (actions to recover delinquent employer contributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases, only plaintiffs who obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d may seek attorney\u2019s fees. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to include in \u00a7 1132(g)(1) an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d limit on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting statute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely resembles \u201cinventing] a statute rather than interpreting] one.\u201d <em>Pasquantino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 349, 359 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question, particularly given Reliance\u2019s concessions. See Brief for Respondent 9-10 (\u201cOn its face,\u201d \u00a7 1132(g)(1) \u201cdoes not expressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant be a \u2018prevailing party' before receiving attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). We therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to be eligible for an attorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We next consider the circumstances under which a court may award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g)(1). \u201cOur basic point of reference\u201d when considering the award of at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>torney\u2019s fees is the bedrock principle known as the \u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019 Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>463 U. S., at 683; see <em>id., </em>at 683-686; <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, </em>421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U. S., at 602-603; see also <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Kenny A., </em>559 U. S. 542, 550 (2010). Statutory changes to this rule take various forms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to award attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Others permit a \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d party<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or a \u201csuccessful\u201d litigant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to obtain fees. Still others authorize district courts to award attorney\u2019s fees where \u201cappropriate,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or simply vest district courts with \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule, we have most often considered statutes containing an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement. See, <em>e. g., Texas State Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Garland Independent School Dist., </em>489 U. S. 782, 792-793 (1989); <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U. S. 103, 109-114 (1992); <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>at 602-606; <em>Sole </em>v. <em>Wyner, </em>551 U. S. 74, 82-86 (2007). Our \u201cprevailing party\u201d precedents, however, do not govern the availability of fees awards under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), because this provision does not limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>at 252; see also <em>Gross, supra, </em>at 174 (cautioning courts \u201cconducting statutory interpretation ... \u2018not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>out careful and critical examination\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Federal Express Corp. </em>v. <em>Holowecki, </em>552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Instead, we interpret \u00a7 1132(g)(1) in light of our precedents addressing statutory deviations from the American Rule that do not limit attorney\u2019s fees awards to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In that line of precedents, <em>Ruckelshaus </em>is the principal case. There, the Court interpreted \u00a7 307(f) of the Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees \u201cwhenever it determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 7607(f). We began by noting that because nothing in \u00a7307(f)\u2019s text \u201cclear[ly] show[ed]\u201d that Congress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S., at 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating success to be eligible for a fees award under that section, <em>id., </em>at 686. We then concluded that by using the less stringent \u201cwhenever... appropriate\u201d standard instead of the traditional \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard, Congress had \u201cexpand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards from prevailing parties to <em>partially prevailing </em>parties \u2014 parties achieving <em>some success, </em>even if not major success.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 688. We thus held \u201cthat, absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for a federal court to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 307(f).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Applying the interpretive approach we employed in <em>Ruck-elshaus </em>to \u00a7 1132(g)(1), we first look to \u201cthe language of the section,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion ... to either party,\u201d \u00a7 1132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with such broad discretion are well known in the law, particularly in the attorney\u2019s fees context. See, <em>e. g., </em>n. 7, <em>supra; </em>see also <em>Perdue, </em>559 U. S., at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Equally well known, however, is the fact that a \u201cjudge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consistent with Circuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to guide its discretion in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1). See <em>supra, </em>at 249, and n. 1. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>these five factors bear no obvious relation to \u00a7 1132(g)(l)\u2019s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they are not required for channeling a court\u2019s discretion when awarding fees under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Instead, <em>Ruckelskaus </em>lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising the discretion that \u00a7 1132(g)(1) grants. As in the statute at issue in <em>Ruckelskaus, </em>Congress failed to indicate clearly in \u00a7 1132(g)(1) that it \u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and intuitive notions of fairness.\u201d 463 U. S., at 686. Accordingly, a fees claimant must show \u201csome degree of success on the merits\u201d before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), <em>id., </em>at 694. A claimant does not satisfy that requirement by achieving \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural victor[y],\u201d but does satisfy it if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the merits without conducting a \u201clengthy inquir[y] into the question whether a particular party\u2019s success was \u2018substantial\u2019 or occurred on a \u2018central issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 688, n. 9.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should govern fee requests under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), see Brief for Respondent 13-31, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it. Specifically, Reliance contends that a court order remanding an ERISA claim for further consideration can never constitute \u201csome success on the merits,\u201d even if such a remand results in an award of benefits. See <em>id., </em>at 34-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Reliance\u2019s argument misses the point, given the facts of this case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that \u201cthe plan administrator has failed to comply with the ERISA guidelines\u201d and \u201cthat Ms. Hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1133(2), 29 CFR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00a72560.503-l(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to win summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless found \u201ccompelling evidence that Ms. Hardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,\u201d and stated that it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor\u201d on her benefits claim, but declined to do so before \u201cfirst giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its\u201d statutorily mandated \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of that claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1133(2). Hardt thus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance \u201cto act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s application by adequately considering all the evidence\u201d within 30 days; \u201cOtherwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review, and consistent with the District Court\u2019s appraisal, Reliance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits she sought. App. 120a-123a.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more than \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural victory.\u201d Accordingly, she has achieved \u201csome success on the merits,\u201d and the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award Hardt attorney\u2019s fees in this case. Because these conclusions resolve this case, we need not decide today whether a remand order, without more, constitutes \u201csome success on the merits\u201d sufficient to make a party eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> These factors are: \u2018\u201c(1) the degree of opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting <em>Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Life Ins.

Some (a few only tentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion here that only prevailing parties are entitled to fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1). See, <em>e. g., Cottrill </em>v. <em>Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc., </em>100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1 1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>(\u201cCongress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a \u2018participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 <em>to the prevailing party\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Long Term Disability Plan for Salaried Employees of Champion Int\u2019l Corp. #506, </em>545 F. 3d 555, 564 (CA7 2008) (\u201cIn analyzing whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 in an ERISA case, a court should consider whether the losing party\u2019s position was justified and taken in good faith. However, we have held that a claimant who is awarded a remand in an ERISA case generally is not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the term\u201d (some internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins.

S. 680 (1983), should be given any special weight in the interpretation of this \u2014 or any other \u2014 different statutory provision. The outcome in that closely divided case turned, to a significant extent, on a judgment about how to read the legislative history of the provision in question. Compare <em>id., </em>at 686-693, with <em>id., </em>at 703-706 (Stevens, J., dissenting). I agree with the Court in this case that 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) does not impose a \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement; I agree, further, that the District Court acted well within its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to this petitioner. But I would examine the text, structure, and history of any other federal statute authorizing an award of fees before concluding that Congress intended the same approach under that statute as under this one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
