S. C. \u00a7 541, subject to the debtor\u2019s right to reclaim certain property as \u201cexempt,\u201d \u00a7 522(0. The Bankruptcy Code specifies the types of property debtors may exempt, \u00a7 522(b), as well as the maximum value of the exemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets, \u00a7 522(d). Property a debtor claims as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy estate \u201c[u]nless a party in interest\u201d objects. \u00a7522(0.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">This case presents an opportunity for us to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what constitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested party must object under \u00a7522(0- The issue is whether an interested party must object to a claimed exemption where, as here, the Code defines the property the debtor is authorized to exempt as an interest, the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular type of asset, and the debtor\u2019s schedule of exempt property accurately describes the asset and declares the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\u201d in that asset to be an amount within the limits that the Code prescribes. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinafter Schedule C). We hold that, in cases such as this, an interested party need not object to an exemption claimed in this manner in order to preserve the estate\u2019s ability to recover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the debtor expressly declared exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering business failed. She supported her petition with various schedules and statements, two of which are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bankruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of which become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on which the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>require debtors to list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt. The assets Reilly listed on Schedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other kitchen equipment that she described as \u201cbusiness equipment,\u201d and to which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718. App. 40a, 49a-55a.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in this equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code. Reilly claimed a \u201ctool[s] of the trade\u201d exemption of $1,850 in the equipment under \u00a7 522(d)(6), which permits a debtor to exempt his \u201caggregate interest, not to exceed [$1,850] in value, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of [his] trade.\u201d See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table). And she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in the equipment under \u00a7 522(d)(5), which, at the time she filed for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a \u201cwildcard\u201d exemption equal to the \u201cdebtor\u2019s aggregate interest in any property, not to exceed\u201d $10,225 \u201cin value.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See App. 58a. The total value of these claimed exemptions ($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on Schedules B and C as the equipment\u2019s estimated market value, see <em>id., </em>at 49a, 58a.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties to object to a debtor\u2019s claimed exemptions within 30 days after the conclusion of the creditors\u2019 meeting held pursuant to Rule 2003(a). See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b). If an interested party fails to object within the time allowed, a claimed exemption will exclude the subject property from the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>even if the exemption\u2019s value exceeds what the Code permits. See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 <em>522(1); Taylor </em>v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz, </em>503 U. S. 638, 642-643 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly\u2019s bankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions in her business equipment because the dollar value Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits that \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe. App. 163a. But because an appraisal revealed that the total market value of Reilly\u2019s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718 she claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the equipment\u2019s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to Reilly\u2019s creditors. <em>Id., </em>at 141a-143a.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Reilly opposed Schwab\u2019s motion. She argued that by equating on Schedule C the total value of the exemptions she claimed in the equipment with the equipment\u2019s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\u2019s full value, even if that amount turned out to be more than the dollar amount she declared, and more than the Code allowed. <em>Id., </em>at 165a. Citing \u00a7 <em>522(1), </em>Reilly asserted that because her Schedule C notified Schwab of her intent to exempt the full value of her business equipment, he was obliged to object if he wished to preserve the estate\u2019s right to retain any value in the equipment in excess of the $10,718 she estimated. Because Schwab did not object within the time prescribed by Rule 4003(b), Reilly asserted that the estate forfeited its claim to such value. <em>Id., </em>at 165a. Reilly further informed the Bankruptcy Court that exempting her business equipment from the estate was so important to her that she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>dismiss her bankruptcy case if doing so was the only way to avoid the equipment\u2019s sale at auction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The Bankruptcy Court denied both Schwab\u2019s motion to auction the equipment and Reilly\u2019s conditional motion to dismiss her case. See <em>In re Reilly, </em>403 B. R. 336 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Pa. 2006). Schwab sought relief from the District Court, arguing that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the debtor declares as the \u201cvalue of [the debtor\u2019s] claimed exemption\u201d in certain property is an amount within the limits the Code prescribes. The District Court rejected Schwab\u2019s argument, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See <em>In re Reilly, </em>534 F. 3d 173 (CA3 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her exemptions in her business equipment with the equipment\u2019s market value, Reilly \u201cindicate[d] the intent\u201d to exempt the equipment\u2019s full value. <em>Id., </em>at 174. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in <em>Taylor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\u201c[W]e believe this case to be controlled by <em>Taylor. </em>Just as we perceive it was important to the <em>Taylor </em>Court that the debtor meant to exempt the full amount of the property by listing 'unknown\u2019 as both the value of the property and the value of the exemption, it is important to us that Reilly valued the business equipment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>$10,718 and claimed an exemption in the same amount. Such an identical listing put Schwab on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property fully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">\u201c \u2018[A]n unstated premise\u2019 of <em>Taylor </em>was \u2018that a debtor who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is claiming the \u201cfull amount,\u201d whatever it turns out to be.\u2019\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 178-179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Relying on this \u201cunstated premise,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that Schwab\u2019s failure to object to Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions entitled Reilly to the equivalent of an in-kind interest in her business equipment, even though the value of that exemption exceeded the amount that Reilly declared on Schedule C and the amount that the Code allowed her to withdraw from the bankruptcy estate. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">As noted, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision adds to disagreement among the Circuits about what constitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested party must object under <em>\u00a7522(l).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. See 556 U. S. 1207 (2009). We conclude that the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach fails to account for the text of the relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our decision in <em>Taylor. </em>Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">The starting point for our analysis is the proper interpretation of Reilly\u2019s Schedule C. If we read the Schedule Reilly\u2019s way, she claimed exemptions in her business equipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus claimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected if he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the estate. If we read Schedule C Schwab\u2019s way, Reilly claimed valid exemptions to which Schwab had no duty to object. The Court of Appeals construed Schedule C Reilly\u2019s way and interpreted her claimed exemptions as improper, and therefore objectionable, even though their declared value was facially within the applicable Code limits. In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that trustees evaluating the validity of exemptions in cases like this cannot take a debtor\u2019s claim at face value, and specifically cannot rely on the fact that the amount the debtor declares as the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\u201d is within statutory limits. Instead, the trustee\u2019s duty to object turns on whether the interplay of various schedule entries supports an inference that the debtor \u201cintended\u201d to exempt a dollar value different than the one she wrote on the form. 534 F. 3d, at 178. This complicated view of the trustee\u2019s statutory obligation, and the strained reading of Schedule C on which it rests, is inconsistent with the Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The parties agree that this case is governed by \u00a7 522(0, which states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \u201cfile a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,\u201d and further states that \u201c[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.\u201d The parties further agree that the \u201clist\u201d to which \u00a7 522(0 refers is the \u201clist of property... claim[ed] as exempt\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>currently known as \u201cSchedule C.\u201d See Schedule C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties, like the Courts of Appeals, disagree about what information on Schedule C defines the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d for purposes of evaluating an exemption\u2019s propriety under \u00a7522(Z). Reilly asserts that the \u201cproperty claimed as. exempt\u201d is defined by reference to all the information on Schedule C, including the estimated market value of each asset in which the debtor claims an exempt interest. Schwab and the United States as <em>amicus curiae </em>argue that the Code specifically defines the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an interest, the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular asset, <em>not </em>as the asset itself. Accordingly, they argue that the value of the property claimed exempt, <em>i. e., </em>the value of the debtor\u2019s exempt interest in the asset, should be judged on the value the debtor assigns the interest, <em>not </em>on the value the debtor assigns the asset. The point of disagreement is best illustrated by the relevant portion of Reilly\u2019s Schedule C: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>According to Reilly, Schwab was required to treat the estimate of market value she entered in column 4 as part of her claimed exemption in identifying the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d under \u00a7522(7). See Brief for Respondent 22-28. Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that where, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her claimed exemptions in a certain asset (column 3) with her estimate of the asset's market value (column 4), she establishes the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as the full value of the asset, whatever that turns out to be. See <em>ibid. </em>Accordingly, Reilly argues that her Schedule C clearly put Schwab on notice that she \u201cintended\u201d to claim an exemption for the full value of her business equipment, and that Schwab\u2019s failure to oppose the exemption in a timely manner placed the full value of the equipment outside the estate\u2019s reach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Schedule C-Property Claimed as Exempt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">Description of Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"az0-dedup-0\">Specify Law Providing Each Exemption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alb-dedup-0\">Value of Claimed Exemption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACM\">Current Market Value of Property Without Deducting Exemptions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">Schedule B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aag-dedup-0\">Personal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axx\">Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKK\">See attached 11 U.

He simply disagrees with Reilly that this \u201cidentical listing put [him] on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property fully,\u201d regardless of whether its value exceeded the exemption limits the Code prescribes. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Schwab and <em>amicus </em>United States instead contend that the Code defines the \u201cproperty\u201d Reilly claimed as exempt under \u00a7522(Z) as an \u201cinterest\u201d whose value cannot exceed a certain dollar amount. Brief for Petitioner 20-26; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3-6; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12-18. Construing Reilly\u2019s Schedule C in light of this statutory definition, they contend that Reilly\u2019s claimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (i <em>e., </em>two interests in her business equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respectively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude from her estate under the Code provisions she referenced in column 2. See supra, at 780 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6)). Accordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>that Schwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in order to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\u2019s business equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly properly claimed as exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We agree. The portion of \u00a7 522(0 that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt\u201d unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the portion of \u00a7522(0 that defines the target of the objection, namely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object to the \u201clist of property that the debtor claims as exempt <em>under subsection (b).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That subsection, \u00a7 522(b), does <em>not </em>define the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d by reference to the estimated market value on which Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely. Brief for Respondent 22-23; 534 F. 3d, at 178. Section 522(b) refers only to property defined in \u00a7 522(d), which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as exempt. As we have recognized, most of these categories (and all of the categories applicable to Reilly\u2019s exemptions) define the \u201cproperty\u201d a debtor may \u201cclai[m] as exempt\u201d as the debtor\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d \u2014 up to a specified dollar amount \u2014 in the assets described in the category, <em>not </em>as the assets themselves. \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5)-(6); see also \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(1) \u2014 (4), (8); <em>Rousey </em>v. <em>Jacoway, </em>544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). Viewing Reilly\u2019s form entries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab and the United States that Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in her business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because the stated value of each interest, and thus of the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d was within the limits the Code allows.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Reilly\u2019s contrary view of Schwab\u2019s obligations under \u00a7522(Z) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the target of a trustee\u2019s objection \u2014 the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d \u2014 based on language in Schedule C and dictionary definitions of \u201cproperty,\u201d see Brief for Respondent 24-25, 40-41, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.* *<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we may look to dictionaries and the Bankruptcy Rules to determine the meaning of words the Code does not define, see, <em>e. g., Rousey, supra, </em>at 330, the Code\u2019s definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d in this case is clear. As noted above, \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6) define the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an \u201cinterest\u201d in Reilly\u2019s business equipment, <em>not </em>as the equipment <em>per se. </em>Sections 522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to exempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and thus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is below a particular dollar amount.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is the case here, and Schwab was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>to rely upon these provisions in evaluating whether Reilly\u2019s exemptions were objectionable under the Code. See <em>Lamie </em>v. <em>United States Trustee, </em>540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004); <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N. A., </em>530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000). The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary holding not only fails to account for the Code\u2019s definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt.\u201d It also fails to account for the provisions in \u00a7 522(d) that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or in full regardless of value. See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(9) (professionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability benefits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts). We decline to construe Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions in a manner that elides the distinction between these provisions and provisions such as \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6), see, <em>e. g., Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001), particularly based upon an entry on Schedule C \u2014 Reilly\u2019s estimate of her equipment\u2019s market value \u2014 to which the Code does not refer in defining the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>For all of these reasons, we conclude that Schwab was entitled to evaluate the propriety of the claimed exemptions based on three, and only three, entries on Reilly\u2019s Schedule C: the description of the business equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled \u201cvalue of claimed exemption.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, we do not render the market value estimate on Reilly\u2019s Schedule C superfluous. We simply confine the estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may have value beyond the dollar amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose full value may not be available for exemption because a portion of the interest is, for example, encumbered by an unavoidable lien. See, <em>e. g., </em>3 W. Norton <em>&amp; </em>W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice \u00a7 56:7 (3d ed. 2009); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16; Dept, of Justice, Executive Office for U. S. Trustees, Handbook for Chapter 7 Trustees, p. 8-1 (2005), http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/private_ trustee / library /chapter07 / docs / 7handbookl008 / Ch7_ Handbookpdf (as visited June 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). As noted, most assets become property of the estate upon commencement of a bankruptcy case, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 541, and exemptions represent the debtor\u2019s attempt to reclaim those assets or, more often, certain interests in those assets, to the creditors\u2019 detriment. Accordingly, it is at least useful for a trustee to be able to compare the value of the claimed exemption (which typically represents the debtor\u2019s interest in a particular asset) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the asset\u2019s estimated market value (which belongs to the estate subject to any valid exemption) without having to consult separate schedules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Our interpretation of Schwab\u2019s statutory obligations is not only consistent with the governing Code provisions; it is also consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions. Congress has permitted debtors to exempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for more than two centuries. See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19, \u00a7 5, 2 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>23.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Throughout these periods, debtors have validly exempted property based on forms that required the debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without also estimating the market value of the asset in which the debtor claimed the exempt interest. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 7 (citing Sup. Ct. Bkrtcy. Form 20 (1877)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, it was not until 1991 that Schedule B-4 was redesignated as Schedule C and amended to require the estimate of market value on which Reilly so heavily relies. See Schedule C. This amendment was not occasioned by legislative changes that altered the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cthe property claimed as exempt\u201d in this case as an \u201cinterest,\u201d not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in Reilly\u2019s business equipment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with Schwab and the United States that this recent amendment to the exemption form does not compel Reilly\u2019s view of Schwab\u2019s statutory obligations, or render the claimed exemptions in this ease objectionable under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Code.

See 534 F. 3d, at 178. <em>Taylor </em>does not rest on what the debtor \u201cmeant\u201d to exempt. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Rather, <em>Taylor </em>applies to the face of a debtor\u2019s claimed exemption the Code provisions that compel reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The debtor in <em>Taylor, </em>like the debtor here, filed a schedule of exemptions with the Bankruptcy Court on which the debtor described the property subject to the claimed exemption, identified the Code provision supporting the exemption, and listed the dollar value of the exemption. Critically, however, the debtor in <em>Taylor </em>did <em>not, </em>like the debtor here, state the value of the claimed exemption as a specific dollar amount at or below the limits the Code allows. Instead, the debtor in <em>Taylor </em>listed the value of the exemption itself as \u201c$ <em>unknown\u201d:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Schedule B-4. -Property Claimed Exempt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALd\">Type of Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A08\">Location, Description, and, So Far as Relevant to the Claim of Exemption, Present Use of Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKC\">Specify the Statute Creating the Exemption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"atd-dedup-0\">Value Claimed Exempt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMn\">Proceeds from lawsuit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANc\">Winn v.

C. 522(b)(d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al6\">\n<em>unknown</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">The interested parties in <em>Taylor </em>agreed that this entry rendered the debtor\u2019s claimed exemption objectionable on its face because the exemption concerned an asset (lawsuit proceeds) that the Code did not permit the debtor to exempt beyond a specific dollar amount. See 503 U. S., at 642. Accordingly, although this case and <em>Taylor </em>both concern the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to object to a claimed exemption within the time specified by Rule 4003, the question arose in <em>Taylor </em>on starkly different facts. In <em>Taylor, </em>the question concerned a trustee\u2019s obligation to object to the debtor\u2019s entry of a \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d that was <em>not </em>plainly within the limits the Code allows. In this case, the opposite is true. The amounts Reilly listed in the Schedule C column titled \u201cValue of Claimed Exemption\u201d <em>are </em>facially within the limits the Code prescribes and raise no warning flags that warranted an objection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>supra, </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Taylor </em>supports this conclusion. In holding otherwise, the Court of Appeals focused on what it described as <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>\u201c'unstated premise\u201d\u2019 that '\"a debtor who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is claiming the \u201cfull amount,\u201d whatever it turns out to be.\u2019\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 179. But <em>Taylor </em>does not rest on this premise. It establishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount the debtor lists as the \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d is not within statutory limits, a test the value ($ unknown) in <em>Taylor </em>failed, and the values ($8,868 and $1,850) in this ease pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We adhere to this test. Doing otherwise would not only depart from <em>Taylor </em>and ignore the presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Budd, </em>144 U. S. 154, 163 (1892); it would also require us to expand the statutory definition of \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d and the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a claimed exemption. Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised. As evidenced by the differences between Reilly\u2019s Schedule C and the schedule in <em>Taylor, </em>preprinted bankruptcy schedules change over time. Basing the definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d and thus an interested party\u2019s obligation to object under \u00a7 522(0, on inferences that party must draw from evolving forms, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code, would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to provide.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For all of these reasons, we take Reilly\u2019s exemptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>at face value and find them unobjectionable under the Code, so the objection deadline we enforced in <em>Taylor </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In a final effort to defend the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, Reilly asserts that her approach to \u00a7 522(Z) is necessary to vindicate the Code\u2019s goal of giving debtors a fresh start, and to further its policy of discouraging trustees and creditors from sleeping on their rights. See Brief for Respondent 21, 55-68. Although none of Reilly\u2019s policy arguments can overcome the Code provisions or the aspects of <em>Taylor </em>that govern this case, our decision fully accords with all of the policies she identifies. We agree that \u201cexemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel of the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a 'fresh start.\u2019\u201d Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting <em>Rousey, </em>544 U. S., at 325); see <em>Marrama </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank of Mass., </em>549 U. S. 365, 367 (2007). We disagree that this policy required Schwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on pain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\u2019s business equipment beyond the value of the interest she declared exempt. This approach threatens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">As we emphasized in <em>Rousey, </em>\u201c[t]o help the debtor obtain a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to <em>withdraw from the estate </em>certain <em>interests in </em>property, such as his car or home, <em>up to certain values.\u201d </em>544 U. S., at 325 (emphasis added). The Code limits exemptions in this fashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available to his creditors. See \u00a7 522(b)(1). Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors, and it is not for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>alter this balance by requiring trustees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those that govern an exemption\u2019s validity under the Code. See <em>Lamie, </em>540 U. S., at 534, 538; Hartford, 530 U. S., at 6; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Reilly nonetheless contends that our approach creates perverse incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on their rights. See Brief for Respondent 64, n. 10, 67-69. Again, we disagree. Where a debtor intends to exempt nothing more than an interest worth a specified dollar amount in an asset that is not subject to an unlimited or in-kind exemption under the Code, our approach will ensure clear and efficient resolution of competing claims to the asset\u2019s value. If an interested party does not object to the claimed interest by the time the Rule 4003 period expires, title to the asset will remain with the estate pursuant to \u00a7 541, and the debtor will be guaranteed a payment in the dollar amount of the exemption. If an interested party timely objects, the court will rule on the objection and, if it is improper, allow the debtor to make appropriate adjustments.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Where, as here, it is important to the debtor to exempt the full market value of the asset or the asset itself, our decision will encourage the debtor to declare the value of her claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope of the exemption clear, for example, by listing the exempt value as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201cfull fair market value (FMV)\u201d or \u201c100% of FMV.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such a declaration will encourage the trustee to object promptly to the exemption if he wishes to challenge it and preserve for the estate any value in the' asset beyond relevant statutory limits.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If the trustee fails to object, or if the trustee objects and the objection is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the full value of the asset. If the trustee objects and the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the portion of the exemption that exceeds the statutory allowance, or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with her creditors to permit the exemption. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 1009(a). Either re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>suit will facilitate the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the debtor (and the debtor\u2019s creditors) to achieve a fresh start free of the finality and clouded-title concerns Reilly describes. See Brief for Respondent 57-59 (arguing that \u201c[u]nder [Schwab\u2019s] interpretation of Rule 4003(b), a debtor would never have the certainty of knowing whether or not he or she may keep her exempted property until the case had ended\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 66.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">For all of these reasons, the policy considerations Reilly cites support our approach. Where, as here, a debtor accurately describes an asset subject to an exempt interest and on Schedule C declares the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\u201d as a dollar amount within the range the Code allows, interested parties are entitled to rely upon that value as evidence of the claim\u2019s validity. Accordingly, we hold that Schwab was not required to object to Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions in her business equipment in order to preserve the estate\u2019s right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>value of the exempt interest. In reaching this conclusion, we express no judgment on the merits of, and do not foreclose the courts from entertaining on remand, procedural or other measures that may allow Reilly to avoid auction of her business equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> The 1994 version of 11 U.

See 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (Table). In 2007 and 2010 the limits were again increased.

But the sentimental value of the property cannot drive our decision in this case, because sentimental value is not a basis for construing the Bankruptcy Code. Because the Code imposes limits on exemptions, many debtors who seek to take advantage of the Code are, no doubt, put to the similarly difficult choice of parting with property of \u201cextraordinary sentimental value.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 152a-153a; see <em>infra, </em>at 791-794.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\"> Compare <em>In re Williams, </em>104 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA4 1997) (holding that interested parties have no duty to object to a claimed exemption where the dollar amount the debtor assigns the exemption is facially within the range the Code allows for the type of property in issue); <em>In re Wick, </em>276 F. 3d 412 (CA8 2002) (employing reasoning similar to <em>Williams, </em>but stopping short of articulating a clear rule), with <em>In re Green, </em>31 F. 3d 1098, 1100 (CA11 1994) (\u201c[A] debtor who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is claiming the [asset\u2019s] \u2018full amount,\u2019 whatever it turns out to be\u201d); <em>In re Anderson, </em>377 B.

See, <em>e. g., Rousey, </em>544 U. S., at 325. It also accords with bankruptcy court decisions holding that where, as here, a debtor claims an exemption pursuant to provisions that (like \u00a7 522(d)(6)) permit the debtor to exclude from the estate only an \u201cinterest\u201d in certain property, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201cproperty\u201d that becomes exempt absent objection, \u00a7 <em>522(1), </em>is only the \u201cpartial interest\u201d claimed as exempt and not \u201cthe asset as a whole,\u201d <em>e. g., In re Soost, </em>262 B. R. 68, 72 (Bkrtey. App. Panel CA8 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\"> The dissent\u2019s approach does not avoid these concerns. The dissent insists that \u201ca debtor\u2019s market valuation [of the equipment in which she claims an exempt interest] is an essential factor in determining the nature of the \u2018interest\u2019 [the] debtor lists as exempt\u201d (and thus in determining whether the claimed exemption is objectionable), because \u201cwithout comparing [the debtor\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemption\u201d the trustee \u201ccould not comprehend whether [the debtor] claimed a monetary or an in-kind \u2018interest\u2019 in [the] equipment.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 803, n. 9. This argument overlooks the fact that there is another way the trustee could discern from the \u201cface of the debtor\u2019s filings,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 801, n. 6, whether the debtor claimed as exempt a \u201cmonetary or an in-kind \u201cinterest\u2019 in\u201d her equipment, <em>post, </em>at 803, n. 9: The trustee could simply consult the Code provisions the debtor listed as governing the exemption in question. Here, those provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6), expressly describe the exempt interest as an \u201cinterest\u201d \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a specified dollar amount. Accordingly, it was entirely appropriate for Schwab to view Reilly\u2019s schedule entries as exempting an interest in her business equipment in the (declared and unobjectionable) amounts of $1,850 and $8,868. Viewing the entries otherwise, <em>i. e., </em>as exempting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>equipment in kind or in full no matter what its dollar value, would unnecessarily treat the exemption as violating the limits imposed by the Code provisions that govern it, as well as ignore the distinction between those provisions and the provisions that \u201cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the property in full without any cap on value,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 801, n. 5. And it would do all of this based on information (identical dollar amounts in columns 3 and 4 of Schedule C) that Schwab and one of his <em>amici </em>say often result from a default setting in commercial bankruptcy software. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 15; Brief for National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees 13, n. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\"> The dissent\u2019s argument that the estimate plays a greater role, and is \u201cvital,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 801, to determining whether the value a debtor assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (here, an interest in certain business equipment) is objectionable, see <em>post, </em>at 801-802, lacks statutory support because the governing Code provisions phrase the exemption limit as a simple dollar amount. The dissent\u2019s view, see <em>post, </em>at 800-803, might be plausible if the Code stated that the debtor could exempt an interest in her equipment \u201cnot to exeeed\u201d a certain <em>percentage </em>of the equipment\u2019s market value, because then it might be necessary to \u201ccomparte] [the debt- or\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemption\u201d to determine the exemption\u2019s propriety. <em>Post, </em>at 803, n. 9. But the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms. Moreover, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent relies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset\u2019s full value, the dissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from relying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries. According to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should assume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she believes to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to exempt an interest \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain dollar amount, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 522(d)(6), but <em>also </em>that the debtor would continue to claim the asset\u2019s full value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point that would cause her claim to violate the Code. The schedule entries themselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions they invoke undercut it. The evidence that the debtor in this case would have chosen that course is external to her exemption schedule. See, <em>e. g., supra, </em>at 776-777 (citing statements in Reilly\u2019s motion to dismiss); <em>post, </em>at 798, n. 3, 800 (same). And in the ordinary case, particularly if the equivalent entries the dissent relies upon result from a software default, see n. 10, <em>supra, </em>there is no reason to assume that a debtor would want to violate the Code or jeopardize other exemptions if her market value estimate turns out to be wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b835-5\"> See also Act of Aug. 19,1841, ch. 9, \u00a73, 5 Stat. 442; Act of Mar. 2,1867, ch. 176, \u00a7 11, 14 Stat. 521, amended by Act of June 22, 1874, 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 182; Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, \u00a76, 30 Stat. 548, 11 U.

We engage the point only because Reilly suggests that the 1991 schedule revisions requiring debtors to provide such an estimate on the schedule of \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d means that the estimate must be viewed as part of the exemption and is therefore subject to the Rule.

S. 57, 62 (1998)). This argument misses the mark for two reasons. First, the only burdens our conclusion imposes are burdens the Code itself prescribes, specifically, the burdens the Code places on debtors to state their claimed exemptions accurately and to conform such claims to statutory limits. Second, and in any event, <em>Geiger </em>and the other cases Reilly cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>emphasize in the discharge context the importance of limiting exceptions to discharge to \u201cthose plainly expressed,\u201d a principle that supports our approach here. <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> We disagree that Reilly\u2019s approach to exemptions would more efficiently dispose of competing claims to the asset. On Reilly\u2019s view, a trustee would be encouraged (if not obliged) to object to claims to exempt a specific dollar amount of interest in an asset whenever the value of the exempt interest equaled the debtor\u2019s estimate of the asset\u2019s market value. Where the debtor genuinely intended to claim nothing more than the face value of the exempt interest (which is rational if a debtor wishes to ensure that his aggregate exemptions remain within statutory limits), such an approach would engender needless objections and litigation, particularly if the equation that would precipitate the objection often results from, a default software entry.

As the United States observes, Schwab did not do so in this case with respect to certain assets (perishable foodstuffs from Reilly\u2019s commercial kitchen) that could not be readily sold. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>28, n. 7 (explaining that Schwab could have objected to Reilly\u2019s claim of a wildcard exemption for an interest in the food totaling $2,306 because this claim, combined with her wildcard claims for an interest of $8,868 in her business equipment and interests totaling $26 in her bank accounts, placed the total value of the interests she claimed exempt under the wildcard provision $975 above then-applicable limits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\"> Reilly\u2019s clouded-title argument arises only if one accepts her flawed conception of the exemptions in this case. According to Reilly, \u201conce the thirty-day deadline passed without objection\u201d to her claim, she was \u201centitled to know that she would emerge from bankruptcy with her cooking equipment intact.\u201d Brief for Respondent 57. There are two problems with this argument. First, it assumes that the property she claimed as exempt was the full value of the equipment. That assumption is incorrect for the reasons we explain. Second, her argument assumes that a claim to exempt the full value of the equipment would, if unopposed, entitle her to the equipment itself as opposed to a payment equal to the equipment\u2019s full value. That assumption is at least questionable. Section 541 is clear that title to the equipment passed to Reilly\u2019s estate at the commencement of her case, and \u00a7\u00a7 522(d)(5) and (6) are equally clear that her reclamation right is limited to exempting an interest in the equipment, not the equipment itself Accordingly, it is far from obvious that the Code would \u201centitle\u201d Reilly to clear title in the equipment even if she claimed as exempt a \u201cfull\u201d or \u201c100%\u201d interest in it (which she did not). Of course, it is likely that a trustee who fails to object to such a claim would have little incentive to do anything but pass title in the asset to the debtor. But that does not establish the statutory entitlement Reilly claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b843-8\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"A__\">with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">In Chapter 7 bankruptcies, debtors must surrender to the trustee-in-bankruptcy all their assets, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 541, but may reclaim for themselves exempt property, \u00a7 522. Within 30 days after the meeting of creditors, the trustee or a creditor may file an objection to the debtor\u2019s designation of property as exempt. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proe. 4003(b). Absent timely objection, \u201cproperty claimed [by the debtor] as exempt... is exempt.\u201d \u00a7522(Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">The trustee in this case, petitioner William G. Schwab, maintains that the obligation promptly to object to exemption claims extends only to the qualification of an asset as exemptible, not to the debtor\u2019s valuation of the asset. Respondent Nadejda Reilly, the debtor-in-bankruptcy, urges that the timely objection requirement applies not only to the debtor\u2019s designation of an asset as exempt; the requirement applies as well, she asserts, to her estimate of the asset\u2019s market value. That is so, she reasons, because the asset\u2019s current dollar value is critical to the determination whether she may keep the property intact and outside bankruptcy, or whether the trustee, at any time during the course of the proceedings, may sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The Court holds that challenges to the debtor\u2019s valuation of exemptible assets need not be made within the 30-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>period allowed for \u201cobjection[s] to the list of property claimed as exempt.\u201d Rule 4008(b). Instead, according to the Court, no time limit constrains the trustee\u2019s (or a creditor\u2019s) prerogative to place at issue the debtor\u2019s evaluation of the property as folly exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The Court\u2019s decision drastically reduces Rule 4003\u2019s governance, for challenges to valuation have been, until today, the most common type of objection leveled against exemption claims. See 9 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 4003.04, p. 4003-15 (rev. 15th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Collier) (\u201cNormally, objections to exemptions will focus primarily on issues of valuation.\u201d). In addition to departing from the prevailing understanding and practice, the Court\u2019s decision exposes debtors to protracted uncertainty concerning their right to retain exempt property, thereby impeding the \u201cfresh start\u201d exemptions are designed to foster. In accord with the courts below, I would hold that a debtor\u2019s valuation of exempt property counts and becomes conclusive absent a timely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Nadejda Reilly is a cook who operated a one-person catering business. Unable to cover her debts, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition appending all required schedules and statements. Relevant here, her filings included a form captioned \u201cSchedule B - Personal Property,\u201d which called for enumeration of \u201call personal property of the debtor of whatever kind.\u201d App. 40a. On that all-encompassing schedule, Reilly listed \u201cbusiness equipment,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>her kitchen equipment, with a current market value of $10,718. <em>Id., </em>at 49a.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Reilly also filed the more particular form captioned \u201cSchedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 56a. Schedule C contained four columns, the first headed \u201cDescription of Property\u201d; the second, \u201cSpecify Law Providing Each Exemption\u201d; the third, \u201cValue of Claimed Exemption\u201d; and the fourth, \u201cCurrent Market Value of Property Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Deducting Exemptions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 57a. In the first column of Schedule C, Reilly wrote, as she did in Schedule B\u2019s description-of-property column: \u201cSee attached list of business equipment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 58a. On the list appended to Schedules B and C, Reilly set out by hand a 31-item inventory of her restaurant-plus-catering-venture equipment. Next to each item, <em>e. g., </em>\u201cDough Mixer,\u201d \u201cGas stove,\u201d \u201cHood,\u201d she specified, first, the purchase price and, next, \u201cToday\u2019s Market Value,\u201d which added up to $10,718 for the entire inventory. <em>Id., </em>at <em>51a~55a}</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">As the laws securing exemption of her kitchen equipment, Reilly specified in the second Schedule C column, \u00a7 522(d)(6), the exemption covering trade tools, and \u00a7 522(d)(5), the \u201cwild-card\u201d exemption. <em>Id., </em>at 58a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the value-of-claimed-exemption column, she listed $1,850, then the maximum trade-tools exemption, and $8,868, drawn from her wildcard exemption, amounts adding up to $10,718. <em>Ibid. </em>And in the fourth, current-market-value, column, she recorded $10,718, corresponding to the total market value she had set out in her inventory and reported in Schedule B. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Before the 30-day clock on filing objections had begun to run, an appraiser told Schwab that Reilly\u2019s equipment was worth at least $17,000. Brief for Petitioner 15; App. 164a. Nevertheless, Schwab did not object to the $10,718 market value Reilly attributed to her business equipment in Schedule C and the attached inventory. Instead, he allowed the limitations period to lapse and then moved, unsuccessfully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>for permission to sell the equipment at auction. <em>Id., </em>at 141a-143a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">From Reilly\u2019s filings, the Bankruptcy Judge found it evident that Reilly had claimed the property itself, not its dollar value, as exempt. <em>Id., </em>at 168a-169a (\u201cI know there\u2019s an argument. . . that . . . the property identified as exempt is really the [valuation] column, <em>[i. e., </em>$10,718,] but that\u2019s not what the forms say. The forms say property declared as exempt and to see attached list. So, they\u2019re exempting all the property. ... If the Trustee believes that ... all the property cannot be exempt, [he] should object to it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The District Court and Court of Appeals similarly concluded that, by listing the identical amount, $10,718, as the property\u2019s market value and the value of the claimed exemptions, Reilly had signaled her intention to safeguard all of her kitchen equipment from inclusion in the bankruptcy estate. <em>In re Reilly, </em>403 B. R. 336, 338-339 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Pa. 2006); <em>In re Reilly, </em>534 F. 3d 173, 178 (CA3 2008). Both courts looked to \u00a7 522(0 and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(b), which state, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201cThe debtor shall file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt .... Unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.\u201d \u00a7 <em>522(1).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">\u201cA party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under \u00a7 341(a) is con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>eluded .... The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections if, before the time to object expires, a party in interest files a request for an extension.\u201d' Rule 4003(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Schwab having filed no objection within the allowable 30 days, each of the tribunals below ruled that the entire inventory of Reilly\u2019s business equipment qualified as exempt in full. App. 168a; 403 B. R., at 339; 534 F. 3d, at 178. The leading treatise on bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals noted, <em>id., </em>at 180, n. 4, is in accord:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cNormally, if the debtor lists property as exempt, that listing is interpreted as a claim for exemption of the debtor\u2019s entire interest in the property, and the debtor\u2019s valuation of that interest is treated as the amount of the exemption claimed. Were it otherwise \u2014 that is, if the listing were construed to claim as exempt only that portion of the property having the value stated \u2014 the provisions finalizing exemptions if no objections are filed would be rendered meaningless. The trustee or creditors could [anytime] claim that the debtor\u2019s interest in the property was greater than the value claimed as exempt and [then] object to the debtor exempting his or her entire interest in the property after the deadline for objections had passed.\u201d 9 Collier \u00b6 4003.02[1], pp. 4003-4 to 4003-5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Agreeing with the courts below, I would hold that Reilly, by her precise identification of the exempt property, and her specification of $10,718 as both the current market value of her kitchen equipment and the value of the claimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She claimed as exempt the listed property itself \u2014 not the dollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by Schwab might yield. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Because neither Schwab nor any creditor lodged a timely objection, the listed property became exempt, reclaimed as property of the debtor, and therefore outside the bankruptcy estate the trustee is charged to administer.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7522(0, Reilly filed a list of property she claimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy. Her filing left no doubt that her exemption claim encompassed her entire inventory of kitchen equipment. Schwab, in fact, was fully aware of the nature of the claim Reilly asserted. At the meeting of creditors, Reilly reiterated that she sought to keep the equipment in her possession; she would rather discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding, she made plain, than lose her equipment. See supra, at 798, n. 3. Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) requires the trustee, if he contests the debtor\u2019s exemption claim in whole or part, to file an objection within 30 days after the meeting of creditors. Absent a timely objection, \u201cthe property claimed as exempt ... is exempt.\u201d \u00a7 522(0; Rule 4003. That prescription should be dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The Court holds, however, that Schwab was not obliged to file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed, and indeed could auction off her cooking equipment anytime prior to the administrative closing of the bankruptcy estate. In so holding, the Court decrees that no objection need be made to a debtor\u2019s valuation of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">To support the conclusion that Rule 4003\u2019s timely objection requirement does not encompass the debtor\u2019s estimation of her property\u2019s market value, the Court homes in on the language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to a monetary cap.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those prescriptions, the Court points out, \u201cdefine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the \u2018property\u2019 a debtor may \u2018clai[m] as exempt\u2019 as the debt- or\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019 \u2014 up to a specified dollar amount \u2014 in the assets described in the category, <em>not </em>as the assets themselves.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 782. So long as a debtor values her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below the statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its-face permissible no matter the market value she ascribes to the asset. To evaluate the propriety of Reilly\u2019s declared \u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes, Schwab was obliged promptly to inspect \u201cthree, and only three, entries on Reilly\u2019s Schedule C: the description of the business equipment. ..; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled \u2018value of claimed exemption.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 785.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The Court\u2019s account, however, shuts from sight the vital part played by the fourth entry on Schedule C \u2014 current mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ket value \u2014 when a capped exemption is claimed. A debtor who estimates a market value <em>below </em>the cap, and lists an identical amount as the value of her claimed exemption, thereby signals that her aim is to keep the listed property in her possession, outside the estate-in~bankruptcy. In contrast, a debtor who estimates a market value <em>above </em>the cap, and above the value of her claimed exemption, thereby recognizes that she cannot shelter the property itself and that the trustee may seek to sell it for whatever it is worth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Schedule C\u2019s final column, in other words, alerts the trustee whether the debtor is claiming a right to retain the listed property itself as her own, a right secured to her if the trustee files no timely objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Because an asset\u2019s market value is key to determining the character of the interest the debtor is asserting in that asset, Rule 4003(b) is properly read to require objections to valuation within 30 days, just as the Rule requires timely objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tions to the debtor\u2019s description of the property, the asserted legal basis for the exemption, and the claimed value of the exemption. See 4 Collier \u00b6 522.05[1], p. 522-28 (rev. 15th ed. 2005) (\u201c[T]o evaluate the propriety of the debtor\u2019s claim of exemption,\u201d trustees need the information in all four columns of Schedule C; \u201c[market] value\u201d is \u201cessential\u201d to judging whether the claim is proper because \u201c[exemption provisions often are limited according to . . .

See, <em>e. g., Burling-ham </em>v. <em>Crouse, </em>228 U. S. 459, 473 (1913) (Bankruptcy provisions \u201cmust be construed\u201d in light of policy \u201cto give the bankrupt a fresh start.\u201d). See also <em>Rousey </em>v. <em>Jacoway, </em>544 U.

As \u201cthere can be no possibility of further objection to the exemptions\u201d after this period elapses, the principal bankruptcy treatise observes, \u201cif the debtor is not yet in possession of the property claimed as exempt, it should be turned over to [her] at this time to effectuate fully the fresh start purpose of the exemptions.\u201d 9 Collier \u00b6 4003.03[3], p. 4003-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">With the benefit of closure, and the certainty it brings, the debtor may, at the end of the 30 days, plan for her future secure in the knowledge that the possessions she has exempted in their entirety are hers to keep. See 534 F. 3d, at 180. If she has reclaimed her car from the estate, for example, she may accept a job not within walking distance. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2-3 (hereinafter NACBA Brief). Or if she has exempted her kitchen equipment, she may launch a new catering venture. See App. 138a (Reilly \u201cwishe[d] to continue in restaurant and catering as her occupation\u201d postbankruptcy.).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">By permitting trustees to challenge a debtor\u2019s valuation of exempted property anytime before the administrative closing of the bankruptcy estate, the Court casts a cloud of uncertainty over the debtor\u2019s use of assets reclaimed in full. If the trustee gains a different opinion of an item\u2019s value months, even years, after the debtor has filed her bankruptcy petition,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he may seek to repossess the asset, auction it off, and hand the debtor a check for the dollar amount of her claimed exemption.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With this threat looming until the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ministrative closing of the bankruptcy estate, \u201c[h]ow can debtors reasonably be expected to restructure their affairs\u201d?

(\u201cIf the assets sought to be exempted by the debtor were not valued at a date early in the bankruptcy proceeding, neither the debtor nor the creditors would know who had the right to them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The Court and Schwab raise three concerns about reading Rule 4003 to require timely objection to the debtor\u2019s estimate of an exempt asset\u2019s market value: Would trustees face an untoward administrative burden? Would trustees lack fair notice of the need to object? And would debtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an effort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions? In my judgment, all three questions should be answered no.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The Court suggests that requiring timely objections to a debtor\u2019s valuation of exempt property would saddle trustees with an unmanageable load. See <em>ante, </em>at 790 (declining to \u201cexpand .. . the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a claimed exemption\u201d). See also Brief for Petitioner 32-33; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>24.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But trustees, sooner or later, must attempt to ascertain the market value of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>empted assets. They must do so to determine whether sale of the items would likely produce surplus proceeds for the estate above the value of the claimed exemption, see \u00a7 704(a)(1); the only question, then, is <em>when </em>this market valuation must occur \u2014 (1) within 30 days or (2) at any time before the administrative closing of the bankruptcy estate? Removing valuation from Rule 4003\u2019s governance thus does little to reduce the labors trustees must undertake.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The 30-day objection period, I note, does not impose on trustees any <em>additional </em>duty, but rather guides the exercise of <em>existing </em>responsibilities; under Rule 4003(b), a trustee must rank evaluation of the debtor\u2019s exemptions as a priority item in his superintendence of the estate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And if the trustee entertains any doubt about the accuracy of a debtor\u2019s estimation of market value, the procedure for interposing objections is hardly arduous. The trustee need only file with the court a simple declaration stating that an item\u2019s value exceeds the amount listed by the debtor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>If the trustee needs more than 30 days to assess market value, moreover, the time period is eminently extendable. Rule 4003(b) prescribes that a trustee may, for cause, ask the court for an extension of the objection period. Alternatively, the trustee can postpone the conclusion of the meeting of creditors, from which the 30-day clock runs, simply by adjourning the meeting to a future date. Rule 2003(e). A trustee also may examine the debtor under oath at the creditors\u2019 meeting, Rule 2003(b)(1); if he gathers information impugning her exemption claims, he may ask the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing to determine valuation issues, Rule 4003(c). See <em>Taylor, </em>503 U. S., at 644 (\u201cIf [the trustee] did not know the value of [a claimed exemption], he could have sought a hearing on the issue . . . or . . . asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of time to object.\u201d). See also NACBA Brief 19, 21-23 (listing ways trustees may enlarge the limitations period for objections). Trustees, in sum, have ample mechanisms at their disposal to gain the time and information they need to lodge objections to valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On affording trustees fair notice of the need to object, the Court emphasizes that a debtor must list her claimed exemptions \u201cin a manner that makes the scope of the exemption clear.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 792. If a debtor wishes to exempt property in its entirety, for example, the Court counsels her to write \u201cfull fair market value (FMV)\u201d or \u201c100% of FMV\u201d in Schedule C\u2019s value-of-claimed-exemption column. <em>Ante, </em>at 793 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7, 26-29; <em>In re Hyman, </em>967 F. 2d 1316, 1319-1320, n. 6 (CA9 1992) (Trustees must be able to assess the validity of an exemption from the face of a debtor\u2019s schedules.). Our decision in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz, </em>the Court notes, is instructive. In <em>Taylor, </em>the debtor recorded the term \u201c$ <em>unknown\u201d </em>as the value of a claimed exemption, which, the Court observes, raised a \u201cwarning fla[g]\u201d because the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201cwas <em>not </em>plainly within the limits the Code allows.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 788-789.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">True, a debtor\u2019s schedules must give notice sufficient to cue the trustee that an objection may be in order. But a \u201cwarning flag\u201d is in the eye of the beholder: If a debtor lists identical amounts as the market value of exempted property and the value of her claimed exemption, she has, <em>on the face of her schedules, </em>reclaimed the entire asset just as surely as if she had recorded \u201c100% of FMV\u201d in Schedule C\u2019s value-of-claimed-exemption column. See Brief for Respondent 36. See also 9 Collier \u00b64003.03[3], p. 4003-14 <em>(\u201cOnly </em>when a debtor\u2019s schedules specifically value the debtor\u2019s interest in the property at an amount <em>higher </em>than the amount claimed as exempt can it be argued that a part of the debtor\u2019s interest in property has not been exempted.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In this case, by specifying $10,718 as both the current market value of her kitchen equipment and the value of her claimed' exemptions, Reilly gave notice that she had reclaimed the listed property in full. See <em>supra, </em>at 796-800. To borrow the Court\u2019s terminology, Reilly waved a \u201cwarning flag\u201d that should have prompted Schwab to object if he believed the equipment could not be reclaimed in its entirety because its value exceeded the statutory cap. 534 F. 3d, at 179. See 4 Collier \u00b6 522.05[2][b], p. 522-33 (\u201cNormally, if a debtor lists an asset as having a particular value in the schedules and then exempts that value, the schedules should be read as a claim of exemption for the entire asset, to which the trustee should object if the trustee believes the asset has been undervalued.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Training its attention on trustees\u2019 needs, moreover, the Court overlooks the debtor\u2019s plight. As just noted, the Court counsels debtors wishing to exempt an asset in full to write \u201c100% of FMV\u201d or \u201cfull FMV\u201d in the value-of-claimed-exemption column. But a debtor following the instructions that accompany Schedule C would consider such a response nonsensical, for those instructions direct her to \u201cstate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>dollar value </em>of the claimed exemption in the space provided.\u201d Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C, Instruction 5 (1991) (emphasis added). Chapter 7 debtors are often unrepresented. How are they to know they must ignore Schedule C\u2019s instructions and employ the \u201cwarning flag\u201d described today by the Court, if they wish to trigger the trustee\u2019s obligation to object to their market valuation in a timely fashion? See <em>In re Anderson, </em>377 B. R. 865, 875 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6 2007).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Schwab finally urges that requiring timely objections to a debtor\u2019s market-value estimations \u201cwould give debtors a perverse incentive to game the system by undervaluing their assets.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35; see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>27. The Court rejected an argument along these lines in <em>Taylor, </em>and should follow suit here. Multiple measures, <em>Taylor </em>explained, discourage undervaluation of property claimed as exempt. 503 U. S., at 644. Among those measures: The debtor flies her exemption claim under penalty of perjury See Rule 1008. She risks judicial sanction for signing documents not well grounded in fact. Rule 9011. And proof of fraud subjects her to criminal prosecution, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 152; extends the limitations period for filing objections to Schedule C, Rule 4003(b); and authorizes denial of discharge, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 727(a)(4)(B).

Prior to 1991, however, debtors recorded market value on a different schedule. See Interim Fed. Rule Bkrtey. Proe. Official Form 6, Schedule B-2 (1979) (requiring debtor to list the \u201c[mjarket value of [her] interest [in personal property] without deduction for . . . exemptions claimed\u201d). Trustees assessing the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d therefore, have always been able, from the face of the debtor\u2019s filings, to compare the value of the claimed exemption to the property\u2019s declared market value. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\"> By authorizing exemption of assets that a debtor would want to keep in kind, such as her jewelry and car, but limiting the exemptible value of this property, Congress struck a balance between debtors\u2019 and creditors\u2019 interests: Debtors can reclaim items helpful to their fresh start after bankruptcy, but only if those items are of modest value. Assets of larger worth, however, are subject to liquidation so that creditors may obtain a portion of the item\u2019s value. Cf. <em>In re Price, </em>370 F. 3d 362, 378 (CA3 2004) (\u201c[Bjankruptcy law is bilateral, replete with protections and policy considerations favoring both debtors and creditors.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> The significance of market value is what differentiates capped exemptions from uncapped ones that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind regardless of its worth. See <em>swpra, </em>at 800-801, n. 5. For uncapped exemptions, the nature of the property the debtor has reclaimed is dear: If the exemption is valid, the debtor gets the asset in full every time. For capped exemptions, however, market value is a crucial component in determining whether the debtor gets the item itself or a sum of money representing a share of the item\u2019s liquidation value. Reading Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) to require objections to valuation thus does not, as the Court contends, <em>\u201celid[ej </em>the distinction\u201d between capped and uncapped exemptions, <em>ante, </em>at 784 (emphasis added), but instead <em>accounts for </em>that distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\"> Suggesting that this interpretation of Rule 4003(b) \u201clacks statutory-support,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 786, n. 11, the Court repeatedly emphasizes that the Bankruptcy Code defines the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d to which a trustee must object, as \u201cthe debtor\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019 \u2014 up to a specified dollar amount \u2014 -in the assets described in [capped exemption] categories],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 782; see, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 783; <em>ibid., </em>n. 9; <em>ante, </em>at 793, n. 19. But the commonly understood definition of a property \u201cinterest\u201d is \u201c[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property .... Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of [such] rights.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed. 2004). Schwab, therefore, could not comprehend whether Reilly claimed a monetary or an in-kind \u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment without comparing her market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemption. See <em>supra, </em>at 802 and this page. In line with the statutory text, a debtor\u2019s market valuation is an essential factor in determining the nature of the \u201cinterest\u201d a debtor lists as exempt. Bankruptcy \u201cforms, rules, treatise excerpts, and policy considerations,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 779, n. 5, corroborate, rather than conflict with, this reading of the Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> Schwab states that \u201c[clases in which there are assets to administer... can take \u2018one to four years\u2019 to complete.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting Dept. of Justice, U.

See <em>swpra, </em>at 796. By lopping off valuation disagreements from the timely objection requirement, see, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 783, n. 8, the Court so severely shrinks the Rule\u2019s realm that this question arises: Why are trustees granted a full 30 days to lodge objections? Under the Court\u2019s reading of the Rule, trustees need only compare a debtor\u2019s Schedule C to the text of the exemption prescriptions to assess an exemption claim\u2019s facial validity, with no further investigation necessary. That comparison should take no more than minutes, surely not a month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\"> Trustees, it bears noting, historically had valuation duties far more onerous than they have today. Rule 4003\u2019s predecessor required trustees in the first instance, rather than debtors, to estimate the market value of property claimed as exempt. See Rule 403(b) (1975).
