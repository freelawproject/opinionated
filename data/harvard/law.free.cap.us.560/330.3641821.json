S. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a72, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a), we consider nine exceptions submitted by the parties to two reports filed by the Special Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In 1986, Congress granted its consent under the Compact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a710, cl. 3, to seven interstate compacts providing for the creation of regional facilities to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. Omnibus Low-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent Act, 99 Stat. 1859. One of those compacts was the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact), entered into by Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. <em>Id., </em>at 1871-1880. That Compact established an \u201cinstrument and framework for a cooperative effort\u201d to develop new facilities for the long-term disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region. Art. 1, <em>id., </em>at 1872. The Compact was to be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission (Commission), composed of two voting members from each party State. Art. 4(A), <em>id., </em>at 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, was to serve as the initial facility for regional generators to dispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), <em>id., </em>at 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the regional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992, <em>ibid., </em>and so the Compact required the Commission to develop \u201cprocedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>and criteria for identifying... a host [S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal facility,\u201d and to \u201cseek to ensure that such facility is licensed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no event later than 1991,\u201d Art. 4(E)(6), <em>id., </em>at 1875. The Compact authorized the Commission to \u201cdesignate\u201d a party State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7), <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In September 1986, the Commission designated North Carolina as the host for the second facility. North Carolina therefore became obligated to \u201ctake appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.\u201d Art. 5(C), <em>id., </em>at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill the State\u2019s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 104G, 1987 N. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Although \u201c[t]he Commission is not responsible for any costs associated with,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe creation of any facility,\u201d Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina asked the Commission for fin\u00e1ncial assistance with building and licensing costs. The Commission responded by adopting a resolution, which declared it was both \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d for the Commission \u201cto provide financial assistance\u201d to North Carolina. App. 63. To that end, the Commission created a \u201cHost States Assistance Fund\u201d to help North Carolina with the \u201cfinancial costs and burdens\u201d of \u201cpreliminary planning, the administrative preparation, and other pre-operational\u201d activities. <em>Id., </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approximately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license for North Carolina\u2019s regional-disposal facility. That proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate had ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for obtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the beginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the estimated cost had grown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the estimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was not anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the estimated cost had increased by another $27 million and the projected date to receive a license had become August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">North Carolina\u2019s own appropriations \u2014 approximately $27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 \u2014 did not cover the costs of the licensing phase. But during the same time period, the Commission provided North Carolina with approximately $67 million. The funds came from surcharges and access fees collected for that purpose from generators disposing of low-level radioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility. <em>Id., </em>at 71-74, 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from the Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of continued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the Commission accordingly informed North Carolina that it would no longer be able to provide financial support for licensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina responded that the State was not prepared to assume a greater portion of the project\u2019s costs, and would not be able to proceed without continued Commission funding. Shortly thereafter the Commission adopted a resolution declaring that it was willing and able to provide additional funds, but calling on North Carolina to work with it to develop long-term funding sources for the facility. From FY 1996 through FY 1998, the Commission provided North Carolina approximately an additional $12.27 million in financial assistance. North Carolina, for its part, continued to provide its own funds toward licensing activities \u2014 another $6 million during the same time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In August 1997, the Commission notified North Carolina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of the licensing phase, it would not disburse additional funds to North Carolina after November 30, 1997. North Carolina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>responded that it would not be able to continue without additional guarantees of external funding. On December 1, 1997, the parties having failed to agree upon a long-term financing plan, the Commission ceased financial assistance to North Carolina. By then it had provided almost $80 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On December 19,1997, North Carolina informed the Commission it would commence an orderly shutdown of its licensing project, and since that date has taken no further steps toward obtaining a license for the facility. But it did continue to fund the Authority for several more years, in the hope that the project would resume upon the restoration of external financial assistance. North Carolina maintained the proposed facility site, preserved the work it had completed to date, and retained the Authority\u2019s books and records. It also participated in discussions with the Commission, generators of low-level radioactive waste, and other stakeholders regarding options to resolve the financing shortfall. From FY 1988 through FY 2000, North Carolina had expended almost $34 million toward obtaining a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the handing impasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the Commission a complaint for sanctions against North Carolina. It alleged that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligations oonder the Compact, and requested (among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid to North Carolina by the Commission, plus interest, as well as damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The next month, North Carolina withdrew from the Compact by enacting a law repealing its status as a party State, see 1999 N. C. Sess. Laws ch. 357, as required by Article 7(G) of the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">More than four months later, in December 1999, the Commission held a sanctions hearing. North Carolina did not participate. After the hearing, the Commission concluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligations under the Compact. It adopted a resolution demanding that North Carolina repay approximately $80 million, plus interest, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the Commission; pay an additional $10 million penalty to compensate the Commission for the loss of future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would have received had a facility been completed in North Carolina; and pay the Commission\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. North Carolina did not comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In July 2000, seeking to enforce its sanctions resolution, the Commission moved for leave to file a bill of complaint under our original jurisdiction. <em>Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>No. 131, Orig. North Carolina opposed the motion on the grounds that the Commission could not invoke this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, and we invited the Solicitor General to express the views of the United States. 531 U. S. 942 (2000). The Solicitor General filed a brief urging denial of the Commission\u2019s motion on the grounds that the Commission\u2019s bill of complaint did not fall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over \u201ccontroversies between two or more States.\u201d \u00a7 1251(a). We denied the Commission\u2019s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively Plaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint against North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the motion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor General. 537 U. S. 806 (2002) . The United States urged that we grant Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, which we did. 539 U. S. 925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts: violation of the party States\u2019 rights under the Compact (Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment (Count III); promissory estop-pel (Count IV); and money had and received (Count V). Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief requests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the Commission\u2019s sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages, costs, and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S. 1014 (2003) , who has conducted proceedings and now has filed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>reports. The Master\u2019s Preliminary Report addressed three motions filed by the parties. He recommended denying without prejudice North Carolina\u2019s motion to dismiss the Commission\u2019s claims against North Carolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Preliminary Report 4-14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought enforcement of the Commission\u2019s sanctions resolution. <em>Id., </em>at 14-33. He recommended granting North Carolina\u2019s cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the bill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions resolution. <em>Id., </em>at 33-34. And he recommended denying North Carolina\u2019s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts II-V. <em>Id., </em>at 34-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report, the parties engaged in partial discovery and subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Special Master\u2019s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report 8-35, and granting North Carolina\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II, <em>id., </em>at 35-40. Finally, he recommended denying North Carolina\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims in Counts III-V. <em>Id., </em>at 41-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Plaintiffs present a total of seven exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s two reports. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Their first exception challenges the Special Master\u2019s conclusion that the Commission lacked authority to impose monetary sanctions upon North Carolina. The terms of the Compact determine that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Article 4(E) of the Compact sets forth the Commission\u2019s \u201cduties and powers.\u201d 99 Stat. 1874. Among its powers are the authority \u201cto revoke the membership of a party [Sjtate that willfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>gional facility,\u201d Art. 4(E)(7), <em>id., </em>at 1875, and the authority \u201cto revoke the membership of a party [S]tate in accordance with Article 7(f),\u201d Art. 4(E)(11), <em>ibid. </em>Conspicuously absent from Article 4, however, is any mention of the authority to impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs contend that authority may be found elsewhere \u2014 in the first paragraph of Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">\u201cAny party [S]tate which fails to comply with the provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, including suspension of its rights under this compact and revocation of its status as a party [S]tate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F) \u2014 \u201csuspension\u201d of rights and \u201crevocation\u201d of party-state status \u2014 flow directly from the Commission\u2019s power in Articles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State\u2019s membership. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser power to suspend a party State\u2019s rights. There is no similar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose monetary sanctions, and the absence is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">According to Plaintiffs, however, the word \u201csanctions\u201d in Article 7(F) naturally \u201cinclud[es]\u201d monetary sanctions. Since the Compact contains no definition of \u201csanctions,\u201d we give the word its ordinary meaning. A \u201csanction\u201d (in the sense the word is used here) is \u201c[t]he detriment loss of reward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a violation of a law as a means of enforcing the law.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Second); see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1458 (9th ed. 2009) (\u201cA penalty or coercive measure that results from failure to comply with a law, rule, or order\u201d). A monetary penalty is assuredly one kind of \u201csanction.\u201d See generally <em>Department of Energy </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>503 U. S. 607, 621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the withholding of ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>efits, or the imposition of a nonmonetary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact surely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Ultimately, context dictates precisely which \u201csanctions\u201d are authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the Compact suggests that these include monetary measures. The only two \u201csanctions\u201d specifically identified as being included within Article 7(F) are \u201csuspension\u201d of a State\u2019s rights under the Compact and \u201crevocation\u201d of its status as a party State. These are arguably merely examples, and may not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission can impose. But they do establish \u201cillustrative application[s] of the general principle,\u201d <em>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Bismarck Lumber Co., </em>314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941), which underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission can impose. It is significant that both these specifically authorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: \u201cThe rights granted to the party [Sjtates by this compact are additional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign [Sjtates, and nothing in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon, limit, or abridge those rights.\u201d 99 Stat. 1873. Construing Article 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate this provision, since the primeval sovereign right is immunity from levies against the government fisc. See, <em>e.g., Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U. S. 706, 750-751 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Finally, a comparison of the Compact\u2019s terms with those of \u201c[ojther interstate compacts, approved by Congress contemporaneously,\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S. 554, 565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize monetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented to this Compact, it consented to three other interstate compacts that expressly authorize their commissions to impose monetary sanctions against the parties to the compacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat. 1915 (hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Northeast Compact); Central Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. VIII(f), <em>id., </em>at 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Compact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. VII(e), <em>id., </em>at 1870 (hereinafter Central Compact). The Compact \u201cclearly lacks the features of these other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it\u201d to empower the Commission to impose monetary sahctions. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S., at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Because the Compact does not authorize the Commission to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs\u2019 second exception\u2014 that North Carolina could not avoid monetary sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact \u2014 is moot. The third exception also pertains to the Commission\u2019s sanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its right to object to a monetary penalty by failing to participate at the sanctions hearing. Plaintiffs have failed to argue this exception. They have merely noted that North Carolina refused to participate at the sanctions hearing, and have cited no law in support of the proposition that this was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It was wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North Carolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that the Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Plaintiffs next take exception to the Special Master\u2019s recommendation that no binding effect or even deference be accorded to the Commission\u2019s conclusion that North Carolina violated Article 5(C) of the Compact. We are bound by the Commission's conclusion of breach only if there is \u201can explicit provision or other clear indieatio[n]\u201d in the Compact making the Commission the \u201csole arbiter of disputes\u201d regarding a party State's compliance with the Compact. <em>Id., </em>at 569-570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a provision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which states: \u201cThe Commission is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>judge of the qualifications of the party [S]tates and of its members and of their compliance with the conditions and requirements of this compact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the enactment of this compact.\u201d 99 Stat. 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited nature of the authority to \u201cjudge\u201d that it confers upon the Commission is clear from its context. The first sentence of Article 7(C) states that an eligible State \u201cshall be declared\u201d a party State \u201cupon enactment of this compact into law by the [SJtate and upon [the] payment of\u201d a $25,000 fee, as \u201crequired by Article 4(H)(1).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The second sentence makes the Commission the \u201cjudge\u201d of four matters, <em>all of which concern status </em>os <em>a party State or Commission member. </em>First, the Commission is the judge of the \u201cqualifications\u201d of a State to become a party State (the qualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party States and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently petition to join). Seeond, the Commission is the judge of the qualifications of the members of the Commission, which are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission is the judge of a party State\u2019s compliance with the \u201cconditions\u201d and \u201crequirements\u201d of the Compact. The former term is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): \u201cThe Commission may establish such conditions as it deems necessary and appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing... to become a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1878. The accompanying term \u201crequirements\u201d also refers to Article 7\u2019s prescriptions for prospective party States, such as paying the \u201cfees required\u201d under Article 7(C), <em>id., </em>at 1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds vote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the Commission is the judge of the \u201claws of the party [S]tates relating to the enactment of this compact.\u201d Art. 7(C), <em>ibid. </em>Again, that concerns status as a party State, which requires that the State \u201cenac[t]... this compact into law,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>The Commission is the \u201cjudge\u201d of only these specific matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to interpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has violated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power to sanction under Article 7(F). But because \u201cthe express terms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the Commission as the sole arbiter\u201d regarding North Carolina\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the Compact, <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound to follow the Commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to the Commission\u2019s conclusion. But unless the text of an interstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the actions of a compact commission \u201con the deferential model of judicial review of administrative action by a federal agency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 566-567. The terms of this Compact do not establish that \u201cthis suit may be maintained only as one for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s\u201d determination of breach. <em>Id., </em>at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply administrative-law standards of review, but exercise our independent judgment as to both fact and law in executing our role as the \u201cexclusive\u201d arbiter of controversies between the States, \u00a7 1251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next two exceptions are to the Special Master\u2019s recommendations to deny their motion for summary judgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant North Carolina\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those claims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in cases within our original jurisdiction, we are not technically bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but we use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court\u2019s Rule 17.2; <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence, summary judgment is appropriate where there \u201cis no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ.

At that point, in their view, North Carolina was no longer \u201ctak[ing] appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority,\u201d Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. North Carolina says that once the Commission ceased providing financial assistance on December 1, and once it became clear there was insufficient funding to complete the licensing phase, there were no more \u201cappropriate\u201d steps to take. The Special Master concluded that the phrase \u201cappropriate steps\u201d in Article 5(C) was ambiguous, and that the parties\u2019 course of performance established that North Carolina was not required to take steps toward obtaining a license once it was made to bear the remaining financial burden of the licensing phase. Second Report 10-24, 35-36. Plaintiffs take exception to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Article 5(C) does not require North Carolina to take any and all steps to license a regional-disposal facility; only those that are \u201cappropriate.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that this requires North Carolina to take the steps set forth in the regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission governing the filing and disposition of applications for licenses to operate radioactive waste disposal facilities, 10 CPR pt. 61 (1997). Those regulations set forth some, but certainly not all, of the \u201csteps\u201d the State would have to take to obtain a license. But Article 5(C) does not incorporate the regulations by reference, much less describe them as the <em>appropriate </em>steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We could accept Plaintiffs\u2019 contention if \u201cappropriate\u201d meant \u201cnecessary\u201d (the steps set forth in the regulation are assuredly necessary to obtaining a license). But it does not. Whether a <em>particular </em>step is \u201cappropriate\u201d \u2014 \u201c[specially suitable; fit; proper,\u201d Webster\u2019s Second 133 \u2014 could depend upon many factors other than its mere indispensability to obtaining a license. It would not be appropriate, for exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>pie, to take a step whose cost greatly exceeded whatever benefits the license would confer, or if it was highly uncertain the license would ever issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In determining whether, in terminating its efforts to obtain a license, North Carolina failed to take what the parties considered \u201cappropriate\u201d steps, the parties\u2019 course of performance under the Compact is highly significant. See, <em>e. g., New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>523 U. S. 767, 830-831 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 202(4), 203 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement). That firmly establishes, that North Carolina was not expected to go it alone \u2014 to proceed with the very expensive licensing process without any external financial assistance. The history of the Compact consists entirely of shared financial burdens. From the beginning, North Carolina made clear that it required financial assistance to do the extensive work required for obtaining a license. The Commission promptly declared it was \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to assist North Carolina with the costs. App. 63. It provided the vast majority of funding for licensing-related activities \u2014 $80 million, compared to North Carolina\u2019s $34 million. The Commission repeatedly noted the necessity (and propriety) of providing financial assistance to North Carolina, and reiterated its dedication to sharing the substantial financial burdens of the licensing phase. See, <em>e. g., id., </em>at 63, 71,145. There is nothing to support the proposition that the other States had an obligation under the Compact to share the licensing costs through the Commission; but we doubt that they did so out of love for the Tarheel State. They did it, we think, because that was their understanding of how the Compact was supposed to work. One must take the Commission at its word, that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to share the cost \u2014 which suggests that it would not have been appropriate to make North Carolina proceed on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Nor was North Carolina required after December 19,1997, to continue to expend its own funds at the same level it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>previously (which Plaintiffs concede had satisfied North Carolina\u2019s obligation to take \u201cappropriate steps\u201d). Once the Commission refused to provide any further financial assistance, North Carolina would have had to assume an unlimited financial commitment to cover all remaining licensing costs. Even if it maintained its prior rate of appropriations going forward, it would not have come close to covering the at least $34 million needed for the last steps of the licensing phase. And since the income from the South Carolina facility had been terminated, there was no apparent prospect of funding for the construction phase (expected to cost at least $75 million). In connection with its August 1997 refusal to provide further assistance, the Commission itself had said, \u201c[I]t will be imprudent to continue to deplete Commission resources for this purpose if a source of funds is not established soon for the ultimate completion of the project.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 306, 307; App. to Joint Supp. Fact Brief 36, 37. And in March 1998, the Commission \u201cstrongly\u201d reiterated that \u201cit would be imprudent to spend additional funds for licensing activities if funds will not be available to complete the project.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 59. What was imprudent for the Commission would surely have been imprudent (and hence inappropriate) for North Carolina as well. The State would have wasted millions of its taxpayers\u2019 dollars on what seemed to be a futile effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Justice Breyer would uphold Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge on this point. He believes that the Compact obligated North Carolina to fund and complete the licensing and construction of a nuclear waste facility. <em>Post, </em>at 364, 366-368 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). In fact, however, North Carolina was not even contractually required to \u201cse-eur[e] a license,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 364, but only to take \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to obtain one, Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. And nothing in the terms of the Compact required North Carolina either to provide \u201cadequate funding\u201d for or to \u201cbeg[i]n construction\u201d on a regional facility, <em>post, </em>at 364. Other contempora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>neously enacted interstate compacts expressly provide that the host State is \u201cresponsible for the timely development\u201d of a regional facility, Central Midwest Compact, Ant. VI(f), 99 Stat. 1887; Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact, Art. VI(e), <em>id., </em>at 1898 (hereinafter Midwest Compact), or \u201cshall... [clause a regional facility to be developed on a timely basis,\u201d Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. III(d)(i), <em>id., </em>at 1903-1904. But the Compact here before us has no such provision, and the contrast is telling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S., at 565. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s statements described in the preceding paragraph, that it would be imprudent to commit additional resources \u201cif a source of funds is not established soon for the ultimate completion of the project,\u201d or \u201cif funds will not be available to complete the project,\u201d surely suggest that North Carolina is not committed to the funding by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Justice Breyer asserts, <em>post, </em>at 366-367, that the rotating-host requirement in the Compact, see Art. 5(A), 99 Stat. 1877, necessarily implies that North Carolina is solely responsible for the licensing and construction costs of its facility. But all that requirement entails is that a party State \u201cshall not be designated\u201d as a host State for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>time before \u201ceach [other] party [S]tate\u201d has taken a turn. <em>Ibid. </em>It can perfectly well envision that the States will take turns in bearing the lead responsibility for getting the facility licensed, supervising its construction, and operating the facility on its soil. In fact, that is just what its text suggests, since it describes the responsibility that is to be rotated as the host State\u2019s \u201cobligation ... to have a regional facility operated within its borders.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Not to construct it, or pay for its construction, but to \u201chave [it] operated within its borders.\u201d As noted above, other contemporaneously enacted compacts do spell out the obligation of the host State to construct the facility. Still others at least provide that the host State will recoup its costs through disposal fees \u2014 which arguably suggests that the host State is to bear the costs. See, <em>e.g., </em>Central Compact, Art. 111(d), <em>id., </em>at 1865; Northeast Compact, Art. 111(c)(2), <em>id., </em>at 1913. The Compact before us here does not even contain that arguable suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">What it comes down to, then, is Justice Breyer\u2019s intuition that the whole <em>point </em>of the Compact was that each designated host State would bear the upfront costs of licensing and construction, but would eventually recoup those costs through its regional monopoly on the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. <em>Post, </em>at 366-367. He can cite no provision in the Compact which reflects such an understanding, and the behavior of the parties contradicts it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would, moreover, have been a foolish understanding, since the regional monopoly to recoup construction costs would not be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>monopoly if South Carolina withdrew and continued to operate its facility \u2014 'which is exactly what happened in 1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even leaving aside the principle, discussed <em>infra, </em>at 351-352, that implied obligations are not to be read into interstate compacts, Justice Breyer\u2019s intuition fails to reflect the reality of what was implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Plaintiffs take exception to the Special Master\u2019s rejection of their alternative argument that North Carolina repudiated the Compact when it announced it would not take further steps toward obtaining a license. They argue that North Carolina\u2019s announcement that it was shutting down the project constituted a refusal to tender any further performance under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 repudiation theory fails for the same reasons their breach theory fails. A repudiation occurs when an ob-ligor either informs an obligee \u201cthat the obligor will commit a breach that would of itself give the obligee a claim for damages for total breach,\u201d Restatement \u00a7 250(a), or performs \u201ca voluntary affirmative act which renders the obligor unable or apparently unable to perform without such a breach,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 250(b). Neither event occurred here. North Carolina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>never informed the Commission (or any party State) that it would not fulfill its Article 5(C) obligation to take appropriate steps toward obtaining a license. Rather, it refused to take further steps that were not appropriate. Nor did North Carolina take an affirmative act that rendered it unable to perform. To the contrary, it continued to fund the Authority for almost two years; it maintained the records of the Authority; and it preserved the work completed to date while waiting for alternative funding sources that would enable resumption of the project. Plaintiffs further argue that a repudiation was effected by North Carolina\u2019s refusal to take further steps toward licensing \u201cexcept on conditions which go beyond\u201d the terms of the Compact, <em>id., </em>\u00a7250, Comment <em>b </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) \u2014 ! <em>e., </em>the provision of external financial assistance. But, as we have discussed, external financial assistance was contemplated by the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final exception is to the Special Master's recommendation to deny their motion for summary judgment, and to grant North Carolina\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, on their claim that North Carolina violated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing when it withdrew from the Compact in July 1999. Plaintiffs concede that North Carolina could withdraw from the Compact, but contend it could not do so in \u201cbad faith.\u201d And, they assert, its withdrawal after accepting $80 million from the Commission, and with monetary sanctions pending against it, was the epitome of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We have never held that an interstate compact approved by Congress includes an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Of course \u201c[ejvery contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7205. But an interstate compact is not just a contract; it is a federal statute enacted by Congress. If courts were authorized to add a fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>requirement to the implementation of federal statutes, judges would be potent lawmakers indeed. We do not \u2014 we cannot \u2014 add provisions to a federal statute. See, <em>e. g., Connecticut Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992). And in that regard a statute which is a valid interstate compact is no different. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S., at 564, 565. We are especially reluctant to read absent terms into an interstate compact given the federalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would arise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign States, to which the political branches consented. As we have said before, we will not \u201c\u2018order relief inconsistent with [the] express terms\u2019\u201d of a compact, \u201cno matter what the equities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>523 U. S., at 811 (quoting <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 564).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Compact imposes no limitation on North Carolina\u2019s exercise of its statutory right to withdraw. Under Article 7(G), which governed North Carolina\u2019s withdrawal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[a]ny party [S]tate may withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing the compact.\u201d 99 Stat. 1879. There is no restriction upon a party State\u2019s enactment of such a law, and nothing in the Compact suggests the parties understood there were \u201ccertain purposes for which the expressly conferred power . . . could not be employed.\u201d <em>Tymshare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Covell, </em>727 F. 2d 1145, 1153 (CADC 1984) (opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). Moreover, Article 3 ensures that no such restrictions may be implied, since it provides that the Compact shall not be \u201cconstrued to infringe upon, limit, or abridge\u201d the sovereign rights of a party State.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>A comparison of the Compact with other, contemporaneously enacted, compacts confirms there is no such limitation on North Carolina\u2019s right to withdraw. See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 565. In contrast to the Compact, several other compacts concerning the creation of regional facilities for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste contain express good-faith limitations upon a State\u2019s exercise of its rights. See, <em>e.g., </em>Central Compact, Art. 111(f), 99 Stat. 1865; Central Midwest Compact, Art. V(a), <em>id., </em>at 1886; Midwest Compact, Art. V(a), <em>id., </em>at 1897.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">North Carolina submits two exceptions \u2014 one to the Special Master\u2019s Second Report and one to his Preliminary Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">North Carolina takes exception to the recommendation of the Second Report to deny without prejudice its motion for summary judgment on the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 equitable claims in Counts III-V. North Carolina\u2019s motion was based on the ground that, as a matter of law, its obligations are governed entirely by the Compact. The Special Master recommended denying the motion without prejudice, because the claims in Counts III-V \u201crequir[e] further briefing and argument, and possibly further discovery.\u201d Second Report 41. A threshold question for all claims in those Counts, for example, is whether they \u201cbelong to the Commission, the Plaintiff States, or both.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Perhaps the States can bring them in their capacity as <em>parens patriae, </em>but as the Special Master noted \u201cthe parties have not adequately briefed this issue, and its resolution in this case is unclear.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 42-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">We think it was reasonable for the Special Master to defer ruling. We granted the Special Master discretion to \u201cdirect subsequent proceedings\u201d and \u201cto submit such reports as he may deem appropriate.\u201d 540 U. S., at 1014. He could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>deferred filing any report until fall factual discovery had been completed and all of the legal issues, many of which are novel and challenging, had been fully briefed, considered, and decided. Instead, he concluded that our immediate resolution of Counts I and II would facilitate the efficient disposition of the case; and in agreeing to hear exceptions to his Preliminary Report and Second Report we implicitly agreed. His deferral of ruling on the merits of Counts III-V is part and parcel of the same case management, and we find no reason to upset it.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">North Carolina takes exception to the Special Master\u2019s recommendation in his Preliminary Report to deny without prejudice its motion to dismiss the Commission\u2019s claims on the ground that they are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution and by structural principles of state sovereign immunity. The Special Master assumed for the sake of argument that a State possesses sovereign immunity against a claim brought by an entity, like the Commission, created by an interstate compact,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Preliminary Report 5. But he recommended denying North Carolina\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cat this point in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The Special Master relied upon our decision in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of several Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the allocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River. The United States had already intervened, in its capacity as trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved to intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted the Tribes\u2019 motion, stating that the States do not enjoy sovereign immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>against the United States, and \u201c[t]he Tribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against the States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudication of their vital water rights that was commenced by the United States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 614. Thus, \u201cour judicial power over the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to intervene, and the States\u2019 sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Relying on this holding, the Special Master held that sovereign immunity does not bar the Commission\u2019s suit, so long as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so, he said, \u201ccannot be resolved without further factual and legal development^],\u201d Preliminary Report 6, and so North Carolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, <em>id., </em>at 13-14. See Second Report 45-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commission\u2019s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign immunity, we agree with his disposition. North Carolina contends that making application of the Constitution\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity turn upon whether a nonsovereign party seeks to expand the relief sought is inconsistent with our decisions construing state sovereign immunity as a \u201cpersonal privilege.\u201d <em>College Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Florida Prepaid Post-secondary Ed. Expense Bd., </em>527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Alden, </em>527 U. S., at 758. But nothing in those cases suggests that <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California </em>has been implicitly overruled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Shalala </em>v. <em>Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., </em>529 U. S. 1, 18 (2000). Neither of them arose under our original jurisdiction, and neither cited <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California </em>or discussed\u2014 at all \u2014 the sovereign immunity issue that case addressed. That sovereign immunity is a personal privilege of the States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>says nothing about whether that privilege \u201cis not compromised,\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at 614, by an additional, nonsovereign plaintiff\u2019s bringing an entirely overlapping claim for relief that burdens the State with no additional defense or liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">North Carolina contends that <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California </em>cannot apply to the Commission\u2019s claims, because the Commission does not \u2014 indeed, cannot \u2014 assert the same claims or seek the same relief as the plaintiff States. We disagree. In the bill of complaint, the States and the Commission assert the same claims and request the same relief. Bill of Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 62-86 and Prayer for Relief Their claim for restitution of $80 million cannot, given the other allegations of the complaint, be thought to be $80 million payable to each of the four plaintiff States and the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">North Carolina argues, however, that summary judgment in its favor is appropriate because it is clear that the Commission, and not the plaintiff States, provided $80 million to North Carolina \u2014 wherefore, as a matter of law, only the Commission can claim entitlement to $80 million, either as a measure of damages for breach of the Compact under Counts I and II of the bill of complaint, see Restatement \u00a7 370, Comment <em>a, </em>and \u00a7373, or under the unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and money-had-and-received theories of recovery in Counts III, IV, and V, see, <em>e. g., </em>Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 1, Comment <em>a </em>(1936). And, it contends, a stand-alone suit by the Commission is barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>With regard to Counts I and II, at least, we disagree. The Commission\u2019s claims under those Compact-related Counts are wholly derivative of the States\u2019 claims. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S., at 614. The Commission is \u201ca legal entity separate and distinct from\u201d the States that are parties to the Compact. Art. 4(M)(1), 99 Stat. 1877. Since it is not a party it has neither a contractual right to performance by the party States nor enforceable statutory rights under Article 5 of the Compact, see <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>520 U. S. 154, 162-163 (1997). The Compact does, however, authorize the Commission to \u201cact or appear on behalf of any party [S]tate or [S]tates ... as an intervenor or party in interest before . . . any court of law,\u201d Art. 4(E)(10), 99 Stat. 1875, and it is obviously in this capacity that the Commission seeks to vindicate the <em>plaintiff States\u2019 </em>statutory and contractual rights in Counts I and II. Its Count I and Count II claims therefore rise or fall with the claims of the States. While the Commission may not bring them in a stand-alone action under this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, see \u00a7 1251(a), it may assert them in this Court alongside the plaintiff States, see <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at 614. The summary judgment disallowing the underlying claims on their merits renders the sovereign immunity question with regard to any <em>relief </em>the Commission alone might have on those claims moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Counts III-V, which do not rely upon the Compact, stand on a different footing. As to them, while the Commission again seemingly makes the same claims and seeks the same relief as the States, it is conceivable that as a matter of law the Commission\u2019s claims are not identical. The Commission can claim restitution as the party that paid the money to North Carolina; the other plaintiffs cannot claim it on that basis. Whether this means that the claims are not identical for <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California </em>purposes, and that the Commission\u2019s Counts III-V claims must be dismissed on sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>immunity grounds, is a question that the Special Master declined to resolve until the merits issues were further clarified. We have approved his deferral of those issues, and we likewise approve his deferral of the related sovereign immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">* * H*</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We overrule the exceptions of Plaintiffs and North Carolina to the Special Master\u2019s Reports, and we adopt the recommendations of the Special Master. We grant North Carolina\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I. We grant North Carolina\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II. We deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment on Counts I and II. And we deny without prejudice North Carolina\u2019s motion to dismiss the Commission\u2019s claims on the grounds of sovereign immunity and its motion for summary judgment on Counts III-V.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> The Compact provides only that the host State is \u201cresponsible for the availability... of their regional facilities in accordance with\u201d Article 5(B). Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873-1874. The latter section makes clear that responsibility for \u201cavailability\u201d does not mean that the host State will fund construction of the facility, but that it will keep it open and not impose unreasonable restrictions on its use. Justice Breyer is correct that the Compact says the Commission is not \u201cresponsible\u201d for the costs of \u201cthe creation\u201d of a regional facility. Art. 4(K)(1), <em>id., </em>at 1876. But what is important here is that it does <em>not </em>say that the host State <em>is </em>responsible\u2014 which (if it were true) would almost certainly have been joined with saying who was not responsible. What Justice Breyer overlooks is the possibility that <em>no one </em>is responsible, and the licensing and construction of the facility is meant to depend upon <em>voluntary </em>funding by interested parties, such as the party States, the Commission, and low-level radioactive waste generators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> The course-of-dealing evidence that Justice Breyek identifies, <em>post, </em>at 368-369, is not probative. The Commission\u2019s statements that it is not legally responsible for costs and that at some point Commission funds will no longer be available, and North Carolina\u2019s assurances that it will keep its commitments and honor its obligations, are perfectly compatible with the proposition that North Carolina did not have to provide <em>all </em>funding for licensing the facility, and that it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to proceed toward obtaining a license for a facility that would never be needed or built.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> South Carolina\u2019s withdrawal from the Compact not only <em>\u201ccould\u201d </em>affect North Carolina\u2019s ability to recoup its facility costs, as Justice Breyer grudgingly concedes, <em>post, </em>at 367; it unquestionably <em>would. </em>With a regional competitor in the Barnwell facility and declining demand for waste disposal facilities due to technological and other factors, App. 261, 263-264, North Carolina would receive significantly lower revenues from its facility, <em>id., </em>at 261-262, 265. The document attached to a 1996 letter from North Carolina to the Commission trumpeting \u201c$600 million in cost savings\u201d that would come from a new facility, <em>post, </em>at 367, proves precisely the opposite of what Justice Breyer thinks. The cost savings were to accrue \u201cto all generatorsi\u201d of waste, App. 266 (emphasis added) \u2014 that is, those who would use North Carolina\u2019s facility. Those savings would come, of course, from lower costs for waste disposal, which means that North Carolina would be charging <em>lower </em>rates than the Barnwell facility (and thus receiving <em>lower </em>revenues).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\"> After North Carolina was designated as a host State, the Compact was amended to add Article 7(H), which restricted the ability of a party State to withdraw to -within 30 days after a second regional-disposal facility opened.

Plaintiffs do not request as much, however, in contending that North Carolina was required by the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact) to carry out its obligations in good faith. Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the Compact\u2019s terms, properly construed, speak not only to the specific duties imposed upon the parties but also to the manner in which those duties must be carried out. This is an interpretive argument familiar to contract disputes. See, <em>e. g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 205 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">As the opinion for the Court notes, congressional consent to an interstate compact gives it the status of a federal statute. See <em>ante, </em>at 351. This is an apt and proper way to indicate that a compact has all the dignity of an Act of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>gress. And that is surely what was meant in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998), where it was stated that the Court may not \u201c \u2018order relief inconsistent with [the] express terms\u2019 \u201d of a compact. <em>Ante, </em>at 352 (quoting <em>New Jersey; </em>alteration in original; some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>449 U. S. 433, 438 (1981) (\u201c[Congressional consent transforms an interstate compact ... into a law of the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">From this principle, however, it simply does not follow that a law\u2019s nature and origin as a compact must be dismissed as irrelevant. Like a treaty, a compact represents an agreement between parties. See <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>at 831 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Compact here is of course a treaty\u201d). The Court\u2019s duty in interpreting a compact involves ascertaining the intent of the parties. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Kidd, </em>254 U. S. 433, 439 (1921) (\u201c[T]reaties are to be interpreted upon the principles which govern the interpretation of contracts... with a view to making effective the purposes of the high contracting parties\u201d); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Henkel, </em>190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (\u201cTreaties must receive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of the contracting parties\u201d). Carrying out this duty may lead the Court to consult sources that might differ from those normally reviewed when an ordinary federal statute is at issue. That much is surely implicit in the Court\u2019s reference to contract law principles elsewhere in its opinion in the instant case. See, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 346 (\u201c[T]he parties\u2019 course of performance under the Compact is highly significant\u201d); <em>ibid, </em>(citing the Restatement); <em>ante, </em>at 350 (same); see also <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>at 830-831 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (construing a compact in light of \u201chornbook contracts law that the practical construction of an ambiguous agreement revealed by later conduct of the parties is good indication of its meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">That said, it is quite correct to hold here that the reasonable expectations of the contracting States, as manifested in the Compact, do not reveal an intent to limit North Caroli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>na\u2019s power of withdrawal. For purposes of rejecting this argument, it is sufficient to note \u2014 as the Court does \u2014 that the Compact permits any State to withdraw; imposes no limitation on this right; and explicitly provides that the Compact shall not be construed to abridge the sovereign rights of any party State. See <em>ante, </em>at 352. Federalism concerns also counsel reluctance to find that a State has implicitly restricted its sovereignty in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Court is therefore correct to reject plaintiffs\u2019 final exception.

One of these things is not like the others: The Commission is not a sovereign State. The Court entertains its suit \u2014 despite North Carolina\u2019s sovereign immunity \u2014 because the Commission \u201casserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the other plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355. Our Constitution does not countenance such \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d jurisdiction, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The Court has made this mistake before. In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S. 605 (1983), we allowed Indian Tribes that could not sue sovereign States to piggyback on the claims of the United States, which could. We reasoned that once the United States had initiated suit, the state defendants could \u201cno longer ... assert [their] immunity with respect to the subject matter of [the] action,\u201d so the Tribes were free to pile on and join the suit. <em>Id., </em>at 614. Today the Court retraces <em>Arizona\u2019s </em>steps, quoting that case for the proposition that when private plaintiffs \u201c\u2018do not seek to bring new claims or issues,. .. our judicial power over the controversy is not enlarged . .., and the States\u2019 sovereign immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>nity protected by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.'\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355 (quoting <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 614).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">That statement is contrary to the language of the Constitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The immunity conferred is against the \u201ceommence[ment] or prosecut[ion]\u201d of \u201cany suit in law or equity.\u201d There is no carve-out for suits \u201cprosecuted\u201d by private parties so long as those parties \u201c\u2018do not seek to bring new claims or issues.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355 (quoting <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 614).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Understandably, the Court\u2019s opinion leans heavily on <em>Arizona, </em>which has never been squarely overruled. <em>Ante, </em>at 354-356. But <em>Arizona </em>itself is built on sand. The relevant portion of that opinion is almost wholly unreasoned. It cites only a footnote in a prior case, the pertinent paragraph of which failed even to discuss the State\u2019s immunity from private suit. See 460 U. S., at 614 (citing <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981)). That paragraph addressed only intervention, not sovereign immunity, and the two issues are distinct. See <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>558 U. S. 256, 268, n. 5 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Most importantly, the subsequent development of our sovereign immunity jurisprudence has only undermined <em>Arizona\u2019s </em>already weak foundations. We recognized in <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U. S. 706, 718 (1999), that the Constitution left intact the States\u2019 pre-existing \u201cimmunity from private suits\u201d; as the Eleventh Amendment confirms, the States did not \u201c\u2018surrender . . . this immunity in the plan of the convention,\u201d\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 717 (quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)); see also <em>Alden, supra, </em>at 718-722, 755-756. There is no reason to suppose that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>States, at the founding, made an exception for private suits that happen to mimic other plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u2014 and neither <em>Arizona </em>nor the Court today suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Whether or not a plaintiff \u201cseeks the same relief\u201d or imposes any \u201cadditional defense or liability,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 355, 356, simply does not matter in light of our recognition that sovereign immunity provides an \u201cimmunity from suit,\u201d not a \u201cdefense to . . . liability,\u201d <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority, </em>535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002). As we have explained, \u201cthe relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is barred.\u201d <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>517 U. S. 44, 58 (1996). Indeed, we have suggested that private parties may not sue even if a court is \u201cprecluded . . . from awarding them <em>any </em>relief.\u201d <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>at 766 (emphasis added) (dictum). It is the fact that a private party is allowed to sue a sovereign State \u2014 not the burden of litigation or the relief sought \u2014 that infringes the immunity of the State. \u201cThe Eleventh Amendment is concerned not only with the States\u2019 ability to withstand suit, but with their privilege not to be sued.\u201d <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority </em>v. <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U. S. 139, 147, n. 5 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is therefore impossible for the Court to hear private claims against a nonconsenting State without expanding \u201cour judicial power over the controversy.\u201d <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 614. Sovereign immunity is a limitation on that power. The similarity of claims may be relevant to joinder or intervention, but those are procedural means of processing claims, not fonts of judicial authority. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U. S. 654, 664 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Nor may the Court entertain private claims without \u201ccom-promis[ing]\u201d \u201cthe States\u2019 sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 614. As a party, the Commission enjoys legally enforceable rights against the defendant State: It may object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to settlement, seek taxation of costs, advance arguments we are obliged to consider, and plead the judgment as res judi-cata in future litigation. If the Commission truly sought nothing for itself \u2014 other than \u201ca full exposition of the issues,\u201d Preliminary Report of the Special Master 14 \u2014 it could have participated as an <em>amicus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Commission and North Carolina know that more is at stake if the Commission is allowed to sue the State. It is precisely the Commission\u2019s status as a <em>party, </em>its attempt to \u201cprosecut[e]\u201d a \u201csuit in law or equity .. . against one of the United States,\u201d U. S.

(The Chief Justice joins all but Parts II-D and III-B of the Court\u2019s opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Article 5(C) is the critical term of the Compact. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u201cEach party state designated as a host state for a regional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a facility ... is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.\u201d Omnibus Low-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent Act (Consent Act), 99 Stat. 1877.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>In September 1986, North Carolina was \u201cdesignated as a host state for a regional\u201d low-level nuclear waste disposal \u201cfacility.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also App. 417, 432. Soon thereafter, North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly enacted legislation authorizing a state agency to \u201csite, finance, [and] build\u201d a waste disposal facility. N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 104G-4 (1987) (repealed 2000). Pursuant to this legislation, a new facility was to be completed by January 1,1993. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">From August 1987 until December 1997, North Carolina took a series of steps to prepare for the construction of the storage facility. See Brief for North Carolina in Support of Exceptions to Reports of the Special Master 6-8. And while doing so it continually assured its Compact partners that it \u201cremainfed] committed to fulfilling its obligations to the Compact to serve as the next host state.\u201d App. 92 (Letter from James G.

See Second Report of Special Master 2-3 (hereinafter Second Report). Eventually, the State simply stopped trying: On December 19, 1997, North Carolina informed its fellow member States that it would \u201ccommence the orderly shutdown\u201d of the waste disposal \u201cproject.\u201d App. 319. After this point, North Carolina admittedly took no further steps toward obtaining a license or building a facility before withdrawing from the Compact in July 1999. <em>Id., </em>at 460 (North Carolina Admissions \u00b6 11) (North Carolina \u201cdid not [after 1997] take additional steps to . . . license a waste disposal facility\u201d); Second Report 10 (\u201cThe parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not take additional steps to pursue a license for- a waste facility\u201d after December 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Whatever one might think of the sufficiency of North Carolina\u2019s activities during the previous decade, I do not see how the Court can find that a year and a half of doing nothing\u2014 which North Carolina admits it did between December 1997 and July 1999 \u2014 constitutes \u201ctak[ing] appropriate steps.\u201d If a student promises to \u201ctake appropriate steps to ensure\u201d that he will pass the bar and then refuses to study, has he not broken his promise?

But this fact may just as easily be read to indicate what the parties here intended, rather than, as the majority argues, what they did not intend. Regardless, the language of the Compact and the context in which it was enacted \u2014 as part of a congressional effort to encourage regional solutions to this Nation\u2019s low-level radioactive waste problem, see Consent Act, 99 Stat. 1859; Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, \u00a7 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348 \u2014 both indicate that North Carolina was supposed to take \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to build a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. And North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly passed a state statute recognizing and accepting this responsibility. See N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7104G-4 (creating a state agency to \u201csite, finance, [and] build\u201d a waste disposal facility). How can it be that two years of inactivity followed by withdrawal satisfies this promise?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The answer, says the Court, is that any further \u201cappropriate steps\u201d would have cost a significant amount of money. <em>Ante, </em>at 346, 347. In 1997, the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission (Commission), the entity responsible for administering the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>pact, made clear that it would not advance North Carolina any more money toward building a facility. See App. 315. In response, North Carolina concluded that it was unwilling to fund the rest of the project itself. See <em>id., </em>at 317-319. And the Court agrees that it would have been \u201cimprudent\u201d for North Carolina to spend further funds, in light of the Commission\u2019s refusal to do so also. <em>Ante, </em>at 347,348.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">But this is an odd excuse. If a builder promises to \u201ctake appropriate steps\u201d to build me a house, the fact that he runs out of funds would not normally excuse his breaking his promise \u2014 at least if it is he, and not I, who is responsible for financing the project. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 9.6, p. 638 (3d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Farnsworth) (courts \u201cgenerally\u201d conclude that \u201cadditional expense\u201d \u201cdoes not rise to the level of impracticability\u201d so as to excuse a party from performance). And here it is North Carolina, and not anyone else, who bears ultimate responsibility for finding the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The text, structure, and purpose of the Compact all demonstrate this fact. As the Court recognizes, <em>ante, </em>at 335, the Compact expressly provides that the Commission \u201cis not responsible for any costs associated with ... the creation of any facility,\u201d Art. 4(E)(1), 99 Stat. 1876. Rather, the Compact States determined that each \u201cparty state\u201d should take a turn as the \u201chost state,\u201d during which time that State would be obligated to build a facility and then operate it for 20 years. See Art. 3(A), <em>id., </em>at 1873; Art. 5(A), <em>id., </em>at 1877; Art. 5(C), <em>ibid.; </em>Art. 5(E), 103 Stat. 1289; see also Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873-1874 (\u201cHost states are responsible for the availability, the subsequent post-closure observation and maintenance, and the extended institutional control of their regional facilities\u201d). The host State would then recover its upfront construction expenses from the considerable fees and surcharges charged to the waste generators served by the facility. N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 104G-15(a), (b) (repealed 2000) (\u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that the cost of all activities [toward siting, building, and operating a facility] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>borne by the waste generators\u201d who use it); Brief for Plaintiffs in Surreply to North Carolina\u2019s Reply 1, n. 1 (noting that a disposal facility in South Carolina collected over $47 million in fees in 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Of course, as the majority notes, South Carolina\u2019s withdrawal from the Compact <em>could </em>have affected North Carolina\u2019s ability to \u201crecoup\u201d its \u201cconstruction costs.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 349. But, as far as I am aware, North Carolina did not seriously seek to amend the Compact when South Carolina departed (even though the State had sought and obtained an amendment previously, see <em>ante, </em>at 352, n. 4; Brief for North Carolina in Reply to Exceptions by Plaintiffs to Reports of the Special Master 27), nor has it argued to this Court that South Carolina\u2019s departure voided its contractual obligations. Indeed, there is evidence in the record indicating that, even after South Carolina left the Compact, North Carolina continued to believe that the operation of a waste disposal facility presented a substantial financial opportunity. App. 255, 266 (Attachment to Letter from John H. MacMil-lan, Executive Director, North Carolina Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Authority, to Richard S. Hodes, M. D., Chairman, Southeast Compact Commission (Dec. 13, 1996)) (enclosing a business plan identifying $600 million in cost savings that could provide a \u201csubstantial return\u201d on the \u201cinvestment needed to put the North Carolina facility into operation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">I thus cannot conclude, as the majority does, that the Compact\u2019s rotational design, as I understand it, is \u201cfoolish.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 349. Rather, the Compact\u2019s structure represents what, in my view, was an understandable decision by the contracting States, all of whom needed a waste disposal facility, to bind themselves together so that each would take a turn \u201cbear[ing] the cos[t] of building\u201d the necessary facility. Preliminary Report of Special Master 21 (citing Art. 4(K), 99 Stat. 1876); see Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Board et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>16-18. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>This rotational approach is surely a sensible solution to the problems caused by the widespread existence of low-level nuclear waste and the political unpopularity of building the necessary facilities to house it. See <em>id., </em>at 13-16; <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, 505 </em>U. S. 144, 149-151 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The only contrary <em>evidence </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that indicates that North Carolina did not bear ultimate funding responsibility \u2014 consists of the fact that the Commission voluntarily advanced North Carolina nearly $80 million between 1988 and 1998 in order to help it defray its costs. Second Report 16. The Court believes that this \u201ccourse of performance\u201d demonstrates that, once the Commission turned off its monetary spigot, North Carolina was no longer required to do anything further. <em>Ante, </em>at 346-347. But why? If I advance my builder <em>half </em>the cost of a building, I have not thereby promised to advance him the <em>whole </em>cost. This is particularly true when the contract says I am responsible for <em>none </em>of the cost of the building. At the very least, something more in the circumstances would have to show that additional expenditure had become a reasonable expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In this case, nothing suggests that North Carolina could reasonably expect further financing assistance. Indeed, I can And nothing in the majority\u2019s opinion, or the record, that suggests that the Commission or the other Compact States intended to let North Carolina off the hook. And numerous documents indicate precisely the opposite \u2014 that despite the Commission\u2019s funding assistance, North Carolina was still responsible for funding the project. See, <em>e. g., </em>App. 63 (Resolution (Feb. 9, 1988)) (\u201c[T]he Commission, although not obligated to do so under the Compact,\u201d provides funding for North Carolina); <em>id., </em>at 215 (Letter from Richard S. Hodes, M. D., Chairman, Southeast Compact Commission, to James B. Hunt, Governor of North Carolina (Jan. 5, 1996)) (\u201cAt some point, Commission funds will no longer be available to North Carolina ..., and North Carolina will need to make alternate plans . . . \u201d); <em>id., </em>at 75 (Press Release by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>James G. Martin, Governor of North Carolina (Nov. 8,1989)) (\u201c\u2018The task of siting and operating a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility is a commitment the state of North Carolina has made and one which I am personally committed to keeping\u2019\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 92 (Letter from James G. Martin, Governor of North Carolina, to Carrol A. Campbell, Jr., Governor of South Carolina (Oct. 25, 1990)) (\u201cNorth Carolina remains committed to fulfilling its obligations to the Compact to serve as the next host state\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 183 (Letter from James B. Hunt, Jr., Governor of North Carolina, to David M. Beasley, Governor of South Carolina (Mar. 14, 1995)) (\u201cLet me assure you that North Carolina is committed to honoring its obligation to the Compact\u201d); Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6\u00b628, 33, 39 (other public statements about North Carolina\u2019s commitment to building a facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Without better evidence of a reallocation of funding responsibility, I can only conclude that North Carolina remained under an obligation to \u201ctake appropriate steps\u201d at all times relevant to this case. And North Carolina admittedly took <em>no steps </em>towards building a disposal facility from December 1997 to July 1999: It did no indepth study of the further financing that might be necessary; it made no serious effort to look for alternative funding; the Executive of the State did not ask its legislature for any appropriation. Rather, North Carolina simply withdrew from the Compact. <em>Ante, </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Of course, North Carolina was free to withdraw from the Compact. Art. 7(G), 99 Stat. 1879-1880. But that fact does not repair what, in my view, was a breach of a key contractual provision. See <em>Franconia Associates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>536 U. S. 129, 142-143 (2002) (\u201cFailure by the promisor to perform ... establishes an immediate breach\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7235(2) (1979) (\u201cWhen performance of a duty under a contract is due <em>any non-performance </em>is a breach\u201d (emphasis added)); 2 Farnsworth \u00a7 8.8, at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
