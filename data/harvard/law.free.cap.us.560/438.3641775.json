In an effort to make these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform, and effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub. L. 109-248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590. Among its provisions, the Act established a federal criminal offense covering, <em>inter alia, </em>any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(1) \u201cis required to register under [SORNA],\u201d (2) \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\u201d and (3) \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a registration.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a). At issue in this case is whether \u00a7 2250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred prior to SORNA\u2019s effective date and, if so, whether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. See Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. Liability under \u00a72250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel. We therefore do not address the <em>ex post facto </em>question.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in Alabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse. He was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but 2 years suspended. Receiving credit for time previously served, Carr was released on probation on July 3,2004, and he registered as a sex offender as required by Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA's enactment, Carr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He did not comply with Indiana\u2019s sex-offender registration requirements. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law enforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his involvement in a fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">On August 22,2007, federal prosecutors filed an indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in violation of \u00a7 2250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to SORNA\u2019s effective date, it would violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause to prosecute him under \u00a72250. The District Court denied Carr\u2019s motion, and Carr entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving his right to appeal. He received a 30-month prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit consolidated Carr\u2019s appeal with that of a similarly situated defendant, who, in addition to raising an <em>ex post facto </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>claim, asserted that \u00a7 2250, by its terms, does not apply to persons whose interstate travel preceded SORNA\u2019s enactment. Beginning with the statutory argument, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a72250 \u201cdoes not require that the defendant\u2019s travel postdate the Act.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). The court relied principally on its understanding of SORNA\u2019s underlying purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cThe evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted sex offenders registered in one state might move to another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the public unprotected. The concern is as acute in a ease in which the offender moved before the Act was passed as in one in which he moved afterward.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The court drew an analogy to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in or affecting commerce] any firearm or ammunition.\u201d \u201cThe danger posed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun crossed state lines . . . , and so it need not have crossed after the statute was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 582 (citing <em>Scarborough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U. S. 563 (1977)). According to the court, \u00a7 2250(a), like \u00a7 922(g), uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element \u201cto establish a constitutional predicate for the statute . . . rather than to create a temporal requirement.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Reading \u00a72250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the Seventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Husted, </em>545 F. 3d 1240 (2008). In holding that \u00a7 2250\u2019s coverage \u201cis limited to those individuals who travel in interstate commerce after the Act\u2019s effective date,\u201d the Tenth Circuit emphasized \u201cCongress\u2019s use of the present tense form of the verb \u2018to travel\u2019 . . . , which according to ordinary English grammar, does not refer to travel that has already occurred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1243-1244. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Rejecting this analysis, the Seventh Circuit characterized Congress\u2019 choice of tenses as \u201c'not very revealing.\u2019\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting <em>Scarborough, </em>431 U. S., at 571).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Having dispensed with the statutory question, the Seventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co-appellant that predicating a \u00a7 2250 prosecution on pre-SORNA travel violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Reliance on a defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded, poses no <em>ex post facto </em>problem so long as the defendant had \u201creasonable time\u201d to register after SORNA took effect but failed to do so. 551 F. 3d, at 585. Noting that Carr remained unregistered five months after SORNA became applicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his conviction. <em>Id., </em>at 586-587. The court reversed the conviction of Carr\u2019s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a sufficient grace period to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In view of the division among the Circuits as to the meaning of \u00a7 2250\u2019s \u201ctravel\u201d requirement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we granted certiorari, 557 U. S. 965 (2009), to decide the statute\u2019s applicability to pre-SORNA travel and, if necessary, to consider the statute\u2019s compliance with the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As relevant here, \u00a7 2250 provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>For a defendant to violate this provision, Carr and the Government agree, the statute\u2019s three elements must \u201cbe satisfied in sequence, culminating in a post-SORNA failure to register.\u201d Brief for United States 13; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 4,7, n. 6. A sequential reading, the parties recognize, helps to ensure a nexus between a defendant\u2019s interstate travel and his failure to register as a sex offender. Persons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their State of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \u00a7 2250 even if they had not left the State after being convicted \u2014 an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201c(a) In General \u2014 Whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201c(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201c(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act by reason of a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice), the law of the District of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-7\">\u201c(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am1\">\u201c(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>While both parties accept that the elements of \u00a72250 should be read sequentially, they disagree on the event that sets the sequence in motion. In the Government\u2019s view, the statute is triggered by a sex-offense conviction, which must be followed by interstate travel, and then a failure to register under SORNA. Only the last of these events, the Government maintains, must occur after SORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel may both have predated the statute\u2019s enactment. Carr, in contrast, asserts that the statutory sequence begins when a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. The person must then travel in interstate commerce and thereafter fail to register. All of these events, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA\u2019s enactment because a sex offender could not have been required to register under SORNA until SORNA became the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Carr\u2019s interpretation better accords with the statutory text. By its terms, the first element of \u00a7 2250(a) can only be satisfied when a person \u201cis required to register <em>under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u00a7 2250(a)(1) (emph\u00e1sis added). In an attempt to reconcile its preferred construction with the words of the statute, the Government insists that this language is merely \u201ca shorthand way of identifying those persons who have a [sex-offense] conviction in the classes identified by SORNA.\u201d Brief for United States 19-20. To reach this conclusion, the Government observes that another provision of SORNA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16913(a), states that the Act\u2019s registration requirements apply to \u201csex offender[s].\u201d A \u201csex offender\u201d is elsewhere defined as \u201can individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d \u00a7 16911(1). Thus, as the Government would have it, Congress used 12 words and two implied cross-references to establish that the first element of \u00a7 2250(a) is that a person has been convict\u00e9d of a sex offense. Such contortions can scarcely be called \u201cshorthand.\u201d It is far more sensible to conclude that Congress meant the first precondition to \u00a7 2250 liability to be the one it listed first: a \u201crequire[ment] to register under [SORNA].\u201d Once a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, which can occur only after the statute\u2019s effective date, that person can be convicted under \u00a72250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">That \u00a7 2250 sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>feet (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces the conclusion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute\u2019s compass. Consistent with normal usage, we have frequently looked to Congress\u2019 choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute\u2019s temporal reach. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>503 U. S. 329, 333 (1992) (\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes\u201d); <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., </em>484 U. S. 49, 57 (1987) (\u201cCongress could have phrased its requirement in language that looked to the past . . . , but it did not choose this readily available option\u201d); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 U. S. 212, 216 (1976) (observing that Congress used the present perfect tense to \u201cdenot[e] an act that has been completed\u201d). The Dictionary Act also ascribes significance to verb tense. It provides that, \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwisef,]... words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. By implication, then, the Dictionary Act instructs that the present tense generally does not include the past. Accordingly, a statute that regulates a person who \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect. Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent identifies any instance in which this Court has construed a present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In this instance, the statutory context strongly supports a forward-looking construction of \u201ctravels.\u201d First, the word \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) by a series of other present-tense <em>verbs </em>\u2014 \u201centers or <em>leaves, </em>or <em>resides </em>in, Indian country.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This Court has previously described a statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the present tense\u201d as a \u201cstriking indie[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective orientation.\u201d <em>Gwaltney, </em>484 U. S., at 59. The Seventh Circuit thought otherwise, reasoning that it would \u201cmak[e] no sense\u201d for \u201ca sex offender who has resided in Indian country since long before the Act was passed [to be] subject to the Act but not someone who crossed state lines before the Act was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583. As a textual matter, however, it is the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach that makes little sense: If \u201ctravels\u201d means \u201ctraveled\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>a person \u201ctravels\u201d if he crossed state lines <em>before </em>SORNA\u2019s enactment), then the only way to avoid an incongruity among neighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase \u201cresides i[n] Indian country\u201d to encompass persons who once resided in Indian country but who left before SORNA\u2019s enactment and have not since returned \u2014 an implausible reading that neither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Government, nor the dissent endorses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Second, the other elements of a \u00a72250 violation are similarly set forth in the present tense. Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who <em>\u201cis </em>required to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who \u201cknowingly <em>fails </em>to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Government accepts that this last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>element \u2014 a knowing failure to register or update a registration \u2014 must postdate SORNA\u2019s enactment. Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy the first two requirements of \u00a7 2250 but not the third, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to convey this meaning. Indeed, numerous federal statutes use the past-perfect tense to describe one or more elements of a criminal offense when coverage of preenactment events is intended. See, <em>e. g., </em>18 U. S. C. \u00a7249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (2006 ed., Supp. Ill) (proscribing hate crimes in which \u201cthe defendant employs a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon that <em>has traveled </em>in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 922(g)(9) (2006 ed.) (proscribing firearm possession or transport by any person \u201cwho <em>has been con</em>victed\u201d of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (emphasis added)); \u00a7 2252(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (making it unlawful for any person to receive or distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct that <em>\u201chas been mailed, </em>or <em>has been shipped or transported </em>in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce\u201d (emphasis added)). The absence of similar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that \u00a7 2250 targets only posten-actment travel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Echoing the Seventh Circuit\u2019s assessment that Congress\u2019 use of present-tense verbs in \u00a7 2250 is \u201cnot very revealing,\u201d Brief for United States 17, the Government offers two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover pre-SORNA travel: First, such a reading avoids an \u201canomaly\u201d in the statute\u2019s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders; and second, it \u201cbetter effectuates the statutory purpose,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 22 (capitalization omitted). Neither argument persuades us to adopt the Government\u2019s strained reading of the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender \u201cby reason of a conviction under Federal law . . . , the law of the District of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under SORNA who \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country,\u201d \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B). According to the Government, these categories correspond to \u201ctwo alternate sources of power to achieve Congress\u2019s aim of broadly registering sex offenders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 22. Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the statute's coverage, the Government maintains, \u201censures that the jurisdictional reach of Section 2250(a)(2) has a comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Government\u2019s pronouncement that \u00a7 2250 should have an \u201cequally broad sweep\u201d with respect to federal and state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>offenders, <em>id., </em>at 22, is little more than <em>ipse dixit. </em>Had Congress intended to subject any unregistered state sex offender who has ever traveled in interstate commerce to federal prosecution under \u00a72250, it easily could have adopted language to that effect. That it declined to do so indicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal and state sex offenders differently. There is nothing \u201canomalous]\u201d about such a choice. To the contrary, it is entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by federal sex offenders \u2014 persons who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reasonable for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after SORNA\u2019s enactment, they use the channels of interstate commerce in evading a State\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In this regard, it is notable that the federal sex-offender registration laws have, from their inception, expressly relied on state-level enforcement. Indeed, when it initially set national standards for state sex-offender registration programs in 1994, Congress did not include any federal criminal liability. Congress instead conditioned certain federal funds on States\u2019 adoption of \u201ccriminal penalties\u201d on any person \u201crequired to register under a State program ... who knowingly fails to so register and keep such registration current.\u201d Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub. L. 103-322, Tit. XVII, \u00a7 170101(c), 108 Stat. 2041, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 14071(d). Two years later, Congress supplemented state enforcement mechanisms by subjecting to federal prosecution any covered sex offender who \u201cchanges address to a State other than the State in which the person resided at the time of the immediately preceding registration\u201d and \u201cknowingly fails to\u201d register as required. Pam Lyehner Sexual Offender Tracking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Identification Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-236, \u00a72,110 Stat. 3095, 3096, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14072(g)(3), (i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prospective orientation of this provision is apparent. No statutory gap necessitated coverage of unregistered offenders who \u201cchange[d] address\u201d before the statute\u2019s enactment; the prosecution of such persons remained the province of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic allocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen state enforcement of registration requirements, Congress established, as a funding condition, that \u201c[e]ach jurisdiction, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter.\u201d \u00a7 16913(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Meanwhile, Congress in \u00a7 2250 exposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, persons required to register under SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a direct supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of the statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm Congress sought to punish serves to distinguish \u00a7 2250 from the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh Circuit analogized. See 551 F. 3d, at 582-583. In <em>Scarborough, </em>this Court held that a prior version of the statute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted felon who \u201c \u2018pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>sesses ... in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm/\u201d 481 U.S., at 564 (quoting 18 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the Government to prove posten-actment movement of the firearm across state lines. According to the Court, Congress had given \u201cno indication of any concern with either the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time of acquisition.\u201d 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply \u201cto keep guns out of the hands of\u201d convicted felons, <em>ibid., </em>and, by using the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce,\u201d it invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause authority to achieve that end. No one in <em>Scarborough </em>disputed, however, that the act of possession had to occur postenactment; a felon who \u201cpossess[ed]\u201d a firearm only preenactment was plainly outside the statute\u2019s sweep. In this case, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit suggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who \u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In a final effort to justify its position, the Government invokes one of SORNA\u2019s underlying purposes: to locate sex offenders who had failed to abide by their registration obligations. SORNA, the Government observes, was motivated at least in part by Congress\u2019 concern about these \u201cmissing\u201d sex offenders \u2014 a problem the House Committee on the Judiciary expressly linked to interstate travel: \u201cThe most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth in the Nation[,] are \u2018missing/ meaning they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements. This typically occurs when the sex offender moves from one State to another.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>goal of tracking down missing sex offenders, the Government maintains, \u201cis surely better served by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their new States of residence immediately than by waiting for them to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register yet again.\u201d Brief for United States 23-24. The Court of Appeals expressed a similar view. See 551 F. 3d, at 582.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Government\u2019s argument confuses a general goal of SORNA with the specific purpose of \u00a72250. Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16901 (\u201cCongress in this chapter establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders\u201d). Among its many provisions, SORNA instructs States to maintain sex-offender registries that compile an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>array of information about sex offenders, \u00a716914; to make this information publicly available online, \u00a716918; to share the information with other jurisdictions and with the Attorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive national sex-offender registry, \u00a7\u00a716919-16921; and to \u201cprovide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter,\u201d \u00a7 16913(e). Sex offenders, in turn, are required to \u201cregister, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student,\u201d \u00a7 16913(a), and to appear in person periodically to \u201callow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and verify the information in each registry in which that offender is required to be registered,\u201d \u00a7 16916. By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these provisions, not \u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019 effort to account for missing sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the number of noncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the specific policy choice Congress made in enacting \u00a72250. While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under \u00a7 2250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal. Taking account of SORNA\u2019s overall structure, we have little reason to doubt that Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce. Cf. <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Hewitt Associates, </em>508 U. S. 248, 261 (1993) (\u201c[Vjague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic purpose\u2019 are . . . inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the <em>specific </em>issue under consideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AXj3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evidence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this reading into question. To the contrary, the Report of the House Judiciary Committee suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Congress\u2019 goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt. As the Government acknowledges, the bill under consideration by the Committee contained a version of \u00a72250 that \u201cwould not have reached pre-enactment interstate travel.\u201d Brief for United States 24, n. 9. This earlier version imposed federal criminal penalties on any person who \u201creceives a notice from an official that such person is required to register under [SORNA] and ... thereafter travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves Indian country.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 9; see also <em>id., </em>at 26 (\u201c[S]ex offenders will now face Federal prosecution ... if they cross a State line and fail to comply with the sex offender registration and notification requirements contained in the legislation\u201d). Yet this did not stop the Committee from describing its legislation as a solution to the problem of missing sex offenders. See <em>id., </em>at 28-24, 26, 45-46. The Government identifies nothing in the legislative record to suggest that, in modifying this language during the course of the legislative process, Congress intended to alter the statute\u2019s temporal sweep.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the very least, the close correspondence between the Committee\u2019s discussion of missing sex offenders and its recognition of the travel element\u2019s prospective application would seem to confirm that reading \u00a7 2250 to reach only post-enactment travel does not contravene SORNA\u2019s underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>purposes, let alone result in an absurdity that would compel us to disregard the statutory text. Cf. <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>548 U. S. 291, 296 (2006) (\u201cWe have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the statutory language is plain, the sole function of the courts \u2014 at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd \u2014 is to enforce it according to its terms\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Having concluded that \u00a7 2250 does not extend to preenactment travel, we need not consider whether such a construction would present difficulties under the Constitution\u2019s <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have confronted the question directly, other Circuits have also touched on it. Aligning itself with the Seventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has analogized 18 U. S. C. 12250(a) to the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7 922(g), and applied it to a sex offender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dumont, </em>555 F. 3d 1288, 1291-1292 (2009) <em>(per curiam). </em>In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has stated in dictum that \u00a7 2250(a) \u201cpunishes convicted sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce <em>after the enactment of SORNA\u201d United States </em>v. <em>May, </em>535 F. 3d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> There is a separate conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to when SORNA\u2019s registration requirements became applicable to persons convicted of sex offenses prior to the statute\u2019s enactment. Several Circuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act did not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided for their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a7 72.3). See, e. <em>g., United States </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>560 F. 3d 222, 226-229 (CA4 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>583 F. 3d 408, 414-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>419 (CA6 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>551 F. 3d 578, 582 (CA7 2008) (case below); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>528 F. 3d 852, 857-859 (CA11 2008) <em>(per curiam). </em>Other Circuits have held that persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions became subject to the Act\u2019s registration requirements upon the statute\u2019s enactment in July 2006. See, <em>e. g., May, </em>535 F. 3d, at 915-919; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>550 F. 3d 926, 929-935 (CA10 2008). Because Carr traveled from Alabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether a pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred between July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under \u00a72250, and we express no view on that question. We similarly express no view as to whether \u00a7 72.3 was properly promulgated \u2014 a question that has also divided the Circuits. Compare <em>Cain, </em>583 F. 3d, at 419-424 (holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for issuing the interim regulation without adhering to the notice-and-comment and publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>604 F. 3d 1275, 1278-1282 (CA11 2010) (finding no APA violation); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>568 F. 3d 459, 469-470 (CA4 2009) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> For persons convicted of sex offenses under federal or Indian tribal law, interstate travel is not a prerequisite to \u00a7 2250 liability.

This occurs, the dissent maintains, \u201cwhen an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 465. The dissent\u2019s account cannot be squared with the statutory text. \u201c[T]he first act necessary for conviction\u201d under \u00a7 2250(a) is not a predicate sex-offense conviction. It is a requirement \u201cto register under [SORNA].\u201d \u00a7 2250(a)(1). Thus, even if the dissent is correct that legislative drafters do not invariably use the moment of enactment to mark the dividing line between covered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b496-5\"> The Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit decision for the proposition that \u201c\u2018the present tense is commonly used to refer to past, present, and future all at the same time.\u2019 \u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting <em>Coalition for Clean Air </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co., </em>971 F. 2d 219, 225 (1992)). Neither court offered examples of such usage. Perhaps, as the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there may be instances in which \u201ccontext\u201d supports this sort of omnitemporality, but it is not the typical understanding of the present tense in either normal discourse or statutory construction. Taken in context, the word \u201ctravels\u201d as it appears in \u00a72250 is indistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that appear in myriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a prospective basis. Examining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>criminal law with a travel element similar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed that \u201cthe present tense verb \u2018travels,\u2019 most sensibly read, does not refer to travel that occurred in the past\u2014 that is, before the enactment of the statute.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>480 F. 3d 1014, 1019 (2007) (interpreting 18 U.

All of these examples appear in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16911, a definitional section that merely elucidates the meaning of certain statutory terms and proscribes no conduct. All but two of the provisions, moreover, rely on the term \u201csex offender,\u201d which \u00a716911(1) defines to mean \u201can individual who <em>was convicted </em>of a sex offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remaining provisions are \u00a7 16911(7), which simply uses \u201cinvolves\u201d rather than \u201cinvolved\u201d to define whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cspecified offense against a minor,\u201d and \u00a7 16911(8), which makes plain that its present-tense reference to an offender\u2019s age refers to age \u201cat the time of the offense.\u201d These examples thus provide scant support for the proposition that \u00a72250 uses \u201ctravels\u201d to refer to pre-SORNA travel. Given the well-established presumption against retroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar on <em>ex post facto </em>laws, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the ease that a statutory prohibition set forth in the present tense applies by default to acts completed before the statute's enactment. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>529 U.

See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14072(c), (g)(2), (i). SORNA does not include a similar FBI registration requirement, presumably because, by the time of the statute\u2019s enactment, \u201cevery State . .. had enacted some\u201d type of registration system. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.

The dissent sees \u201cno apparent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a requirement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Yet the dissent approves an even greater impairment. Addressing a dispute we leave unresolved, see n. 2, <em>supra, </em>the dissent would hold that, in enacting SORNA, \u201cCongress remained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 467. The dissent\u2019s view, in other words, is that SORNA does not apply of its own force to <em>any </em>sex offenders convicted prior to the statute\u2019s enactment \u2014 a reading wholly inconsistent with the dissent\u2019s description of SORNA as \u201ca response to a dangerous gap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 470. If, as the dissent accepts, Congress left open the possibility that <em>no </em>preenaetment offenders would face liability under \u00a72250, then it is certainly not unreasonable to conclude that Congress limited the statute\u2019s coverage to offenders who travel after its enactment..

S. C. \u00a7 2250(a), a provision of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) that is designed to prevent dangerous sex offenders from evading registration requirements. SORNA requires convicted sex offenders to register, and to keep their registrations current, in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16913, and the provision at issue here, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2250(a), makes it a crime for a convicted sex offender who moves in interstate commerce<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to fail to abide by the Act\u2019s registration requirements. The question that we must decide is whether \u00a7 2250(a) applies only to those sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce after SORNA became law or whether the statute also reaches sex offenders, like petitioner, who were convicted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and traveled before SORNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>took effect but violated the registration requirement after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Court\u2019s answer is that \u00a7 2250(a) applies only to sex offenders who moved from State to State after SORNA became law. The Court reaches this conclusion for two reasons: (1) the verb tense used in \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B); and (2) the sequence in which the elements of the offense are listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">As I will attempt to show, the Court\u2019s textual arguments \u00e1re thoroughly unsound. And the conclusion that the Court reaches makes no sense. To appreciate the folly of the Court\u2019s interpretation, consider the following two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The first involves a situation in which, for present purposes, I assume that \u00a7 2250(a) applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A man convicted in State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in that State and then, after the enactment of SORNA, moves to State B and fails to register as required by State B law Section 2250(a) makes this offender\u2019s failure to register in State B a federal crime because his interstate movement frustrates SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. Because this offender is convicted and then released from custody in State A, the State A authorities know of his presence in their State and are thus in a position to try to ensure that he remains registered. At the time of his release, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and they can make sure that he registers as required by state law. Thereafter, they can periodically check the address at which he is registered to confirm that he still resides there. And even if he moves without warning to some other address in the State, they can try to track him down. Once this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities in that State are severely limited in their ability to monitor his movements. And because the State B authorities have no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a great disadvantage in trying to enforce State B\u2019s registration law. Congress enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00a7 2250(a) in order to punish and deter interstate movement that seriously undermines the enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The second case is the same as the first in all respects except that the sex offender travels from State A to State B before SORNA\u2019s enactment. In other words, the sex offender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after SORNA takes effect, he fails to register in State B, as SORNA requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to treat the second case any differently from the first? In both cases, a sex offender\u2019s interstate movement frustrates enforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. In both cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex offender\u2019s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the presence of a potentially dangerous person in their community, and the State B law enforcement authorities are hampered in their ability to protect the public. The second case is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers no plausible explanation why Congress might have wanted to treat this case any differently from the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">If the text of \u00a7 2250(a) commanded this result, we would, of eourse, be obligated to heed that command. But the text of \u00a7 2250(a) dictates no such thing. On the contrary, when properly read, it reaches both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u2018Whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">\u201c(2) ...

Brief for Petitioner 15. \u201c[I]n ordinary usage it refers to current or future travel.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to petitioner, our \u201cinquiry in this case should go no further than the plain language of \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B), which applies to a person who 'travels\u2019 in interstate commerce. Congress\u2019s use of the present tense is unambiguous, and the statutory language accordingly should be the end of the matter.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 16-17; see also <em>id., </em>at 17 (use of the present tense \u201ctravels\u201d is \u201cdispositive\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 18 (\u201c[T]he use of the present tense in the statute should be decisive\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 21 (use of the present tense \u201cis enough to dispose of this case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">A bad argument does not improve with repetition. And petitioner\u2019s argument fails because it begs the relevant question. Petitioner belabors the obvious \u2014 that the present tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in the past \u2014 but studiously avoids the critical question: At what point in time does \u00a7 2250(a) speak? Does it speak as of the time when SORNA took effect? Or does it speak as of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>time when the proscribed conduct occurs? Without knowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is impossible to tell what is past and what is present or future.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The unspoken premise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 2250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law. And if that premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the present tense in \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite interstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took effect. Petitioner\u2019s premise, however, flies in the face of the widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention that a law should <em>not </em>be read to speak as of the date of enactment. The United States Senate Legislative Drafting Manual directly addresses this point: \u201cA legislative provision speaks as of any date on which it is read <em>(rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u201d </em>Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual \u00a7 103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis added). The House Manual makes the same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201cYour draft should be a movable feast \u2014 that is, it speaks as of whatever time it is being read <em>(rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u201d </em>House Legislative Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \u00a7 102(c), p. 2 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In accordance with this convention, modern legislative drafting manuals teach that, except in unusual circumstances, all laws, including penal statutes, should be written in the present tense. The Senate Manual, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 103(a), at 4, states: \u201cAlways use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.\u201d Similarly, the House Manual, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 102(c), at 2, advises: \u201cStay in the Present. \u2014 Whenever possible, use the present tense (rather than the past or future).\u201d Numerous state legislative drafting manuals and other similar handbooks hammer home this same point. See, <em>e. g., </em>Colorado Legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Drafting Manual, p. 5-15 (2009), online at http://www.state. co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/LDM/OLLS_Drafting_Manual.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 26, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (\u201cProvisions should generally be stated in the present tense\u201d); Hawaii Legislative Drafting Manual 21 (K. Takayama rev. 9th ed. 2007 reprint), online at http://www.state.hi.us/lrb/rpts96/dftman.pdf (\u201cUse the present tense and indicative mood\u201d); Legislative Research Comm\u2019n, Bill Drafting Manual for the Kentucky General Assembly \u00a7304, p. 19 (rev. 14th ed. 2004) (\u201cUse the present tense and the indicative mood\u201d); Maine Legislative Drafting Manual 78 (rev. 2009) (\u201cLaws are meant to be of continuing application and should be written in the present tense\u201d); Massachusetts General Court, Legislative Research and Drafting Manual 16 (5th ed. 2010) (\u201cUse the present tense and the indicative mood\u201d); New Mexico Legislative Council Service, Legislative Drafting Manual 105 (2004 update) (\u201cStatutes are written in the present tense, not the future tense\u201d); Texas Legislative Council Drafting Manual \u00a77.35, p. Ill (2008) (\u201cUse present tense whenever possible\u201d); West 'Virginia Legislature Bill Drafting Manual 22 (rev. 2006), online at http://www.legis.state.wv.us/joint/Bill_Drafting/ Drafting_Manual.pdf (\u201cAvoid future tense (will be paid) and future perfect tense (will have been paid). Use present tense (is paid)\u201d); see also Ohio Legislative Service Comm\u2019n, Rule Drafting Manual 47 (4th ed. 2006), online at http:// www.lsc.state.oh.us/rules/rdm06_06.pdf (\u201cUse present tense. The majority of rules have a continuing effect in that they apply over time. They speak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their adoption. The present tense therefore includes the Mure tense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Once it is recognized that \u00a7 2250(a) should not be read as speaking as of the date when SORNA went into effect, petitioner\u2019s argument about the use of the present tense collapses. In accordance with current drafting conventions, \u00a7 2250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>effect, but as of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed. In the case of \u00a7 2250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For present purposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this event may have occurred before SORNA was enacted. Viewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction takes place, every subsequent act, including movement from State to State, occurs in the future and is thus properly described using the present tense. Accordingly, \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s use of the present tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) supports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like petitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction but before SORNA went into effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Petitioner\u2019s present-tense argument is particularly perverse in light of the context in which \u00a7 2250(a) was adopted. When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not to decide for itself whether the Act\u2019s registration requirements \u2014 and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties \u2014 would apply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex offenses before SORNA took effect. Instead, Congress delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide that question. See \u00a7 113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16913(d) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this Act\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to this delegation, the Attorney General in 2007 issued an interim rule providing that SORNA applies to preenactment convictions. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a7 72.3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Petitioner contends that, if Congress had wanted to make \u00a7 2250(a) applicable to sex offenders who traveled in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect, Congress could have referred in \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) to a person who \u201ctraveled,\u201d \u201chas traveled,\u201d or, at the time of the statute's enactment, \u201chad traveled\u201d in interstate commerce. Brief for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any such phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested that \u00a7 2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions\u2014 the very question that Congress chose not to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A brief explanation is needed to make clear why wording \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect or past perfect tense) would have had such an effect. The Court and I agree that \u00a7 2250(a) applies only to persons who travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted of a qualifying sex offense. See <em>ante, </em>at 446; <em>infra, </em>at 469. Therefore, if \u00a7 2250(a) had been phrased in the past tense (or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would seem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches pre-SORNA convictions. By using the present tense, Congress remained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions and left that question open for the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The conclusion that \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) embraces pre-SORNA travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few other SORNA provisions that plainly use the present tense to refer to events that, as a result of the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, may have occurred before SORNA took effect. For example, an individual may qualify as a \u201ctier IT sex offender\u201d under the Act if, among other things, his sex offense <em>\u201cinvolves </em>... (i) use of a minor in a sexual performance; (ii) solicitation of a minor to practice prostitution; or (iii) production or distribution of child pornography.\u201d 42 U. S. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00a716911(3)(B) (emphasis added); see also \u00a716911(4)(B) (offense <em>\u201cinvolves </em>kidnapping of a minor\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 16911(7) (offense \u201cinvolves\u201d certain specified conduct). Similarly, a sex offender can qualify as a \u201ctier II sex offender\u201d if his sex offense <em>\u201coccurs </em>after the offender <em>becomes </em>a tier I sex offender.\u201d \u00a7 16911(3)(C) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 16911(4)(C) (offense <em>\u201coccurs </em>after the offender <em>becomes </em>a tier II sex offender\u201d (emphasis added)). A juvenile adjudication, moreover, may qualify as a conviction for purposes of the Act only if, among other things, the \u201coffender <em>is </em>14 years of age or older at the time of the offense.\u201d \u00a716911(8) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Congress cast all of these provisions in the present tense, but now that the Attorney General has made SORNA applicable to individuals with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions, all of these provisions must necessarily be interpreted as embracing preenactment conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AJh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Court\u2019s second reason for holding that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2250(a) reaches only post-SORNA travel is based on the sequence in which the elements of \u00a7 2250(a) are listed. The Court concludes (and I agree) that the first listed element (subsection (a)(1) (\u201cis required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\u201d)) cannot have been violated until the Act took effect. The Court then reasons that the third listed element (subsection (a)(2)(B) (\u201ctravels in interstate ... commerce\u201d)) must be violated after the first. See <em>ante, </em>at 446. The Court explains: \u201cPersons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their State of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \u00a72250 even if they had not left the State after being convicted \u2014 an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, the Court reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the statute as reaching a person who first moves from State A to State B, then commits and is convicted of a qualifying sex offense in State B, and subsequently, upon release from custody in State B, fails to register as required under the law of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">I agree with the Court that there is a good argument that \u00a7 2250(a) should not be read to apply to such a case, where there is little if any connection between the offender\u2019s prior interstate movement and his subsequent failure to register. In the two hypothetical cases discussed at the beginning of this opinion, the offender\u2019s interstate movement seriously frustrated the ability of the law enforcement authorities in his new State (State B) to enforce its registration requirements. By contrast, where an offender\u2019s interstate movement predates his sex offense and conviction, his interstate movement has little if any effect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in State B to enforce that State\u2019s laws. When a sex offender is released from custody in State B, the ability of the State B authorities to enforce that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>State\u2019s registration laws would appear to be the same regardless of whether that offender had lived his entire life in that State or had moved to the State prior to committing the offense for which he was convicted. Accordingly, it can be argued that Congress cannot have meant to reach this situation. As the Seventh Circuit put it, \u201c[s]ince the statutory aim is to prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing registration by leaving the state in which he is registered, it can be argued that the travel must postdate the conviction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). It can also be argued that a broader construction would mean that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">What the Court\u2019s argument shows, however, is not that the interstate travel required by \u00a7 2250(a) must come <em>after SORNA\u2019s enactment. </em>Rather, what the Court\u2019s argument suggests is that the interstate travel must come <em>after the sex-offense conviction. </em>And because, under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General, \u00a7 2250(a) reaches pre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support the Court\u2019s conclusion that the interstate travel needed under \u00a7 2250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a result that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum go back and verify that the textual analysis is correct. Here, not only are the Court\u2019s textual arguments unsound for the reasons explained above, but the indefensible results produced by the Court\u2019s interpretation should have led the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws. In the years prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by cases in which children had been raped and murdered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>persons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police, were convicted sex offenders. In response, Congress and state legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of sex offenders. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U. S. 84, 89-90 (2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17,108 Stat. 2038; Megan\u2019s Law, 110 Stat. 1345. Despite those efforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex offenders \u2014 nearly one-fifth of the Nation\u2019s total sex-offender population \u2014 remained unregistered. H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The principal problem, a House Report determined, was that sex offenders commonly moved from one State to another and then failed to register in their new State of residence. <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, interstate travel was dangerously undermining the effectiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Interpreting \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment travel severely impairs \u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness. As interpreted by the Court, \u00a7 2250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex offender only if that offender traveled in interstate commerce at some point <em>after </em>SORNA\u2019s enactment. As the examples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illustrate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a requirement. To the contrary, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, the many sex offenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registration regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another before SORNA\u2019s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws. It surely better serves the enforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements to apply \u00a7 2250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless of whether their interstate travel occurred before or after the statute\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its analysis produces. The Court suggests that enhanced information collection and sharing and state enforcement of registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>wield in order to deal with those convicted sex offenders whose whereabouts were unknown when SORNA was passed. See <em>ante, </em>at 454-456. I see no basis for this conclusion. There can be no dispute that the enactment of \u00a7 2250(a) shows that Congress did not think these measures were sufficient to deal with persons who have qualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from State to State after SORNA\u2019s enactment. And in light of that congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason to think that Congress concluded that these same measures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex-offense convictions who had already disappeared at the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court has no answer, and I submit that there is none.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Seventh Circuit, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> Section 2250(a) also applies to persons with federal sex-offense convictions, those who travel in foreign commerce, and those who enter, leave, or reside in Indian country. For convenience, I will refer in this opinion solely to interstate travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> The Court holds only that \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) does not apply to a person who moved in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect. The Court does not address the separate question whether \u00a7 2250(a) may validly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense before SORNA was enacted. Congress delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide whether the Act\u2019s registration requirements \u2014 and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties \u2014 should apply to persons in the latter category, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16913(d), and the Attorney General has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR \u00a7 72.3 (2009)). Because the Court does not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the assumption that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> See n. 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-5\"> Under 42 U.

The Court relies on the artificial argument that the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2250(a) is the failure to register, <em>ante, </em>at 446-447, and n. 4, but in real-world terms the first necessary act is plainly the commission of a qualifying offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Contrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, see <em>ante, </em>at 448-449, <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., </em>484 U.

C. \u00a7 1365(a), which authorizes suit against any person \u201calleged to be in violation\u201d of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.

Section 2250(a) contains no similar specification. Moreover, the <em>Gwaltney </em>Court did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time when the provision was enacted. As noted above, however, the silent premise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 2250(a) must be read as speaking as of the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\"> To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements apply by the Act\u2019s own terms to those individuals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA\u2019s enactment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>550 F. 3d 926, 929-935 (CA10 2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>May, </em>535 F. 3d 912, 918-919 (CA8 2008). Other Courts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA\u2019s explicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the Act\u2019s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies that the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney General\u2019s regulation. See,e. <em>g., United States </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>583 F. 3d 408, 414-415, 419 (CA6 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>560 F. 3d 222, 226-229 (CA4 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008) (case below); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>528 F. 3d 852, 856-859 (CA11 2008) <em>(per curiam). </em>Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have the better of the argument. Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the Attorney General the \u201cauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of [the] Act.\u201d 120 Stat. 594,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 16913(d). The clear negative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determination by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two examples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule contemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s interstate-travel requirement. See 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (Example 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> That many of these provisions rely on \u00a7 16911(l)\u2019s definition of the term \u201csex offender\u201d changes nothing. See <em>ante, </em>at 450-451, n. 6. Had the Attorney General not exercised his discretion to make SORNA\u2019s registration requirements applicable to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions, all of these provisions would have applied to only postenaetment conduct \u2014 notwithstanding \u00a7 16911(l)\u2019s reference to \u201can individual who <em>was convicted </em>of a sex offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But now that the Attorney General has so exercised his discretion, all of these present-tense-phrased provisions necessarily must be interpreted as reaching preenaetment conduct. The same conclusion should follow with respect to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Additionally, I do not suggest that the \u201cdefault\u201d rule is that provisions written in the present tense apply to past conduct. To the contrary, I had thought it an uncontroversial proposition of statutory interpretation that statutes must be interpreted in context. See, e. <em>g., United States Nat. Bank of Ore. </em>v. <em>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., </em>508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993); see also 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. And when \u00a7 2250(a) is read with an eye to the context in which SORNA was enacted, it becomes quite clear that \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) should be interpreted as reaching preenactment travel. Giving effect to those contextual indicators, moreover, does not offend the presumption against retroactivity or the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. See n. 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b520-5\"> Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see <em>ante, </em>at 455, n. 9, it is no answer to point to Congress\u2019 decision to delegate to the Attorney General the responsibility of deciding whether \u00a7 2250(a) should reach persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions. Of course, that delegation created the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that \u00a7 2250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it would likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be required. (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a strong argument that \u00a7 2250(a) requires interstate travel that comes after a qualifying conviction.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Now that the Attorney General has decided that \u00a7 2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions, however, the relevant question is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions and pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions and post-SORNA travel? And to this question, the Court offers no plausible answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting \u00a7 2250(a) (2)(B) to reach preenactment travel renders the statute an unlawful <em>ex post facto </em>law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 9, el. 8. Petitioner remained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation of the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions. For essentially the reasons explained by the Court of Appeals, see 551 F. 3d, at 585-587, I would reject petitioner\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
