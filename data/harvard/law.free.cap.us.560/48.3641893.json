The sentence was imposed by the State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the sentence under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Gruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em>370 U. S. 660 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on January 6, 1987. Graham\u2019s parents were addicted to crack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early years. Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in elementary school. He began drinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked marijuana at age 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three other school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. One youth, who worked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just before closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing masks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham\u2019s masked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager in the back of the head with a metal bar. When the manager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two youths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third accomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for his head injury. No money was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under Florida law, it is within a prosecutor\u2019s discretion whether to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for most felony crimes. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 985.227(l)(b) (2003) (subsequently renumbered at \u00a7 985.557(l)(b) (2007)). Graham\u2019s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult. The charges against Graham were armed burglary with assault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \u00a7\u00a7 810.02(l)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted armed robbery, a second-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>felony carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment, \u00a7\u00a7 812.13(2)(b), 777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both charges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to the trial court. After reciting \u201cthis is my first and last time getting in trouble,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to turn my life around.\u201d App. 379-380. Graham said, \u201cI made a promise to God and myself that if I get a second chance, I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National Football League].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of probation. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of his probation in the county jail, but he received credit for the time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on June 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Less than six months later, on the night of December 2, 2004, Graham again was arrested. The State\u2019s case was as follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a home invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men. According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham, Bailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home where Carlos Rodriguez lived. Graham, followed by Bailey and Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol to Rodriguez's chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three held Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at gunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for money. Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices barricaded Rodriguez and his Mend inside a closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and Lawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second robbery, during which Bailey was shot. Graham, who had borrowed his father\u2019s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to the hospital and left them there. As Graham drove away, a police ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>geant signaled him to stop. Graham continued at a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole. He tried to flee on foot but was apprehended. Three handguns were found in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied involvement in the crimes. He said he encountered Bailey and Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot. One of the detectives told Graham that the victims of the home invasion had identified him. He asked Graham, \u201cAside from the two robberies tonight how many more were you involved in?\u201d Graham responded, \u201cTwo to three before tonight.\u201d Id., at 160. The night that Graham allegedly committed the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On December 13, 2004, Graham\u2019s probation officer filed with the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham had violated the conditions of his probation by possessing a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with persons engaged in criminal activity. The trial court held hearings on Graham\u2019s violations about a year later, in December 2005 and January 2006. The judge who presided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham\u2019s guilty plea to the earlier offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the home invasion robbery; but, even after the court underscored that the admission could expose him to a life sentence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating probation conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence related to the home invasion, including testimony from the victims. The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting his attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating his probation. The court further found that Graham had violated his probation by committing a home invasion robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with persons engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Florida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>downward departure by the judge was 5 years\u2019 imprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment. Graham\u2019s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture sentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the Florida Department of Corrections recommended that Graham receive an even lower sentence \u2014 at most 4 years\u2019 imprisonment. The State recommended that Graham receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years on the attempted armed robbery count.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">After hearing Graham\u2019s testimony, the trial court explained the sentence it was about to pronounce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cMr. Graham, as I look back on your case, yours is really candidly a sad situation. You had, as far as I can tell, you have quite a family structure. You had a lot of people who wanted to try and help you get your life turned around including the court system, and you had a judge who took the step to try and give you direction through his probation order to give you a chance to get back onto track. And at the time you seemed through your letters that that is exactly what you wanted to do. And I don\u2019t know why it is that you threw your life away. I don\u2019t know why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cBut you did, and that is what is so sad about this today is that you have actually been given a chance to get through this, the original charge, which were very serious charges to begin with. .. . The attempted robbery with a weapon was a very serious charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c[I]n a very short period of time you were back before the Court on a violation of this probation, and then here you are two years later standing before me, literally the \u2014 facing a life sentence as to \u2014 up to life as to count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand why you would be given such a great opportunity to do something with your life and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>why you would throw it away. The only thing that I can rationalize is that you decided that this is how you were going to lead your life and that there is nothing that we can do for you. And as the state pointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of criminal conduct on your part and that we can\u2019t help you any further. We can\u2019t do anything to deter you. This is the way you are going to lead your life, and I don\u2019t know why you are going to. You\u2019ve made that decision. I have no idea. But, evidently, that is what you decided to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cSo then it becomes a focus, if I can\u2019t do anything to help you, if I can\u2019t do anything to get you back on the right path, then I have to start focusing on the community and trying to protect the community from your actions. And, unfortunately, that is where we are today is I don\u2019t see where I can do anything to help you any further. You\u2019ve evidently decided this is the direction you\u2019re going to take in life, and it\u2019s unfortunate that you made that choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cI have reviewed the statute. I don\u2019t see where any further juvenile sanctions would be appropriate. I don\u2019t see where any youthful offender sanctions would be appropriate. Given your escalating pattern of criminal conduct, it is apparent to the Court that you have decided that this is the way you are going to live your life and that the only thing I can do now is to try and protect the community from your actions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 392-394.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial court found Graham guilty of the earlier armed burglary and attempted armed robbery charges. It sentenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law on each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because Florida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.002(l)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant no possibility of release unless he is granted executive clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his sentence under the Eighth Amendment. The motion was deemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it within 60 days. The First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed, concluding that Graham\u2019s sentence was not grossly disproportionate to his crimes. 982 So. 2d 43 (2008). The court took note of the seriousness of Graham\u2019s offenses and their violent nature, as well as the fact that they \u201cwere not committed by a pre-teen, but a seventeen-year-old who was ultimately sentenced at the age of nineteen.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 52. The court concluded further that Graham was incapable of rehabilitation. Although Graham \u201cwas given an unheard of probationary sentence for a life felony, . . . wrote a letter expressing his remorse and promising to refrain from the commission of further crime, and . . . had a strong family structure to support him,\u201d the court noted, he \u201crejected his second chance and chose to continue committing crimes at an escalating pace.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Florida Supreme Court denied review. 990 So. 2d 1058 (2008) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. 1220 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The Eighth Amendment states: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d To determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look beyond historical conceptions to \u201c \u2018the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019\u201d <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles, </em>356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)). \u201cThis is because \u2018[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral judgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its applicability must change as the basic mores of society change.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>554 U. S. 407, 419 (2008) (quoting <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U. S. 238, 382 (1972) (Burger, C. J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits the imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under all circumstances. See, <em>e. g., Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer, </em>536 U. S. 730 (2002). \u201c[P]unishments of torture,\u201d for example, \u201care forbidden.\u201d <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879). These cases underscore the essential principle that, under the Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the human attributes even of those who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">For the most part, however, the Court\u2019s precedents consider punishments challenged not as inherently barbaric but as disproportionate to the crime. The concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment. Embodied in the Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishments is the \u201cprecept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\u201d <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Court\u2019s cases addressing the proportionality of sentences fall within two general classifications. The first involves challenges to the length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances in a particular case. The second comprises cases in which the Court implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical restrictions on the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In the first classification the Court considers all of the circumstances of the case to determine whether the sentence is unconstitutionally excessive. Under this approach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without parole sentence for the defendant\u2019s seventh nonviolent felony, the crime of passing a worthless check. <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U. S. 277 (1983). In other cases, however, it has been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of proportionality. A leading case is <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U. S. 957 (1991), in which the offender was sentenced under state law to life without parole for possessing a large quantity of cocaine. A closely divided Court upheld the sentence. The controlling opinion concluded that the Eighth Amendment contains a \u201cnarrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>proportionality principle,\u201d that \u201cdoes not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence\u201d but rather \u201cforbids only extreme sentences that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 997, 1000-1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Again closely divided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25 years to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under California\u2019s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>California, </em>538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also upheld a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a defendant\u2019s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses, <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>445 U. S. 263 (1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and distribution of marijuana, <em>Hutto </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>454 U. S. 370 (1982) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The controlling opinion in <em>Harmelin </em>explained its approach for determining whether a sentence for a term of years is grossly disproportionate for a particular defendant\u2019s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity of the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S., at 1005 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). \u201c[I]n the rare case in which [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an inference of gross dis-proportionality\u201d the court should then compare the defendant\u2019s sentence with the sentences received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and with the sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions. <em>Ibid. </em>If this comparative analysis \u201cvalidate^] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly disproportionate,\u201d the sentence is cruel and unusual. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The second classification of cases has used categorical rules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previous cases in this classification involved the death penalty. The classification in turn consists of two subsets, one considering the nature of the offense, the other considering the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals. <em>Kennedy, </em>551 U. S., at 437-438; see also <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>458 U. S. 782 (1982); <em>Coker </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the characteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted categorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defendants who committed their crimes before the age of 18, <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U. S. 551 (2005), or whose intellectual functioning is in a low range, <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U. S. 304 (2002). See also <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>487 U. S. 815 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has taken the following approach. The Court first considers \u201cobjective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\u201d to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 563. Next, guided by \u201cthe standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court\u2019s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s text, history, meaning, and purpose,\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U. S., at 421, the Court must determine in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The present case involves an issue the Court has not considered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of-years sentence. The approach in cases such as <em>Harmelin </em>and <em>Ewing </em>is suited for considering a gross proportionality challenge to a particular defendant\u2019s sentence, but here a sentencing practice itself is in question. This case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does not advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the question presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in cases that involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the categorical approach, specifically <em>Atkins, Roper, </em>and <em>Kennedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The analysis begins with objective indicia of national consensus. \u201c[T]he \u2018clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures.\u201d' <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 312 (quoting <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for any juvenile offenders. See Appendix, <em>infra, </em>Part III. Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes. <em>Id., </em>Part II. Thirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in some circumstances. <em>Id., </em>Part I. Federal law also allows for the possibility of life without parole for offenders as young as 13. See, <em>e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying on this metric, the State and its <em>amici </em>argue that there is no national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">This argument is incomplete and unavailing. \u201cThere are measures of consensus other than legislation.\u201d <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 433. Actual sentencing practices are an important part of the Court's inquiry into consensus. See <em>Enmund, supra, </em>at 794-796; <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 831-832 (plurality opinion); <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 316; <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 564-565; <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 433-434. Here, an examination of actual sentencing practices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is permitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use. Although these statutory schemes contain no explicit prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile nonhomieide offenders, those sentences are most infrequent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are only 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The State contends that this study\u2019s tally is inaccurate because it does not count juvenile offenders who were convicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense, even when the offender received a life without parole sentence for the nonhomicide. See Brief for Respondent 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>O. T. 2009, No. 08-7621, pp. 28-31. This distinction is unpersuasive. Juvenile offenders who committed both homicide and nonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a sentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed no homicide. It is difficult to say that a defendant who receives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who was at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some sense being punished in part for the homicide when the judge makes the sentencing determination. The instant case concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced to life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Florida farther criticizes this study because the authors were unable to obtain complete information on some States and because the study was not peer reviewed. See Brief for Respondent 40. The State does not, however, provide any data of its own. Although in the first instance it is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we have been able to supplement the study\u2019s findings. The study\u2019s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally for Nevada, Utah, or Virginia. See Annino 11-13. Our research shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has none, and Virginia has eight. See Letter from Alejandra Livingston, Offender Management Division, Nevada Dept, of Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 26, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s ease file); Letter from Steve Gehrke, Utah Dept, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 29, 2010) (same); Letter from Dr. Tama S. Celi, Virginia Dept, of Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 30, 2010) (same). Finally, since the study was completed, a defendant in Oklahoma has apparently been sentenced to life without parole for a rape and stabbing he committed at the age of 16. See Stogsdill, Delaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa World, May 5, 2010, p. A12.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to those we have been able to locate independently, there are 123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without parole sentences. A significant majority of those, 77 in total, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. Annino 2. The other 46 are imprisoned in just 10 States \u2014 California, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia. <em>Id., </em>at 14; <em>supra, </em>at 63 and this page; Letter from Thomas P. Hoey, Dept, of Corrections, Government of the District of Columbia, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 31, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); Letter from Judith Simon Garrett, U. S. Dept, of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), to Supreme Court Library (Apr. 9,2010) (same). Thus, only 11 jurisdictions nationwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile non-homicide offenders \u2014 and most of those do so quite rarely\u2014 while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government do not impose them despite statutory authorization.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The numbers cited above reflect all current convicts in a jurisdiction\u2019s penal system, regardless of when they were convicted. It becomes all the more clear how rare these sentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do sometimes impose them, when one considers that a juvenile sentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison for decades. Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence stretching back many years. It is not certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile nonhomi-cide offender nationwide serving a life without parole sentence, for the statistics are not precise. The available data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate how rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are isolated cases that have not been included in the presentations of the parties or the analysis of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute numbers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomicides are more common than the sentencing practices at issue in some of this Court\u2019s other Eighth Amendment cases. See, <em>e. g., Enmund, </em>458 U. S., at 794 (only six executions of non-triggerman felony murderers between 1954 and 1982), <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of mentally retarded defendants in 13-year period). This contrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first given to the base number of certain types of offenses. For example, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult and juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes. That same year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated assault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900 for burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for arson. See Dept, of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online at http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s ease file). Although it is not certain how many of these numerous juvenile offenders were eligible for life without parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>sentences, the comparison suggests that in proportion to the opportunities for its imposition, life without parole sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as other sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact that many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole for juvenile nonhomieide offenders. The Court confronted a similar situation in <em>Thompson, </em>where a plurality concluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than 16 was unconstitutional. A number of States then allowed the juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory scheme. As is the case here, those States authorized the transfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at that point there was no statutory differentiation between adults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties. The plurality concluded that the transfer laws show \u201cthat the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court), <em>but tells us nothing about the judgment these States have made regarding the appropriate punishment for such youthful </em>offenders.\u201d 487 U. S., at 826, n. 24. Justice O\u2019Connor, concurring in the judgment, took a similar view. <em>Id., </em>at 850 (\u201cWhen a legislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed through the adult criminal justice system, and capital punishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the death penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to such defendants. . . . [HJowever, it does not necessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have deliberately concluded that it would be appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The same reasoning obtains here. Many States have chosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to allow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in, adult court under certain circumstances. Once in adult court, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence as would be given to an adult offender, including a life without parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>sentence. But the fact that transfer and direct charging laws make life without parole possible for some juvenile non-homicide offenders does not justify a judgment that many States intended to subject such offenders to life without parole sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be prosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sentenced to life without parole. The State acknowledged at oral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could receive such a sentence under the letter of the law. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-87. All would concede this to be unrealistic, but the example underscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration. Similarly, the many States that allow life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the punishment should not be treated as if they have expressed the view that the sentence is appropriate. The sentencing practice now under consideration is exceedingly rare. And \u201cit is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.\u201d <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Community consensus, while \u201centitled to great weight,\u201d is not itself determinative of whether a punishment is cruel and unusual. <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U. S., at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted). In accordance with the constitutional design, \u201cthe task of interpreting the Eighth Amendment remains our responsibility.\u201d <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 575. The judicial exercise of independent judgment requires consideration of the culpability of the offenders at issue in light of their crimes and characteristics, along with the severity of the punishment in question. <em>Id., </em>at 568; <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 438; cf. <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 292. In this inquiry the Court also considers whether the challenged sentencing practice serves legitimate penological goals. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>441-446; <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 571-572; <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 318-320.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Roper </em>established that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less deserving of the most severe punishments. 543 U. S., at 569. As compared to adults, juveniles have a \u201c\u2018lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility\u2019 \u201d; they \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure\u201d; and their characters are \u201cnot as well formed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 569-570. These salient characteristics mean that \u201c[i]t is difficult even for expert psychologists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 573. Accordingly, \u201cjuvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 569. A juvenile is not absolved of responsibility for his actions, but his transgression \u201cis not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.\u201d <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 835 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court\u2019s observations in <em>Roper </em>about the nature of juveniles. As petitioner\u2019s <em>amici </em>point out, developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds. For example, parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence. See Brief for American Medical Association et al. 16-24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. 22-27. Juveniles are more capable of change than are adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of \u201cirretrievably depraved character\u201d than are the actions of adults. <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 570. It remains true that \u201c[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor\u2019s character deficiencies will be reformed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>These matters relate to the status of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>next the nature of the offenses to which this harsh penalty-might apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The Court has recognized that defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers. <em>Kennedy, supra; Enmund, </em>458 U. S. 782; <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>481 U. S. 137 (1987); <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S. 584. There is a line \u201cbetween homicide and other serious violent offenses against the individual.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U. S., at 438. Serious nonhomicide crimes \u201cmay be devastating in their harm . . . but \u2018in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public/ . . . they cannot be compared to murder in their \u2018severity and irrevocability.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 598 (plurality opinion)). This is because \u201c[l]ife is over for the victim of the murderer,\u201d but for the victim of even a very serious nonhomicide crime, \u201clife ... is not over and normally is not beyond repair.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(plurality opinion). Although an offense like robbery or rape is \u201ca serious crime deserving serious punishment,\u201d <em>Enmund, supra, </em>at 797, those crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability. The age of the offender and the nature of the crime each bear on the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">As for the punishment, life without parole is \u201cthe second most severe penalty permitted by law.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U. S., at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). It is true that a death sentence is \u201cunique in its severity and irrevocability,\u201d <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U. S. 153, 187 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); yet life without parole sentences share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences. The State does not execute the offender sentenced to life without parole, but the sentence alters the offender\u2019s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable. It deprives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the convict of the most basic liberties without giving hope of restoration, except perhaps by executive clemency \u2014 the remote possibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the sentence. <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 300-301. As one court observed in overturning a life without parole sentence for a juvenile defendant, this sentence \u201cmeans denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial; it means that whatever the future might hold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he will remain in prison for the rest of his days.\u201d <em>Naovarath </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. 525, 526, 779 P. 2d 944 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that deny convicts the possibility of parole. In <em>Rummel, </em>445 U. S. 263, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment challenge to a life sentence for a defendant\u2019s third nonviolent felony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant the possibility of parole. Noting that \u201cparole is an established variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,\u201d it was evident that an analysis of the petitioner\u2019s sentence \u201ccould hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actually be imprisoned for the rest of his life.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 280-281 (internal quotation marks omitted). And in <em>Solem, </em>the only previous case striking down a sentence for a term of years as grossly disproportionate, the defendant\u2019s sentence was deemed \u201cfar more severe than the life sentence we considered in <em>Rum-mel,\u201d </em>because it did not give the defendant the possibility of parole. 463 U. S., at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile. Under this sentence a juvenile offender will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender. A 16-year-old and a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole receive the same punishment in name only. See <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 572; cf. <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 996 (\u201cIn some cases... there will be negligible difference between life without parole and other sentences of imprisonment \u2014 for example,... a lengthy term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sentence without eligibility for parole, given to a 65-year-old man\u201d). This reality cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The penological justifications for the sentencing practice are also relevant to the analysis. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 420; <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 571-572; <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 318-320. Criminal punishment can have different goals, and choosing among them is within a legislature\u2019s discretion. See <em>Har-melin, supra, </em>at 999 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\u201c[T]he Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory\u201d). It does not follow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal sanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth Amendment restrictions. A sentence lacking any legitimate penological justification is by its nature disproportionate to the offense. With respect to life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of penal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate\u2014 retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see <em>Ewing, </em>538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion) \u2014 provides an adequate justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it cannot support the sentence at issue here. Society is entitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomicide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and to seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the offense. But \u201c[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\u201d <em>Tison, supra, </em>at 149. And as <em>Roper </em>observed, \u201c[wjhether viewed as an attempt to express the community\u2019s moral outrage or as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the victim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\u201d 543 U. S., at 571. The case becomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did not commit homicide. <em>Roper </em>found that \u201c [rjetribution is not proportional if the law\u2019s most severe penalty is imposed\u201d on the juvenile murderer. <em>Ibid,. </em>The considerations underlying that holding support as well the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>elusion that retribution does not justify imposing the second most severe penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomi-cide offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence either. <em>Roper </em>noted that \u201cthe same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest... that juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because juveniles' \u201clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a possible punishment into consideration when making decisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is rarely imposed. That the sentence deters in a few cases is perhaps plausible, but \u201c[t]his argument does not overcome other objections.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U. S., at 441. Even if the punishment has some connection to a valid penological goal, it must be shown that the punishment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justification offered. Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide offenders' diminished moral responsibility, any limited deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not enough to justify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprisonment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in question here. Recidivism is a serious risk to public safety, and so incapacitation is an important goal. See <em>Ewing, supra, </em>at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67 percent of former inmates released from state prisons are charged with at least one serious new crime within three years). But while incapacitation may be a legitimate penological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in other contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment for juveniles who did not commit homicide. To justify life without parole on the assumption that the juvenile offender forever will be a danger to society requires the sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorrigible. The characteristics of juveniles make that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>judgment questionable. \u201cIt is difficult even for expert psychologists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 573. As one court concluded in a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14-year-old, \u201cincorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.\u201d <em>Workman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an immediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume, serious crimes early in his term of supervised release and despite his own assurances of reform. Graham deserved to be separated from society for some time in order to prevent what the trial court described as an \u201cescalating pattern of criminal conduct,\u201d App. 394, but it does not follow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his life. Even if the State's judgment that Graham was incorrigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or failure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate because that judgment was made at the outset. A life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity. Incapacitation cannot override all other considerations, lest the Eighth Amendment\u2019s rule against disproportionate sentences be a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Finally there is rehabilitation, a penological goal that forms the basis of parole systems. See <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 300; <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989). The concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility and proper implementation are the subject of a substantial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue. See, <em>e. g., </em>Cullen &amp; Gen-dreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation: Policy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000, pp. 119-133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several decades). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>for legislatures to determine what rehabilitative techniques are appropriate and effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, however, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The penalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By denying the defendant the right to reenter the community, the State makes an irrevocable judgment about that person\u2019s value and place in society. This judgment is not appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s capacity for change and limited moral culpability. A State\u2019s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a mere expressive judgment. As one <em>amicus </em>notes, defendants serving life without parole sentences are often denied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative services that are available to other inmates. See Brief for Sentencing Project 11-13. For juvenile offenders, who are most in need of and receptive to rehabilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>28-31 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of rehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the disproportionality of the sentence all the more evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This determination; the limited culpability of juvenile nonhomicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment. Because \u201c[t]he age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood,\u201d those who were below that age when the offense was committed may not be sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>life without parole for a nonhomicide crime. <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime. What the State must do, however, is give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, however, that while the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to release that offender during his natural life. Those who commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will remain behind bars for life. It does prohibit States from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is necessary here. Two alternative approaches are not adequate to address the relevant constitutional concerns. First, the State argues that the laws of Florida and other States governing criminal procedure take sufficient account of the age of a juvenile offender. Here, Florida notes that under its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and 17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious felonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those offenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors may not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders as adults for misdemeanors. Brief for Respondent 54 (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 985.227 (2003)). The State also stresses that \u201cin only the narrowest of circumstances\u201d does Florida law impose no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juveniles in adult court. Brief for Respondent 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring consideration of a defendant\u2019s age in charging decisions are salutary. An offender\u2019s age is relevant to the Eighth Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants\u2019 youthfulness into account at all would be flawed. Florida, like other States, has made substantial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system. See generally Fla. Stat. \u00a7 958 <em>et seq. </em>(2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by themselves insufficient to address the constitutional concerns at issue. Nothing in Florida\u2019s laws prevents its courts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to life without parole based on a subjective judgment that the defendant\u2019s crimes demonstrate an \u201cirretrievably depraved character.\u201d <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 570. This is inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment. Specific cases are illustrative. In Graham\u2019s case the sentencing judge decided to impose life without parole \u2014 a sentence greater than that requested by the prosecutor \u2014 for Graham\u2019s armed burglary conviction. The judge did so because he concluded that Graham was incorrigible: \u201c[Y]ou decided that this is how you were going to lead your life and that there is nothing that we can do for you. . . . We can\u2019t do anything to deter you.\u201d App. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Another example comes from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>No. 08-7621. <em>Sullivan </em>was argued the same day as this case, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certiorari in <em>Sullivan </em>as improvidently granted. <em>Post, </em>p. 181. The facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida\u2019s system. The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as an adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13 years old. Noting Sullivan\u2019s past encounters with the law, the sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan had been \u201cgiven opportunity after opportunity to upright himself and take advantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>of the second and third chances he\u2019s been given,\u201d he had demonstrated himself to be unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away from society for the duration of his life. Brief for Respondent in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>O. T. 2009, No. 08-7621, p. 6. The judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. As these examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing the imposition of these sentences based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the offender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life without parole sentence for which he or she lacks the moral culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Another possible approach would be to hold that the Eighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender\u2019s age into consideration as part of a case-specific gross dispro-portionality inquiry, weighing it against the seriousness of the crime. This approach would allow courts to account for factual differences between cases and to impose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous crimes. Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more difficult than sentencing. The task is usually undertaken by trial judges who seek with diligence and professionalism to take account of the human existence of the offender and the just demands of a wronged society.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however, be confined by some boundaries. The dilemma of juvenile sentencing demonstrates this. For even if we were to assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might have \u201csufficient psychological maturity, and at the same time dem-onstrat[e] sufficient depravity,\u201d <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality approach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change. <em>Roper </em>rejected the argument that the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be told they must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>sider the defendant\u2019s age as a mitigating factor in sentencing. The Court concluded that an \u201cunacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of course, even where the juvenile offender\u2019s objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 573. Here, as with the death penalty, \u201c[t]he differences between juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive\u201d a sentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime \u201cdespite insufficient culpability.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 572-573.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it does not take account of special difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation. As some <em>amici </em>note, the features that distinguish juveniles from adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal proceedings. Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited understandings of the criminal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it. They are less likely than adults to work effectively with their lawyers to aid in their defense. Brief for NAACP Legal Defense <em>&amp; </em>Educational Fund et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7-12; Henning, Loyalty, Paternalism, and Rights: Client Counseling Theory and the Role of Child\u2019s Counsel in Delinquency Cases, 81 Notre Dame L. Rev. 245, 272-273 (2005). Difficulty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding impulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel, seen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects, all can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juvenile offense. Aber Brief 35. These factors are likely to impair the quality of a juvenile defendant\u2019s representation. Cf. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320 (\u201cMentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel\u201d). A categorical rule avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide offenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform. The juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to achieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of human worth and potential. In Roper, that deprivation resulted from an execution that brought life to its end. Here, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns apply. Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance for reconciliation with society, no hope. Maturity can lead to that considered reflection which is the foundation for remorse, renewal, and rehabilitation. A young person who knows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before life\u2019s end has little incentive to become a responsible individual. In some prisons, moreover, the system itself becomes complieit in the lack of development. As noted above, see <em>supra, </em>at 74, it is the policy in some prisons to withhold counseling, education, and rehabilitation programs for those who are ineligible for parole consideration. A categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders avoids the perverse consequence in which the lack of maturity that led to an offender\u2019s crime is reinforced by the prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Terrance Graham\u2019s sentence guarantees he will die in prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain release, no matter what he might do to demonstrate that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character, even if he spends the next half century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from his mistakes. The State has denied him any chance to later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he was a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth Amendment does not permit.</p>\n<p id=\"AHN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in continuing to impose life without parole sentences on juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over. This observation does not control our decision. The judgments of other nations and the international community are not dis-positive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. But \u201c\u2018[t]he climate of international opinion concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment\u2019 \u201d is also \u201c \u2018not irrelevant.\u2019\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U. S., at 796, n. 22. The Court has looked beyond our Nation\u2019s borders for support for its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual. See, <em>e. g., Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 575-578; <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 316-318, n. 21; <em>Thompson, </em>487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); <em>Enmund, supra, </em>at 796-797, n. 22; <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 596, n. 10 (same); <em>Trop, </em>356 U. S., at 102-103 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting the global consensus against the sentencing practice in question. A recent study concluded that only 11 nations authorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under any circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States and Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice. See M. Leighton &amp; C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children To Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An updated version of the study concluded that Israel\u2019s \u201claws allow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life terms,\u201d but expressed reservations about how that parole review is implemented. De la Vega <em>&amp; </em>Leighton, Sentencing Our Children To Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice, 42 U. S. F. L. Rev. 983, 1002-1003 (2008). But even if Israel is counted as allowing life without parole for juvenile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that sentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli prisoners whom commentators have identified as serving life sentences for juvenile crimes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>convicted of homicide or attempted homicide. See Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives; Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 106, n. 322 (2005); Memorandum and Attachment from Ruth Levush, Law Library of Congress, to Supreme Court Library (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not contest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders. We also note, as petitioner and his <em>amici </em>emphasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U. N. T. S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by every nation except the United States and Somalia, prohibits the imposition of \u201clife imprisonment without possibility of release ... for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 66; Brief for Amnesty International et al. 15-17. As we concluded in <em>Roper </em>with respect to the juvenile death penalty, \u201cthe United States now stands alone in a world that has turned its face against\u201d life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. 543 U. S., at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The State\u2019s <em>amici </em>stress that no international legal agreement that is binding on the United States prohibits life without parole for juvenile offenders and thus urge us to ignore the international consensus. See Brief for Solidarity Center for Law and Justice et al. 14-16; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House of Representatives 40-43. These arguments miss the mark. The question before us is not whether international law prohibits the United States from imposing the sentence at issue in this case. The question is whether that punishment is cruel and unusual. In that inquiry, \u201cthe overwhelming weight of international opinion against\u201d life without parole for nonhomicide offenses committed by juveniles \u201cprovide[s] respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions.\u201d <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The debate between petitioner\u2019s and respondent\u2019s <em>amici </em>over whether there is a binding^ <em>cogens </em>norm against this sentencing practice is likewise of no import. See Brief for Amnesty International 10-23; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House of Representatives 4-40. The Court has treated the laws and practices of other nations and international agreements as relevant to the Eighth Amendment not because those norms are binding or controlling but because the judgment of the world\u2019s nations that a particular sentencing practice is inconsistent with basic principles of decency demonstrates that the Court\u2019s rationale has respected reasoning to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide. A State need not guarantee the offender eventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term. The judgment of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">I.

S. 349, 373-378 (1910), this argument suggests the dissenting opinions in those cases more accurately describe the law today than does Justice Thomas\u2019 rigid interpretation of the Amendment. Society changes. Knowledge accumulates. We learn, sometimes, from our mistakes. Punishments that did not seem cruel and unusual at one time may, in the light of reason and experience, be found cruel and unusual at a later time; unless we are to abandon the moral commitment embodied in the Eighth Amendment, proportionality review must never become effectively obsolete, <em>post, </em>at 103-104, and n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">While Justice Thomas would apparently not rule out a death sentence for a $50 theft by a 7-year-old, see <em>post, </em>at 100, 106, n. 3, the Court wisely rejects his static approach to the law. Standards of decency have evolved since 1980. They will never stop doing so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Chief Justice Roberts,</author>\n<p id=\"A4r\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">I agree with the Court that Terrance Graham\u2019s sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d Unlike the majority, however, I see no need to invent a new constitutional rule of dubious provenance in reaching that conclusion. Instead, my analysis is based on an application of this Court\u2019s precedents, in particular (1) our cases requiring \u201cnarrow proportionality\u201d review of noncapital sentences and (2) our conclusion in <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less culpable than adults who commit the same crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">These cases expressly allow courts addressing allegations that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth Amendment to consider the particular defendant and particular crime at issue. The standards for relief under these precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here Graham\u2019s juvenile status \u2014 together with the nature of his criminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punishment imposed \u2014 lead me to conclude that his sentence of life without parole is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences for noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised serious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an original matter, the Constitution was understood to require any degree of proportionality between noncapital offenses and their corresponding punishments. See, <em>e. g., Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U. S. 957, 962-994 (1991) (principal opinion of Scalia, J.); <em>post, </em>at 99-100, and n. 1 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to reexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality, however, and so I approach this case by trying to apply our past decisions to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Graham\u2019s case arises at the intersection of two lines of Eighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of decisions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause embraces a \u201cnarrow proportionality principle\u201d that we apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review non-capital sentences. <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U. S. 63, 72 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>California, </em>538 U. S. 11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 996-997 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). This \u201cnarrow proportionality principle\u201d does not grant judges blanket authority to second-guess decisions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the contrary, a reviewing court will only \u201crarely\u201d need \u201cto engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence is <em>not </em>constitutionally disproportionate,\u201d <em>Solem, supra, </em>at 290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and \u201csuccessful challenges\u201d to noncapital sentences will be all the more \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We have \u201cnot established a clear or consistent path for courts to follow\u201d in applying the highly deferential \u201cnarrow proportionality\u201d analysis. <em>Lockyer, supra, </em>at 72. We have, however, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in setting sentences, the variety of legitimate penological schemes, the state-by-state diversity protected by our federal system, and the requirement that review be guided by objective, rather than subjective, factors. <em>Ewing, supra, </em>at 23 (plurality opinion); <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 998-1001 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Most importantly, however, we have explained that the Eighth Amendment \u201c \u2018does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence\u2019 \u201d; rather, \u201c \u2018it forbids only extreme sentences that are \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ewing, supra, </em>at 23 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 1001 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Our cases indicate that courts conducting \u201cnarrow proportionality\u201d review should begin with a threshold inquiry that compares \u201cthe gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty.\u201d <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 290-291. This analysis can consider a particular offender\u2019s mental state and motive in committing the crime, the actual harm caused to his victim or to society by his conduct, and any prior criminal history. <em>Id., </em>at 292-294, 296-297, and n. 22 (considering motive, past criminal conduct, alcoholism, and propensity for violence of the particular defendant); see also <em>Ewing, swpra, </em>at 28-30 (plurality opinion) (examining defendant\u2019s criminal history); <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U. S., at 1001-1004 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (noting specific details of the particular crime of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Only in \u201cthe rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1005, should courts proceed to an \u201cintrajurisdictional\u201d comparison of the sentence at issue with those imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, and an \u201cinterjurisdictional\u201d comparison with sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions, <em>Solem, supra, </em>at 291-292. If these subsequent comparisons confirm the inference of gross disproportion-ality, courts should invalidate the sentence as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The second line of precedent relevant to assessing Graham\u2019s sentence consists of our cases acknowledging that juvenile offenders are <em>generally </em>\u2014 though not necessarily in every case \u2014 less morally culpable than adults who commit the same crimes. This insight animated our decision in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we invalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who had committed his crime under the age of 16. More recently, in <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibition on executions to those who committed their crimes before the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Both <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Roper </em>arose in the unique context of the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has recognized \u201cmust be limited to those offenders who commit \u2018a narrow category of the most serious crimes\u2019 and whose extreme culpability makes them \u2018the most deserving of execution.\u2019\u201d 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). <em>Roper\u2019s </em>prohibition on the juvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that \u201c[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\u201d 543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a heightened susceptibility to negative influences and outside pressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is \u201cmore transitory\u201d and \u201cless fixed\u201d than that of an adult. <em>Id., </em>at 569-570. Together, these factors establish the \u201cdiminished culpability of juveniles,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 571, and \u201crender suspect any conclusion\u201d that juveniles are among \u201cthe worst offenders\u201d for whom the death penalty is reserved, <em>id., </em>at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Today, the Court views <em>Roper </em>as providing the basis for a new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes. I disagree. In <em>Roper, </em>the Court tailored its analysis of juvenile characteristics to the specific question whether juvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to capital punishment. Our answer that they could not be sentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion that they \u201ccannot with reliability be classified among the <em>worst </em>offenders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 569 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can never be eligible for life without parole. A life sentence is of course far less severe than a death sentence, and we have never required that it be imposed only on the very worst offenders, as we have with capital punishment. Treating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>odds with our longstanding view that \u201cthe death penalty is different from other punishments in kind rather than degree.\u201d <em>Solem, supra, </em>at 294. It is also at odds with <em>Roper </em>itself, which drew the line at capital punishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are \u201cless severe than death\u201d despite involving \u201cforfeiture of some of the most basic liberties.\u201d 543 U. S., at 573-574. Indeed, <em>Roper </em>explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life without parole on some juvenile offenders. <em>Id., </em>at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">But the fact that <em>Roper </em>does not support a categorical rule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean that a criminal defendant\u2019s age is irrelevant to those sentences. On the contrary, our cases establish that the \u201cnarrow proportionality\u201d review applicable to noncapital cases itself takes the personal \u201cculpability of the offender\u201d into account in examining whether a given punishment is proportionate to the crime. <em>Solem, supra, </em>at 292. There is no reason why an offender\u2019s juvenile status should be excluded from the analysis. Indeed, given <em>Roper\u2019s </em>conclusion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than adults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender\u2019s juvenile status can play a central role in the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Justice Thomas disagrees with even our limited reliance on <em>Roper </em>on the ground that the present case does not involve capital punishment. <em>Post, </em>at 121 (dissenting opinion). That distinction is important \u2014 indeed, it underlies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the Court. But <em>Roper\u2019s </em>conclusion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital cases, and rightly informs the ease-specific inquiry I believe to be appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In short, our existing precedent already provides a sufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined by the majority. Not every juvenile receiving a life sentence will prevail under this approach. Not every juvenile should. But all will receive the protection that the Eighth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p id=\"Anh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Applying the \u201cnarrow proportionality\u201d framework to the particular facts of this ease, I conclude that Graham\u2019s sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity of Graham\u2019s conduct to the harshness of his penalty. There is no question that the crime for which Graham received his life sentence \u2014 armed burglary of a nondomicile with an assault or battery \u2014 is \u201ca serious crime deserving serious punishment.\u201d <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>458 U. S. 782, 797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was the basis of Graham\u2019s probation violation. But these crimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such as murder or rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As for Graham\u2019s degree of personal culpability, he committed the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile \u2014 a stage at which, <em>Roper </em>emphasized, one\u2019s \u201cculpability or blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by reason of youth and immaturity.\u201d 543 U. S., at 571. Graham\u2019s age places him in a significantly different category from the defendants in <em>Rumm\u00e9l, Harmelin, </em>and <em>Ewing, </em>all of whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham\u2019s youth made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>him relatively more likely to engage in reckless and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also likely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See, <em>e. g., Roper, supra, </em>at 569; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993); <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>455 U. S. 104, 115-117 (1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should be denied the general presumption of diminished culpability that <em>Roper </em>indicates should apply to juvenile offenders. If anything, Graham\u2019s in-court statements \u2014 including his request for a second chance so that he could \u201cdo whatever it takes to get to the NFL\u201d \u2014 underscore his immaturity. App. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did proves that he was dangerous and deserved to be punished. But it does not establish that he was <em>particularly </em>dangerous \u2014 at least relative to the murderers and rapists for whom the sentence of life without parole is typically reserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, <em>ante, </em>at 53, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a typical adult who commits the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced Graham to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This is the second-harshest sentence available under our precedents for <em>any </em>crime, and the most severe sanction available for a nonhomicide offense. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>554 U. S. 407 (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes, Graham\u2019s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed by the Florida Department of Corrections (which suggested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20), and the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced to. 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388). No one in Graham\u2019s case other than the sentencing judge appears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to prison for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that there is a strong inference that Graham\u2019s sentence of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>imprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate in violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed to the next steps of the proportionality analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdietional comparisons of Graham\u2019s sentence confirm the threshold inference of disproportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Graham\u2019s sentence was far more severe than that imposed for similar violations of Florida law, even without taking juvenile status into account. For example, individuals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Florida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less than 10 years, respectively. Florida Dept, of Corrections, Annual Report FY 2007-2008: The Guidebook to Corrections in Florida 35. Unsurprisingly, Florida\u2019s juvenile criminals receive similarly low sentences \u2014 typically less than five years for burglary and less than seven years for robbery. <em>Id., </em>at 36. Graham's life without parole sentence was far more severe than the average sentence imposed on those convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically receive under 25 years in prison. <em>Id., </em>at 35. As the Court explained in <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 291, \u201c[i]f more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at issue may be excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Finally, the inference that Graham\u2019s sentence is disproportionate is further validated by comparison to the sentences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions. As the majority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its willingness to impose sentences of life without parole on juveniles convicted of nonhomieide crimes. See <em>ante, </em>at 62-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">So much for Graham. But what about Milagro Cunningham, a 17-year-old who beat and raped an 8-year-old girl before leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rock in a recy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cling bin in a remote landfill? See Musgrave, Cruel or Necessary? Life Terms for Youths Spur National Debate, Palm Beach Post, Oct. 15, 2009, p. 1A. Or Nathan Walker and Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together with their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son? See 3 Sentenced to Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life without parole for his conduct says nothing whatever about these offenders, or others like them who commit nonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the conduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham\u2019s case as a vehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule \u2014 applicable well beyond the particular facts of Graham\u2019s case \u2014 that a sentence of life without parole imposed on <em>any </em>juvenile for <em>any </em>nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional. This categorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particular conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before us are not serious enough to justify Graham\u2019s sentence. In reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court to decide whether that same sentence would be constitutional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in light of the Court\u2019s apparent recognition that it is perfectly legitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life without parole for committing murder. This means that there is nothing <em>inherently </em>unconstitutional about imposing sentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders; rather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on the particular crimes for which they are imposed. But if the constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particular crime being punished, then the Court should limit its holding to the particular offenses that Graham committed here, and should decline to consider other hypothetical crimes not presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In any event, the Court\u2019s categorical conclusion is also unwise. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some nonhomicide crimes \u2014 like , the ones committed by Milagro Cunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor \u2014 are especially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserving of more severe punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have \u201cdiminished\u201d culpability relative to adults who commit the same crimes, <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 571, but that does not mean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify a life sentence. See generally <em>Thompson, </em>487 U. S., at 853 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment). It does not take a moral sense that is fully developed in every respect to know that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong. The single fact of being 17 years old would not afford Cunningham protection against life without parole if the young girl had died \u2014 as Cunningham surely expected she would \u2014 so why should it do so when she miraculously survived his barbaric brutality?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Court defends its categorical approach on the grounds that a \u201cclear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 74. It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportionality review is constitutionally insufficient because courts might not be able \u201cwith sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The Court is of course correct that judges will never have perfect foresight \u2014 or perfect wisdom \u2014 in making sentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence adults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is also true when they sentence juveniles who commit murder no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before them. As we explained in <em>Solem, </em>the whole enterprise of proportionality review is premised on the \u201cjustified\u201d assumption that \u201ccourts are competent to judge the gravity of an offense, at least on a relative scale.\u201d 463 U. S., at 292. Indeed, \u201ccourts traditionally have made these judgments\u201d by applying \u201cgenerally accepted criteria\u201d to analyze \u201cthe harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 292, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">* <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which he deserves serious punishment. But he was only 16 years old, and under our Court\u2019s precedents, his youth is one factor, among others, that should be considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally excessive. In my view, Graham\u2019s age \u2014 together with the nature of his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his sentence \u2014 tips the constitutional balance. I thus concur in the Court\u2019s judgment that Graham\u2019s sentence of life without parole violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in every case involving a juvenile offender. Some crimes are so heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable, that a sentence of life without parole may be entirely justified under the Constitution. As we have said, \u201csuccessful challenges\u201d to noncapital sentences under the Eighth Amendment have been \u2014 and, in my view, should continue to be \u2014 \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Rummel, </em>445 U. S., at 272. But Graham\u2019s sentence presents the exceptional case that our precedents have recognized will come along. We should grant Graham the relief to which he is entitled under the Eighth Amendment. The Court errs, however, in using this case as a vehicle for unsettling our established jurisprudence and fashioning a categorical rule applicable to far different cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Justice Auto suggests that Graham has failed to preserve any challenge to his sentence based on the \u201cnarrow, as-applied proportionality principle.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 124 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. It is true that Graham asks us to declare, categorically, that no juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense may ever be subject to a sentence of life without parole. But he claims that this rule is warranted under the narrow proportionality principle we set forth in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U. S. 277 (1983), <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U. S. 957 (1991), and <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>California, </em>538 U. S. 11 (2003). Brief for Petitioner 30, 31, 54-64. Insofar as he relies on that framework, I believe we may do so as well, even if our analysis results in a narrower holding than the categorical rule Graham seeks. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8 (\u201c[T]he Court could rule narrowly in this case and hold only that petitioner\u2019s sentence of life without parole was unconstitutionally disproportionate\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">with whom Justice Scalia joins, and with whom Justice Alito joins as to Parts I and III, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Court holds today that it is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and hence unconstitutional for any judge or jury to impose a sentence of life without parole on an offender less than 18 years old, unless he has committed a homicide. Although the text of the Constitution is silent regarding the permissibility of this sentencing practice, and although it would not have offended the standards that prevailed at the founding, the Court insists that the standards of American society have evolved such that the Constitution now requires its prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The news of this evolution will, I think, come as a surprise to the American people. Congress, the District of Columbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to consider this sentencing practice in juvenile nonhomieide cases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it in the very worst cases they have encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The Court does not conclude that life without parole itself is a cruel and unusual punishment. It instead rejects the judgments of those legislatures, judges, and juries regarding what the Court describes as the \u201cmoral\u201d question whether this sentence can ever be \u201cproportiona[te]\u201d when applied to the category of offenders at issue here. <em>Ante, </em>at 58, 59 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>ante, </em>at 85 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">I am unwilling to assume that we, as Members of this Court, are any more capable of making such moral judgments than our fellow citizens.

At age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked accomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida restaurant, during which one of Graham\u2019s accomplices twice struck the restaurant manager on the head with a steel pipe when he refused to turn over money to the intruders. Graham was arrested and charged as an adult. He later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including armed burglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable by life imprisonment under Florida law. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7810.02(2)(a), (b) (2007). The trial court withheld adjudication on both counts, however, and sentenced Graham to probation, the first 12 months of which he spent in a county detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Graham reoffended just six months after his release. At a probation revocation hearing, a judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11 months, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices and held the homeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30 minutes while his accomplices ransacked the residence. As a result, the judge concluded that Graham had violated his probation and, after additional hearings, adjudicated Graham guilty on both counts arising from the restaurant robbery. The judge imposed the maximum sentence allowed by Florida law on the armed burglary count, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Graham argues, and the Court holds, that this sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause because a life-without-parole sentence is always \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d when imposed on a person under 18 who commits any crime short of a homicide. Brief for Petitioner 24; <em>ante, </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The Eighth Amendment, which applies to the States through the Fourteenth, provides that \u201c[ejxcessive bail shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d It is by now well established that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally understood as prohibiting torturous \u201c <em>\u2018methods </em>of punishment/ \u201d <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U. S. 957, 979 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (quoting Granucci, \u201cNor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted:\u201d The Original Meaning, 57 Cal. L. Rev. 839, 842 (1969)) \u2014 specifically methods akin to those that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted, <em>Baze </em>v. <em>Rees, </em>553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable exception, see <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U. S. 349 (1910); <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 990-994 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (discussing the scope and relevance of <em>Weems\u2019 </em>holding), this Court applied the Clause with that understanding for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">More recently, however, the Court has held that the Clause authorizes it to proscribe not only methods of punishment that qualify as \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d but also any punishment that the Court deems \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime committed. <em>Ante, </em>at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted). This latter interpretation is entirely the Court\u2019s creation. As has been described elsewhere at length, there is virtually no indication that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause originally was understood to require proportionality in sentencing. See <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U. S., at 975-985 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Here, it suffices to recall just two points. First, the Clause does not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any synonym for that term, even though the Framers were familiar with the concept, as evidenced by several founding-era state constitutions that required (albeit without defining) proportional punishments. See <em>id., </em>at 977-978. In addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Congress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>sidered a constitutional command.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>id., </em>at 980-981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital punishment for offenses ranging from \u201c \u2018run[ning] away with... goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars/\u201d to \u201cmurder on the high seas\u201d (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am. J. Legal Hist. 326, 348-349, 353 (1982) (explaining that crimes in the late 18th-century Colonies generally were punished either by fines, whipping, or public \u201cshaming,\u201d or by death, as intermediate sentencing options such as incarceration were not common).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The Court has nonetheless invoked proportionality to declare that capital punishment \u2014 though not unconstitutional <em>per se </em>\u2014 is categorically too harsh a penalty to apply to certain types of crimes and certain classes of offenders. See <em>Coker </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opinion) (rape of an adult woman); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>554 U. S. 407 (2008) (rape of a child); <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>458 U. S. 782 (1982) (felony murder in which the defendant participated in the felony but did not kill or intend to kill); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>487 U. S. 815 (1988) (plurality opinion) (juveniles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>under 16); <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U. S. 551 (2005) (juveniles under 18); <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U. S. 304 (2002) (mentally retarded offenders). In adopting these categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes upon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state and federal) organs of government. The Eighth Amendment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and unusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other constitutional provisions ensure the defendant\u2019s right to fair process before any punishment is imposed. But, as members of today\u2019s majority note, \u201c[sjociety changes,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 85 (Stevens, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment leaves the unavoidably moral question of who \u201cdeserves\u201d a particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the prosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that impose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from the death penalty on the theory that \u201cevolving standards of decency\u201d require this result. <em>Ante, </em>at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has offered assurances that these standards can be reliably measured by \u201c \u2018objective indicia\u2019 \u201d of \u201cnational consensus,\u201d such as state and federal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given that we are talking about \u201cnational\u201d consensus) international opinion. <em>Ante, </em>at 61 (quoting <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 563); see also ante, at 62-67, 80-82. Yet even assuming that is true, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality of a particular type of punishment to turn on a \u201csnapshot of American public opinion\u201d taken at the moment a case is decided. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 629 (Scalia, J., dissenting). By holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one direction the evolution of the standards it describes, thus \u201ccalling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pendulum swing in social attitudes,\u201d <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 869 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and \u201cstunt[ing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>legislative consideration\u201d of new questions of penal policy as they emerge, <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 448 (Auto, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of community consensus in any event. <em>Ante, </em>at 67 (\u201cCommunity consensus, while \u2018entitled to great weight/ is not itself determinative\u201d (quoting <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 434)). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence of consensus it finds whenever its own \u201cindependent judgment\u201d points in a different direction. <em>Ante, </em>at 67. The Court thus openly claims the power not only to approve or disapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on evidence of how society\u2019s standards <em>have </em>evolved, but also on the basis of the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d perception of how those standards <em>should </em>evolve, which depends on what the Court concedes is \u201c \u2018 \u201cnecessarily ... a moral judgment\u201d \u2019 \u201d regarding the propriety of a given punishment in today\u2019s society. <em>Ante, </em>at 58 (quoting <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>at 419).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The categorical proportionality review the Court employs in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation. The Court\u2019s decision today is significant because it does not merely apply this standard \u2014 it remarkably expands its reach. For the first time in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Until today, the Court has based its categorical proportionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives special protection to capital defendants because the death penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be reserved for only those who are \u201cmost deserving of execution.\u201d <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 319; see <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 568; <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>455 U. S. 104 (1982); <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U. S. 586 (1978). Of course, the Eighth Amendment itself makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>distinction between capital and noncapital sentencing, but the \u201c \u2018bright line\u2019 \u201d the Court drew between the two penalties has for many years served as the principal justification for the Court\u2019s willingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death penalty. See <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Today\u2019s decision eviscerates that distinction. \u201cDeath is different\u201d no longer. The Court now claims not only the power categorically to reserve the \u201cmost severe punishment\u201d for those the Court thinks are \u201c \u2018the most deserving of execution/ \u201d <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 568 (quoting <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 319), <em>but also </em>to declare that \u201cless culpable\u201d persons are categorically exempt from the <em>\u201csecond </em>most severe penalty.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 72 (emphasis added). No reliable limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from immunizing any class of offenders from the law\u2019s third, fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The Court\u2019s departure from the \u201cdeath is different\u201d distinction is especially mystifying when one considers how long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a time the Court declined to apply proportionality principles to noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that \u201ca sentence of death differs in kind from any sentence of imprisonment, <em>no matter how long.\u201d Rummel, </em>445 U. S., at 272 (emphasis added). Based on that rationale, the Court found that the exeessiveness of one prison term as compared to another was \u201cproperly within the province of legislatures, not courts,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 275-276, precisely because it involved an <em>\u201cinvariably . . . subjective determination, </em>there being no clear way to make \u2018any constitutional distinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer term of years/ \u201d <em>Hutto </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>454 U. S. 370, 373 (1982) <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting <em>Rummel, supra, </em>at 275; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Even when the Court broke from that understanding in its 5-to-4 decision in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U. S. 277 (1983) (strik<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ing down as \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d a life-without-parole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a worthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the facts of that case; it announced no categorical rule. <em>Id., </em>at 288, 303. Moreover, the Court soon cabined <em>Solem\u2019s </em>rationale. The controlling opinion in the Court\u2019s very next noncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles of federalism require substantial deference to legislative choices regarding the proper length of prison sentences. <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U. S., at 999 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201c[Mjarked divergences both in underlying theories of sentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms are the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal structure\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 1000 (\u201c[DJiffering attitudes and perceptions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational, conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison terms for particular crimes\u201d). That opinion thus concluded that <em>\u201csuccessful </em>challenges to the proportionality of [prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years since <em>Solem, </em>the Court has considered just three such challenges and has rejected them all, see <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>California, </em>538 U. S. 11 (2003); <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U. S. 63 (2003); <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>largely on the theory that criticisms of the \u201cwisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness\u201d of term-of-years prison sentences are \u201cappropriately directed at the legislature^],\u201d not the courts, <em>Ewing, supra, </em>at 27, 28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that those decisions were \u201cclosely divided,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 59, but so was <em>Solem </em>itself, and it is now fair to describe <em>Solem </em>as an outlier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to So lew\u2019s case-by-ease proportionality standard for noncapital sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a <em>categorical </em>proportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences not just in this case, but in <em>every </em>case involving a juvenile nonhomi-cide offender, no matter what the circumstances. Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court\u2019s precedents justify this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Court asserts that categorical proportionality review is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a categorical rule, see <em>ante, </em>at 61, and because the Court thinks clear lines are a good idea, see <em>ante, </em>at 75. I find those factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court\u2019s break from past practice. First, the Court fails to acknowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire category of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a much heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief under <em>Solem. </em>Unlike the petitioner in <em>Solem, </em>Graham must establish not only that his own life-without-parole sentence is \u201cgrossly disproportionate,\u201d but also that such a sentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is applied to a juvenile nonhomi-cide offender, no matter how heinous his crime. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U. S. 739 (1987). Second, even applying the Court\u2019s categorical \u201cevolving standards\u201d test, neither objective evidence of national consensus nor the notions of culpability on which the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment\u201d relies can justify the categorical rule it declares here.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment analysis \u201cbegins with objective indicia of national consensus,\u201d* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country\u2019s legislatures,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, the analysis should end quickly, because a national \u201cconsensus\u201d in favor of the Court\u2019s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50 States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>ante, </em>at 82-85 (appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty-five States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia expose juvenile offenders charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>in adult court to the very same range of punishments faced by adults charged with the same crimes. See <em>ante, </em>at 82-84 (Part I). Eight of those States do not make life-without-parole sentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regardless of age.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All remaining jurisdictions \u2014 the Federal Government, the other 37 States, and the District \u2014 authorize life-without-parole sentences for certain nonhomicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such sentences on persons under 18. See <em>ibid. </em>Only <em>five </em>States prohibit juvenile offenders from receiving a life-without-parole sentence that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ,</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">No plausible claim of a consensus against this sentencing practice can be made in light of this overwhelming legislative evidence. The sole fact that federal law authorizes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our Nation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality that 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit the practice makes the claim utterly implausible. Not only is there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear legislative consensus <em>in favor </em>of its availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence aside as \u201cincomplete and unavailing,\u201d declaring that \u201c \u2018[t]here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>are measures of consensus other than legislation.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 62 (quoting <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U. S., at 433). This is nothing short of stunning. Most importantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And although the Court has never decided how many state laws are necessary to show consensus, the Court has never banished into constitutional exile a sentencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a supermajority, of States expressly permit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeNW\">Moreover, the consistency and direction of recent legislation \u2014 a factor the Court previously has relied upon when crafting categorical proportionality rules, see <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 315-316; <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 565-566 \u2014 underscores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the consensus <em>against </em>the rule the Court announces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a national consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a consensus in favor of the two penological points it later discusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than similarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit nonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation through parole. <em>Ante, </em>at 68-69,74-75. But legislative trends make that assumption untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">First, States over the past 20 years have consistently <em>increased </em>the severity of punishments for juvenile offenders. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the 1990's as \u201ca time of unprecedented change as State legislatures crackled] down on juvenile crime\u201d); <em>ibid, </em>(noting that, during that period, \u201clegislatures in 47 States and the District of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile justice systems more punitive,\u201d principally by \u201cma[king] it easier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile justice system to the [adult] criminal justice system\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 104. This, in my view, reveals the States\u2019 widespread agreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same culpability as adults and that the law should permit judges and juries to consider adult sentences \u2014 including life without parole \u2014 in those rare and unfortunate cases. See Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal Responsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law &amp; Family Studies 11, 69-70 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole sentences for juveniles have increased since the 1980\u2019s); Amnesty International <em>&amp; </em>Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over the same period. Congress abolished parole for federal offenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to \u201cgamesmanship and cynicism,\u201d Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180 (1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1987), and several States have followed suit, see T. Hughes, D. Wilson, <em>&amp; </em>A. Beck, Dept, of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990-2000, p. 1 (2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had abolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States had abolished it for certain ones). In light of these developments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus that parole must be available to offenders less than 18 years old in <em>every </em>nonhomicide case simply fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The Court nonetheless dismisses existing legislation, pointing out that life-without-parole sentences are rarely imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders \u2014 123 times in recent memory<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by the Court\u2019s calculation, spread out across 11 States.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 62-64. Based on this rarity of use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice, implying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus of a prior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures tone-deaf to the moral values of their constituents that this Court claims to have easily discerned from afar. See <em>ante, </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This logic strains credulity. It has been rejected before. <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U. S. 153, 182 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (\u201c[T]he relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment <em>per se. </em>Rather, [it] ... may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases\u201d)- It should also be rejected here. That a punishment is rarely imposed demonstrates nothing more than a general consensus that it should be just that \u2014 rarely imposed. It is not proof that the punishment is one the Nation abhors.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that authorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating a juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole sentence, cannot be counted as approving its use. The mere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this penalty, the Court explains, \u201cdoes not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">But this misapplies the Court\u2019s own evolving standards test. Under that test, \u201c[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to establish a national consensus <em>approving </em>what their citizens have voted to do; rather, it is the \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of petitioners to establish a national consensus <em>against </em>it.\u201d <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (quoting <em>Gregg, supra, </em>at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); some emphasis added; citation omitted). In light of this fact, the Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction\u2019s disuse of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>legislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition to it. The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this sentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the citizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility that a jury of their peers could impose a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is sufficiently depraved.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illustrates this point. Just weeks before the release of this opinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life without parole after hearing evidence that he viciously attacked a 17-year-old girl who gave him a ride home from a party. See Stogsdill, Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, Tulsa World, Apr. 2, 2010, p. A10; Stogsdill, Delaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12. Budder allegedly put the girl\u2019s head \u201c \u2018into a headlock and sliced her throat,\u2019 \u201d raped her, stabbed her about 20 times, beat her, and pounded her face into the rocks alongside a dirt road. Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, at A10. Miraculously,- the victim survived. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Budder\u2019s crime was rare in its brutality. The sentence the jury imposed was also rare. According to the study relied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such offender in its prison system before Budder\u2019s offense. P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14 (Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, therefore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma\u2019s citizens as morally opposed to life-without-parole. sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Yet Oklahoma\u2019s experience proves the inescapable flaw in that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws that allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole sentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries invoke those laws rarely \u2014 in the unusual cases that they find exceptionally depraved. I cannot agree with the Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally disabled from using this sentencing practice merely because they have not done so more frequently. If anything, the rarity of this penalty\u2019s use underscores just how judicious sentencing judges and juries across the country have been in invoking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This fact is entirely consistent with the Court\u2019s intuition that juveniles <em>generally </em>are less culpable and more capable of growth than adults. See <em>infra, </em>at 116-118. Graham\u2019s own case provides another example. Graham was statutorily eligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first crime. But the record indicates that the trial court did not give such a sentence serious consideration at Graham\u2019s initial plea hearing. It was only after Graham subsequently violated his parole by invading a home at gunpoint that the maximum sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In sum, the Court\u2019s calculation that 123 juvenile nonhomi-cide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed nationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly amounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice offends our common sense of decency.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the Court finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case are stronger than those supporting at least one other penalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court, joined by the author of today\u2019s opinion, upheld the application of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the fact that no such punishment had been carried out on a person of that age in this country in nearly 30 years. See <em>Stanford, </em>492 U. S., at 374. Whatever the statistical frequency with which life-without-parole sentences have been imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the last 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation and the frequency of a penalty\u2019s use are merely ornaments in the Court\u2019s analysis, window dressing that accompanies its judicial fiat.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By the Court\u2019s own decree, \u201c[cjommunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>consensus ... is not itself determinative.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 67. Only the independent moral judgment of this Court is sufficient to. decide the question. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court shifts to the heart of its argument: its \u201cindependent judgment\u201d that this sentencing practice does not \u201cserv[e] legitimate penological goals.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court begins that analysis with the obligatory preamble that \u201c\u2018[t]he Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 71 (quoting <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U. S., at 999 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)), then promptly mandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems best.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">First, the Court acknowledges that, at a minimum, the imposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile nonhom-icide offenders serves two \u201clegitimate\u201d penological, goals: incapacitation and deterrence. <em>Ante, </em>at 72-74. By definition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation by ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed burglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex crimes described by The Chief Justice, no longer threaten their communities. See <em>ante, </em>at 93-94 (opinion concurring in judgment). That should settle the matter, since the Court acknowledges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>that incapacitation is an \u201cimportant\u201d penological goal. <em>Ante, </em>at 72. Yet, the Court finds this goal <em>\u201cinadequate\u201d </em>to justify the life-without-parole sentences here. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). A similar fate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such sentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to some degree, but rejects that peno-logical goal, not as illegitimate, but as insufficient. <em>Ibid. </em>(\u201c[A]ny limited deterrent effect provided by life without parole is <em>not enough </em>to justify the sentence\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but laments that life-without-parole sentences do little to promote this goal because they result in the offender\u2019s permanent incarceration. <em>Ante, </em>at 74. Of course, the Court recognizes that rehabilitation's \u201cutility and proper implementation\u201d are subject to debate. <em>Ante, </em>at 73. But that does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may not \u201cforswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 74. In other words, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate \u201cany one penological theory,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted), just one the Court approves.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Ultimately, however, the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment\u201d and the proportionality rule itself center on retribution \u2014 the notion that a criminal sentence should be proportioned to \u201c\u2018the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 67, 71 (quoting <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987)). The Court finds that retributive purposes are not served here for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">First, quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 569-570, the Court concludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults because, as compared to adults, they \u201chave a \u2018 \u201clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\u201d\u2019\u201d and \u201ctheir characters are \u2018not as well formed.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 68. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>evidence recounted above that judges and juries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently, despite legislative authorization to do so in many more cases. See Part III-B, <em>supra. </em>Our society tends to treat the average juvenile as less culpable than the average adult. But the question here does not involve the average juvenile. The question, instead, is whether the Constitution prohibits judges and juries from <em>ever </em>concluding that an offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated sufficient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his permanent incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the Court cites \u201cdevelopments in psychology and brain science\u201d indicating that juvenile minds \u201ccontinue to mature through late adolescence,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 68 (citing Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>16-24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>22-27 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that juveniles are \u201cmore likely [than adults] to engage in risky behaviors,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 7. But even if such generalizations from social science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking, the Court misstates the data on which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial number of youths to engage in \u201crisky\u201d or antisocial behaviors with the propensity of a much smaller group to commit violent crimes. <em>Ante, </em>at 76-79. But research relied upon by the <em>amici </em>cited in the Court\u2019s opinion differentiates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a fleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pattern. See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-Course-Persistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxonomy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA Brief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who are \u201cantisocial only during adolescence\u201d and a smaller group who engage in antisocial behavior \u201cat every life stage\u201d despite \u201cdrifting] through successive systems aimed at curbing their deviance\u201d). That research further suggests that the pattern of behavior in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>latter group often sets in before 18. See Moffitt, <em>swpra, </em>at 684 (\u201cThe well-documented resistance of antisocial personality disorder to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the life-eourse-persistent style is fixed sometime before age 18\u201d). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evidence that an adolescent offender\u2019s antisocial behavior is <em>not </em>transient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the Taxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-Limited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status of Criminological Theory 277, 292-293 (F. Cullen, J. Wright, &amp; K. Blevins eds. 2006) (observing that \u201clife-course persistent\u201d males \u201ctended to specialize in serious offenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault, robbery, violating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited\u201d ones \u201cspecialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5, public drunkenness, giving false information on application forms, pirating computer software, etc.)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this psychological or sociological data is sufficient to support the Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018moral\u2019 \u201d conclusion that youth defeats culpability in <em>every </em>case. <em>Ante, </em>at 68 (quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 570); see <em>id., </em>at 618 (Scalia, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case Against Adolescence 171 (2007) (reporting on a study of juvenile reasoning skills and concluding that \u201cmost teens are capable of conventional, adult-like moral reasoning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Court responds that a categorical rule is nonetheless necessary to prevent the \u201c \u2018unacceptable likelihood\u2019 \u201d that a judge or jury, unduly swayed by \u201c\u2018the brutality or coldblooded nature\u2019 \u201d of a juvenile\u2019s nonhomicide crime, will sentence him to a life-without-parole sentence for which he possesses \u201c \u2018insufficient culpability,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 78 (quoting <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 572-573). I find that justification entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal justice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand between the defendant and an outraged public and dispassionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of punishment based on the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>presented. That process necessarily admits of human error. But so does the process of judging in which we engage. As between the two, I find far. more \u201cunacceptable\u201d that this Court, swayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of youth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to decide for themselves when the rare case requires different treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does not even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile mind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and federal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who commit homicides. See <em>ante, </em>at 68-69. The Court thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in the psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from acquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life-without-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects overwhelming legislative consensus only on the question of which <em>acts </em>are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old who pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate sufficient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8-year-old and leaves her for dead does not. See <em>ibid.; </em>cf. <em>ante, </em>at 93-94 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment) (describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Milagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court\u2019s conclusion that life-without-parole sentences are \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d for juvenile nonhomi-cide offenders in fact has very little to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do with its perception that \u201cdefendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such an untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The question of what acts are \u201cdeserving\u201d of what punishments is bound so tightly with questions of morality and social conditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question for legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding certain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capital punishment. See <em>supra, </em>at 100-101. But never before today has the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to impose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser punishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established boundary raises the question whether any democratic choice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the Court\u2019s ever-expanding constitutional veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Although The Chief Justice\u2019s concurrence avoids the problems associated with expanding categorical proportionality review to noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality analysis in a way that raises the same fundamental concern. Although I do not believe <em>Solem </em>merits <em>stare decisis </em>treatment, Graham\u2019s claim cannot prevail even under that test (as it has been limited by the Court\u2019s subsequent precedents). <em>Solem </em>instructs a court first to compare the \u201cgravity\u201d of an offender\u2019s conduct to the \u201charshness of the penalty\u201d to determine whether an \u201cinference\u201d of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S., at 290-291. Only in \u201cthe rare case\u201d in which such an inference is present should the court proceed to the \u201cobjective\u201d part of the inquiry \u2014 an intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparison of the defendant's sentence with others similarly situated. <em>Har-melin, </em>501 U. S., at 1000, 1005 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Under the Court\u2019s precedents, I fail to see how an \u201cinference\u201d of gross disproportionality arises here. The concurrence notes several arguably mitigating facts \u2014 Graham\u2019s \u201clack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbringing.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 92 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). But the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a <em>nonviolent </em>drug crime. See <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 1002-1004. Graham\u2019s conviction for an actual violent felony is surely more severe than that offense. As for Graham\u2019s age, it is true that <em>Roper </em>held juveniles categorically ineligible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence explains, <em>Roper </em>was based on the \u201cexplicit conclusion that [juveniles] \u2018cannot with reliability be classified among the <em>worst </em>offenders\u2019 \u201d; it did \u201cnot establish that juveniles can never be eligible for life without parole.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 89 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 569; emphasis added in opinion of Roberts, C. J.). In my view, <em>Roper's </em>principles are thus not generally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the same type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it restrains itself to a ease-by-case rather than a categorical ruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham \u201cthe general presumption of diminished culpability\u201d for juveniles, <em>ante, </em>at 92, apparently because it believes that Graham\u2019s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were \u201ccertainly less serious\u201d than murder or rape, <em>ante, </em>at 91. It recoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend the same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex crime. See <em>ante, </em>at 94-95. I simply cannot accept that these subjective judgments of proportionality are ones the Eighth Amendment authorizes us to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The \u201cobjective\u201d elements of the <em>Solem </em>test provide no additional support for the concurrence\u2019s conclusion. The concurrence compares Graham\u2019s sentence to \u201csimilar\u201d sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in Florida and concludes that Graham\u2019s sentence was \u201cfar more severe.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 93 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment). But strangely, the concurrence uses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as examples of \u201csimilar\u201d offenses, even though it seems that a run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to Graham\u2019s criminal history, which includes a charge for armed burglary <em>with assault, and </em>a probation violation for invading a home at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">And even if Graham\u2019s sentence is higher than ones he might have received for an armed burglary with assault in other jurisdictions, see <em>ibid., </em>this hardly seems relevant if one takes seriously the principle that \u201c \u2018[ajbsent a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of federalism, some State will <em>always </em>bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other State,\u201d' <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 1000 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (quoting <em>Rummel, </em>445 U. S., at 282; emphasis added). Applying <em>Solem, </em>the Court has upheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under California\u2019s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and its <em>amici </em>could cite only \u201ca single instance of a similar sentence imposed outside the context of California\u2019s three strikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching two million individuals.\u201d <em>Ewing, </em>538 U. S., at 47 (Breyer, J., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole sentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the fact that only one other State would have authorized such a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that State required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilograms) to trigger the penalty. See <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>at 1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham\u2019s sentence is certainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases, so his claim fails even under <em>Solem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Both the Court and the concurrence claim their decisions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line-drawing problems to which courts must seek answers beyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds that \u201c[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,\u201d but must provide the offender with \u201csome meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 75. But what, exactly, does such a \u201cmeaningful\u201d opportunity entail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment principles will govern review by the parole boards the Court now demands that States empanel? The Court provides no answers to these questions, which will no doubt embroil the courts for years.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life-without-parole sentence \u201cfits\u201d the crime at issue here or the crimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more generally, but to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The Florida Legislature has concluded that such sentences should be available for persons under 18 who commit certain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to impose that legislatively authorized sentence here. Because a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of punishment under any standard, the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to reject those judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It would be unjustifiable for the Court to declare otherwise even if it could claim that a bare majority of state laws supported its independent moral view. The fact that the Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an overwhelming legislative majority <em>in favor </em>of leaving that sentencing option available under certain cases simply illustrates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional principle the Court has reached to ensure that its own sense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of the people and their representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I agree with Justice Stevens that \u201c[w]e learn, sometimes, from our mistakes.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 85 (concurring opinion). Perhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The Chief Justice\u2019s concurrence suggests that it is unnecessary to remark on the underlying question whether the Eighth Amendment requires proportionality in sentencing because \u201c[njeither party here asks us to reexamine our precedents\u201d requiring \u201cproportionality between noncapital offenses and their corresponding punishments.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 86 (opinion concurring in judgment). I disagree. Both the Court and the concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality precedents to the particulars of Graham\u2019s daim. The Court radically departs from the framework those precedents establish by applying to a noncapital sentence the categorical proportionality review its prior decisions have reserved for death penalty cases alone. See Part III, <em>infra. </em>The concurrence, meanwhile, breathes new life into the case-by-case proportionality approach that previously governed noncapital cases, from which the Court has steadily, and wisely, retreated since <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U. S. 277 (1983). See Part IV, <em>infra. </em>In dissenting from both choices to expand proportionality review, I find it essential to reexamine the foundations on which that doctrine is built.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\"> Courts and commentators interpreting this Court\u2019s decisions have reached this conclusion.

S. 399, 405 (1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the evidence is clear that, at the time of the founding, \u201cthe common law set the rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the age of 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to be imposed on anyone over the age of 7.\u201d <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>492 U.

After the Court released its opinion, the Acting Solicitor General disputed the BOP's calculations and stated that none of those six offenders was serving a life-without-parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime completed before the age of 18. See Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting Solicitor General, U. S. Dept, of Justice, to Clerk of the Supreme Court (May 24,2010) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (noting that five of the six inmates were convicted for participation in unlawful conspiracies that began when they were juveniles but continued after they reached the age of 18, and noting that the sixth inmate was convicted of murder as a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act). The Court has amended its opinion in light of the Acting Solicitor General\u2019s letter. In my view, the inconsistency between the BOP\u2019s classification of these six offenders and the Solicitor General\u2019s is irrelevant. The fact remains that federal law, and the laws of a supermajority of States, permit this sentencing practice. And, as will be explained, see <em>infra </em>this page and 111-115, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>judges and jurors have chosen to impose this sentence in the very worst cases they have encountered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> Because existing legislation plainly suffices to refute any consensus against this sentencing practice, I assume the accuracy of the Court\u2019s evidence regarding the frequency with which this sentence has been imposed. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about the Court\u2019s figures. First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those juveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis all juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences <em>(e. g., </em>70 or 80 years\u2019 imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury imposing such a long sentence \u2014 which effectively denies the offender any material opportunity for parole \u2014 would express moral outrage at a life-without-parole sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the Court\u2019s analysis, the statistical information presently available would be woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule that can be revoked only by constitutional amendment. The only evidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sentence\u2019s imposition was a single study completed after this Court granted certiorari in this ease. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to question the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the study itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its kind. See <em>id., </em>at 1. The Court\u2019s questionable decision to \u201ccomplete\u201d the study on its own does not materially increase its reliability. For one thing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from ever disputing its findings. Complicating matters further, the original study sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the States themselves, see <em>ibid.; </em>the study has never been peer reviewed; and specific data on all 123 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of conviction, etc.) have not been collected, making verification of the Court\u2019s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames Florida for all of this. See <em>ante, </em>at 63. But as already noted, it is not Florida\u2019s burden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this sentencing practice, but Graham\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove a consensus <em>against </em>it. See <em>supra, </em>at 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">I confine to a footnote the Court\u2019s discussion of foreign laws and sentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such factors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court\u2019s discernment of any longstanding tradition in <em>this </em>Nation. See <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 324-325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Here, two points suffice. First, despite the Court\u2019s attempt to count the actual number of juvenile non-homicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in other nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within our borders), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>laws </em>of other countries permit juvenile life-without-parole sentences, see Child Rights Information Network, C. de la Vega, M. Montesano, &amp; A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on Juvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess., \u00b69 (Nov. 3, 2009), online at http:// www.erin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (\u201cEleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the sentencing of child offenders to life without [the] possibility of release\u201d (as visited May 14,2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)). Second, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the world remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself among the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making that choice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\"> It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, permits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of imprisonment for up to 40 years. Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-1.3-401(4)(b) (2009). In light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently <em>permits </em>life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence of agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole hearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7 (counsel for Graham, stating that \u201c[o]ur position is that it should be left up to the States to decide. We think that the . . . Colorado provision would probably be constitutional\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b172-8\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">I join Parts I and III of Justice Thomas' dissenting opinion. I write separately to make two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\"><em>First, </em>the Court holds only that \u201cfor a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of <em>life without parole.\u201d Ante, </em>at 74 (emphasis added). Nothing in the Court's opinion afreets the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the possibility of parole. Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral argument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without the possibility of parole \u201cprobably\u201d would be constitutional. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7; see also <em>ante, </em>at 123, n. 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\"><em>Second, </em>the question whether petitioner\u2019s sentence violates the narrow, as-applied proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences is not properly before us in this case. Although petitioner asserted an as-applied proportionality challenge to his sentence before the Florida courts, see 982 So. 2d 43, 51-53 (Fla. App. 2008), he did not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>an as-applied claim in his petition for certiorari or in his merits briefs before this Court. Instead, petitioner argued for only a categorical rule banning the imposition of life without parole on <em>any </em>juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense. Because petitioner abandoned his as-applied claim, I would not reach that issue. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a); <em>Yee </em>v. <em>Escondido, </em>503 U. S. 519, 534-538 (1992).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
