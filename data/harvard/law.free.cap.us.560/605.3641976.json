The statute in question focuses upon mandatory restitution for victims of crimes. It provides that \u201cthe court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5). We hold that a sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power to order restitution \u2014 at least where, as here, the sentencing court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On February 8,2007, petitioner Brian Dolan pleaded guilty to a federal charge of assault resulting in serious bodily injury. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a)(6), 1153; App. 17. He entered into a plea agreement that stated that \u201crestitution... may be ordered by the Court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18. The presentence report, provided to the court by the end of May, noted that restitution was required. But, lacking precise information about hospital costs and lost wages, it did not recommend a restitution amount. <em>Id., </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">On July 30, the District Court held Dolan\u2019s sentencing hearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment along with 3 years of supervised release. <em>Id., </em>at 38. The judge, aware that restitution was \u201cmandatory,\u201d said that there was \u201cinsufficient information on the record at this time regarding possible restitution payments that may be owed,\u201d that he would \u201cleave that matter open, pending the receipt of additional information,\u201d and that Dolan could \u201canticipate that such an award will be made in the future.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 39-40. A few days later (August 8) the court entered a judgment, which, among other things, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\u201cPursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitution is applicable; however, no information has been received regarding possible restitution payments that may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order restitution at this time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 49 (boldface deleted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The probation office later prepared an addendum to the pre-sentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the views of the parties, and which the judge later indicated he had received. <em>Id., </em>at 54. The addendum documents the \u201ctotal amount of restitution\u201d due in the case (about $105,000). <em>Id., </em>at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after Dolan\u2019s July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the statute\u2019s \u201c90 days after sentencing\u201d deadline would expire. \u00a7 3664(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hearing for February 4, 2008 \u2014 about three months after the 90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no one asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing, Dolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed. <em>Id., </em>at 54-55. And he argued that the law no longer authorized the court to order restitution. <em>Id., </em>at 60-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The court disagreed and ordered restitution. See Memorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR 06-02173-RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F. 3d 1022 (CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the Courts of Appeals, we granted Dolan\u2019s petition for certiorari on the question. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cheal, </em>389 F. 3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court\u2019s authority to enter restitution order past 90 days), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Balentine, </em>569 F. 3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maung, </em>267 F. 3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such authority), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>419 F. 3d 621 (CA7 2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the 90-day statutory deadline \u201cfor the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses.\u201d \u00a7 3664(d)(5). No one has offered any excuse for the court\u2019s doing so. Nor did any party seek an extension or \u201ctolling\u201d of the 90 days for equitable or for other reasons. All the information needed to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>requisite restitution amount was available before the 90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us concerns the consequences of the missed deadline where, as here, the statute does not specify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In answering this kind of question, this Court has looked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is designed to serve. The Court\u2019s answers have varied depending upon the particular statute and time limit at issue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in question imposes a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d condition upon, for example, a court\u2019s authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or to act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, <em>e. g., Bowles </em>v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). But cf. <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule did not show legislative intent to \u201cdelineat[e] the classes of cases\u201d and \u201cpersons\u201d properly \u201cwithin a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority\u201d); see also <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muchnick, </em>559 U. S. 154, 160-161 (2010) (discussing use of term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d). The expiration of a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d deadline prevents the court from permitting or taking the action to which the statute attached the deadline. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot waive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable reasons. See <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U. S. 130, 133-134 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines are more ordinary \u201cclaims-processing rules,\u201d rules that do not limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court. Unless a party points out to the court that another litigant has missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the deadline\u2019s protection. See, <em>e. g., Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, supra, </em>at 454-456 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor\u2019s objection to debtor discharge); <em>Eberhart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) <em>(per curiam) </em>(7-day criminal rule deadline for filing motion for a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>In still other instances, we have found that a deadline seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other public official of the power to take the action to which the deadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>495 U. S. 711, 722 (1990) (missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing does not require judge to release defendant); <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Pierce County, </em>476 U. S. 253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline for making final determination as to misuse of federal grant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds); <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Peabody Coal Co., </em>537 U. S. 149, 171-172 (2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree benefits does not prevent later award of benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">After examining the language, the context, and the purposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision before us sets forth this third kind of limitation. The fact that a sentencing court misses the statute\u2019s 90-day deadline, even through its own fault or that of the Government, does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. <em>First, </em>where, as here, a statute \u201cdoes not specify a consequence for noncompliance with\u201d its \u201ctiming provisions,\u201d \u201cfederal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>James Daniel Good Real Property, </em>510 U. S. 43, 63 (1993); see also <em>Montalvo-Murillo, supra, </em>at 717-721. Cf., <em>e. g., </em>Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1); \u00a7 3162(a)(2) (statute specifying that missed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment); <em>Zedner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>547 U. S. 489, 507-509 (2006) (\u201cThe sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">We concede that the statute here uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d \u00a7 3664(d)(5), but a statute\u2019s use of that word alone has not always led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges (or other officials) from taking the action to which a missed stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>utory deadline refers. See, <em>e. g., Montalvo-Murillo, supra, </em>at 718-719 (use of word \u201cshall\u201d in context of bail hearing makes duty \u201cmandatory\u201d but does not mean that the \u201csanction for breach\u201d is \u201closs of all later powers to act\u201d); <em>Brock, supra, </em>at 262 (same in context of misuse of federal funds); <em>Barnhart, supra, </em>at 158-168 (same in context of benefits assignments). See also <em>Regions Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998) (same in respect to federal official\u2019s reporting date).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>Second, </em>the statute\u2019s text places primary weight upon, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending an older provision that left restitution to the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion, the statute before us (entitled \u201cThe Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996\u201d) says <em>\u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense ... , the court <em>shall </em>order . . . that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(l) (emphasis added); cf. \u00a7 3663(a)(1) (stating that a court \u201cmay\u201d order restitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other specified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitution shall be ordered in the \u201cfull amount of each victim\u2019s losses\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><em>Third, </em>the Act\u2019s procedural provisions reinforce this substantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks primarily to ensure that victims of a crime receive full restitution. To be sure speed is important. The statute requires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to prepare a report providing \u201ca complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant.\u201d \u00a7 3664(a). The prosecutor, after consulting with all identified victims, must \u201cpromptly provide\u201d a listing of the amount subject to restitution <em>\u201cnot later than 60 days </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>prior to the date initially set for sentencing\u201d </em>\u00a7 3664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the provision before us says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cIf the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a7 3664(d)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">But the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus, in the sentence following the language we have just quoted, the statute continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201cIf the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The sentence imposes no time limit on the victim\u2019s subsequent discovery of losses. Consequently, a court might award restitution for those losses long after the original sentence was imposed and the 90-day time limit has expired. That fact, along with the Act\u2019s main substantive objectives, is why we say that the Act\u2019s efforts to secure speedy determination of restitution is <em>primarily </em>designed to help victims of crime secure prompt restitution rather than to provide defendants with certainty as to the amount of their liability. Cf. S. Rep. No. 104-179, p. 20 (1995) (recognizing \u201cthe need for finality and certainty in the sentencing process,\u201d but also stating that the \u201csole due process interest of the defendant being protected ... is the right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises or inaccurate information\u201d); see also <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[Jjustiee cannot be considered served until full restitution is made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order restitution would harm those\u2014 the victims of crime \u2014 who likely bear no responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the deadline\u2019s being missed and whom the statute also seeks to benefit. Cf. \u00a7 3664(g)(1) (\u201cNo victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order\u201d). The potential for such harm \u2014 to third parties \u2014 normally provides a strong indication that Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture, here depriving a court of the power to award restitution to victims. See <em>Brock, </em>476 U. S., at 261-262 (parties concede and court assumes that official can \u201cproceed after the deadline\u201d where \u201cinaction\u201d would hurt third party); see also 3 N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a757:19, pp. 73-74 (7th ed. 2008) (hereinafter Singer, Statutory Construction) (missing a deadline does not remove power to exercise a duty where there is no \u201clanguage denying performance after a specified time,\u201d and especially \u201cwhere a mandatory construction might do great injury to persons not at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a public officer might prejudice private rights or the public interest\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"><em>Fifth, </em>we have previously interpreted similar statutes similarly. In <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>495 U. S. 711, for example, we considered the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which states that a \u201cjudicial officer shall hold a hearing\u201d to determine whether to grant bail to an arrested person and that \u201chearing shall be held <em>immediately upon the person\u2019s first appearance </em>before the judicial officer.\u201d (A continuance of up to five days may also be granted.) 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3142(f) (emphasis added). The judicial officer missed this deadline, but the Court held that the judicial officer need not release the detained person. Rather, \u201conce the Government discovers that the time limits have expired, it may [still] ask for a prompt detention hearing and make its case to detain based upon the requirements set forth in the statute.\u201d 495 U. S., at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The Court reasoned that \u201ca failure to comply\u201d with the hearing deadline \u201cdoes not so subvert the procedural scheme ... as to invalidate the hearing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 717. Missing the deadline did not diminish the strength of the Government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>interest in preventing release to avert the likely commission of crimes \u2014 the very objective of the Act. <em>Id., </em>at 720. Nor would mandatory release of the detained person \u201cproportion-[atelyj\u201d repair the \u201cinconvenience and uncertainty a timely hearing would have spared him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Here, as in <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>neither the language nor the structure of the statute requires denying the victim restitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline. As in <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>doing so would defeat the basic purpose of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. And, here, as in <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>that remedy does not \u201cproportionately]\u201d repair the harm caused the defendant through delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant \u201cknew about restitution,\u201d including the likely amount, well before expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. Indeed, our result here follows from <em>Montalvo-Murillo a fortiori, </em>for here delay at worst postpones the day of financial reckoning. In <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>delay postponed a constitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached risk that the defendant would remain improperly confined in jail. See 495 U. S., at 728 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting the seriousness \u201cof the deprivation of liberty that physical detention imposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Nor does <em>Montalvo-Murillo </em>stand alone. The Court there found support in similar cases involving executive officials charged with carrying out mandatory public duties in a timely manner. See <em>id., </em>at 717-718 (citing <em>French </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872); <em>Brock, supra, </em>at 260). Those cases, in turn, are consistent with numerous similar decisions made by courts throughout the Nation. See, <em>e. g., Taylor </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>260 N. W. 2d 521, 522-523 (Iowa 1977); <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>154 Kan. 751, 756-757, 121 P. 2d 179, 182 (1942); <em>State </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>233 Wis. 461, 466, 289 N. W. 769, 771 (1940); see also 3 Singer, Statutory Construction \u00a757:19, at 74 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\"><em>Sixth, </em>the defendant normally can mitigate any harm that a missed deadline might cause \u2014 at least if, as here, he ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tains the relevant information regarding the restitution amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defendant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been) missed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action. See \u00a7 3664(d)(4) (providing that \u201ccourt may require additional documentation or hear testimony\u201d); \u00a7 3664(d)(5). Though a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to comply with the statute seems improbable, should that occur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651(a); <em>La Buy </em>v. <em>Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U. S. 249 (1957). Cf. <em>Brock, supra, </em>at 260, n. 7 (noting availability of district court action to compel agency compliance with time-related directive).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have understated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can cause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1) A defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is not \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determination of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day deadline is to delay the defendant\u2019s ability to appeal for more than 90 days \u2014 perhaps to the point where his due process rights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The critical problem with this argument lies in its third step. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner here, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware of the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90-day deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by pointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a timely hearing. That did not happen here. And that minimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their due restitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(Should the court still refuse, the defendant could seek mandamus \u2014 which we believe will rarely be necessary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does cause the defendant prejudice \u2014 perhaps by depriving him of evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount \u2014 the defendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact into account upon review. That inquiry might also consider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for its cause, <em>i. e., </em>whether the Government or the victim. Cf., <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>211 F. 3d 1, 4-6 (CA2 2000) (tolling 90-day deadline for defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Terlingo, </em>327 F. 3d 216, 218-223 (CA3 2003) (same). Adopting the dissent\u2019s approach, by contrast, would permit a defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay to prevent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the defendant to manipulate whether restitution could be awarded at all. But since we are not presented with such a case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such potential harm or equitable considerations should be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In focusing upon the argument\u2019s third step, we do not mean to imply that we accept the second premise, <em>i. e., </em>that a sentencing judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution. To the contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determining the restitution amount. The initial judgment here imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This Court has previously said that a judgment that imposes \u201cdiscipline\u201d may still be \u201cfreighted with sufficiently substantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.\u201d <em>Corey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 U. S. 169, 174, 175 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General points to statutes that say that a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d that \u201cincludes\u201d a \u201csentence to imprisonment\u201d is a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3582(b). So is a judgment that imposes supervised release (which can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>be imposed only in conjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). <em>Ibid.; </em>\u00a7 3583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. \u00a7 3572(c). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 3664(o) provides that a \u201csentence that imposes an order of restitution,\u201d such as the later restitution order here, \u201cis a final judgment.\u201d Thus, it is not surprising to find instances where a defendant has appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment; that same defendant has subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution; and the Court of Appeals has consolidated the two appeals and decided them together. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Maung, </em>267 F. 3d, at 1117; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cheat, </em>389 F. 3d, at 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">That the defendant can appeal from the earlier sentencing judgment makes sense, for otherwise the statutory 90-day restitution deadline, even when complied with, could delay appeals for up to 90 days. Defendants, that is, would be forced to wait three months before seeking review of their conviction when they could ordinarily do so within 14 days. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b). Nonetheless, in light of the fact that the interaction of restitution orders with appellate time limits could have consequences extending well beyond cases like the present case (where there was no appeal from the initial conviction and sentence), we simply note the strength of the arguments militating against the second step of petitioner\u2019s argument without deciding whether or when a party can, or must, appeal. We leave all such matters for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The dissent, however, creates a rule that could adversely affect not just restitution, but other sentencing practices beyond the narrow circumstances presented here. Consider, for example, a judge who (currently lacking sufficient information) wishes to leave open, say, the amount of a fine, or a special condition of supervised release. In the dissent\u2019s view, the entry of any such judgment would immediately de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>prive the judge of the authority later to fill in that blank, in the absence of a statute specifically providing otherwise. See post, at 622-624 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). Thus, the sentencing judge would either have to (1) forgo the specific dollar amount or potential condition, or (2) wait to enter any judgment until all of the relevant information is at hand. The former alternative would sometimes deprive judges of the power to enter components of a sentence they may consider essential. The latter alternative would require the defendant to wait \u2014 perhaps months \u2014 before taking an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">As we have pointed out, our precedents do not currently place the sentencing judge in any such dilemma. See <em>supra, </em>at 611-612, 614-615. And we need not now depart from those precedents when <em>this </em>case does not require us to do so; when the issue has not been adequately briefed; when the lower court had no opportunity to consider the argument (which the petitioner may well have forfeited); and when the rule would foreclose the current practices of some district courts and unnecessarily cabin the discretion they properly exercise over scheduling and sentencing matters. Cf., <em>e. g., Stevens, supra, </em>at 3; <em>Cheat, supra, </em>at 47 (illustrating district court practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Certainly there is no need to create this rule in the context of restitution, for provisions to which the dissent refers are silent about whether restitution can or cannot be ordered after an initial sentencing. See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3551(b), (c) (\u201cA sanction authorized by [criminal forfeiture and restitution statutes] may be imposed in addition to the [rest of the] sentence\u201d); \u00a7 3663A(c)(l) (mandatory orders of restitution \u201cshall apply in all sentencing proceedings [for specified offenses]\u201d). And even on the dissent\u2019s theory, the statute elsewhere provides the necessary substantive authorization: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense <em>..., the court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitution to the victim </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>of the </em>offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(l) (emphasis added). The dissent cannot explain why a <em>separate </em>statutory provision regarding procedures as to when a \u201ccourt shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses,\u201d \u00a7 3664(d)(5), automatically divests a eourt of this distinct substantive authority. While of course that provision does not \u201cplainly\u201d confer \u201cpower to act after sentencing,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 625 (emphasis deleted), neither does it \u201cplainly\u201d remove it or require that all sentencing matters be concluded at one point in time. (And the dissent\u2019s assertion, see <em>post, </em>at 626 \u2014 that it uses the term \u201cauthority\u201d not in its \u201cjurisdictional\u201d sense, but rather in the sense that a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d to \u201cimpose a sentence above the . . . maximum\u201d \u2014 introduces a tenuous analogy that may well confuse this Court\u2019s precedents regarding the term \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 610-611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In any event, unless one reads the relevant statute\u2019s 90-day deadline as an ironclad limit upon the judge's authority to make a final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, the statute before us itself provides adequate authority to do what the sentencing judge did here \u2014 essentially fill in an amount-related blank in a judgment that made clear that restitution was \u201capplicable.\u201d App. 49 (boldface deleted). Since the sentencing judge\u2019s later order did not \u201ccorrect\u201d an \u201cerror\u201d in the sentence, Rule 35 does not apply. Compare Fed. Rule Crim. Proe. 35(a) with <em>post, </em>at 622-623. Hence the dissent\u2019s claim that there is no <em>other </em>statute that creates authority (even were we to assume all else in its favor, which we do not) is merely to restate the question posed in this case, not to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Moreover, the dissent\u2019s reading creates a serious statutory anomaly. It reads the statute as permitting a sentencing judge to order restitution for a \u201cvictim\u201d who \u201csubsequently discovers further losses\u201d a month, a year, or 10 years after entry of the original judgment, while at the same time depriving that judge of the power to award restitution to a victim whose \u201closses are not ascertainable\u201d within 90 days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Compare \u00a7 3664(d)(5) (first sentence) with \u00a7 3664(d)(5) (second sentence). How is that a sensible reading of a statute that makes restitution mandatory for victims?</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Finally, petitioner asks \u00fas to apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d in favor of his reading of the statute. Dolan has not provided us with an example of an instance in which the \u201crule of lenity\u201d has been applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. 76 (1820) (applying rule in interpreting substantive criminal statute); <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U. S. 381, 387, 400 (1980) (applying rule in interpreting \u201cpenalties\u201d). But, assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the rule might be so applied, and after considering the statute\u2019s text, structure, and purpose, we nonetheless cannot find a statutory ambiguity sufficiently \u201cgrievous\u201d to warrant its application in this case. <em>Muscarello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U. S. 125, 139 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998) (rejecting application of rule where the \u201cambiguous\u201d reading \u201cis an implausible reading of the congressional purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b669-8\">Chief Justice Roberts,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The statute at issue in this case provides that \u201c[i]f the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable [at least] 10 days prior to sentencing, . . . the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). Under the Court\u2019s view, failing to meet the 90-day deadline has no consequence whatever. The Court reads the statute as if it said \u201cthe court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, <em>at any time </em>after sentencing.\u201d I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"Av7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In the absence of \u00a7 3664(d)(5), any order of restitution must be imposed at sentencing, if it is to be imposed at all. Restitution \u201cmay be imposed in addition to [a] sentence\u201d of probation, fine, or imprisonment only if it is authorized under \u00a7 3556. See \u00a7\u00a7 3551(b)-(c). Section 3556, in turn, authorizes courts to order restitution <em>\u201cin imposing a sentence </em>on a defendant\u201d (emphasis added), pursuant to yet other provisions requiring such orders to be made <em>\u201cwhen sentencing </em>a defendant,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), 3663A(a)(l) (emphasis added). The mandatory restitution provisions of \u00a73663A \u201capply in all <em>sentencing proceedings </em>for convictions of\u201d certain crimes. \u00a7 3663A(e)(l) (emphasis added). And the court \u201cat the time of sentencing\u201d must \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d \u2014 including its reasons for \u201cnot ordering] restitution\u201d if it fails to do so. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">These provisions authorize restitution orders <em>at </em>sentencing. They confer no authority to order restitution <em>after </em>sentencing has concluded. When Congress permits courts to impose criminal penalties at some time <em>other </em>than sentencing, it does so explicitly. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 3552(b) (provisional sentence during a study period); \u00a7 3582(d) (authorizing certain penalties \u201cin imposing a sentence ... or at any time thereafter\u201d); \u00a7 3583(e) (permitting extension of supervised release); \u00a7\u00a7 4244(d)-(e) (provisional sentencing for the mentally ill); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 32.2(b)(2)(B), (4)(A) (presentencing forfeiture orders); cf. <em>Corey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 U. S. 169 (1963) (appeals from provisional and final sentences authorized by law).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Once a sentence has been imposed, moreover, it is final, and the trial judge\u2019s authority to modify it is narrowly circumscribed. We have stated that \u201cthe trial courts had no such authority\u201d prior to the adoption of Rule 35, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Addonizio, </em>442 U. S. 178, 189, and n. 16 (1979), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Congress has since revoked the broad authority to correct illegal sentences originally set forth in that Rule. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, \u00a7 215(b), 98 Stat. 2015-2016; see also Historical Notes on 1984 Amendments to Rule 35, 18 U. S. C. A., p. 605 (2008). Today, an error may be corrected by the trial court only if it is \u201cclear,\u201d and only within 14 days after the sentence is announced. Rules 35(a), (c). The Rule of Criminal Procedure allowing extensions of time expressly provides that \u201c[t]he court may not extend the time to take any action under Rule 35, except as stated in that rule.\u201d Rule 45(b)(2). This Court has reiterated that time limits made binding under Rule 35 \u201cmay not be extended,\u201d <em>Addonizio, swpra, </em>at 189, and that Rule 45(b)(2) creates \u201cinflexible\u201d \u201cclaim-processing rules,\u201d <em>Eberhart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Thus, if the trial court fails to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment, see, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), or a mandatory fine, see, <em>e. g., </em>21 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(a), or a mandatory order of restitution, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3663A, the Government cannot simply ask it to impose the correct sentence later. If the error is clear, and raised within 14 days, it might be corrected under Rule 35. Otherwise, the Government must appeal, and seek resentencing on remand. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(b)(1), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to these bedrock rules. It permits a trial court to go forward with sentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to 90 days. This provision is meaningful precisely because restitution must otherwise be ordered at sentencing, and because sentences are otherwise final unless properly corrected. If trial courts had power to amend their sentences at any time, \u00a7 3664(d)(5) would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Here, however, the District Court failed to make use of its limited authority under \u00a7 3664(d)(5). Dolan was sentenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order restitution at that time or to set a date for a future restitution order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>App. 35, 39-40; see also <em>id., </em>at 49.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The 90-day period elapsed on October 28. At no time did the Government seek timely relief, whether under Rule 35 or by appeal. Cf. <em>Corey, supra, </em>at 174; <em>Berman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937). Nor did it assert any claim that the deadline had been lawfully extended or equitably tolled, an issue that I agree is not before us, see <em>ante, </em>at 609, 617. But on April 24, 2008 \u2014 269 days after sentencing, and after Dolan had already been released from prison \u2014 the District Court nonetheless ordered $104,649.78 in restitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">I cannot see where that court obtained authority to add additional terms to Dolan\u2019s sentence. That is the step the Court misses when it searches for the \u201cremedy\u201d for a violation of \u00a7 3664(d)(5). <em>Ante, </em>at 607. The rule is that a trial court cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing. Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If the limits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and the general rule takes over \u2014 the sentence cannot be changed to add a restitution provision. Section 3664(d)(5) is self-executing. It grants authority subject to a deadline, and if the deadline is not met, the authority is no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The Court appears to reason that \u00a7 3664(d)(5) confers the authority to add a restitution provision for at least 90 days, and that once the camel\u2019s nose of some permitted delay sneaks under the tent, any further delay is permissible. <em>Ante, </em>at 609-610,611. But that is not what \u00a7 3664(d)(5) says. It provides 90 days for a final determination of the victims\u2019 losses, not a free pass to impose restitution whenever the trial court gets around to it. The court had no more power to order restitution 269 days after sentencing than it did to order an additional term of imprisonment and send Dolan back to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">To avoid this conclusion, the Court runs through a series of irrelevancies that cannot trump the clear statutory text. It notes, for example, that \u00a73663A provides that \u201c <em>\u2018[Notwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense ..., the court <em>shall </em>order . . . that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 612 (quoting \u00a7 3663A(a)(l); emphasis in Court\u2019s opinion). But the issue before us is <em>when </em>restitution should be ordered, so the language the Court should underscore is <em>\u201cwhen sentencing.\u201d </em>This provision plainly confers no power to act <em>after </em>sentencing. Any such power attaches only by virtue of \u00a7 3663A(d), which incorporates the procedures of \u00a7 3664, including the limited 90-day exception. See also \u00a73556 (\u201cThe procedures under section 3664 shall apply to all orders of restitution under this section\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The Court puts greater emphasis on its reading of the statute\u2019s purpose, namely to provide restitution to victims of crime. Certainly that was a purpose Congress sought to promote. But \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,\u201d and \u201cit frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever </em>furthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201d <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U. S. 522, 525-526 (1987) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Congress had to balance against the interest in restitution the contrary interest in promptly determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. The balance struck was clearly set forth in the statute: determine the victim\u2019s losses by a date \u201cnot to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a7 3664(d)(5). Whether or not that limit was <em>\u201cprimarily </em>designed to help victims of crime,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 613, it does not cease to be law when invoked by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Nor can the Court find any support in the second sentence of \u00a7 3664(d)(5). See <em>ante, </em>at 620-621. That provision ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>dresses a distinct issue \u2014 what to do about newly discovered losses \u2014 and sets a higher \u201cgood cause\u201d standard. The fact that Congress struck the balance between restitution and finality differently in that context does not justify overriding the balance it struck here.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The Court also analogizes the 90-day limit to other provisions discussed in our precedents, most of which have nothing to do with the rights of criminal defendants (for whom procedural protections are of heightened importance), let alone the finality of criminal sentencing. The cited cases are said to establish that an official\u2019s \u201cfailure to meet [a] deadline\u201d does not always deprive that official of \u201cpower to act beyond it.\u201d <em>Regions Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998). But the failure to comply with \u00a7 3664(d)(5) does not deprive anyone of anything: The trial court never had the general authority to alter sentences once imposed, in the way that the administrative agencies in the cited cases were said to have general regulatory authority. The trial court\u2019s authority to add a restitution provision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred by the very provision that limited that authority. Section 3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist in the absence of \u00a7 3664(d)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Even more perplexing is the Court\u2019s suggestion that references to the authority of trial courts necessarily implicate questions of jurisdiction. <em>Ante, </em>at 620. To say that a court lacks authority to order belated restitution does not use \u201cauthority\u201d in a jurisdictional sense, see <em>Arbaugh </em>v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U. S. 500, 511 (2006), but only in the same sense in which a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such action is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not jurisdictional. As in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Student Aid Funds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Espinosa, </em>559 U. S. 260, 271 (2010), compliance with \u00a7 3664(d)(5) is \u201cnot a limitation on the . . . court\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d but it is a statutory \u201cprecondition to obtaining a [particular] order.\u201d Here that condition was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In the end, the Court does not appear to need \u00a7 3664(d)(5) at all. It instead suggests that we abandon the bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final, and that the only exceptions are ones <em>Congress </em>chooses to allow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court instead proposes a <em>judicial </em>power to alter sentences, apparently at any time. But if a trial court can \u201cleave open, say, the amount of a fine,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 618, why not, say, the number of years? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has served his entire sentence\u2014 and who knows how long after? \u2014 a court might still order additional imprisonment, additional restitution, an additional fine, or an additional condition of supervised release. See <em>ante, </em>at 618-619.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Court cites no authority in support of such \u201cfill in th[e] blank\u201d sentencing, other than two cases implicated in the Circuit split below. <em>Ante, </em>at 619. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 3664(d)(5), however, it was widely recognized that the requirement to impose restitution \u201cwhen sentencing\u201d meant that \u201c[Restitution must be determined <em>at the time </em>of sentencing,\u201d and could not be left open after sentencing had concluded. Federal Judicial Center, J. Wood, Guideline Sentencing: An Outline of Appellate Case Law on Selected Issues, p. 300 (Sept. 2002) (emphasis added; citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>41 F. 3d 68, 71 (CA2 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ramilo, </em>986 F. 2d 333, 335-336 (CA9 1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>979 F. 2d 1289, 1293 (CA8 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sasnett, </em>925 F. 2d 392, 398-399 (CA11 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The Court finds Rule 35(a) inapplicable because the District Court was not \u201c \u2018correcting]\u2019 \u201d a clear error in the sentence. <em>Ante, </em>at 620. True enough; but that is why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Government should <em>lose. </em>The limitation of Rule 35(a) to clear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing, does not leave trial courts free to make <em>other </em>changes to sentences whenever they choose. Rule 35(a) only makes sense against a background rule that trial courts cannot change sentences at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The same is true of \u00a7 3552(b), which empowers a court that does not wish to delay sentencing but \u201cdesires more information than is otherwise available to it\u201d to impose a provisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That statute would be largely unnecessary if a trial court could do the same by order.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In <em>Addonizio, </em>442 U. S., at 189, we thought it noncontroversial that a sentence once imposed is final, subject to such exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante, </em>at 619, Dolan invoked that principle both here and below. See, <em>e. g., </em>Brief for Petitioner 13, 15-18, 20, 29, 33, and n. 14, 36, 48, and n. 19; Reply Brief for Petitioner 1, 5-8; Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No. 08-2104 (CA10), pp. 12-13 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>81 F. 3d 945, 949 (CA10 1996), for the proposition that a \u201cdistrict court does not have inherent authority to modify a sentence\u201d). That the Court finds it necessary to question that principle \u2014 indeed, to accuse this dissent of \u201ccreat[ing] th[e] rule,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 619 \u2014 highlights how misguided its decision is.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">To counter the effects of its opinion and to restore some semblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises defendants to seek mandamus \u2014 a remedy we have described as \u201cdrastic and extraordinary,\u201d \u201creserved for really extraordinary causes,\u201d and one of \u201cthe most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal.\u201d <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D. C., </em>542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). What an odd procedure the Court contemplates! A defendant, who should have received a harsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and extraordinary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That is not how sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>errors are corrected: If the trial court fails to order the appropriate sentence, the Government must appeal to correct it. It did not do so here, and that ends the case. <em>Greenlaw </em>v. <em>United States, </em>554 U. S. 237, 244-245 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Moreover, the Court\u2019s mandamus remedy only helps defendants who know they are in danger of an increased sentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that the trial court must explicitly \u201cleave open\u201d the precise sentence at the time of sentencing, <em>ante, </em>at 618, or must make clear, \u201cprior to the deadline\u2019s expiration[,] that it <em>would </em>order restitution\u201d at some indeterminate time, <em>ante, </em>at 608 (emphasis added). But what if the court does not make the crucial announcement at sentencing, or \u201cprior to the deadline\u2019s expiration\u201d? Are these judicially created deadlines to be taken more seriously than those imposed by Congress? Or are we just back at the beginning, asking what the \u201cremedy\u201d should be for failing to meet the relevant deadline?</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Court\u2019s suggestion to require notice of intent to augment the sentence at <em>some </em>future date may be a good idea. But an even better one might be to set a particular date\u2014 say, 90 days after sentencing \u2014 on which the parties could base their expectations. That was Congress\u2019s choice, and it should be good enough for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The District Court in this case failed to order mandatory restitution in sentencing Dolan. That was wrong. But two wrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave the court no authority to amend Dolan\u2019s sentence later, beyond the 90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requiring restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">I am mindful of the fact that when a trial court blunders, the victims may suffer. Consequences like that are the unavoidable result of having a system of rules. If no one appeals a mistaken ruling on the amount of restitution (or whether restitution applies at all), finality will necessarily obstruct the victims\u2019 full recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>It is up to Congress to balance the competing interests in recovery and finality. Where \u2014 as here \u2014 it has done so clearly, the \u201cjudicial inquiry is complete.\u201d <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Sig-mon Coal Co., </em>534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\"> Whether that date must itself be set at sentencing is not before us. The order setting the date plainly cannot be entered 182 days after sentencing, as happened here. See App. 3-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\"><em> United States </em>v. <em>Montalvo-Murillo, </em>495 U. S. 711 (1990), is equally in-apposite: The statute in that case rested the lower court\u2019s authority on whether a bail hearing had been held at all (it had), whereas here the only statutory condition is whether the losses were determined within 90 days of sentencing (they were not).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
