For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss Meletz\u2019s petition in part, and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">A January 5, 2006 Notice to Appear charged Meletz, a native of Guatemala, with entering the United States on an unknown date without being admitted or paroled. On December 8, 2006, Meletz filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal, asserting that he had fled Guatemala because he had been persecuted on the basis of his race, and that he entered in United States in July 2005. Meletz explained that he had been persecuted by government officials and landowners in Guatemala, because he and his father worked in cane fields for little pay. Meletz explained that when he and his father went on strike, the landowners threatened to harm their family if they did not return to work. He stated that one day he was beaten by men with covered faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">At a November 16, 2007 hearing before the IJ, Meletz testified that he was born in Guatemala and is of Mayan descent. He stated that, since he was 13 years old, he had worked for a sugar plantation in Guatemala for very little pay, and that he and the other workers eventually protested the low wages. Meletz testified about three separate encounters he had in Guatemala. First, in 2001, Meletz was in San Jose, Guatemala, on his way home from work, when his former boss and another individual told him that he had to go back to work or suffer consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">On a second occasion when Meletz was on his way home, three individuals confronted him. One individual was wearing civilian clothing, while another was wearing a police uniform, and both men had masks on their faces. The men grabbed him and beat him with a flashlight, causing a cut on his face. Meletz believed that the men attacked him because his former boss wanted him to return to work. After this incident, Meletz moved to another village, called Estanzuela, but after moving, he was confronted a third time while on his way home from work. He stated that the men approached him and wanted to hurt him, but he ran away. Meletz \u201cheard them say the next time, we will kill you if you [have] not gone back to work.\u201d In 2002, about two weeks after this last incident, Meletz left Guatemala and came to the United States. Meletz stated that his asylum application, which stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>entered the United States in June 2005, was incorrect. Meletz testified that his family remained in Guatemala, although his father later came to the United States. He stated that he was afraid to return to Guatemala because he was afraid that certain people would find him and kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On cross-examination, Meletz testified that he believed the men who attacked him during the first and second encounters were sent by his former boss. He stated that his mother and brothers still resided in Estanzuela. On recross, Meletz testified that men in Estanzuela had been asking his brother \u201cwhen is your brother coming back.\u201d He stated that his brother does not know these men.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The IJ issued an order denying Meletz\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found that Meletz failed to establish eligibility for asylum, because the three encounters he described \u201cd[id] not equate to persecution\u201d and there was no evidence of political activity or governmental interference at the sugar plantation. He also determined that Meletz\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot reliable as to establishing a claim for asylum,\u201d because Meletz could not identify the individuals that confronted him and \u201cfailed to report on at least one occasion a threat against his person.\u201d Furthermore, the IJ noted that there was no indication that Meletz\u2019s injuries were inflicted as a result of any political opinion which he had. Finally, the IJ pointed out that Meletz did not attempt to live in other areas of Guatemala before moving to the United States and that Meletz\u2019s family continued to live safely in Guatemala. The IJ concluded that Meletz had not suffered past persecution and that there was no nexus between Me-letz\u2019s political opinions and the alleged persecution. With respect to Meletz\u2019s credibility, the IJ found that Meletz \u201clargely told the truth,\u201d but \u201cha[d] not created a credible claim for relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The IJ also stated that he could not \u201cfind that the respondent filed a timely application for asylum upon entering the United States,\u201d because the IJ could not substantiate the exact date of his entry into the country. The IJ determined that Meletz failed to offer a sufficient explanation for his failure to file a timely application. Based on these findings, the IJ determined that Meletz was eligible only for withholding of removal and CAT relief, but that he was not entitled to either of these remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Meletz, now proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a notice of appeal with the BIA, stating that he had been beaten because he and other farmers participated in a strike and that his life would be in danger if he returned to Guatemala. In his brief to the BIA, Meletz simply stated, \u201cI was paid very poorly at the finca. The workers organized and our employers t[h]reatened us to death. I am afraid for my life. Please grant me asylum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision for the reasons set forth in the IJ\u2019s opinion, although it noted that \u201cit is not clear whether the Immigration Judge analyzed the respondent\u2019s applications under the REAL ID Act of 2005 ... which applies to the instant case because the respondent first filed his application after May 11, 2005.\u201d The BIA noted that any such error was harmless, because Meletz\u2019s \u201cclaim clearly lacks a showing of persecution and a nexus between any purported persecution and a protected ground.\u201d The BIA noted that Meletz \u201cfailed to submit any meaningful argument addressing the Immigration Judge\u2019s merits determinations,\u201d and that it was \u201cunpersuaded as to the actual merits of his appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA \u201caffirm[ed] the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision for the reasons stated therein.\u201d Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The government argues that Meletz failed to exhaust his administrative remedies or abandoned all of his claims with respect to his application for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. It also asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Meletz\u2019s asylum application was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) to review decisions of the Attorney General regarding whether an alien timely filed an application for asylum, or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). This leniency, however, does not require or allow courts to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u2018When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, a court may not review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). The regulations governing appeals from the IJ to the BIA require that a notice of appeal \u201cmust specifically identify the findings of fact, conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(b). However, a petitioner is not required to address all of the IJ\u2019s reasons for denying a claim; instead, he is simply required to argue \u201cthe core issue\u201d before the BIA. <em>See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1229 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we lack jurisdiction to consider any claims relating to Meletz\u2019s asylum application, because the IJ found that Me-letz\u2019s asylum application was untimely, and this determination is not subject to judicial review. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1231. In addition, Meletz failed to present any argument in his appellate brief or to the BIA regarding his application for CAT relief. Therefore, Meletz has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and abandoned any claims with respect to his application for CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(b); <em>Fernandez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1317 n. 13. Accordingly, to the extent that Meletz challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum and CAT relief, we dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Meletz has preserved his arguments with respect to his claim for withholding of removal by stating in his notice of appeal to the BIA that he was beaten while in Guatemala and that his life would be in danger if he returned to the country. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Furthermore, in his <em>pro se </em>opening brief submitted to us, Meletz asserts that he \u201cmade out sufficient arguments supported by ... case law [with respect to his] ... Withholding of Removal [claim].\u201d Because these statements, construed liberally, preserve Meletz\u2019s claim that the IJ erred in denying his application for withholding of removal, we now address this claim. <em>See Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263 (noting that we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally); <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1229 n. 3 (noting that a petitioner is simply required to argue \u201cthe core issue\u201d before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">When considering a petition to review an IJ\u2019s final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. Under this test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Under the INA, an alien shall not be removed to his country of origin if his life or freedom would be threatened in that country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not [that] [ ]he will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to h[is] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (quotation omitted). An alien applying for withholding of removal may satisfy his burden of proof in two ways. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cFirst, an alien may establish past persecution in [his] country based on a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Second, if the alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that (1) he would be persecuted in the future on account of one of the five enumerated grounds; and (2) he could not avoid this future threat to his life or freedom by relocating, if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect relocation. <em>Id., </em>citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution,\u201d but this Court has indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation ... [m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulve-da, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The IJ did not err in denying Me-letz\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under the INA, because Meletz failed to show that the persecution he allegedly suffered in Guatemala was inflicted on account of one of the protected grounds. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). In fact, Meletz testified that he believed his attackers were sent by his former boss who wanted him to return to work. Meletz presented no testimony regarding his political opinions and, although he mentioned that he was Mayan, he never asserted that any of the three encounters he described occurred as a result of his Mayan heritage. Additionally, the only evidence indicating that Meletz would suffer persecution in the future was Meletz\u2019s testimony that certain unidentified individuals asked his brother when Meletz would be returning to Guatemala. Meletz did not know the identity of these individuals and there was no evidence indicating that these individuals would harm Meletz. Moreover, Meletz\u2019s family continues to reside safely in Guatemala and Me-letz failed to show that he could not relocate to another area of Guatemala. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>cause Meletz failed to show that he would, more likely than not, be persecuted on the basis of a protected ground if he returned to Guatemala, the IJ correctly denied withholding of removal relief under the INA. Accordingly, we dismiss Meletz\u2019s petition for review to the extent that he attempts to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and CAT relief, and we deny his petition for review to the extent that he challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
