Both of the refused instructions were improper under Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-26\">Mississippi law and the ruling in this case is not contrary to federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. The writ could not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
