This court refused him a certificate of appealability. Celis next moved the district court to reduce his sentence pursuant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. The district court denied the motion. Celis now \u2014 in his third time before this court \u2014 appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is GRANTED. Celis\u2019s motion lacks a jurisdictional basis; it is a \u201cmeaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Furthermore, Celis\u2019s appellate brief exceeds the topical scope of his motion before the district court. To the extent that we liberally could construe his pro se brief as a type of \u00a7 2255 motion, it would be a successive petition. Celis has not shown the court either newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law \u2014 at least one of which is required for this court to certify a successive petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">It follows that the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a brief; Celis\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for summary judgment; and any other outstanding motions are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
