Rodriguez appeals from his sentence of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed after he pled guilty to one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349. He argues that: (1) the district court erred in denying the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure to his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, because it failed to consider the factors included in the policy statement set forth in the guideline; and (2) his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We do not normally review the refusal to grant a downward departure, including a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, unless the district court was not aware of its authority to depart from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d 1490, 1497 (11th Cir.1990); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). However, if a defendant challenges the ruling on a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on the ground that the court misapplied the guideline, we review the ruling <em>de novo. United States v. Luiz, </em>102 F.3d 466, 468 (11th Cir.1996). We \u201cshall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">First, we reject Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for reasons stated that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">(5)the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The commentary to this guideline notes that \u201c[s]ubstantial weight should be given to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment. (n.3). We have interpreted this provision so that it \u201cdoes not nullify the discretion expressly given to the district court by the text of the guideline itself[.]\u201d <em>Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d at 1497.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">Here, the record indicates that the district court considered the motion and chose not to depart based upon its evaluation of Rodriguez\u2019s assistance; thus, it was aware of its authority to depart. <em>Id. </em>at 1498. Nevertheless, Rodriguez may appeal on the basis that the court misapplied the \u00a7 5K1.1 guideline by failing to consider the factors in \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See Luiz, </em>102 F.3d at 468. The court noted that it generally defers to the attorneys\u2019 evaluations of a defendant\u2019s assistance, but after hearing Rodriguez testify in both trials, found that his testimony was untruthful, so he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>not entitled to the \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction. Thus, the court properly considered the guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Our holding in <em>Castellanos </em>forecloses Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the commentary to the guideline required the district court to give substantial weight to the government\u2019s position and subsequently grant the motion. In <em>Castellanos, </em>we held that a district court must give substantial weight to the government\u2019s position \u201cwhere the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.\u201d 904 F.2d at 1498 (quotation omitted). However, the extent and value of the assistance is not difficult to determine where, as here, the district court presided over the trial of the codefendants against whom a defendant testifies and can \u201cjudge for itself the extent and value of his assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, because the district court presided over the trials of Rodriguez\u2019s codefendants and witnessed Rodriguez\u2019s testimony, it was able to determine that his assistance did not warrant a \u00a7 5K1.1 sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, we award \u201cdue regard\u201d to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and accept its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). The record does not reveal that the district court clearly erred in its findings and, accordingly, we affirm the denial of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We also are unpersuaded by Rodriguez\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id. </em>When the district court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, it need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the purposes of sentencing stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1191. However, the district court has discretion to determine the weight that should be given to each factor. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). And although a sentence within the advisory guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, it is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Rodriguez has failed to establish that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court found that Rodriguez\u2019s within-guidelines sentence was appropriate for Rodriguez based upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his testimony at his codefendants\u2019 trials. In addition, it did not blindly presume that a within-guidelines sentence was <em>per se </em>reasonable, contrary to Rodriguez\u2019s assertion, but instead, noted that the guidelines were advisory. The court also considered the impact that Rodriguez\u2019s actions had on the victims and his family, and the government\u2019s difficulty in discerning the truth from the statements Rodriguez provided as part of his assistance. The court noted that it had never denied a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction before, thereby indicating that its sentence was based on the individual facts of Rodriguez\u2019s case. And because the court was not required to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786, its explicit statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when sentencing Rodriguez was sufficient. Further, Rodriguez fails to mention the \u201cclearly erroneous facts\u201d upon which the district court relied, and therefore does not satisfy his burden of showing that the district court abused its discretion when sentencing him. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Rodriguez also has failed to establish that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced Rodriguez at the low end of his guideline range, which suggests a sentence that is expected to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. The court, moreover, properly considered the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and its supporting arguments and reasonably found that Rodriguez\u2019s offense warranted a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines. Although Rodriguez presents several factors that he contends would support a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction, like the 18 months of debriefings with the government, and mentions \u00a7 3553(a) factors in his favor, like his 20-year military career, he has not provided any compelling argument that the court abused its discretion when weighing the sentencing factors in his case. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743 (district court has discretion to determine weight given to each factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
