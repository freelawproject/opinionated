While on supervised release for a New Jersey drug distribution conviction, Rey committed additional federal offenses in New York. He was arrested and detained for these New York offenses in October 1998. Rey pleaded guilty to the New York charges in November 1999. On 17 December 1999 \u2014 while he was awaiting sentencing for the New York convictions \u2014 the New Jersey district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment. On 13 October 2000, the New York district court sentenced Rey to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run concurrently with his New Jersey sentence. For both sentences, Rey was credited with the time he spent in detention from his October 1998 arrest until 17 December 1999, the start of his sentence for the supervised release violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-20\">In his section 2241 petition, Rey alleged that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) did not give him appropriate credit on his New York sentence for time served, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). Rey sought to have credited to his New York sentence the approximately 300 days between when his New Jersey sentence for the supervised release violation was imposed (17 December 1999) and when his sentence for the New York convictions was imposed (13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>October 2000). The district court denied relief, concluding that Rey was unentitled to have the challenged time credited against his New York sentence because it already had been credited against his New Jersey sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">On appeal, Rey argues that the BOP\u2019s interpretation of section 3585(b) violated due process because it was contrary to the New York district court\u2019s order that his sentences run concurrently. The availability of habeas relief under section 2241 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute. <em>Rodriguez v. Lamer, </em>60 F.3d 745, 747 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In some circumstances, a defendant is entitled to credit for time served in official detention before his sentence commences if that time has not been credited against another sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). A sentence \u201ccommences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation to ... the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Rey relief because the time he sought to have credited to his New York sentence already had been credited to his New Jersey sentence. And, in enacting section 3585(b), \u201cCongress made clear that a defendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 1355-56, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). Rey argues that, when his New Jersey sentence was imposed, he already was serving his New York sentence and there was no interruption of his custody on this sentence. But a sentence cannot begin before the date it is pronounced, \u201ceven if made concurrent with a sentence already being served.\u201d <em>Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Flores, </em>616 F.2d 840, 841 (5th Cir.1980)). So, Rey\u2019s New York sentence commenced on 13 October 2000, the date it was imposed; and he could receive no credit for time served before this date if that time already was credited to another sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b); <em>Wilson, </em>112 S.Ct. at 1355-56.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In his section 2241 petition, Rey also argued that the BOP did not award him the correct amount of good conduct time (GCT), in violation of 18 U.S.C. .\u00a7 3624. The district court concluded that this claim was due to be dismissed because Rey had not exhausted his administrative remedies on it. On appeal, Rey argues that this claim should be exempt from the exhaustion requirement because exhaustion would have been futile. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Prisoners seeking relief pursuant to section 2241 are subject to administrative exhaustion requirements. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2004). And the exhaustion requirement in the section 2241 context is jurisdictional. <em>See Winck v. England, </em>327 F.3d 1296, 1300 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), exhaustion is required even if the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201cdoes not appear to be \u2018plain, speedy, and effective,\u2019 before filing those claims in federal court.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>159 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The record indicates \u2014 and Rey concedes \u2014 that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his GCT claim. And the futility exception to exhaustion is inapplicable to his claim because exhaustion is mandatory. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the government raised this claim in the district court and before this Court. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>60 F.3d at 747 (considering a section 2241 claim where it was unclear whether the prisoner had exhausted the claim because the government had not objected on the basis of exhaustion). Accordingly, the district court made no error by denying Key\u2019s challenge to the BOP\u2019s interpretation of section 3624 for lack of exhaustion as it had no jurisdiction over this claim. Because Rey failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we decline to address his substantive arguments about the interpretation of section 3624.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-15\">. Rey does not need a certificate of appealability to proceed in this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a federal prisoner proceeding under section 2241 does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">. That the New York district court ordered the sentence to run concurrent to the New Jersey sentence did not mean that the New York sentence had to start the same day as the New Jersey sentence. <em>See Coloma, </em>445 F.3d at 1284. And it did not have the effect of ordering the BOP to credit Rey for any particular days spent in prior custody. Indeed, the New York court had no authority to order the BOP to apply such credit. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 990 (11th Cir.2005) (the BOP, as opposed to the district courts, is responsible for computing the amount of credit due for the time a defendant served before sentencing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
