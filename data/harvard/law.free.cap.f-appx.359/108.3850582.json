She sought an award of statutory damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. On November 13, 2008, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Edwards after concluding, among other things, that Niagara\u2019s messages violated those provisions and that the company was not protected by the bona fide error defense, an affirmative defense available to debt collectors under the Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c). On February 9, 2009, the district court awarded Edwards $33,036.00 in attorney\u2019s fees. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act allows a prevailing plaintiff to recover \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1692k(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">In a separate appeal, Niagara challenged the district court\u2019s determination that it was not protected by the bona fide error defense. In <em>Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions, Inc., </em>584 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.2009), we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Edwards, concluding that Niagara was not protected by the bona fide error defense because its violation of the Act was intentional and did not constitute a bona fide error. <em>See id. </em>at 1353-54. In this appeal, Niagara is challenging the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Edwards. Niagara does not contest the amount of Edwards\u2019 award but rather asserts that Edwards was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because it was protected by the bona fide error defense. We have already decided that issue against Niagara. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order awarding Edwards attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
