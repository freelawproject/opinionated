Benitez argues that the district court erred in finding that the sentencing court held him accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and therefore was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">At the time Benitez was sentenced, a defendant was assigned a base offense level of 38 for any offense that involved 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. As a result of Amendment 706, a base offense level of 36 now applies to offenses that involve quantities of crack cocaine of at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms and a base offense level of 38 still applies to quantities above 4.5 kilograms. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>1369 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, Amendment 706 did not change the base offense level for an offense involving more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine, and hence, does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s guideline range for those defendants who were sentenced based on quantities above 4.5 kilograms. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In Benitez\u2019s case, the sentencing court adopted, without objection by Benitez, all of the findings in the presentence investigation report (PSI), including that the conspiracy distributed more than 53 kilograms of cocaine, that Benitez was a manager or supervisor in the conspiracy, and that he personally \u201csold well over 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.\u201d According to Benitez there is at least ambiguity as to the amount of cocaine base that the sentencing court attributed to him because any amount over 1.5 kilograms was immaterial to the calculation of his original sentence, given that, at that time, a base offense level of 38 applied to all amounts over 1.5 kilograms. Benitez\u2019s argument, however, is foreclosed by Paragraph 57 of the PSI, which in discussing the sentencing guidelines\u2019 provisions on relevant conduct explicitly states, \u201cTherefore, the defendant is held accountable for all of the drug distribution involved in the <em>instant </em>conspiracy.\u201d (emphasis added). We find that this statement unambiguously attributes 53 kilograms of cocaine base to Benitez.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Thus, because the sentencing court held Benitez accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering his guideline sentencing range and the district court did not err in denying his request for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Benitez\u2019s additional arguments, that the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion violated <em>Apprendi </em>and that the district court should have exercised its discretion under <em>Booker </em>and reduced his sentence based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, are foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings) and <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that a district court may not consider extraneous sentencing issues, including constitutional claims, during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
