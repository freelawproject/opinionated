Torres appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the dismissal of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Torres was convicted for the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and is serving a seventy-month prison sentence to be followed by three years of supervised release. She applied for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). Upon completion of the program, an inmate convicted of a nonviolent felony may obtain a sentence reduction not exceeding one year, subject to the BOP\u2019s discretionary authority under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). BOP maintains a policy, codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55(b)(5)(ii), which categorically excludes from early-release any inmates with a felony conviction for \u201c[a]n offense that involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Torres instituted proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, alleging that this exclusion would wrongfully deny her the opportunity to participate in RDAP, and consequently, the opportunity for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). The district court dismissed the petition in its entirety for lack of ripeness and standing because Torres had not yet been denied admission to the program, and alternatively, because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Torres challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her petition. She argues that BOP\u2019s categorical exclusion policy, which denies her the possibility of a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), is unenforceable because it violates the Administrative Procedures Act. She also contends that she is entitled to the same relief granted to prisoners who were parties to <em>Arrington v. Daniels, </em>a Ninth Circuit case finding the categorical exclusion to be arbitrary and capricious. 516 F.3d 1106 (9th Cir.2008). According to Torres, a denial of similar relief would constitute \u201cdisparate treatment of similarly situated inmates at similar Bureau of Prisons\u2019 [sic] institutions, particularly located within the Ninth Circuit,\u201d in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although we agree with Torres that the case is ripe and she has standing to bring her petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, <em>Handley v. Chapman </em>mandates that we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and rule for the defendants on the merits. 587 F.3d 273 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We first address Torres\u2019s standing and ripeness arguments. We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s legal determinations and application of AEDPA <em>de novo </em>\u201d and review factual findings \u201cfor clear error.\u201d <em>Buntion v. Quarterman, </em>524 F.3d 664, 670 (5th Cir.2008). The district court concluded that the case was not ripe for review because BOP had made no determination on whether Torres was eligible to participate in the RDAP. The case is nevertheless ripe because Torres \u201cbrings a facial challenge to BOP\u2019s policy of categorically denying early release eligibility to inmates convicted as felons in possession of a firearm.\u201d <em>Handley, </em>587 F.3d at 280. Torres\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies likewise presents no bar to our resolution of this petition. Torres\u2019s ability to participate in the RDAP is relevant to our determination only so far as it implicates her ability to obtain a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e), as the \u201csole function\u201d of habeas is to \u201cgrant relief from unlawful imprisonment or custody and it cannot be used properly for any other purpose.\u201d <em>Pierre v. United States, </em>525 F.2d 933, 936 (5th Cir.1976); <em>see Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 430-31, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). BOP\u2019s policy, which Torres challenges on its face, would ultimately preclude her from obtaining a sentence reduction regardless of whether she is admitted to the program. As no other standing issues remain, we proceed to address the facial challenge on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Torres contends that BOP\u2019s categorical exclusion policy is unenforceable because it is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under \u00a7 706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Torres specifically challenges 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(vi)(B), the version of the categorical exclusion in op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>eration at the time of the district court decision. This challenge is without merit. In <em>Handley, </em>we held that this version of the regulation was neither arbitrary nor capricious because BOP articulated \u201cpublic safety\u201d as a rationale for the BOP\u2019s policy, and we expressly rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary conclusion in <em>Arrington. Handley, </em>587 F.3d at 276. Torres\u2019s argument also fails on an alternative ground. The new version of the categorical exclusion, codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55, applies to Torres \u201cbecause its application would not have an impermissible retroactive effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277. This version provides \u201ca much more detailed rationale for the categorical exclusion\u201d than the prior codification, and is likewise valid under the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Torres\u2019s equal protection and due process arguments are both without merit. Torres contends that she has been denied equal protection under the law because \u201cshe was not given the same relief as petitioners in <em>Arrington.\u201d </em>In absence of the showing of a fundamental right or membership in a suspect class, we employ only \u201crational-basis\u201d review to Torres\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 280. Our precedent establishes that the relief obtained by the petitioners in <em>Arrington </em>\u2014 the opportunity to obtain a reduced sentence \u2014 is not a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d <em>Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 217 (5th Cir.1998). Our court has also recognized that <em>Arrington </em>does not create a \u201cbasis for equal protection relief for prisoners outside the Ninth Circuit\u201d because such prisoners do not constitute a \u201csuspect class.\u201d <em>Handley, </em>587 F.3d at 280 &amp; n. 5. Rational-basis review is therefore the appropriate standard, and Torres may prevail only by negating \u201cany reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification\u201d made by the BOP\u2019s categorical exclusion policy. <em>Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 367, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). She has not carried this burden, and is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">Torres\u2019s due process claim also fails. In the prison context, the Due Process Clause operates only where a prison action has \u201cimplicated or infringed\u201d upon a prisoner\u2019s \u201cliberty interest.\u201d <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 223, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). With regard to Torres\u2019s argument that she has a \u201c \u2018liberty\u2019 interest in a sentence reduction,\u201d our court has explicitly held that \u201c\u2018[t]he Due Process Clause does not itself confer a liberty interest in a sentence reduction for completion of an RDAP.\u2019 \u201d <em>Handley, </em>587 F.3d at 281 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Joslin, </em>501 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rublee, </em>160 F.3d at 217 (finding that an inmate has \u201cno protected liberty interest in receiving a \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) sentence reduction.\u201d)). Therefore, we reject Torres\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for lack'of standing is hereby VACATED, and judgment is RENDERED for the respondents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
