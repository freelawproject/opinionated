The district court sentenced Williams to life in prison on count one and 240 months on count two and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-25\">Williams argues that the imposition of a life sentence is cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He argues that the gross disproportionality between his life sentence and the sentences for similar crimes in this and other jurisdictions makes his life sentence unconstitutional. Williams asserts that the prior convictions that qualified him for the life sentence were \u201crelatively minor offenses,\u201d two being state jail felonies and one, a more serious felony. He asks this court to consider the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences and argues that a departure based on such disparity can be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-26\">Williams\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. <em>See Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>566 F.3d 422, 436 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Aug. 20, 2009) (No. 09-7385); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>505 F.3d 323, 330-31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>(5th Cir.2007). Williams\u2019s reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) is misplaeed. <em>Kimbrough </em>recognized that district courts remain bound by the statutory minimum sentences in \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 107, 128 S.Ct. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Accordingly, Williams\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
