McCord argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress. In particular, he contends that the search of his residence was not authorized as a condition of his probation because this condition was unconstitutional and he did not voluntarily agree to it. Additionally, he asserts that the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">At the time the search was conducted, there was recent evidence from a confidential informant, who had previously provided reliable information, that McCord was manufacturing methamphetamine at his residence, and McCord himself admitted that he was cooking methamphetamine. Because we find under the totality of the circumstances that reasonable suspicion existed to support the search of McCord\u2019s residence, we need not reach the issue of the validity of the probationary condition allowing suspicionless searches. <em>See United States v.
