Ramon argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen or reconsider his ease following <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), which he argues overruled the legal basis for his removal from the United States. For the following reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Ramon was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in April 1986. In November 2001, Ramon was convicted of possession of cocaine in Texas state court, and he subsequently departed the United States. In June 2004 Ramon attempted to reenter the United States, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) served Ramon with a Notice to Appear, charging him as inadmissible to the United States based on his conviction for a controlled substance offense. INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">In August 2004, Ramon appeared before an Immigration Judge (IJ) and admitted alienage, but he denied the charge of re-movability on the basis of his controlled substance conviction. The IJ initially found that the DHS had not produced sufficient documentation of Ramon\u2019s prior conviction, but the IJ granted the DHS a continuance to obtain evidence of Ramon\u2019s 2001 conviction. After the DHS produced certified copies of Ramon\u2019s conviction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>IJ found Ramon removable as charged based on his conviction for cocaine possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Following this finding, Ramon made an application for cancellation of removal or, alternatively, termination of his removal proceedings. The IJ concluded that Ramon was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal and thus pretermitted his request for relief. In an oral decision on September 21, 2004, the IJ found that Ramon\u2019s cocaine possession conviction was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and a felony under Texas law. Accordingly, the IJ ruled that Ramon\u2019s conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, rendering Ramon ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A(a)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Ramon then filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on September 22, 2004, and on February 28, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Ramon then petitioned this court for review, and on June 2, 2005, we granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Ramon-Sanchez v. Gonzales, </em>No. 05-60194 (5th Cir. Jun. 2, 2005), Ramon then departed the United States pursuant to the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Subsequent to Ramon\u2019s departure, the Supreme Court decided <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>in which the Court held that a first-time conviction for simple possession of drugs that is neither an illicit trafficking offense nor a federal felony does not constitute an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. 549 U.S. at 53-57, 127 S.Ct. 625; <em>see also Ovalles v. Holder, </em>577 F.3d 288, 291 (5th Cir.2009) (discussing <em>Lopez v. </em>Gonzales). Based on this decision, Ramon filed a motion on June 5, 2008, arguing that the BIA should <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider his case because his situation was substantially similar to the one presented in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Notwithstanding this request, the BIA denied Ramon\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction on July 17, 2008. Particularly, the BIA determined that Ramon\u2019s motion must be denied because his motion was untimely filed and the BIA lacked jurisdiction to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider Ramon\u2019s case after he had been removed to Mexico. The BIA based its decision on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), which provides in relevant part: \u201cA motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.\u201d Ramon then timely filed a petition for review with this court. In this petition, Ramon admits that his application is untimely and that he currently resides in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The central issue in this case is whether the BIA erred in determining that it lacks jurisdiction to <em>sua sponte </em>grant a removed alien\u2019s untimely motion to reconsider or reopen his case, when the underlying legal basis for removal is later determined to be erroneous. We recently confronted this issue in <em>Ovalles </em>and held that the BIA did not err in determining that it did not have jurisdiction to reopen or reconsider such a case because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) limited the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reconsider or reopen proceedings of petitioners who had departed the United States, notwithstanding the change in the underlying legal basis for removal. 577 F.3d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">In <em>Ovalles, </em>Ovalles, a lawful permanent resident, was convicted of attempted possession of drugs in Ohio state court. <em>Id. </em>at 291. As a result of this conviction, Ovalles was charged as removable. <em>Id. </em>Following this charge, Ovalles made an application for cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>The IJ granted Ovalles\u2019s application, but on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>peal to the BIA, the BIA held, on March 8, 2004, that Ovalles\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony, and therefore Ovalles was ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>Ovalles was removed to the Dominican Republic on April 14, 2004. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>Ovalles filed a motion with the BIA on July 27, 2007, to <em>sua sponte </em>reconsider or reopen his case, arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision undermined the legal basis for his removal. <em>Id. </em>However, the BIA refused to consider Ovalles\u2019s motion on the basis of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) because the BIA concluded that the post-departure bar embodied in that section overrode its authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider Ovalles\u2019s case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On petition for review to this court, we reviewed the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen or reconsider Ovalles\u2019s case based on its interpretation of the statute and regulations as a question of law. <em>Id. </em>After reviewing Ovalles\u2019s various legal challenges, we concluded that the BIA\u2019s determination that \u00a7 1003.2(d) overrode its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reconsider or reopen Ovalles\u2019s cases was reasonable; that the post-departure bar of \u00a7 1003.2(d) was intended to apply to aliens who depart the country following termination of proceedings such that the applying this section in Ovalles\u2019s case was not \u201carbitrary and capricious;\u201d and that Ovalles\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen or reconsider his case. <em>Id. </em>at 299-300. Specifically, regarding the applicability \u00a7 1003.2(d) to Ovalles\u2019s case, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">... that the post-departure bar on motions to reconsider and to reopen applies and was intended to apply to aliens who depart the country following the termination of their removal proceedings. Therefore, the BIA did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in applying section 1003.2(d) to Ovalles, despite the fact that the legal basis for his removal was later determined to be erroneous and his removal proceedings were concluded at the time he filed his motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 298 (footnote call omitted). Accordingly, we denied Ovalles\u2019s petition for review. <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Here, Ramon similarly urges that the BIA erred in denying his motion to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider his case based on the procedural bar of \u00a7 1003.2(d). However, Ramon\u2019s situation is indistinguishable from the situation presented in <em>Ovalles: </em>Ramon departed the United States following the denial of his application for cancellation of removal and later filed an untimely petition to reopen or reconsider his case, arguing that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales </em>changed the legal basis for removal, and the BIA similarly denied Ramon\u2019s motion to reopen or reconsider based on the \u00a7 1003.2(d) post-departure bar. As such, <em>Ovalles </em>controls our decision, and we accordingly conclude that the BIA did not err in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider Ramon\u2019s case based on the \u00a7 1003.2(d) post-departure bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
