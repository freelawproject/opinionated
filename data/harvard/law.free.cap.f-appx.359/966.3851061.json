Raines was also convicted of theft of government property, namely, a $15,587 Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) benefit payment made out to Peggy Loughrin, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 and making, uttering, and possessing a forged security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). However, she does not challenge those convictions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">On appeal, Raines argues that she did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A because she had lawful authority to use Peggy Lough-rin\u2019s identification to cash her social security check and because Congress did not intend that her conduct constitute aggravated identity theft. Specifically, she contends that her conduct did not constitute aggravated identity theft because she believed that Loughrin gave her lawful authority to sign and cash her social security cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Normally, we \u201creview challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). However, because Raines failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, we review for plain error to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice, which exists \u201cif the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>526 F.3d 747, 756 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">\u2018We review issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mazarky, </em>499 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe first rule in statutory construction is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute. If the statute\u2019s meaning is plain and unambiguous, there is no need for further inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>289 F.3d 1329, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">The aggravated identity theft provision requires an enhanced sentence of two years of imprisonment if a person \u201cduring and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection (c), knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person....\u201d 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>\u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Subsection (c) includes any offense that is a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c). \u201c[T]o support a conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), the government must prove that the defendant: (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another person; (8) without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in \u00a7 1028A(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 606-07 (11th Cir.2007) (footnote omitted), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">In <em>Hurtado, </em>we held that the language of \u00a7 1028A was not ambiguous and we need not consider the title of \u00a7 1028A (\u201cAggravated Identity Theft\u201d) because the phrase \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) is plain and unambiguous. 508 F.3d at 608 n. 6. Further, \u201cour reading of the plain language to prohibit the possession or use of another person\u2019s identification that was obtained by methods other than stealing does not lead to absurd results.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Finally, the record reveals that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Raines used Peggy Loughrin\u2019s social security number without lawful authority to cash Loughrin\u2019s $15,587 social security check, believing Loughrin\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
