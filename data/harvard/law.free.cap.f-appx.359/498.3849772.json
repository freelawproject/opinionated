At sentencing, the district court determined that the maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037(c)(1) was the maximum guideline range applicable to a similarly situated adult offender; the applicable range was 12-18 months in prison. The district court determined, however, that the appellant\u2019s criminal history was underrepresented under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), p.s., based upon his admission that he had been arrested on five prior occasions and on four occasions had been involved in the transportation of illegal aliens and based upon the court\u2019s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was involved in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>marijuana offense for which he had been arrested but was not convicted. The court departed upward one criminal history level and sentenced the appellant to 21 months of detention, at the top end of the newly applicable relevant guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The appellant now contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentence beyond the statutory maximum because the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly participated in the drug offense. However, the district court also relied upon the prior arrests to which the appellant admitted in order to determine that the appellant\u2019s criminal history category did not represent \u201cthe likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). The fact that the appellant had repeatedly engaged in the transportation of illegal aliens supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the appellant would reoffend. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 419 (5th Cir.2005) (finding no abuse of discretion in an upward departure where the district court determined that the defendant\u2019s likelihood to recidivate because of his ideological beliefs was not adequately reflected by the guideline range.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The appellant contends that the district court could not rely upon his prior alien smuggling offenses for an upward departure because the number of aliens had been included as relevant conduct and had resulted in a three-level enhancement to the original guideline range. The presen-tence report imposed the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(2)(A) based on a finding that the appellant had participated in the transportation of a total of 23 illegal aliens. However, the appellant admitted that the instant offense involved the transportation of six aliens; this number is sufficient to warrant the three-level increase in his offense level. Moreover, the district court found that the fact that the appellant had engaged in the transportation of illegal aliens on multiple occasions made it more likely that he would engage in similar future conduct than if he had participated in one transportation of numerous aliens. Such a finding indicates that the serial nature of the appellant\u2019s offenses constituted a factor \u201cnot adequately taken into consideration\u201d within the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(A). Therefore, the appellant has not established any error arising from the district court\u2019s upward departure at sentencing. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
