He was sentenced to 240 months in prison. We affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Seaton, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 172 (3d Cir.2006). Seaton filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which the sentencing court denied on its merits. <em>United States v. Seaton, </em>Crim. Action No. 04-00049 (E.D. Pa. June 12, 2007). Seaton did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">On July 31, 2009, while incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fairton, New Jersey, Seaton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District of New Jersey. In the \u00a7 2241 petition, he claimed that he was wrongly sentenced as a career criminal offender based on his conviction for simple drug possession, he was sentenced under a sentencing guideline that did not exist, and he was wrongly sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment on his firearms charges when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>should have been exempt from consecutive sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Seaton contended that he should be permitted to pursue habeas relief through \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to attack his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The District Court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that \u00a7 2255 could not be considered ineffective or inadequate to test the legality of Sea-ton\u2019s sentence. Moreover, the court determined that because Seaton\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate was denied on its merits, he had to obtain leave from this Court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the appropriate court. Seaton timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we review the District Court\u2019s judgment de novo. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cir.2002). Motions pursuant to \u00a7 2255 \u201care the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. A prisoner may bring such a challenge in a petition under \u00a7 2241 only where the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the detention. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). A motion under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. \u201cSection 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">We agree with the reasons given by the District Court for dismissing the petition. Seaton has not shown that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his sentencing claims. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21. The \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in rare circumstances, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal because of an intervening change in the law. <em>Id. </em>at 120 <em>(citing In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir1997)). Such is not the case here. The exception identified in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>is simply inapplicable, and Seaton may not seek relief under \u00a7 2241. His only recourse is to request our permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2255(h) and 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Upon thorough review of Seaton\u2019s arguments in support of his appeal, we conclude that his actual innocence claim is meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Absent any demonstration of new reliable evidence of his factual innocence, Seaton cannot show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him. <em>See House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 537, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006); <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 324, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>firm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. Seaton's claim alleges that because he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted, the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
