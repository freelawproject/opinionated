Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), asserting that the United States of America and the Bureau of Prisons had acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and negligently with regard to the treatment of his injured shoulder. Puga has not shown that the district court erred in concluding that Puga could not assert a claim for damages against the defendants under <em>Bivens, </em>as those parties were not individuals. <em>See Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 395-97, 91 S.Ct. 1999; <em>Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, </em>164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.1999). Nor has he shown that the district court erred in determining that the FTCA claim was premature because Puga had not exhausted his administrative remedies prior to the institution of the action. <em>See McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We CAUTION Puga that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
