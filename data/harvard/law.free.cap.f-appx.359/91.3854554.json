The district court dismissed Giles\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint because Giles did not comply with the district court\u2019s order to file a more definite statement conforming to the pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Giles\u2019s original <em>pro se </em>complaint was a four-page, single-spaced document containing two very long, unnumbered paragraphs. Substantively, the original complaint consisted of a rambling personal narrative of Giles\u2019s workplace complaints that suggested numerous possible claims, including race and national origin discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, unjust termination, wrongful wage garnishment, and physical assault by a coworker, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Wal-Mart moved to dismiss Giles\u2019s complaint or alternatively for a more definite statement. In its order granting Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for a more definite statement, the district court described in detail the ways in which the original complaint failed to comply with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 10. Specifically, the district court explained that the complaint lacked information regarding dates of incidents or identities of the alleged bad actors, did not differentiate which facts supported which claims, and did not state claims simply and concisely in numbered paragraphs each limited to a single set of circumstances. The district court ordered Giles to file a more definite statement that complied with Rule 8 and to \u201c[s]et out each of his claims for relief separately, specifying] which factual allegations support each claim and otherwise comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d The district court also warned Giles that if he failed to comply with the order within ten days, it would dismiss his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Giles filed a document entitled \u201cPlaintiffs More Definite Statement,\u201d that amended some of his original allegations to include dates parenthetically, broke allegations into shorter, but still unnumbered, paragraphs and added a \u201cConclusion\u201d requesting $354 million in punitive damages and $1 million in compensatory damages. But, the amended complaint did not address each claim separately or identify which facts supported each claim. In fact, substantively, the amended complaint was essentially identical to the original complaint. As a result, the district court granted Wal-Mart\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss, finding that Giles\u2019s amended complaint did not comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Giles had not complied with the district court\u2019s earlier order to cure the deficiencies in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">On appeal, Giles concedes that his <em>pro se </em>amended complaint did not comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and we agree. Giles\u2019s amended complaint did not contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d or make \u201ceach allegation ... be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), (d)(1). Further, Giles\u2019s amended complaint did not \u201cstate its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b). Instead, Giles\u2019s amended complaint consisted of a lengthy series of unnumbered paragraphs containing what amounts to a personal narrative suggesting, but not clearly and simply stating, a myriad of potential claims. In other words, Giles\u2019s amended complaint is a classic \u201cshot gun\u201d pleading in that it is not possible to know which factual allegations support which claims for relief. <em>See Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Thus, despite guidance from the district court on how to cure the deficiencies in his complaint and a clear warning that noncompliance would be cause for dismissal, Giles did not comply with the district court\u2019s order to file an amended complaint in conformity with the requirements of Rules 8 and 10. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the amended complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e) (providing that, if a party ordered to provide a more definite statement does not provide such a statement within ten days, the district court is empowered to strike the pleading); <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337 (stating that, if the defendant so moves, the district court may also dismiss a ease under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for failure to comply with its order); <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cWhile dismissal is an extraordinary remedy, dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">We find meritless Giles\u2019s argument that justice required the district court to \u201cover look the fact that [he] was unable to fill out a Complaint correctly\u201d and to address his claims on their merits. Although <em>\u201cpro se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and thus are construed liberally,\u201d <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 632, 172 L.Ed.2d 619 (2008), this liberal construction \u201cdoes not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Even a <em>pro se </em>litigant is required to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly after being expressly directed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\">.
