Gutierrez argues that the district court erred by failing to give sufficient reasons for its within-guidelines sentence, and because its reasons were inadequate, the district court might have impermissibly relied on Gutierrez\u2019s failure to cooperate with the Government when determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">Because Gutierrez failed to object in the district court to the sufficiency of the reasons for his sentence, our review is limited to plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our review of the record indicates that the district judge referenced the appropriate guidelines range and stated that he did not think that any factors were present that would take Gutierrez\u2019s case outside of the \u201cheartland.\u201d Moreover, the judge stated during the hearing that Gutierrez had committed a \u201cserious offense.\u201d Finally, the judge concluded that he had considered the guidelines and found that a sentence within the guidelines is consistent with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). Based on the foregoing, we find that the district court\u2019s reasons for Gutierrez\u2019s within-guidelines sentence were sufficient.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Next, Gutierrez argues that the district court may have impermissibly relied on his failure to cooperate when determining his sentence. It is arguable that he failed to object in the district court on this basis: he contended in the district court that his failure to cooperate was not an appropriate factor on which to base an <em>upward departure, </em>but did not assert that it was not an appropriate factor on which to rely in sentencing him <em>within the guidelines. </em>We need not determine whether this means that plain-error or abuse-of-discretion review applies here because Gutierrez is not entitled to relief even assuming that he preserved the issue for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>For one, the record is devoid of any evidence that the district court relied on Gutierrez\u2019s failure to cooperate when determining Gutierrez\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the district court relied on Gutierrez\u2019s failure to cooperate, it did not err because the district court sentenced Gutierrez to a within-guidelines sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">To the extent that Gutierrez\u2019s challenge is to the substantive unreasonableness of his sentence, his 46-month, within-guidelines sentence was presumptively reasonable,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s reasons for Gutierrez\u2019s sentence were sufficient, and thus, the totality of the circumstances, considered in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, does not show that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable under plain error or abuse-of-discretion review.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
