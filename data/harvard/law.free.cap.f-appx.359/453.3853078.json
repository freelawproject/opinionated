In December 1996, Roth was arrested by state officials on charges of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>possession. A Texas court sentenced him to a 20-year prison term in August 1997. That same month in federal court, he pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to participating in a drug conspiracy and a conspiracy to launder money. Though Roth\u2019s prior convictions made him eligible for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (substantial cooperation) and sentenced Roth to concurrent prison terms: 264 months on the drug count and 240 months on the money-laundering count. After the court entered judgment, it granted the Government\u2019s agreed motion to amend it, as relevant here, \u201cto reflect that the sentences imposed in the federal case (264 and 240 months) are to run concurrent to the defendant\u2019s sentence imposed\u201d in state court. The court then entered the amended judgment, recommending that Roth\u2019s sentence \u201crun concurrent to the term imposed\u201d in the Texas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The Board of Prisons determined that Roth was entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the approximately nine months that he spent in state custody after his arrest but before he was sentenced in Texas. According to Roth, he is also eligible to receive credit for the some 17 months served in state custody after he received his state sentence in August 1997 but before he was sentenced in federal court in January 1999 (this time apparently was credited against his state sentence).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roth argues that the 1999 federal judgment does not clearly reflect the sentencing court\u2019s intent that the state and federal sentences run \u201cfully concurrently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Roth has not established that the district court erred in denying his instant Rule 36 motion to correct the judgment. A district court \u201cmay at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment\u201d that arises from an \u201coversight or omission.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 36. A clerical error occurs when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Buendia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995)). Nothing in the record establishes that the district court\u2019s judgment did not accurately reflect its intent. The judgment does not contradict anything that the judge said at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Slanina, </em>359 F.3d 356, 357-58 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Indeed, the record shows that the court crafted the relevant portion of the judgment expressly as the parties requested in the agreed motion to amend the judgment. Roth\u2019s argument that the judgment does not reflect the court\u2019s intent to apply U.S.S.G \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is misplaced because no mention of this guideline was made at sentencing, so there is no evidence that the court intended for it to have any effect on the sentence. Moreover, Roth is not entitled, as he insists, to a more detailed explanation in the judgment regarding how the sentence should be executed. The judgment is consistent with the court\u2019s verbal explanation of the sentence and its grant of the motion to amend the judgment; thus Rule 36 cannot be used to clarify the sentence. <em>See United States v. Patrick Petroleum Corp., </em>703 F.2d 94, 98 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>To the extent that Roth argues that the Bureau of Prisons has incorrectly calculated his sentence, this claim is not cognizable in a motion under Rule 36. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>868 F.2d 151, 151 (5th Cir.1989). Rather, Roth must raise it in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 filed in the district where he is incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at 151-52.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\">. In late August 1997, Roth was brought into federal custody from state custody, where he was serving his state sentence, by the federal court's writ of habeas corpus ad prosequen-dum; he also asserts that two days after his January 1999 federal sentence he was transferred back to state custody to serve his state sentence, that in May 2001 he was paroled from his state sentence and was to taken into federal custody to serve the remainder of his federal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-19\">.
