Waters was convicted and sentenced to, <em>inter alia, </em>170 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiring to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, and heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). A sentence reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement and, therefore, is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Waters\u2019 \u00a7 3582 motion was denied because the district court decided that, under the Guidelines, it could not reduce Waters\u2019 sentence due to his career-offender status. That decision is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, - L.Ed.2d - (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">Waters contends: the district court erred because Waters was sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1, based on the quantity of drugs relevant to his offense, rather than under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), as a career offender. The presentence investigation report (PSR), to which Waters did <em>not </em>object, was adopted without change by the district court. Although the PSR stated that Waters was a career offender, it did not apply the offense level mandated by that Guideline because the offense level was not greater than the otherwise applicable offense level calculated under \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">If Waters\u2019 base-offense level were reduced pursuant to the amended version of \u00a7 2D1.1, the offense level for a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C) would become applicable. With a career-offender base-offense level of 32, a total offense level of 29 after the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and a criminal history category of VI, Waters would be subject to the same advisory guideline range upon which his original sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">In sum, application of the amendments would not lower Waters\u2019 applicable guideline range. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying a reduction of sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
