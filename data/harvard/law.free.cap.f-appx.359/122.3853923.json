On appeal, Bailey contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Specifically, he argues his sentence is longer than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts a reasonable sentence would have either given him credit for 27 months served in state custody during prosecution on a state charge, or acknowledged the time served through a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">We examine the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n. 25 (11th Cir.2008). The standard is deferential, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1270 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 568, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning a particular sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We have held \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A sentencing judge \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>ed States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The record demonstrates Bailey has not met his burden to demonstrate his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals listed in \u00a7 3553(a). Bailey cites no authority to support the proposition that a reasonable sentence compels a federal court, imposing a federal sentence, to credit a defendant with time served while in state custody during the course of a state prosecution. He has thus failed to satisfy his burden of establishing his guideline sentence was unreasonable. <em>Flores, </em>572 F.3d at 1270. Moreover, the district court considered Bailey\u2019s argument and provided a reasoned basis for exercising its authority. <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impose a sentence below the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
