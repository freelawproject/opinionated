The district court determined that Stewart failed to state a claim because he had not alleged that any of the defendants acted as state actors, as required by \u00a7 1983. The district court further determined that even if Stewart had asserted a viable state law claim, that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case because all parties were citizens of Mississippi, thereby destroying diversity. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">Stewart has failed to adequately brief both bases for the district court\u2019s dismissal, and, as such, he has abandoned these claims. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, this appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">Stewart has also filed a \u201cMotion Requesting the Release of Social Security Records,\u201d a \u201cRequest for Summary Judgment\u201d and a \u201cRequest for a[n] Attorney.\u201d In light of the foregoing, these motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">Finally, this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) as does the strike imposed by the district court. R. 54. Stewart is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>nent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">DISMISSED; DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
