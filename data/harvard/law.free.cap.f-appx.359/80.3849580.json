Rendon appeals his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. Rendon asserts the district court abused its discretion when it (1) admitted out-of-court statements by co-conspirators under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) because those statements were not in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (2) admitted testimony regarding a suicidal gesture Rendon made during an interview with law enforcement because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We address each issue in turn, and affirm Rendon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Out-of-court statements offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted are generally inadmissible as hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. An out-of-court statement, however, is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \u201ca statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). As a prerequisite to the admission of a co-conspirator\u2019s statement, the Government, as the proponent, \u201cmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the conspiracy included the declarant and the defendant against whom the statement is offered, and (3) the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1345-46 (11th Cir.2006). We apply \u201ca liberal standard in determining whether a statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy. The statement need not be necessary to the conspiracy, but must only further the interests of the conspiracy in some way.\u201d <em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2002) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f the statement could have been intended to affect future dealings between the parties, then the statement is in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraza, </em>843 F.2d 432, 436 (11th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In general, the out-of-court statements made by co-conspirators Jose Ibar-ra and Pedro Medina-Villegas to other co-conspirators communicated Rendon\u2019s role in the conspiracy. These communications helped maintain good working relations among the co-conspirators and therefore furthered the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>For example, Medina-Villegas\u2019s statement to his daughter about Rendon\u2019s drug customers could have reassured her of Rendon\u2019s role in the conspiracy, and his statements to his son about a loan from Rendon, or to his daughter about Rendon\u2019s demand for money for an erroneously delivered package, could have provided guidance about how those co-conspirators should deal with Rendon, reducing the risk of a confrontation that would derail the conspiracy. Likewise, Medina-Villegas\u2019s statements to co-conspirator Jose Luis Sandoval-Ochoa about the amount of marijuana Medina-Villegas received and unloaded at Ren-don\u2019s property could have been a tool to encourage Sandoval-Ochoa to take a larger role in the conspiracy (which he eventually did).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Finally, although not made to maintain good working relations among the co-conspirators, Medina-Villegas\u2019s statement to a buyer about where the marijuana was grown furthered the conspiracy by helping influence the buyer to pay a higher price. Given the liberal standard for determining when a statement furthers the conspiracy, we conclude the district court did not err<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by admitting the statements because they maintained the functioning of the conspiracy. <em>Miles, </em>290 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, all relevant evidence is admissible. Fed. R.Evid. 402. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. Nonetheless, relevant evidence may be excluded if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. \u201cThe term \u2018unfair prejudice,\u2019 as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 650, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Rule 403, however, is \u201can extraordinary remedy which the district court should invoke sparingly, and [t]he balance ... should be struck in favor of admissibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1120 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted; alternation in original). \u201cIn reviewing issues under Rule 403, we look at the evidence in a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe major function of Rule 403 is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Cross, </em>928 F.2d 1030, 1048 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In this case, the testimony regarding Rendon\u2019s suicidal gesture to a law enforcement officer had probative value because the gesture suggested Rendon wanted to avoid explaining incriminating evidence, which indicated he did not have an exculpatory explanation. This probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403, and thus the district court did not err in admitting the testimony regarding Rendon\u2019s suicidal gesture. Accordingly, we affirm Rendon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. The parties dispute the appropriate standard of review as to the challenged evidentia-ry rulings in this case. Because we conclude there was no error as to either issue on appeal, the standard of review is not outcome determinative, and we need not determine whether we review the district court\u2019s rulings for abuse of discretion or plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
