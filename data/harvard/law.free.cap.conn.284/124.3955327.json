The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>court rendered judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal and ordering the commission to \u201cconsider changes that can reasonably be made to protect the substantial public health and safety interests\u201d implicated by the proposed development. The commission now appeals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that the trial court improperly (1) ordered it to redesign the plaintiffs affordable housing project and (2) weighed the identified public health and safety reasons individually, rather than collectively, when considering the commission\u2019s reasons for denying the plaintiffs application. Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment remanding the matter to the commission was not an appealable final judgment under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122, 129-31, 653 A.2d 798 (1995), we dismiss the commission\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In May, 2000, the plaintiff, a developer of luxury residential apartment complexes, entered into a contract to purchase a 11.99 acre parcel of land located at 1600 Cutspring Road in Stratford (Cutspring property). The Cutspring property, which currently is zoned for residential use,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is bounded by the Merritt Parkway to the south, Cutspring Road on the west, Circle Drive and several single-family homes to the north and Pumpkin Ground Brook on the east. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The Cutspring property is located in a section of town that is accessible only via a section of Cutspring Road that runs underneath the Merritt Parkway (underpass).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In September, 2000, the plaintiff submitted to the commission three applications seeking approval to construct an affordable housing development on the Cutspring property. In accordance with \u00a7 8-30g, the plaintiff filed with the commission: (1) a proposal to amend the town\u2019s zoning regulations to create a \u201cmixed income housing development\u201d district zone for higher density residential use; (2) a proposal to change the town\u2019s zoning map to place the Cutspring property in the proposed new zone; and (3) a site plan for its project, to be known as \u201cAvalon at Stratford.\u201d The plaintiff proposed to construct 160 residential rental units<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> located in six buildings to be built on the Cutspring property, as well as a clubhouse, pool and recreation area, recycling center and parking for 320 vehicles. The affordability plan submitted by the plaintiff as part of its application to the commission demonstrated that the development met the criteria for an affordable housing development set forth in \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B); see footnote 2 of this opinion; because 25 percent of the units would be affordable to low and moderate income households for thirty years. The plaintiff also submitted to the commission reports demonstrating that the commission\u2019s decision regarding the application would not be exempt from the appeal procedures provided by \u00a7 8-30g because, in 2000, only 8.22 percent of the town\u2019s housing units qualified as affordable. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 8-30g (f) (statutory appeal procedures not available if property located in municipality in which 10 percent of properties qualify as affordable). After a public hearing, the commission unanimously voted to deny all three of the plaintiffs applications, citing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>following public health and safety concerns: (1) fire safety; (2) traffic; (3) internal circulation and site design; (4) density; and (5) wetlands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In May, 2000, pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (d), the plaintiff submitted revised applications to the commission. The modifications to the site plan included, inter alia: (1) reducing the number of residential units from 160 to 146; (2) reducing the number of residential buildings from six to five; (3) moving one building further away from the wetlands surrounding Pumpkin Ground Brook; (4) improving access to the rear of the buildings; (5) increasing the width of the driveway; (6) increasing the number of parking spaces; and (7) purchasing an abutting parcel north of the Cutspring property, located at 140 Circle Drive, for use as a secondary emergency access to the site. On July 12, 2000, the commission held a public hearing on the plaintiffs resubmission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Experts for the plaintiff and the town\u2019s various governmental departments offered testimony about the changes made to the application as they related to the public health and safety concerns identified by the commission in its denial of the plaintiffs original application, but most of the discussion focused on the commission\u2019s concerns about fire safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As a result of this discussion during the hearing, the plaintiff agreed to several additional changes to its amended site plan, including: (1) widening the secondary emergency access driveway by four feet to twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>feet; (2) widening the entrance to the development from Cutspring Road by five feet to forty feet; (3) installing sprinklers on all decks and patios; and (4) striping portions of the driveway as fire lanes to prevent parallel parking. Thereafter, the commission again unanimously denied the revised applications, citing in its denial of the site plan application largely the same reasons that had caused it to deny the original application, all grouped under concerns about fire safety, traffic safety, internal circulation and site design, density and wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, challenging the denial on the ground that the commission had failed to show that its reasons for denying the applications were supported by sufficient evidence in the record and clearly outweighed the need for affordable housing in the town. The commission argued in response that its reasons for denial were based on public health and safety concerns that sufficiently were supported by the record, that the concerns outweighed the need for affordable housing, and that the concerns could not be addressed through reasonable changes to the plaintiffs application. After two days of hearings, the trial court, <em>Bryant, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision concluding that, of the commission\u2019s five reasons for denying the revised applications, fire safety was the only public health and safety concern that was supported by sufficient evidence in the record and outweighed the need for affordable housing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the trial court found that the commission had shown that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>sufficient evidence in the record to support its claim that the underpass, \u201cthe height of the individual apartment buildings in the proposed site, the inadequacy of Circle Drive to handle emergency vehicles and equipment and the internal turning radii of the driveways pose health and safety concerns,\u201d and that the public interest in health and safety clearly outweighs the need for affordable housing, because \u201cthe impediments to emergency vehicle and equipment access to the site and to the rear and upper floors of certain buildings proposed to be constructed on the site pose grave risks to the health and safety of prospective residents.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court, however, then stated that the commission had failed to carry its final burden under \u00a7 8-30g (g), because it had \u201cfailed to prove that the denial was necessary as there is insufficient evidence to prove that the public interest could not be [protected] by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The trial court continued: \u201cIf the roads are too narrow, the buildings too high and the buildings too close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>to the slopes, it stands to reason that widening or relocating roads and shortening and relocating buildings would eliminate or sufficiently reduce health and safety concerns so that the public interest can be served and the affordable housing can be built. The record does not contain sufficient evidence of those parameters. The . . . commission is in the best position to identify the structural, environmental, equipment and technical context into which the development must be designed to fit. . . . The . . . commission bears the burden of proving that the public interest cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the applicant\u2019s proposed development.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Accordingly, the trial court remanded the case to the commission \u201cwith an order that it specify categorically the changes reasonably necessary to protect the substantial health and safety concerns cited as reasons for its denial.\u201d This certified appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Before considering the merits of this case, we note that the trial court\u2019s order remanding the case to the commission requires that we determine, sua sponte, whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over the commission\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cAs we repeatedly have observed, [t]he right of appeal is purely statutory. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. . . . Moreover, [t]he statutory right to appeal is limited to appeals by aggrieved parties from final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ments .... Because our jurisdiction over appeals ... is prescribed by statute, we must always determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>276 Conn. 168, 194, 884 A.2d 981 (2005). Thus, unless the remand order of the trial court in this zoning appeal constitutes a final judgment, we are required to dismiss the commission\u2019s appeal to this court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Lakeside Estates, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>100 Conn. App. 695, 699, 919 A.2d 1044 (2007) (\u201cthe final judgment rule applies equally to zoning appeals as to other appeals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This court previously has set forth the relevant law in <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 129-30. \u201cBecause the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., (UAPA)] do not govern a zoning appeal ... it is the scope of the remand order in this particular case that determines the finality of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>... A judgment of remand is final if it so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. ... A judgment of remand is not final, however, if it <em>requires </em>[the agency to make] further evidentiary determinations that are not merely ministerial.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 129-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In <em>Kaufman, </em>the trial court had determined that the plaintiff was entitled to a zone change in connection with its affordable housing application, thereby concluding that the plaintiffs application must be approved, but had \u201cordered a remand to give the [zoning] commission the opportunity to impose reasonable conditions and changes with respect thereto.\u201d Id., 128. In its decision, the trial court stated that it had \u201cresolved all [of] the issues in favor of the plaintiff and therefore the court orders that the plaintiffs modified application be approved under such terms and conditions as the commission might reasonably prescribe within the parameters of this ruling. For this purpose and to this end, the decision is hereby remanded to the commission.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 128 n.4. \u201cIn response to the commission\u2019s motion for further articulation as to the scope of the remand, the trial court explained that while the commission was empowered on remand \u2018to impose reasonable conditions and reasonable changes\u2019 on the application, it was not empowered to deny the application entirely.\u201d Id. On appeal, this court applied the second prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>asks whether the decision of the trial court so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings can not affect them. This court concluded that the remand order was a final judgment because \u201c[a]lthough the trial court\u2019s remand may have <em>allowed </em>the commission to hear additional evidence in order to determine whether to impose reasonable conditions on or to make reasonable changes in the application, the remand in no way <em>required </em>the commission to conduct such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>\u201cEven more important, the trial court\u2019s judgment required the commission to approve the plaintiffs application. </em>With respect to this central issue, the trial court\u2019s decision so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>sis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning </em>Commission, supra, 232 Conn. 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Therefore, under <em>Kaufman, </em>a trial court\u2019s remand to a zoning commission is an appealable final judgment if it (1) does not require further evidentiary determinations by the commission or (2) dictates the outcome of the postremand proceedings before the commission with respect to the application at issue. Compare <em>Westover Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>91 Conn. App. 125, 133, 881 A.2d 412 (no final judgment when zoning board required to hear new evidence and trial court did not order approval of site plan), cert. denied, 276 Conn. 917, 888 A.2d 86 (2005), and <em>Kobyluck </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>70 Conn. App. 55, 57, 796 A.2d 567 (2002) (no final judgment because \u201cthe court\u2019s remand for a new hearing will require the board of appeals to hear new evidence and to exercise its discretion\u201d), with <em>Sydoriak </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>90 Conn. App. 649, 651 n.1, 879 A.2d 494 (2005) (final judgment when remand does not permit board to deprive plaintiff of variance and when judgment \u201cpermits the board to consider evidence and to impose reasonable conditions on the [plaintiffs] variance application,\u201d but does not require board to do so), <em>Children\u2019s School, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>66 Conn. App. 615, 617-19, 785 A.2d 607 (final judgment when remand ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>approval of plan subject to conditions and board not required to make further evidentiary determinations), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 903, 789 A.2d 990 (2001), and <em>Wisniowski </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>37 Conn. App. 303, 310-11, 655 A.2d 1146 (final judgment when approval of application is final and remand does not require further evidentiary hearing), cert. denied, 233 Conn. 909, 658 A.2d 981 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s remand order in this case is not an appealable final judgment under <em>Kaufman. </em>Although the trial court\u2019s order, like the order in <em>Kaufman, </em>does not <em>explicitly </em>require the commission to make further evidentiary determinations, the trial court stated that the record before it did not contain sufficient evidence of the \u201cparameters\u201d of the commission\u2019s requirements with regard to the acceptable height of the buildings, the width of the roads, and distance of the buildings to the slopes. Given that the trial court conducted a plenary review of the record<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and found certain evidence to be lacking, its order that the commission \u201cspecify categorically the changes reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>necessary to protect the substantial health and safety concerns cited as reasons for its denial\u201d implies that the trial court intended to require the commission to conduct further evidentiary proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">More importantly, however, the trial court\u2019s order in this case, unlike the order in <em>Kaufman, </em>did not explicitly decide the ultimate issue in this case for the plaintiff. The trial court did not order the commission to grant the plaintiffs application, nor did it state that the commission was stripped of the power to deny the plaintiffs application. Instead, the trial court determined that the commission had not completed its duty as outlined under \u00a7 8-30g (g), because it had not shown that the public interests could not be protected by reasonable changes to the plaintiffs plan. The language of the trial court\u2019s decision leads us to conclude that it intended for the commission to provide certain parameters that the plaintiff could then use in revising its application for resubmission to the commission. At that point, the commission again would have the discretion to grant or to deny the plaintiffs application. Therefore, because the commission apparently retained its discretion with regard to the ultimate issue in this matter, the trial court did not render a final judgment, and this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the commission\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> The intervening defendant, the Stratford town council (council), was permitted to participate in this appeal in order to raise environmental issues pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, following our decision in <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>280 Conn. 405, 908 A.2d 1033 (2006). The council had filed motions to intervene on behalf of the town in the trial court proceedings arising from both the plaintiffs appeals from the commission\u2019s denial of the affordable housing application and the inland wetlands and watercourses agency\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs wetlands application. Id., 409; see also footnote 6 of this opinion. The plaintiff filed motions to strike the council\u2019s petitions to intervene, and the trial court, <em>Shortall, J., </em>filed separate memoranda of decision granting both motions to strike. <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 410. The council appealed to the Appellate Court, which consolidated the appeals and reversed the trial court\u2019s decisions, concluding that \u00a7 22a-19 (a) permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the council\u2019s intervention in both appeals and that the town\u2019s intervention was not an improper intrusion into the delegated authority of the town\u2019s administrative agencies. <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>87 Conn. App. 537, 541, 867 A.2d 37 (2005). Both cases had proceeded to judgment in the trial court while the council\u2019s appeal from the motions to strike was pending. <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 411. We affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court; id., 424; and accordingly, the council was permitted to participate in this appeal as an intervening defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 8-30g, as amended by P.A. 99-261, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) As used in this section: (1) \u2018Affordable housing development\u2019 means a proposed housing development (A) which is assisted housing or (B) in which not less than twenty-five per cent of the dwelling units will be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that, for at least thirty years after the initial occupation of the proposed development, (i) such dwelling units shall be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a.

The commission shall also have the burden to prove, based upon the evidence in the record compiled before such commission, that (1) (A) the decision is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the commission may legally consider; (B) such public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing; and (C) such public interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development, or (2) (A) the application which was the subject of the decision from which such appeal was taken would locate affordable housing in an area which is zoned for industrial use and which does not permit residential uses, and (B) the development is not assisted housing, as defined in subsection (a) of this section. If the commission does not satisfy its burden of proof under this subsection, the court shall wholly or partly revise, modify, remand or reverse the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it.\u201d We previously have determined that this portion of P.A. 00-206 applies retroactively. See, e.g., <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>271 Conn. 1, 6 n.1, 856 A.2d 973 (2004); <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 674, 701, 780 A.2d 1 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The plaintiff submitted its applications four days before the effective date of P.A. 00-206, \u00a7 1 (g), which amended \u00a7 8-30g (c). Accordingly, both the commission and the trial court reviewed the plaintiffs applications under the substantive law contained in the 1999 revision of the statutes, as amended by P.A. 99-261, but followed the procedure contained in the statutes as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>amended by P.A. 00-206, \u00a7 1 (g). For convenience, all references in this opinion to subsections (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of \u00a7 8-30g are to the 1999 revision of the statutes, as amended by P.A. 99-261. All references to \u00a7 8-30g (g) are to the current version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> The Appellate Court granted the commission\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the trial court; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-9, 8-8 (o) and 8-30g (g); and we thereafter transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> Although the property is zoned for residential use, the western portion of the site presently is occupied by a commercial enterprise, a banquet hall and catering facility, which has been in operation as a nonconforming use on the site. Peak usage of that facility occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> The plaintiffs site plan called for sixty-eight one bedroom units, eighty two bedroom units and twelve three bedroom units.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> The plaintiff also had submitted a simultaneous application to the town\u2019s inland wetland and watercourses agency, requesting a determination that the plaintiffs construction of the development did not constitute regulated activity, or, in the alternative, requesting a permit to conduct regulated activities. That agency also denied the plaintiffs application. That decision is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> The plaintiff, the town and the commission agreed that the record before the commission consisted of all testimony by witnesses and all submissions by the parties in connection with both the original application and the resubmission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> The trial court also concluded that the commission had failed to carry its burden of showing sufficient evidence to support its denial of the application based on its concerns about traffic safety and inadequate recreational areas. The court also found that although the commission had shown sufficient evidence to support the remainder of its density concerns and its concerns about on-site circulation and wetlands, it failed to show that protecting such concerns clearly outweighed the need for affordable housing or that its concerns could not be addressed with reasonable changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> The trial court\u2019s decision with regard to the fire safety concerns was based on all of the evidence in the record, including, in particular, testimony by the chief of the town fire department and fire safety and traffic safety experts hired by both the town and by the plaintiff. The fire safety concerns all revolved around the proposed density of the development and the height of the buildings in light of the isolated location of the Cutspring property. The only route providing access to the area requires vehicles to travel through the underpass on Cutspring Road. The commission claims that the site plan, and in particular the height of the buildings, would require that the town\u2019s largest fire truck, an aerial apparatus known as Tower 1, be the primary responder to the site. The commission claims that the truck cannot traverse the underpass safely because it would need to cross the yellow line in order to fit under the Merritt Parkway, which would place it in the path of southbound traffic. Many of the modifications that have been made to the plan by the plaintiff to its site plan were made in response to the commission\u2019s concerns about the ability of Tower 1 to maneuver the site, including widening the width of the driveway, adjusting curb cuts, increasing turning radii at the entrance to and within the development, eliminating trees and landscaping that could interfere with its maneuverability and preventing parallel parking along the driveway in certain portions of the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> The parties previously disputed this jurisdictional issue before this court when, after this case had been fully briefed and assigned for oral argument, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of a final judgment. Although we denied the plaintiffs motion at that time, we now, sua sponte, reconsider our previous decision as to our jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Governors Grove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill Development Corp., </em>187 Conn. 509, 511 n.6, 446 A.2d 1082 (1982) (per curiam), overruled on other grounds by <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 831, 628 A.2d 1311 (1993); <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>78 Conn. App. 818, 823 n.9, 829 A.2d 26, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 915, 833 A.2d 466 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> In <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 130 n.7, we \u201cassume[d] without deciding that if the trial court judgment had not been final, this court could not have exercised jurisdiction over the appeal, even though certification was granted by the Appellate Court,\u201d but also implied that the relevant statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (o), 8-9 and 52-263, could be read as dispensing with the final judgment requirement in zoning appeals. Although this court has not had occasion to consider the applicability of the final judgment rule in the context of zoning appeals since <em>Kaufman, </em>the Appellate Court recently rejected the argument that \u201czoning appeals are exempt by statute from the final judgment rule.\u201d <em>Lakeside Estates, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>100 Conn. App. 695, 698, 919 A.2d 1044 (2007). The Appellate Court noted that it \u201cconsistently has applied the final judgment requirement to zoning appeals\u201d; id.; and that the \u201clanguage used [in \u00a7 52-263] stating that appeals may be brought from final judgments except as provided for in . . . \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 and 8-9, the statutory sections governing zoning appeals . . . [only] serves to account for the requirement that zoning appeals must be certified by this court.\u201d Id., 698-99. Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201cthe final judgment rule applies equally to zoning appeals as to other appeals.\u201d Id., 699.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> \u201cIn both criminal and civil cases ... we have determined certain interlocutory orders and rulings of the Superior Court to be final judgments for purposes of appeal. An otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\"> Our analysis in <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 130-31, relied heavily on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 409-10, 521 A.2d 566 (1987), which addressed final judgment issues in administrative appeals brought pursuant to the UAPA. In <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>this court applied the second prong of <em>Curdo </em>to administrative appeals and concluded that the court has \u201cdistinguished . . . between two kinds of administrative remands. A trial court may conclude that an administrative ruling was in error and order further administrative proceedings on that very issue. In such circumstances, we have held the judicial order to be a final judgment, in order to avoid the possibility that further administrative proceedings would simply reinstate the administrative ruling, and thus would require a wasteful second administrative appeal to the Superior Court on that very issue. ... A trial court may alternatively conclude that an administrative ruling is in some fashion incomplete and therefore not ripe for final judicial adjudication. Without dictating the outcome of the further administrative proceedings, the court may insist on further administrative evidentiary findings as a precondition to final judicial resolution of all the issues between the parties. . . . Such an order is not a final judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 410. The legislature thereafter amended the UAPA to provide explicitly that, \u201cwhere the court issues a remand pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-183 (j), the remand is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, irrespective of both the nature of the remand and the administrative proceedings that are expected to follow it.\u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 675, 855 A.2d 212 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In <em>Kaufman, </em>this court cited <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 409-11, in emphasizing that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s judgment required the commission to approve the plaintiff\u2019s application. With respect to this central issue, the trial court\u2019s decision so concludes the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. . . . After explicitly resolving all [of] the issues in favor of the plaintiff . . . the trial court remanded the case only for the limited purpose of allowing the commission to impose reasonable conditions on or make reasonable changes to the development, if it so chose. Because the proceedings on remand cannot deprive the plaintiff of the zone change that the trial court has ordered to be approved, the trial court has rendered a final judgment and this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the commission\u2019s appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 131. Notwithstanding the subsequent amendment to \u00a7 4-183 (j), this court\u2019s decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>as applied by <em>Kaufman, </em>remains instructive in this context \u201c[b]ecause the provisions of the [UAPA] do not govern a zoning appeal . . . .\u201d Id., 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> The standard of judicial review in affordable housing appeals has two parts. \u201c[I]n conducting its review in an affordable housing appeal, the trial court must first determine whether the decision from which such appeal is taken and the reasons cited for such decision are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (g). Specifically, the court must determine whether the record establishes that there is more than a mere theoretical possibility, but not necessarily a likelihood, of a specific harm to the public interest if the application is granted. If the court finds that such sufficient evidence exists, then it must conduct a plenary review of the record and determine independently whether the commission\u2019s decision was necessary to protect substantial interests in health, safety or other matters that the commission legally may consider, whether the risk of such harm to such public interests clearly outweighs the need for affordable housing, and whether the public interest can be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development. . . . Because the plaintiff\u2019s] appeal to the trial court is based solely on the record, the scope of the trial court\u2019s review of the [commission\u2019s] decision and the scope of our review of that decision are the same.\u2019\u2019 (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>273 Conn. 573, 596-97, 872 A.2d 385 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> We discuss one aspect of the commission's substantive claims, because it relates to the proper interpretation of the trial court\u2019s remand order. The commission claimed that the trial court\u2019s remand order was improper because it had the effect of improperly directing the commission to redesign the plaintiffs affordable housing application. This argument is based on the commission\u2019s assumption that the trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal and ordered the commission to grant the plaintiffs application subject to reasonable conditions and changes. As discussed previously, we disagree with that interpretation of the trial court\u2019s order. The affordable housing appeals statutes authorize trial courts to employ much more expansive remedies than are available to courts in traditional zoning appeals. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>cally, \u00a7 8-30g (g) provides that, if the commission does not meet its burden of proof, \u201cthe court shall wholly or partly revise, modify, remand or reverse the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it.\u201d The trial court applied the balancing test and explicitly determined that the commission had failed to meet its burden of proving that reasonable changes could not be made that would protect the public interest with regard to fire safety. Rather than order the commission to grant the application on remand, which it had the power to do, the trial court chose instead to exercise the power of remand granted to it by \u00a7 8-30g (g) by ordering the commission to provide the court with more evidence. Thus, the trial court reserved judgment concerning approval of the plaintiffs application pending the results of its remand order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
