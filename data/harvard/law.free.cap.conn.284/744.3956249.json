The defendants filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment claiming, inter alia, that Hartford was not entitled to recovery because Hartford\u2019s losses were not the result of \u201cany one accident\u201d under the reinsurance contracts. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim and the trial court granted the motion. Hartford then filed this appeal. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. For the years 1967 through 1975, Hartford issued general liability insurance policies to MacArthur.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MacArthur was a major manufacturer, distributor and installer of asbestos containing products, including insulation, in northern California and the Midwest. During the transportation and installation of these products, asbestos dust was released into the air. Many people who had been exposed to the asbestos dust developed debilitating illnesses, often long after their exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Beginning in the late 1970s, numerous claims were brought against MacArthur for these asbestos related injuries. Hartford defended and paid many of the claims until the early 1990s, when it determined that MacArthur had exhausted its coverage. Thereafter, MacArthur brought an action against Hartford in California, seeking coverage for thousands of additional claims. A key issue in the coverage action was the proper construction of a provision of the insurance policies that defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201c \u2018an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured\u2019 . . . .\u201d The policies further provided that \u201c \u2018all bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u2019 \u201d MacArthur argued that each claim arose from a separate occurrence, while Hartford contended that all the claims arose from one single occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Another key issue in the coverage action was whether the claims against MacArthur were subject to the policies\u2019 $500,000 yearly aggregate limit for claims within the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision, which applied to \u201c \u2018bodily injuiy and property damage arising out of the named insured\u2019s products . . . but only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured and after physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others.\u2019 \u201d Hartford contended that many of the claims involved injuries caused by MacArthur\u2019s products after MacArthur had relinquished possession of the products and, therefore, fell within the aggregate limit, which had been exhausted. MacArthur contended that most of the claims fell outside the products hazard provision. In December, 2003, Hartford settled the coverage dispute with MacArthur by agreeing to pay approximately $1.15 billion to a trust responsible for paying the asbestos claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">To protect itself against large losses incurred \u201c \u2018by reason of any one accident,\u2019 \u201d Hartford had entered into a series of multilayered, excess of loss reinsurance treaties, referred to collectively as the blanket casualty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>treaty (treaty).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From 1967 through 1975, the defendants underwrote two upper layers of loss protection under the treaty, and from 1973 through 1975, they underwrote a third layer. The treaty provided that the defendants would be liable for losses, above a specified threshold and below a specified limit, incurred by Hartford under its policies \u201c \u2018by reason of any one accident.\u2019 \u201d The treaty defined \u201c \u2018any one accident\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany one, or more than one, accident, happening or occurrence arising or resulting from one event, casualty or catastrophe upon which liability is predicated, under any one, or more than one, of the policies covered by this Agreement, and, <em>as respects liability arising out of products manufactured, made, handled, distributed or sold by an assured, liability arising out of property damage or out of malpractice, said term shall also be deemed and construed to mean any one, or more than one, accident, happening or occurrence which the available evidence shows to be the probable common cause or causes of more than one claim under a policy, or policies, or renewals thereof, irrespective of the time of the presentation of such claims to the assured or the Hartford.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Hereinafter, we refer to the italicized portion of the \u201cany one accident\u201d clause as the common cause provision of the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In February, 2004, Hartford billed its reinsurers pursuant to the treaty for approximately 10 percent of the $1.15 billion settlement with MacArthur. Hartford billed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>about 3.4 percent of the settlement to the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a letter to the reinsurers, Hartford stated that the claims against MacArthur had arisen \u201cfrom the insured\u2019s alleged handling, distribution and/or sale of asbestos containing products and they therefore [fell] within the ambit\u201d of the common cause language in the treaty\u2019s definition of \u201c \u2018any one accident.\u2019 \u201d Hartford also stated in the letter that, \u201c[i]n accordance with this wording, we are accumulating all of the insured\u2019s asbestos related [bodily injury] loss and are presenting these exposures on a per insured, per year basis . . . .\u201d The defendants refused to pay the bill on the ground that Hartford\u2019s losses under the MacArthur settlement could not be aggregated under the common cause language.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Thereafter, Hartford brought this action seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to recover under the treaty for its losses related to the MacArthur settlement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants brought a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the MacArthur claims could not be aggregated as \u201c \u2018any one accident\u2019 \u201d under the treaty, and moved for summary judgment. The defendants contended that: (1) the treaty\u2019s common cause provision did not apply because the MacArthur losses were not \u201c \u2018liability arising out of products manufactured, made, handled, distributed or sold by an assured\u2019 (2) even if the claims did arise out of products, the MacArthur losses could not be aggregated as \u201c \u2018any one accident\u2019 \u201d because they did not have a \u201c \u2018common cause or causes\u2019 and (3) even if the claims properly were aggregated, Hartford could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>recover only up to one year\u2019s limit of reinsurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In its memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court assumed, without addressing the substance of the parties\u2019 arguments, that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the definition of \u201cany one accident\u201d for \u201cliability arising out of products\u201d applied to the MacArthur claims. The court concluded, however, that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>255 Conn. 295, 765 A.2d 891 (2001), the word \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the underlying MacArthur policies meant each claimant\u2019s initial exposure to asbestos or, at most, the exposure of multiple claimants to asbestos at the same place and roughly the same time. The court rejected Hartford\u2019s argument that, even if there were multiple occurrences, they had a \u201c \u2018sufficient commonality\u2019 \u201d to come within the common cause language and concluded that, in order to show that the occurrences were the common causes of the MacArthur claims, Hartford would have to show that the exposure of one claimant to asbestos, or the exposure of multiple claimants at a single place and time, caused all of the claims. Because Hartford had not presented and, indeed, presumably could not have presented, any such evidence, the court concluded that the losses could not be aggregated under the treaty\u2019s \u201ccommon cause\u201d language. Accordingly, the court did not reach the defendants\u2019 claim that, if the common cause language applied, Hartford could recover only up to one year\u2019s limit of reinsurance coverage. The court rendered summary judgment for the defendants. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Hartford claims on appeal that the trial court improperly determined that the MacArthur claims could be aggregated under the common cause provision only if they shared \u201cone and the same cause.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendants contend that the trial court properly determined that the \u201ccommon cause\u201d language in the treaty is not broad enough to encompass Hartford\u2019s theoiy of recovery. They further claim as an alternate ground for affirmance that the common cause language does not apply in the first instance because the MacArthur claims did not arise \u201c \u2018out of products manufactured, made, handled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>distributed or sold by an assured.\u2019 \u201d Finally, they claim as an alternate ground for partial affirmance that, even if the common cause language applies and the MacArthur claims may be aggregated under the treaty, Hartford is limited to recovering up to one year\u2019s limit of reinsurance coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the MacArthur claims had a common cause or causes within the meaning of the treaty\u2019s \u201cany one accident\u201d clause. With respect to the defendants\u2019 first claimed alternate ground for affirmance, we conclude that the \u201carising out of products\u201d language of the common cause provision is ambiguous and, therefore, the claim must be addressed by the finder of fact on remand. With respect to the defendants\u2019 claim that Hartford is limited to recovering up to one year\u2019s limit of reinsurance coverage, we conclude that we need not resolve this issue on appeal but that it also must be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Before addressing the substance of the parties\u2019 claims, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cIn seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>269 Conn. 394, 405, 848 A.2d 1165 (2004). \u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">A reinsurance treaty, like an insurance policy, \u201cis a contract that is construed to effectuate the intent of the parties as expressed by their words and purposes. . . . [Ujnambiguous terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. ... As with contracts generally, a provision in [a reinsurance treaty] is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading. . . . The determination of whether an insurance policy is ambiguous is a matter of law for the court to decide. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cIf the [treaty] is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be introduced to support a particular interpretation. ... If the extrinsic evidence presents issues of credibility or a choice among reasonable inferences, the decision on the intent of the parties is a job for the trier of fact. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\u201cOrdinarily, if an ambiguity arises that cannot be resolved by examining the parties\u2019 intentions . . . the ambiguous language should be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured when he entered into the contract. . . . Courts in such situations often apply the contra proferentem rule and interpret a policy against the insurer. . . . The contra-insurer rule does not apply, however, in actions by one insurer against another.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety </em>Co., supra, 255 Conn. 305-306. Because reinsurance contracts are, in essence, between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>insurers, the contra-insurer rule does not apply to disputes arising from such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We first address Hartford\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly determined that the treaty\u2019s common cause provision unambiguously foreclosed Hartford\u2019s claim under the treaty because, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 295, the MacArthur claims were caused by multiple occurrences, namely, the exposure of each claimant to asbestos, and these multiple occurrences could not have constituted a \u201ccommon cause or causes\u201d under the treaty. We conclude that the treaty\u2019s common cause provision is ambiguous and its proper construction involves factual questions concerning the intent of the parties to the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">As we have indicated, the treaty\u2019s common cause provision states that \u201c \u2018any one accident\u2019 ... as respects liability arising out of products manufactured, made, handled, distributed or sold by an assured . . . shall ... be deemed and construed to mean any one, or more than one, accident, happening or occurrence which the available evidence shows to be the probable common cause or causes of more than one claim under a policy, or policies, or renewals thereof, irrespective of the time of the presentation of such claims to the assured or the Hartford.\u201d Hartford claims that this language is unique to the treaty and never has been construed by any court. It contends that, under the provision, the MacArthur claims constituted one \u201coccurrence\u201d because each MacArthur claimant \u201calleged injury from inhaling asbestos dust that MacArthur generated in the same manner, using the same products and practices, at each of its job sites.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>causes were the same for (that is, \u2018common\u2019 to) each of the thousands of claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Hartford further contends that the common cause provision\u2019s use of the phrases \u201cany one <em>or more than one, </em>accident happening or occurrence\u201d supports the interpretation that the provision permits \u201cthe aggregation of multiple claims deriving from multiple causes that are <em>the same in kind </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) For example, Hartford states, \u201cif two children suffer allergic reactions to their pet cats, it may be said that their conditions share common causes \u2014 exposures to cat hair \u2014 even though the children were not exposed to the very same cat hairs, or even to the very same cat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In support of these contentions, Hartford points to several memoranda and items of correspondence between Hartford and its brokers during the 1960s and 1970s relating to the common cause provision. The documents indicate that Hartford had been reluctant to include in the treaty an \u201c \u2018aggregate extension clause\u2019 \u201d that would permit all losses paid by Hartford subject to an aggregate limit under a particular direct policy in a particular year \u2014 even if entirely unrelated \u2014 to be aggregated for reinsurance purposes. Hartford believed at the time that the unique language of the common cause provision was preferable because, unlike an aggregate extension clause, it would allow aggregation of losses arising from multiple policies spanning two or more policy years. In one of the memoranda relied on by Hartford, a Hartford employee stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018common cause\u2019 wording is so broad as to suggest that nothing should be introduced into the [tjreaty which might lessen its impact.\u201d Hartford contends that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>documents establish that the common cause provision is much broader than the standard aggregation provisions that are contained in most reinsurance agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The defendants concede that the trial court improperly determined that, under <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 295, the word \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the treaty meant each individual MacArthur claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos. See id., 307-308 (as used in excess pohcies under review in that case, word \u201coccurrence\u201d was unambiguous and meant exposure of individuals to dangerous condition).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants claim, however, that, even under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the more lenient \u201ccause test\u201d that this court also discussed in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>Hartford still cannot prevail as a matter of law. We disagree. In <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>the plaintiff, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Metropolitan), had been named as a defendant in thousands of lawsuits filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>throughout the United States seeking recovery for asbestos related injuries resulting from Metropolitan\u2019s failure to publicize the health risks of asbestos exposure over the course of decades. Id., 298-99. Metropolitan argued that, under the \u201c \u2018cause test\u2019 \u201d that several jurisdictions have applied in determining the scope of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d its failure to warn was a single occurrence. Id., 326. Under the cause test, \u201can occurrence is determined by the cause or causes of the resulting injuiy. . . . Using this analysis, the court asks if [tjhere was but one proximate, uninterrupted, and continuing cause which resulted in all of the injuries and damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 326-27 n.26. We noted in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>that this court previously had rejected the cause test. Id., 326. We also stated, however, that, even if the test were applied, \u201cthe defendants would still prevail because [the] failure to warn [about the dangers of asbestos], while possibly a cause of the claimants\u2019 injuries, was not one proximate, uninterrupted cause of the injuries, as evidenced by the fact that the injuries occurred at several different places over a period of sixty years.\u201d Id., 326-27 n.26. \u201cUnder the cause test, each exposure was a separate occurrence that caused the claimants\u2019 injuries.\u201d Id., 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The flaw in the defendants\u2019 argument is that none of the cases that we cited in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>in support of our analysis under the cause test involved contractual language that specifically provided for the accumulation of liability arising from a common cause. Accordingly, \u201cthe concern that a finding of multiple occurrences would render the defendants\u2019 insurance policies meaningless, simply [was] not present .... [T]he continuous exposure clause acts to combine claims originating at the same plant at approximately the same time into one occurrence, thus covering most mass tort claims.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 329. To conclude in the present case that the \u201c \u2018last link in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>causal chain\u2019 id., 322; is the only event that could constitute an \u201coccurrence,\u201d i.e., a \u201ccommon cause,\u201d under the common cause provision, would be to render that language meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The defendants also claim that the common cause provision \u201cincorporates spatial and temporal limitations\u201d that preclude the aggregation of claims that were incurred at hundreds of different locations and over decades. In support of this contention they cite <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>96 N.Y.2d 583, 760 N.E.2d 319, 734 N.Y.S.2d 531 (2001). In that case, the New York Court of Appeals construed a provision of a reinsurance agreement defining \u201cdisaster and/or casualty\u201d as \u201ceach and every accident, occurrence and/or causative incident, it being further understood that all loss resulting from a series of accidents, occurrences and/or causative incidents having a common origin and/or being traceable to the same act, omission, error and/or mistake shall be considered as having resulted from a single accident, occurrence and/or causative incident.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 589. The plaintiff, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company (Travelers), had, in two separate coverage litigations, paid two corporations for claims against the corporations arising from pollution at numerous hazardous waste sites that the corporations had operated for decades. Id., 588-92. Travelers then sought reimbursement from the defendant reinsurers claiming that all of the claims against each separate corporation could be aggregated because the waste sites \u201cshared a \u2018common origin,\u2019 namely, a managerial failure ... in the implementation and enforcement of [the corporations\u2019] company-wide environmental policy.\u201d Id., 592. The trial court held that the sets of claims against each corporation did not constitute single losses. Id., 591, 592. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments, concluding that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>because the word \u201c \u2018series\u2019 \u201d implied a spatial or temporal relationship between the members of the series, the events at the separate waste sites were not a \u201cseries of accidents\u201d and could not be aggregated for purposes of reinsurance. Id., 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">As Hartford points out, however, the treaty in the present case does not contain the \u201cseries\u201d language that was controlling in <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>supra, 96 N.Y.2d 594. Accordingly, we conclude that that case is of little guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We are persuaded that the common cause provision is ambiguous as to whether, as Hartford claims, it allows aggregation of losses that were \u201cmeaningfully related\u201d and \u201carose out of the same pattern of events\u201d or, as the defendants claim, it \u201cincorporates spatial and temporal limitations\u201d that preclude the aggregation of claims that were incurred at hundreds of different locations and over decades. As Hartford points out, the language of the provision appears to be uniquely broad and it never has been construed by any court. We conclude, therefore, that Hartford\u2019s interpretation that MacArthur\u2019s fabrication and installation activities were a \u201ccommon cause\u201d of the MacArthur claims is a plausible one.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Moreover, in support of their position to the contrary, the defendants cite the same documentary evidence as Hartford and contend that it \u201cshows that [Hartford\u2019s reinsurance broker] repeatedly urged Hartford to purchase an aggregate extension clause for its excess of loss reinsurance contracts, but that Hartford rejected this proposal. ... In rejecting its broker\u2019s recommendation, Hartford demonstrated its intent to have an excess of loss reinsurance without a \u2018stop loss\u2019 or other aggregate feature\u201d under which it could aggregate the MacArthur claims. It is well established that extrinsic evidence may be considered in determining contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>intent if a contract is ambiguous. See <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 527, 546 n.17, 791 A.2d 489 (2002). The trier of fact will be required to draw the proper inferences, however, from the ambiguous language of the common cause provision and the accompanying documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In sum, because the language of the treaty\u2019s common cause provision is ambiguous, its meaning involves a genuine issue of material fact, Hartford is entitled to present evidence in support of its interpretation to a fact finder and the fact finder will be required to determine, as a factual matter, the meaning of the common cause provision. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We next consider the defendants\u2019 claimed alternate ground for affirmance that the treaty\u2019s common cause provision does not apply to the MacArthur claims in the first instance because the claims did not arise \u201cout of products manufactured, made, handled, distributed or sold by an assured . . . .\u201d We conclude that the \u201carising out of products\u201d language of the common cause provision is ambiguous as to whether it applies to the MacArthur claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The general liability policies issued by Hartford to MacArthur defined \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cbodily injury . . . arising out of the named insured\u2019s products . . . but only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured and after physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018[N]amed insured\u2019s products\u2019 \u201d was defined in relevant part as \u201cgoods or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured . . . .\u201d The policies defined \u201c \u2018completed operations hazard\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cbodily injury . . . arising out of operations . . . but only if the bodily injury . . . occurs after such operations have been completed or abandoned and occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured.\u201d \u201c \u2018Operations\u2019 \u201d included \u201cmaterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\u201d The MacArthur policies imposed a $500,000 yearly aggregate limit of liability for bodily injury claims falling under the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d definition. There was no such limit for other claims against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In its complaint seeking coverage from Hartford, MacArthur alleged that it had \u201csold, installed, and/or used certain materials and products that contained asbestos\u201d and that the claimants had sought \u201cdamages for bodily injury and/or death allegedly caused, in whole or in part, by materials or products containing asbestos . . . .\u2019\u2019During the coverage litigation between Hartford and MacArthur, Hartford contended that many of the MacArthur claims were subject to the aggregate limit for claims brought under the policies\u2019 \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision, which had been exhausted. MacArthur contended, to the contrary, that most of the claims were not subject to the aggregate limit because the claimants\u2019 injuries had been caused by exposure to asbestos dust created during the installation of the products while MacArthur still had possession of them. When the parties settled the claims, neither side conceded the correctness of the other\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The defendants claim that, because Hartford did not pay the MacArthur claims under the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision of the MacArthur policies, they are not subject to the treaty\u2019s common cause provision. They point out that the common cause provision refers to \u201c \u2018products manufactured, made, handled, distributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>or sold by an assured,\u2019 \u201d while the products hazard provision of the MacArthur policies refer to \u201cgoods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured,\u201d and contend that \u201c[t]he close linguistic correspondence between the [common cause provision] and the products hazard in Hartford\u2019s policies shows, as a matter of logic and common sense, that the language of the provisions is designed to apply to the same thing \u2014 the products liability coverage provided to MacArthur pursuant to the products hazard in Hartford\u2019s policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Hartford contends that, regardless of whether it paid the MacArthur claims under the policies\u2019 \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision, they arose out of MacArthur\u2019s products and, therefore, they are subject to the treaty\u2019s common cause provision. Hartford points out that, unlike the underlying policies, the treaty does not limit products claims to injuries occurring away from premises owned by or rented to the insured and after the insured has relinquished possession of the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The defendants rely on <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>16 Cal. App. 4th 492, 20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 376 (1993), in support of their claim. Their reliance is misplaced. That case involved a coverage dispute between a manufacturer of products containing asbestos and its insurer. Id., 497-98. The manufacturer claimed that numerous asbestos related personal injury claims that had been brought against it did not come within the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision of its liability policy, which was substantially identical to the provision in the present case. Id., 498-99. Rather, the claims were based on \u201ctheories such as concert of action, failure to disclose hazardous nature of products, civil conspiracy, failure to develop asbestos-free products and market share liability . . . .\u201d Id., 500. The trial court concluded that the claims were covered by the products hazard provision. Id. On appeal, the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Court of Appeal explained that \u201ca manufacturer or person who performs a service can incur liability in a number of ways, including (1) while work is in progress, [and] (2) after completion .... An injury or loss may result while an activity is in progress, and prior to the completion thereof, either as a result of an act of negligence or an omission. Such liability is embraced within the ordinary liability aspect of a public liability policy under coverage for premises-operations. . . . [0]nce a product has been completed and sent to market . . . liability may be incurred by reason of a defect in merchandise or improper workmanship. It should be clear that the premises-operations coverage is not appropriate coverage and the individual now needs products liability or completed operations coverage. The coverages are complementary and not overlapping . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In the language relied on by the defendants in the present case, the court stated <em>\"[t]hus, as a matter of sequencing, it is well to recognize that products liability is a coverage that takes over where premises-operations leaves off </em>. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 500-501. The court concluded that \u201c[w]ithin the framework of the Hartford policies and the continuum of coverage provided for liability stemming from operations and products, it is obvious that the traditional products claims in the underlying com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>plaints, namely, those asserting negligent testing, design, manufacture and sale; strict liability for design and manufacturing defects; failure to warn; breach of warranties; misrepresentation and the like, are within the four walls of the \u2018products hazard\u2019 clause.\u201d Id., 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">As the defendants concede, however, the question before us in the present case is not whether the MacArthur claims are properly characterized as \u201cproducts hazard\u201d claims or premises operations claims. The question is whether premises operations claims that admittedly do not come within the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision of the MacArthur policies because they arose before the product had been relinquished by the insured can nevertheless come within the treaty\u2019s common cause provision because they \u201c[arose] out of products.\u201d The decision of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Frontier Insulation Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Merchants Mutual Ins. Co., </em>91 N.Y.2d 169, 690 N.E.2d 866, 667 N.Y.S.2d 982 (1997), provides some guidance on that question. That case involved a coverage dispute between an asbestos insulation contractor and its insurers involving multiple asbestos related personal injury claims. Id., 173-74. The insurers contended that all of the claims fell within the policies\u2019 exclusions for products hazards. Id., 175. The court concluded that this claim \u201cmisses the mark . . . because the focus in determining whether a product-hazard exclusion applies is not simply whether an insured\u2019s product caused the loss at issue, but rather is dependent on the location of the accident and the possession of the product .... [The insurers\u2019] argument fails to appreciate that <em>an exclusion for product hazards governs only one subset of product liability </em>claims.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 175-76. The court explained that \u201c[t]he insurance industry has segregated product-liability hazards and the premiums charged therefor by categorizing them as either risks arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>while work is in progress, or as those arising from the defective nature of a completed product that has been placed in the stream of commerce .... An insured may cover the first risk by purchasing coverage for \u2018premises-operations\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 176. \u201cThe distinct risk of loss occasioned by a defect in the insured\u2019s product, which manifests itself only after the insured has relinquished control of the product and at a location away from the insured\u2019s normal business premises, is covered by the purchase of separate \u2018products hazard\u2019 coverage . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. The court then stated that the asbestos could have been a product within the meaning of the policies\u2019 definition of \u201c \u2018named insured\u2019s products\u2019 \u201d \u2014 which was identical to the definition in the present case \u2014 if the contractor had traded or dealt in asbestos. Id., 177. Assuming that to be the case, the court concluded that the insurers would be relieved of their duty to defend the claims only if they established that the claims fell squarely within the products hazard provisions, i.e., that the claims arose away from the insured\u2019s premises and after possession of the asbestos had been relinquished. Id. Thus, the court in <em>Frontier Insulation Contractors, Inc., </em>recognized that, although product hazard claims and operations claims are mutually exclusive, some operations claims may arise out of products.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The defendants in the present case do not dispute the conclusion of the court in <em>Frontier Insulation Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number><em>tractors, Inc., </em>that products hazard claims constitute only a subset of claims that can be said to arise from products.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor do they claim that the asbestos products that caused the injuries at issue in the MacArthur litigation were not \u201cproducts manufactured, made, handled, distributed or sold\u201d by MacArthur, as stated in the treaty\u2019s \u201c \u2018any one accident\u2019 \u201d clause. They claim only that the \u201c \u2018products hazard\u2019 \u201d provision of the underlying policies constituted a limitation on the treaty. Therefore, they argue, the clause applies only to claims arising \u201cafter physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">We acknowledge that the close linguistic similarity between the language of the treaty\u2019s common cause provision and the products hazard provision of the underlying policies suggests some correspondence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>meaning between the provisions. We also are compelled to acknowledge, however, that the treaty itself contains no express limitation related to physical possession of the products. Moreover, there does not appear to be anything about the language of the common cause provision that would render its application to claims arising from a product before possession of the product has been relinquished to others unfeasible, illogical or inconsistent with other treaty provisions or principles of reinsurance. Indeed, none of the parties has cited, and our research has not revealed, any cases construing an \u201carising out of products\u201d provision of a reinsurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the \u201carising out of products\u201d portion of the common cause provision is ambiguous as to whether it refers to liability arising out of the products hazard provision of the underlying MacArthur policies or, instead, refers to any claim arising from a product, regardless of whether MacArthur had relinquished physical possession of the product at the time that liability was incurred. Accordingly, the meaning of the provision must be determined by the finder of fact on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The defendants also rely on documentary evidence in support of their interpretation of the \u201carising out of products\u201d language. They point out that, in an internal Hartford memorandum written within three months of the effective date of the first MacArthur policy, a Hartford employee stated, in response to a suggestion from its broker that a change in the treaty might be required because the new policy form had separated \u201cproducts from completed operations,\u201d that \u201c[t]he definition of the term \u2018any one accident\u2019 in the [treaty] refers to liability \u2018arising out of products manufactured, made, handled, distributed by an insured.\u2019 It seems clear that this is intended to refer only to the \u2018products\u2019 area and not to the \u2018completed operations\u2019 area.\u201d The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>contend that this constituted an express acknowledgment by Hartford that \u201cliabilities arising out of products\u201d were separate from its liabilities arising from operations. As we have indicated, extrinsic evidence may be considered in determining contractual intent only if a contract is ambiguous. See <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 259 Conn. 546 n.17. We are not persuaded, however, that this documentary evidence is sufficient to remove the ambiguity of the \u201carising out of products\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Finally, we address the defendants\u2019 claimed alternate ground for partial affirmance that, even if the common cause provision applies to the MacArthur claims and the claims arose from a common cause or causes, the claims would have to be aggregated in one treaty year and subjected to one retention by Hartford and one reinsurance limit, and could not be aggregated on a \u201cper insured, per year\u201d basis. The defendants raised this claim in the trial court and in their preliminary supplemental statement of issues on appeal on the basis of their understanding that Hartford was claiming that all of the MacArthur losses arose out of one occurrence. In their brief to this court, however, the defendants state that they \u201cno longer advance \u2018telescoping\u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as a dispositive issue\u201d because, in its main brief, \u201cHartford appears to have . . . finally abandoned its single \u2018any one accident\u2019 position\u201d and now claims that the underlying losses occurred during each of the nine years that Hartford insured MacArthur. In its reply brief, Hartford contends both that the defendants have inadequately briefed and have abandoned their claim that the losses must be aggregated in one year, and that Hartford\u2019s claim that the losses occurred over nine years is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>inconsistent with its claim that the losses arose out of \u201c \u2018any one accident.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We conclude that we need not resolve this issue and that it must be addressed, if necessary, by the trial court on remand. First, the resolution of the telescoping issue depends in part on the resolution of the question of whether the losses may be aggregated under the treaty and, if so, how they should be aggregated. If the trial court resolves the aggregation question in the defendants\u2019 favor, then there will be no need to address the telescoping issue. Second, the telescoping issue appears to involve questions of fact that must be addressed by the trial court in the first instance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, the defendants do not appear to be asking this court to resolve the telescoping issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> The other plaintiffs include: Hartford Casualty Insurance Company; Hartford Fire Insurance Company; Hartford Insurance Company of Canada; Hartford Insurance Company of Illinois; Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest; Hartford Insurance Company of the Southeast; Hartford Lloyd\u2019s Insurance Company; Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company; Nutmeg Insurance Company; Pacific Insurance Company, Ltd.; Sentinel Insurance Company, Ltd.; Trumbull Insurance Company; and Twin City Fire Insurance Company.

See Practice Book \u00a7 61-3. Hartford filed a motion for a written determination that the appeal should proceed as to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>defendants who sought summary judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-4 (b) and the trial court granted the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> Hartford also claims that the trial court improperly determined that the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d that we applied to the excess policies in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>applied to the underlying MacArthur policies. Hartford represents in its brief that, during the settlement negotiations with MacArthur, it took the position that the claims arose from a single occurrence under the policies\u2019 continuous exposure clause, which was identical to the one at issue in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>while MacArthur contended that each claimant\u2019s exposure was a separate occurrence. Hartford further states that the amount of the settlement \u201creflected a compromise between the parties\u2019 positions on the issue, and indeed, can be viewed as most congruent with the intermediate position of one occurrence per job site.\u201d It contends that under well established \u201cfollow the settlement\u201d rules; see <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp., </em>419 F.3d 181, 187-90 (2d Cir. 2005) (reinsurer may not relitigate issues that were disputed and settled between insurer and insured); and under the treaty\u2019s \u201cfollow ihe forms\u201d clause, which provides that \u201cthe reinsurance afforded <em>by </em>this Agreement shall be subject in all respect to all the general and special stipulations, clauses, waivers and modifications of the original policy or policies,\u201d the trial court was required as a matter of law to construe the treaty\u2019s \u201cany one accident\u201d clause in accordance with the settlement position that each MacArthur job site constituted one occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">We agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that, because Hartford presented no evidence in the proceedings on the motion for summary judgment in support of their claim that the MacArthur claims could be aggregated on a per job site basis, this claim should not be a basis for reversing the grant of summary judgment in their favor. Because Hartford\u2019s per job site theory depends not only on the meaning of the word \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the MacArthur policies, but also on the meaning of the word as used in the treaty, which involves questions of fact, however, the viability of the theory may be addressed by the trial court on remand if Hartford presents it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\"> We granted permission to the Reinsurance Association of America to file an amicus brief in this appeal.

And at each site, MacArthur was alleged to have performed these activities in the same negligent manner, exposing people at the site to asbestos dust without any appropriate protective measures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b784-5\"> In <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 298-99, the plaintiff, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Metropolitan), had been named as a defendant in thousands of lawsuits seeking recovery for asbestos related bodily injuries resulting from Metropolitan\u2019s alleged failure to publicize the health risks of asbestos exposure. Metropolitan expended hundreds of millions of dollars in defending and settling the claims. Id., 300. The defendant insurers had sold excess general liability insurance policies to Metropolitan that provided coverage for claims after primary, umbrella and first layer excess coverage had been exhausted. Id. The excess policies provided: \u201cThe total liability of the company for all damages, including damages for care and loss of services, as the result of any one occurrence shall not exceed the limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to each occurrence. For purposes of determining the limit of the company\u2019s liability and the retained limit, all bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 300-301. Metropolitan brought an action seeking coverage under the excess policies for the asbestos related claims. Id., 301. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment claiming, inter alia, that, because Metropolitan\u2019s liability arose from each claimant\u2019s separate exposure to asbestos, each of the underlying claims should be treated as a separate occurrence under the excess policies. Id., 301-302. The trial court agreed that the \u201coccurrence,\u201d as used in the \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure\u201d language of the excess policies, was each claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos. Id., 300-301. On appeal, Metropolitan claimed that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, its liability had been caused by a single occurrence, \u201ci.e., its alleged failure to warn of the health risks of asbestos exposure.\u201d Id., 303-304. We concluded that \u201cthe occurrence in this case was the exposure of the claimants to asbestos, not Metropolitan\u2019s alleged failure to warn. Moreover, the proper interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of the continuous exposure clause is that it combines exposures to asbestos that occurred at the same place, at approximately the same time, resulting <em>still, </em>in multiple occurrences under the policy.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Relying on this language, the trial court in the present case concluded that, as used in the underlying MacArthur policies, the word \u201c \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u201d meant the exposure of each MacArthur claimant to asbestos or, at most, the exposure of multiple claimants to asbestos at the same place and roughly the same time. The court also concluded that the exposures could not have been the common cause or causes of all of the claims within the meaning of the treaty\u2019s \u201cany one accident\u201d clause. In reaching this conclusion, however, the trial court failed to recognize that our conclusion in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>was premised both on the \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions\u201d language of the excess policies; <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 300; which does not exist in the treaty at issue in the present case, and on the <em>purpose </em>of the excess policies, which is different than the purpose of the treaty. We emphasized in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>that the purpose of the excess policies\u2019 continuous exposure clause was to allow aggregation of claims that occurred: (1) <em>at one location-, </em>and (2) as the result of damage that was incurred <em>over a period of time, </em>rather than instantly. Id., 311. In contrast, the purpose of the treaty\u2019s common cause language indisputably was to allow Hartford to aggregate multiple claims arising from multiple events that took place at <em>separate locations </em>and at <em>different times </em>\u2014 assuming, of course, that the events had a common cause or causes. For example, in their brief to this court, the defendants state that the common cause language would allow accumulation of claims if \u201can accident creates a tainted batch of products that are then circulated through the stream of commerce and cause multiple insurance claims under Hartford policies.\u201d If the word \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the common cause provision in the present case had the same meaning as the word as used in the excess policies in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. </em>Co., an \u201coccurrence\u201d would be each individual exposure to the tainted product and such an accumulation would not be allowed. Thus, as the defendants in the present case effectively conceded at oral argument before this court, we conclude that the trial court improperly applied the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the excess policies at issue in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>to the common cause provision of the treaty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b792-4\"> The insured claimed in <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>that the claims against it were not \u201cproducts hazard\u201d claims because they had not arisen from products, not because the claims had arisen while the products were on the insured\u2019s premises or within its possession. <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity </em>Co., supra, 16 Cal. App. 4th 500. Thus, the court was not required to consider the distinction between products hazard claims and operations claims involving products, or whether the latter could be considered claims \u201carising from products\u201d or products liability claims. Accordingly, we interpret the court\u2019s statement that \u201cproducts <em>liability </em>is a coverage that takes over where premises-operations leaves off\u2019; (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 500-501; to refer to products <em>hazard </em>coverage. But see footnote 15 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\"> See also <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md.

Once there has been a <em>sale </em>of a defective product, injuries caused by the defect are called products liability claims under the [Restatement (Third), Torts, Products Liability \u00a7 1, p. 5 (1998)]. The determination of whether a product is defective is made \u2018at the time of sale or distribution.\u2019 [Id., \u00a7 2, p. 14.] If the MacArthur \u2018product\u2019 was an \u2018insulation system\u2019 that was unfinished at the time MacArthur created asbestos dust, then it was not a product liability claim according to the Restatement [Third] . . . because there had not been a sale or distribution of a defective product. \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Even if we were to assume that the defendants are correct, however, the treaty does not unambiguously limit the \u201cliability arising out of products\u201d language to losses that arise from \u201cproducts liability\u201d as that term is technically defined in various statutes and case law. As the court in <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>stated, \u201cthe phrase arising out of does not purport to regulate the theory of liability or (he standard of causation .... Rather, it identifies a core factual nucleus, i.e., products manufactured, sold or distributed by the insured, and links that nucleus to the bodily injury or property damage covered under the policy. This link is not made in terms of tort causation. Tort causation is assumed within the requirement of the general insuring clause that the insured be found legally liable to pay damages. . . . The arising out of embellishment then broadly links the insureds\u2019 products with the resulting bodily injury or property damage.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 16 Cal.
