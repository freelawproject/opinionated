On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his application for protection from foreclosure under what is commonly referred to as the Homeowner Protection Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 49-31d et seq. Specifically, the defendant claims that, in denying the application, the trial court improperly relied on \u00a7 49-31j-4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies because that section: (1) exceeds the statutory author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ity conferred on the banking commissioner under General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 49-31j;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) violates the separation of powers doctrine under the state constitution because it purports to limit the court\u2019s broad discretion over foreclosure proceedings. We conclude that the defendant has failed to provide us with an adequate record to review his claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose its mortgage on residential real property owned by the defendant. The defendant, claiming to be \u201cunderemployed\u201d as defined in \u00a7 49-31d (6),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sought protection from the foreclosure by filing an application under the act. The plaintiff then filed a written objection to the application, along with a memorandum of law. The trial court thereafter held a hearing on the application and the objection on two different days. At the first day of hearings, the plaintiff asserted that: (1) the defendant was not \u201cunderemployed\u201d under \u00a7 49-31d (6) given the amount of his income; and (2) even if the defendant were \u201cunderemployed\u201d under the statute, the court should exercise its discretion under General Statutes \u00a7 49-31g (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the defendant\u2019s application in light of refinancing and other alternatives available to the defendant given the equity he held in the property. The defendant contended that he did in fact meet the required elements for protection under the act, and also argued that \u00a7 49-3 lj-4 of the regulations exceeded the banking commissioner\u2019s statutory authority. After hearing argument from the parties, the court adjourned the proceedings on the first day, February 22, 2005, in an effort to enable the parties to reach a settlement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties were unable to resolve the matter of their own accord, however, and the court therefore resumed the hearing on March 14, 2005. On that date, after hearing additional argument from the parties, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s application to restructure the debt without stating any reasons for the denial other than that it agreed with the plaintiffs arguments. The defendant later filed a motion to reargue with the trial court, which was denied. The defendant filed an appeal from the trial court decision to the Appellate Court. Because the trial court had not yet rendered a judgment of foreclosure, the appeal was dismissed for lack of a final judgment. Thereafter, the trial court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The defendant raises two claims on appeal, both of which center on the trial court\u2019s alleged reliance on \u00a7 49-31j-4 of the regulations. See footnote 2 of this opinion. First, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly relied on \u00a7 49-3 lj-4 because, in promulgating that regulation, the banking commissioner had exceeded the authority conferred on him by \u00a7 49-3 lj of the act, which directs the banking commissioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>adopt regulations specifying the manner in which an interest rate shall be computed for a restructured mortgage debt and the standard for determining market rates of interest. Second, the defendant claims that \u00a7 49-3 lj4 of the regulations violates the separation of powers doctrine under article second of the Connecticut constitution because the regulation purports to limit the court\u2019s broad discretion over foreclosure proceedings. We decline to review either claim due to the inadequacy of the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We begin with the standard of review. \u201cA foreclosure action is an equitable proceeding. . . . The determination of what equity requires is a matter for the discretion of the trial court. ... In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Our review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of the legal discretion vested in it is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have reached the conclusion that it did. . . . <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>88 Conn. App. 806, 811-12, 873 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 902, 882 A.2d 670 (2005).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ridgefield Bank </em>v. <em>Stones Trail, LLC, </em>95 Conn.

[A]n appellate tribunal cannot render a decision without first fully understanding the disposition being appealed. ...)....\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Henne, </em>283 Conn. 361, 366, 926 A.2d 1024 (2007). \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>282 Conn. 709, 720, 924 A.2d 809 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In the present case, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly relied on \u00a7 49-31j-4 of the regulations when it denied his application for protection from foreclosure. Because the trial court never provided any reason for its denial of the defendant\u2019s application, the record is inadequate to review the claim. We therefore do not know whether the trial court denied the application because of the regulation or for another reason, such as the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for relief. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the plaintiff should have filed a motion for articulation to preserve an adequate record for review. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-10 and 66-5.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>well established that [a]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. . . . [P]roper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stone-Krete Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>280 Conn. 672, 685-86, 911 A.2d 300 (2006).
