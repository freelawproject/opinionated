App. 77, 78, 912 A.2d 533 (2007). The Appellate Court concluded that the habeas court properly had determined that the petitioner had not met his burden of proving that his appellate attorney had been ineffective in his representation of him for failing to brief properly the petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court had failed to give an orally requested jury instruction on lesser included offenses. Id., 84-85. We thereafter granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal?\u201d Porter v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>281 Conn. 922, 918 A.2d 272 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The petitioner claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the habeas court\u2019s determination that his trial attorney\u2019s actions had not constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
