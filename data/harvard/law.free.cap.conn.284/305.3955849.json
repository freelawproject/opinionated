App. 600, 601-602, 905 A.2d 696 (2006). We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following undisputed facts and procedural history. \u201cThe respondent was bom on May 14,1988. On November 13, 2003, after he had been adjudicated as delinquent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court ordered that the respondent be committed to the custody of the [petitioner] for a period not to exceed eighteen months, which would expire on May 13, 2005. At that time, the respondent also was advised that his commitment could be extended for an additional period not to exceed eighteen months. The respondent was then placed at the Connecticut Juvenile Training School .... Beginning in January, 2005, the respondent was paroled from [that] school and permitted to live with his grandmother and to attend public high school. Shortly thereafter, the respondent began to have problems at school and tested positive for drags on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cOn April 7, 2005, in light of the respondent\u2019s behavior, the [petitioner] moved for an extension of the respondent\u2019s commitment for twelve months pursuant to \u00a7 46b-141 (b). In support of the motion, the [petitioner] filed a social study detailing the respondent\u2019s circumstances. On April 26, 2005, the respondent filed an opposition to the motion for extension, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction to extend his commitment because he was not a \u2018child\u2019 as defined in ... \u00a7 46b-120 (1). The court held a hearing on the [petitioner\u2019s] motion on May 5, 2005. At this hearing, the respondent asked the court to take judicial notice of his age [then sixteen] and [of] the fact that there were no violations of probation or violations of a court order [the facts relevant to whether, at that time, the respondent was a \u2018child\u2019 as defined under \u00a7 46b-120 (1)]. The [petitioner] concurred in this request, noting that \u2018there aren\u2019t any violations because since he\u2019s committed, there\u2019s no probationary type orders.\u2019 In its May 9, 2005 memorandum of decision, the court rejected the respondent\u2019s claim and concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction. The court further found that it was in the best interest of the respondent and the community to extend the respondent\u2019s commitment to the custody of the [petitioner], The court then extended the respondent\u2019s commitment for an indeterminate period not to extend beyond May 14, 2006, when he would become eighteen years old.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 602-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The respondent then appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the judgment. Id., 602. The Appellate Court rejected the respondent\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend delinquency commitments under \u00a7 46b-141 (b) was limited to persons who satisfied the definition of a \u201cchild\u201d under \u00a7 46b-120 (1) at the time that the extension was sought. Id., 608. The Appellate Court reasoned that, because \u201c[t]he relevant question ... is whether under \u00a7 46b-141 (b) the initial commitment pursuant to \u00a7 46b-141 (a) should be extended,\u201d the two subsections must be read in harmony. Id. Because subsection (a) of \u00a7 46b-141 provides for \u201cthe commitment of children convicted as delinquent,\u201d meaning a person who was a \u201cchild\u201d at the time of the initial commitment, the court concluded that \u201cthe motion for extension of the commitment must relate to a person who was a child at the time he or she first was adjudicated as a delinquent.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to extend the respondent\u2019s commitment. Id., 609. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The respondent advances several reasons why the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment should be reversed. He first contends that the Appellate Court ignored the legislature\u2019s express intent that the definition prescribed for \u201cchild\u201d under \u00a7 46b-120 (1) apply throughout chapter 815t of the General Statutes, including \u00a7 46b-141 (b), and that the court contravened rules of statutory construction by, in effect, substituting the term \u201cperson\u201d for \u201cchild.\u201d The respondent also points to the legislature\u2019s inclusion of a limited class of persons sixteen years of age and older in its definition of \u201cchild\u201d as evidence that the legislature specifically chose not to include a broader class of all persons sixteen or older. He further contends that precluding the extension of delinquency commitments for persons who no longer are children (over the age of sixteen) is consistent with the general limits of the court\u2019s jurisdiction in delinquency matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and with other statutes that provide remedies for troubled youth (those between the ages of sixteen and seventeen). Finally, he contends that, should this court deem \u00a7 46b-141 (b) to be ambiguous as to this question, we must construe it against the state because of the quasi-criminal nature of a delinquency commitment and the significant liberty interest at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The petitioner responds that construing the term \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7 46b-141 (b) to refer to the status of the respondent at the time of the initial commitment is the only construction that is consistent with the language and rehabilitative purpose of the delinquency scheme as a whole. The petitioner contends that various inequities and inconsistencies would ensue if this court were to construe \u00a7 46b-141 (b) to limit the court\u2019s jurisdiction to persons who are children, as defined under \u00a7 46b-120, at the time of the pertinent proceeding subsequent to commitment. We agree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This appeal raises a question of statutory construction. As such, we exercise de novo review under well settled principles. See <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop </em>Cos., 281 Conn. 656, 663, 916 A.2d 803 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We begin, as directed by General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, with the relevant text. Section 46b-141 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) . . . [C]ommitment of children convicted as delinquent by the Superior Court to the Department of Children and Families shall be for (1) an indeterminate time up to a maximum of eighteen months . . . . (b) The Commissioner of Children and Families may file a motion for an extension of the commitment as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) beyond the eighteen-month period on the grounds that such extension is for the <em>best interest of the child </em>or the community. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Section 46b-120 (1) in turn provides the following pertinent definition: \u201c[F]or purposes of delinquency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>matters, \u2018child\u2019 means any person (A) under sixteen years of age, or (B) sixteen years of age or older who, prior to attaining sixteen years of age, has violated any federal or state law or municipal or local ordinance, other than an ordinance regulating behavior of a child in a family with service needs, and, subsequent to attaining sixteen years of age, violates any order of the Superior Court or any condition of probation ordered by the Superior Court with respect to such delinquency proceeding . . . .\u201d Section 46b-120 (1) (B), in essence, addresses those persons who were subject to a delinquency proceeding before the age of sixteen and who, after attaining the age of sixteen, violate a court order. It is undisputed that at the time of the extension proceeding in the present case, the respondent did not fall within either definition of a \u201cchild.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Because, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-141 (b), the court undoubtedly considers the child\u2019s best interest <em>at the time the extension is sought, </em>the respondent contends that his status at that time is controlling. The respondent points to the \u201cplain meaning rule\u201d as dictating such a construction. Although we agree that the definition of \u201cchild\u201d under \u00a7 46b-120 (1) could be applied literally to \u00a7 46b-141 (b) to support the respondent\u2019s construction, we eschew such a mechanistic application of the definition given the internal inconsistencies and consequences that would ensue in clear contravention of the broader purposes of the delinquency scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We note at the outset that there is no one canon of statutory construction that trumps all others, as the respondent appears to suggest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Small </em>v. <em>Going </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Forward, Inc., </em>281 Conn. 417, 425 n.4, 915 A.2d 298 (2007). Indeed, \u00a7 l-2z expressly eschews such a myopic approach. In determining the meaning of a statute, this court\u2019s charge is to consider \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z. This dictate reflects the well established principle that \u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Renaissance Management Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, </em>281 Conn. 227, 238-39, 915 A.2d 290 (2007). Examination of the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7 46b-141 and the delinquency scheme as a whole reveals the legislature\u2019s intent to view that term in the light of the status of the respondent at the time of the original delinquency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Beginning with the provision at issue, we first note, as did the Appellate Court, that \u00a7 46b-141 (b) refers to the extension of a commitment provided for under subsection (a) of that statute. Thus, the statute incorporates by reference the person\u2019s status as a child at the original commitment proceeding. In addition, \u00a7 46b-141 (b) authorizes the court to grant a motion to extend commitment when it is in the best interest of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>munity, and that determination has significance independent of whether extension also is the best interest of the child. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (b) (petitioner may move for extension \u201con the grounds that such extension is for the best interest of the child <em>or the </em>community\u201d [emphasis added]); see also Public Acts 1995, No. 95-225, \u00a7 23 (adding best interest of community as ground for extension); <em>State </em>v. <em>Robert H., </em>273 Conn. 56, 65 n.8, 866 A.2d 1255 (2005) (\u201cthe use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 between the two parts of the statute evinced a \u2018clear legislative intent of separability\u2019 \u201d). There is no textual indication that the community interest determination either requires consideration of the person\u2019s age or precludes extension on the basis of age if extended commitment is in the best interest of the community. Indeed, the delinquency scheme as a whole reflects the twin goals of protecting the community and rehabilitating the juvenile by providing within the juvenile justice scheme a process to help those juveniles who can be rehabilitated and by addressing within the criminal justice system those juveniles who pose a significant risk to the community. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121h (setting forth goals of juvenile justice system); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121i (prescribing responsibilities of judicial department in providing programs and services to juvenile justice system); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121Z (early intervention projects for juvenile offenders); see also <em>In re Jason C., </em>255 Conn. 565, 575-76 n.12, 767 A.2d 710 (2001) (stating in delinquency extension case that, \u201cit is clear that \u00a7 46b-121h includes both rehabilitation and accountability as desired goals of the juvenile justice system\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We further note that \u00a7 46b-141 (b) mandates that the trial court hold a permanency hearing \u201c[n]ot later than twelve months after a child is committed to the [petitioner] .... After the initial permanency hearing, subsequent permanency hearings shall be held not less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>frequently than every twelve months while the child remains committed to the [petitioner].\u201d Were we to adopt the respondent\u2019s temporal view of the term \u201cchild,\u201d the court would lack jurisdiction to conduct a permanency hearing upon the respondent attaining the age of sixteen. Thus, if a child between the ages of fifteen and sixteen were committed to the petitioner for a period in excess of twelve months, the court would be faced with two options: (1) conduct a permanency hearing a short time after the child is committed; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (d) (requiring petitioner to file permanency plan at least sixty days prior to hearing); or (2) lose jurisdiction to conduct the hearing upon the child\u2019s sixteenth birthday. Neither outcome, however, is consistent with the purpose of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Significantly, permanency plans may include the goal of modification or revocation of commitment. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (c) and (d). Uniformly applied, the respondent\u2019s construction would preclude the court from exercising jurisdiction to modify or revoke commitment for persons over the age of sixteen, unless they fall into the limited class under \u00a7 46b-120 (1) (B). A similar result would ensue under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (i) (\u201cparent or guardian of the child or the child may petition the court for modification\u201d of commitment of child to \u201cresidential facility operated by or under contract with\u201d department of children and families). Such results clearly run counter to the goal of permanency plans, which are intended to advance the child\u2019s best interest and need for permanency. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (d). Indeed, as the petitioner pointed out at oral argument in this court, under the respondent\u2019s view, a child who has been committed to the petitioner would enter a sort of \u201clegal limbo\u201d to that child\u2019s prejudice during the period between his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sixteenth birthday and the termination of his commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The effect of the respondent\u2019s construction on motions to extend commitments ordered pursuant to \u00a7 46b-141 (a) (2) also counsels against his view. Under that statute, the court may commit a child convicted as delinquent for a serious juvenile offense<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> up to a maximum of four years. The court thereafter may grant a motion by the petitioner to extend the commitment for an additional eighteen months if the extension is \u201cfor the best interest of the child or the community.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (c). As a practical matter, in order for the court to extend a four year commitment under the respondent\u2019s temporal construction, the child would need to have been <em>under the age of twelve </em>when committed in order for the court to retain jurisdiction to extend commitment near the end of that four year period. It is highly unlikely that the legislature intended for the extension to apply only to the youngest of juvenile offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Review of delinquency provisions outside of \u00a7 46b-141 clearly demonstrates that the term \u201cchild\u201d cannot mean definitively a person who has the status of a child as defined under \u00a7 46b-120 (1) at the time of the pertinent proceeding. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>vides a procedure for the erasure of police and court records for children found to be delinquent. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any child has been found delinquent . . . and has subsequently been discharged from the supervision of the Superior Court or from the custody of the Department of Children and Families or from the care of any other institution or agency to whom he has been committed by the court, such child, his parent or guardian, may file a petition with the Superior Court and, if such court finds that at least two years or, in the case of a child convicted as delinquent for the commission of a serious juvenile offense, four years have elapsed from the date of such discharge, that no subsequent juvenile proceeding has been instituted against such child, that such child has not been found guilty of a crime <em>and that such child has reached sixteen years of age within such period, </em>it shall order all police and court records pertaining to such child to be erased. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, under that section, the court cannot grant a petition for erasure unless the \u201cchild\u201d is sixteen years or older. It is axiomatic that \u201cwe read each statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Mixcus, </em>264 Conn. 314, 322-23, 823 A.2d 321 (2003). The <em>only </em>way to effectuate this statute is to read \u201cchild\u201d to mean a person who had the status of a \u201cchild,\u201d as defined under \u00a7 46b-120 (1), at the time of the original delinquency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We are mindful that, in a different chapter that also addresses delinquency proceedings, the legislature has used the phrase \u201cchild or youth\u201d in some provisions; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-8;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-12 (c);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and thus could have used a similar phrase in \u00a7 46b-141 (b) to state more clearly its intent to allow the court to extend commitments after a person attains the age of sixteen. Given the overwhelming contextual evidence that the legislature intended for the term \u201cchild\u201d as used in \u00a7 46b-141 to have a retrospective meaning referring to the original delinquency proceedings, however, we are not persuaded by these isolated references. We also are not persuaded by the inclusion of a specific class of persons over the age of sixteen in the definition of \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7 46b-120 (1) (B). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>evident that this definition was intended to address a different jurisdictional concern: keeping within the juvenile justice system those delinquent children who currently are not under an order of commitment and who have reoffended. See Public Acts 1998, No. 98-256, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 10 (respectively, adding definition for delinquent child for persons sixteen years of age or older, and confirming jurisdiction of Superior Court to \u201cpersons sixteen years of age and older who are under the supervision of a juvenile probation officer while on probation or a suspended commitment to the Department of Children and Families, for purposes of enforcing any court orders entered as part of such probation or suspended commitment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Recognizing the harm that his construction would engender if uniformly applied throughout the delinquency scheme, the respondent posited at oral argument before this court that the trial court could exercise jurisdiction in some circumstances for persons sixteen years of age and older. Specifically, the respondent suggested that this court could construe the term \u201cchild\u201d differently in the various provisions under the delinquency scheme in chapter 815t of the General Statutes on the basis of whether the result favors or disfavors the respondent. Alternatively, he suggested that we need not consider the meaning of \u201cchild\u201d in any context other than the one specifically implicated in his case. The respondent provides the court with no authority for this novel rule of construction, however, and our case law dictates in favor of a uniform construction in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary. See <em>Renaissance Management Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 238-39 (\u201c[T]he legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute . . . we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>270 Conn. 198, 211, 853 A.2d 434 (2004) (\u201c[i]tis a familiar principle of statutory construction that where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 41, 792 A.2d 835 (2002) (\u201c[o]rdinarily, \u2018where the legislature uses the same phrase it intends the same meaning\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Although not directed to the internal inconsistencies issue, the respondent does contend in his brief to this court that, \u201cbecause liberty is at stake, statutes such as the one at issue here must be strictly construed against the state.\u201d We agree with the petitioner, however, that the respondent has conflated two distinct, albeit related, doctrines. We also conclude that this case does not present a circumstance in which either doctrine is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In support of his rule of construction, the respondent cites <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 804, 820, 786 A.2d 1091 (2002). <em>Johnson </em>recognizes the rule of lenity, under which we strictly construe penal statutes against the state. Id. We need not consider whether an extension of a delinquency commitment should be treated as akin to a penal statute for these purposes, however, because a necessary predicate to the application of the rule of lenity is a conclusion that the statute is ambiguous, meaning that it yields more than one reasonable interpretation <em>after we have applied all of our tools of construction. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 219 (\u201ccourts do not apply the rule of lenity unless a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even after resort to the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>guage and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, after applying our tools of construction, we cannot conclude that the respondent\u2019s interpretation is a reasonable alternative to the one proffered by the petitioner. Indeed, \u201c[although we recognize the fundamental principle that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent. . . . Moreover, there is a presumption that the legislature intends to accomplish a reasonable and rational result rather than a difficult and possibly bizarre one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 26-27, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In addition, the respondent points to cases in which Connecticut appellate courts and the United States Supreme Court have construed commitment statutes against the state to protect due process concerns, i.e., fundamental fairness. See, e.g., <em>In re Jason C., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 575-76 (due process requires trial court to make advisement at time of plea that extension of commitment is possible), citing <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 27-28, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). In the present case, it is undisputed that the respondent expressly was informed during his initial commitment proceeding that his term of commitment could be extended. Accordingly, the respondent does not claim that his right to due process was violated by the extension of his commitment. Thus, we need not construe the statute to remedy defective notice or process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In sum, the delinquency scheme manifestly demonstrates that the term \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7 46b-141 (b) refers to the respondent\u2019s status at the time of the initial delinquency proceeding under \u00a7 46b-141 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise limited by subsection (i) of section 46b-140, commitment of children convicted as delinquent by the Superior Court to the Department of Children and Families shall be for (1) an indeterminate time up to amaximum of eighteen months, or (2) when so convicted for a serious juvenile offense, up to a maximum of four years at the discretion of the court, unless extended as hereinafter provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201c(b) The Commissioner of Children and Families may file a motion for an extension of the commitment as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) beyond the eighteen-month period on the grounds that such extension is for the best interest of the child or the community. The court shall give notice to the parent or guardian and to the child at least fourteen days prior to the hearing upon such motion. The court may, after hearing and upon finding that such extension is in the best interest of the child or the community, continue the commitment for an additional period of not more than eighteen months. Not later than twelve months after a child is committed to the Department of Children and Families in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section the court shall hold a permanency hearing in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. After the initial permanency hearing, subsequent permanency hearings shall be held not less frequently than every twelve months while the child remains committed to the Department of Children and Families. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> We granted the respondent\u2019s petition, limited to the following issue as framed by the respondent: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the term \u2018child\u2019 as used in ... \u00a7 46b-141 (b) did not have the meaning defined under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (1), but rather referred to a person who was previously committed as a delinquent under the provisions of \u00a7 46b-141 (a)?\u201d <em>In re William D., </em>280 Conn. 943, 912 A.2d 479 (2006). Upon reviewing the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, we have rephrased the issue because we conclude that the Appellate Court did not apply a different meaning for the term \u201cchild\u201d than that prescribed in \u00a7 46b-141 (b), but, rather, qualified the temporal lens through which that definition applies to refer to the time of commitment. See <em>Ankerman </em>v. <em>Mancuso, </em>271 Conn. 772, 777, 860 A.2d 244 (2004) (rephrasing certified issue to reflect more precisely issue after reviewing record and briefs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe terms used in this chapter shall, in its interpretation and in the interpretation of other statutes, be defined as follows: (1) \u2018Child\u2019 means any person under sixteen years of age and, for purposes of delinquency matters, \u2018child\u2019 means any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>person (A) under sixteen years of age, or (B) sixteen years of age or older who, prior to attaining sixteen years of age, has violated any federal or state law or municipal or local ordinance, other than an ordinance regulating behavior of a child in afamily with service needs, and, subsequentto attaining sixteen years of age, violates any order of the Superior Court or any condition of probation ordered by the Superior Court with respect to such delinquency proceeding . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We note that technical changes, not relevant to this appeal, were made to \u00a7 46b-120 in 2005.

Although the so-called canons of statutory construction may at times serve as useful tools in deciphering legislative meaning, to rely on any one of them as a compelling factor in the interpretive process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>is problematic, because . . . there are two opposing canons on almost every point.

The so-called canons are not that, at least in the sense that any one of them reliably can be determined to apply or not to apply in any given case.
