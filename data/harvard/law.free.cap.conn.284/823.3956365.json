Kanasky, Jr., the head moderator for the city\u2019s September 11, 2007 Democratic primary, had violated certain election statutes before, during and after the primary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After an expedited hearing, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff then brought an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-325<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>51-199 (b) (5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the appeal was filed, pursuant to \u00a7 9-325, the trial court certified the following question of law to the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. \u201cIn a statutory proceeding under ... \u00a7 9-329a, where the Superior Court has denied [the plaintiffs] request to set aside the primary election results and for a new primary election, must the court thereafter, upon [the plaintiffs] motion, postpone the general election pending an appeal of the court\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court?\u201d The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Immediately after this court held a special session for the purpose of hearing the certified question, as ordered by the Chief Justice pursuant to \u00a7 9-325, this court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and indicated that a full opinion explaining the judgment would be released at a later date. This is that opinion. The certified appeal was dismissed on the ground that it was rendered moot by this court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion to stay proceedings and to postpone the city\u2019s general election in the companion case of <em>Simmons-Cook </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>284 Conn. 815, 936 A.2d 601 (2007), which was released on the same date as this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was a candidate for election to the office of city council for the 135th voting district in the city\u2019s September 11, 2007 Democratic primary. After a mandatory recanvass of the primary vote pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-445, the defendants, Warren Blunt and Richard Bonney, were determined to have won the Democratic nomination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>for the office of city council for the 135th voting district. Fourteen days after the primary, on September 25,2007, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that, before, during and after the primary, and during the recanvass, Ayala and Kanasky had engaged in conduct that violated various election statutes. In her original complaint, the plaintiff stated that she was bringing the action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-328, but she later clarified in an amended complaint that she was bringing the action pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a. In each complaint, the plaintiff sought orders that (1) all of the voting machines used in the Democratic primary election be impounded beyond the automatic fourteen day impoundment period provided for in General Statutes \u00a7 9-310, (2) no Democratic nominee for the office of city council for the 135th voting district be recognized before the case was resolved, (3) \u201cthe votes recounted on the ballots in the 135th [v]oting [district ... be voided,\u201d (4) the plaintiff be declared the winner of the Democratic primary for the office of city council for the 135th voting district, (5) a new primary election be held for the office of city council for the 135th voting district and (6) the ballots cast in the primary election not be examined, unlocked or otherwise inspected except by order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The trial court ordered an expedited hearing on the matter to be held beginning on October 3, 2007. The trial court also issued an ex parte order that all of the voting machines used in the primary, as well as certain other materials related to the election, be impounded, pending further order by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The expedited hearing concluded on October 15, 2007, and, on October 24, 2007, the trial court issued its decision. The trial court concluded that the refusal of Ayala and Kanasky to allow the plaintiff to have an official counter during the recanvass constituted a \u201c \u2018ruling\u2019 \u201d of an election official within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>\u00a7 9-329a and that the ruling was improper. The court also determined, however, that the plaintiff had not established: (1) that the results of the primary might have been different if the rulings had been different; or (2) what the outcome would have been if the rulings had been different. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants and, pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a (b), certified its decision to the secretary of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On October 26, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s impoundment order so that the voting machines could be prepared for the city\u2019s general election on November 6, 2007. The plaintiff objected to the motion and requested that the trial court certify the question of whether the impoundment order should be vacated to the Chief Justice pursuant to \u00a7 9-325. After a hearing, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the impoundment order and denied the plaintiffs request to certify the question to the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">On October 30, 2007, the plaintiff filed a motion to postpone the election \u201cduring the pendency of [her] appeal to the Supreme Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the motion, she also requested that the question of whether the general election should be postponed be certified to the Chief Justice pursuant to \u00a7 9-325. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">On November 1, 2007, the plaintiff filed the appeal, citing \u00a7\u00a7 51-199 (b) (5) and 9-325 as the statutory bases for the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the matter. In her preliminary statement of issues, the plaintiff raised numerous claims relating to the merits of the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the defendants, the vacating of the impoundment order, the denial of the motion to postpone the election and the denials of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>plaintiffs requests to certify the questions of whether the impoundment order should be vacated and the election should be postponed to the Chief Justice pursuant to \u00a7 9-325. The plaintiff also filed a motion to stay pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, in which she requested that the city\u2019s general election for the office of city council for the 135th voting district, scheduled for November 6, 2007, be postponed \u201cpending the appeal.\u201d After the plaintiff filed her appeal and motion to stay, the trial court certified to the Chief Justice the question of whether the trial court was required to grant the plaintiffs motion to postpone the city\u2019s general election pending the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and an opposition to the plaintiffs motion to stay. In the motion to dismiss, the defendants contended that this court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal under \u00a7 9-325 because: (1) there had been no certified question to the Chief Justice when the appeal was filed; and (2) in an appeal from a judgment in a case brought pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a (a) (1), the expedited appeal procedures of \u00a7 9-325 are available only for questions of law arising from \u201ca ruling of an election official\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 9-329a (a) (1); and do not apply to rulings by the trial court, which are reviewable only by way of an ordinary appeal to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-197a and 52-263. In support of these contentions, the defendants relied on this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Bortner v. Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 245 n.4, 736 A.2d 104 (1999) (appeal pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 9-325 and 51-199 [b] requires \u201ccertification, by the trial court to the Chief Justice of this court, of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law\u201d), and <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>186 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>125, 134, 440 A.2d 261 (1982) (expedited review under \u00a7 9-325 \u201cmay deal only with questions of law arising under the statutory provisions by which the \u00a7 9-325 review may be invoked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">On November 2, 2007, the Chief Justice ordered, pursuant to \u00a7 9-325, that a special session of this court be held on November 5, 2007, for the purpose of hearing the plaintiffs appeal. Before and during the hearing, the plaintiff clarified that she had intended to bring both an ordinary appeal from the final judgment of the trial court and a certified appeal pursuant to \u00a7 9-325. She further clarified at the hearing that the only issue in the certified appeal was the certified question of whether the trial court was required to postpone the election pending resolution of the substantive issues raised in the ordinary appeal. Accordingly, this court limited the hearing to the certified question of whether the trial court was required to postpone the city\u2019s general election pending the plaintiffs appeal and to the motion to stay, which involved essentially the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Immediately after the hearing, this court bifurcated the plaintiffs appeal into: (1) this certified appeal, brought pursuant to \u00a7 9-325, and limited to the certified question of whether the trial court was required to postpone the city\u2019s general election pending appeal; and (2) an ordinary appeal from the final judgment of the trial court. We further ordered that the ordinary appeal be accepted for filing in this court. Cf. <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 245 n.4 (although direct appeal to this court pursuant to \u00a7 51-199 [b] [5] was improper in absence of certified question pursuant to \u00a7 9-325, court treated appeal as if it had been filed in Appellate Court and transferred to this court). Because the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was based solely on the alleged jurisdictional defects in this certified appeal, this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>treated the motion as if it had been brought solely in the certified appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">This court then denied the plaintiffs motion to stay in the ordinary appeal, in which the plaintiff had requested that the city\u2019s general election be postponed pending appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The reasons for that denial are set forth in a separate opinion released on the same date as this opinion. See <em>Simmons-Cook </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 822-23; see also <em>Caruso </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>284 Conn. 793, 803-804, 937 A.2d 1 (2007). As we have indicated, the relief that the plaintiff sought in this certified appeal pursuant to \u00a7 9-325 was essentially the same relief that she sought in the motion to stay. Because we concluded in our decision denying the motion to stay in the ordinary appeal that the automatic stay provision of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 did not apply to the city\u2019s general election, that this court has no authority to order post-judgment injunctive relief that was not requested in the underlying complaint and, that even if this court had such authority, neither this court nor the trial court has the authority to postpone a general election pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a under any circumstances; <em>Simmons-Cook </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 822-23; no relief could be granted in the present appeal. We concluded, therefore, that this certified appeal was moot and must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC v. New London, </em>282 Conn. 791, 810, 925 A.2d 293 (2007) (mootness implicates court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction). Accordingly, we do not address the other jurisdictional claims raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 9-329a provides: \u201c(a) Any (1) elector or candidate aggrieved by a ruling of an election official in connection with any primary held pursuant to (A) section 9-423, 9-425 or 9-464, or (B) a special act, (2) elector or candidate who alleges that there has been a mistake in the count of the votes cast at such primary, or (3) candidate in such a primary who alleges that he is aggrieved by a violation of any provision of sections 9-355,9-357 to 9-361, inclusive, 9-364,9-364a or 9-365 in the casting of absentee ballots at such primary, may bring his complaint to any judge of the Superior Court, for appropriate action. In any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this section, the complainant shall send a copy of the complaint by first-class mail, or deliver a copy of the complaint by hand, to the State Elections Enforcement Commission. If such complaint is made prior to such primary such judge shall proceed expeditiously to render judgment on the complaint and shall cause notice of the hearing to be given to the Secretary of the State and the State Elections Enforcement Commission. If such complaint is made subsequent to such primary it shall be brought, within fourteen days after such primary, to any judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\u201c(b) Such judge shall forthwith order a hearing to be held upon such complaint upon a day not more than five nor less than three days after the making of such order, and shall cause notice of not less than three days to be given to any candidate or candidates in any way directly affected by the decision upon such hearing, to such election official, to the Secretary of the Slate, the State Elections Enforcement Commission and to any other person or persons, whom such judge deems proper parties thereto, of the time and place of the hearing upon such complaint. Such judge shall, on the day fixed for such hearing, and without delay, proceed to hear the parties and determine the result. If, after hearing, sufficient reason is shown, such judge may order any voting machines to be unlocked or any ballot boxes to be opened and a recount of the votes cast, including absentee ballots, to be made. Such judge shall thereupon, if he finds any error in the ruling of the election official, any mistake in the count of the votes or any violation of said sections, certify the result of his finding or decision to the Secretary of the State before the tenth day following the conclusion of the hearing. Such judge may (1) determine the result of such primary; (2) order a change in the existing primary schedule; or (3) order a new primary if he finds that but for the error in the ruling of the election official, any mistake in the count of the votes or any violation of said sections, the result of such primary might have been different and he is unable to determine the result of such primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">\u201c(c) The certification by the judge of his finding or decision shall be final and conclusive upon all questions relating to errors in the ruling of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>election official, to the correctness of such count, and, for the purposes of this section only, such alleged violations, and shall operate to correct any returns or certificates filed by the election officials, unless the same is appealed from as provided in section 9-325. In the event a new primary is held pursuant to such Superior Court order, the result of such new primary shall be final and conclusive unless a complaint is brought pursuant to this section. The clerk of the court shall forthwith transmit a copy of such findings and order to the Secretary of the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\"> The plaintiff also named as defendants the following: the city; Hector Diaz, the town clerk for the city; Joseph Borges, the Republican registrar of voters for the city; Patricia Howard, the deputy Democratic registrar of voters for the city; Jeffrey B.

A copy of the finding and decision so certified by the judge of the Superior Court, together with the decision of the Supreme Court, on the questions of law therein certified, shall be attested by the clerk of the Supreme Court, and by him transmitted to the Secretary of the State forthwith.
