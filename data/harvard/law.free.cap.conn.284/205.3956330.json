(Chase Associates), Chase Homes, Inc. (Chase Homes), Chase Orchards, LLC (Chase Orchards), Jodie T. Chase and John J. Doran, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>seeking to recover compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees based on the defendants\u2019 failure to pay for construction materials and forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) found that Chase Associates had not contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase of construction materials; (2) concluded that personal guarantees executed by Chase and Doran in favor of the plaintiffs predecessor in interest, Laureno Lumber and Millwork, Inc. (Laureno Lumber), had not been assigned to the plaintiff; (3) declined to award punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b et seq.;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (4) found that Doran had not violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962 et seq., by forging mechanic\u2019s lien waivers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Doran<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claims that the trial court improperly found that he had violated CUTPA because: (1) the plaintiff failed to establish that Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers proximately caused the plaintiff to suffer an ascertainable loss; and (2) the plaintiff impliedly had ratified Doran\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the plaintiffs CUTPA claim and, therefore, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts. Chase Associates, Chase Homes and Chase Orchards are land development and real estate companies founded and operated by Chase and Doran. At some point in 1997, Chase Orchards began developing a fifty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>one lot subdivision known as Chase Orchards (Chase Orchards subdivision) in the town of South Windsor. Doran ordered construction materials for the Chase Orchards subdivision from Laureno Lumber, a lumber company from which Doran previously had ordered construction materials on behalf of Chase Associates and Chase Homes, doing business as Chase Associates. Although Laureno Lumber delivered the construction materials to the Chase Orchards subdivision, its billing invoices listed Chase Associates as the purchaser. Additionally, Laureno Lumber mailed the billing invoices to Chase Associates at 2033 Ellington Road in South Windsor, a mailing address shared by Chase Orchards. Moreover, Chase Orchards remitted payments for these materials via corporate checks issued on a Chase Orchards checking account. Neither Chase Associates nor Chase Orchards paid Laureno Lumber for all of the materials delivered, however, and approximately $133,442.68 remains past due.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Both Chase and Doran entered into various credit agreements with Laureno Lumber on behalf of Chase Associates and Chase Homes, doing business as Chase Associates. Specifically, on November 17, 1994, Chase executed a credit agreement on behalf of Chase Homes, doing business as Chase Associates; on September 12, 1995, both Chase and Doran executed a credit agreement on behalf of Chase Homes, doing business as Chase Associates; on December 9 1996, Doran executed a credit agreement on behalf of Chase Associates; and on December 16,1996, both Chase and Doran executed a credit agreement on behalf of Chase Associates. Each of these credit agreements provides in relevant part: \u201cIn consideration of [Laureno Lumber] extending credit to [b]uyer, the undersigned individuals unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee the payment of any and all amounts owed to [Laureno Lumber] by the [b]uyer and agrees to pay all costs of collection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, together with interest on any unpaid balance at the highest rate allowed by law, where applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Meanwhile, in October, 1996, Laureno Lumber sold its assets to the plaintiff. Thereafter, on November 25, 1996, \u201c[i]n consideration of and as part of the purchase and sale\u201d of assets, Laureno Lumber agreed to \u201cassign, transfer and provide to [the plaintiff] all of [its] right, title and interest . . . with respect to all customers, including all customer applications, guarantees, certifications and all related agreements . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Additionally, Doran signed several waivers of mechanic\u2019s liens on behalf of various entities, including the plaintiff, that had furnished or had contracted to furnish services, labor or materials to the Chase Orchards subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On April 21, 2003,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed a revised complaint alleging: (1) breach of contract against all five defendants; (2) quantum meruit against all five defendants; (3) unjust enrichment against all five defendants; (4) breach of personal guarantees against Chase Associates and Doran; (5) violations of CUTPA against Chase and Doran; (6) fraud against Chase Associates and Doran; (7) piercing the corporate veil of Chase Associates, Chase Homes and Chase Orchards against Chase and Doran; and (8) violations of RICO predicated on Chase and Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Following a bench trial, the trial court determined that: (1) \u201cthe evidence does not support a conclusion that any defendant other than [Chase Orchards] had a contract with the plaintiff\u2019; (2) Chase Orchards \u201chad a valid and enforceable, although perhaps uncollectible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>contract, [and] therefore neither quantum meruit nor unjust enrichment is appropriate\u201d; (3) although Chase and Doran had executed credit agreements in favor of Laureno Lumber, \u201cthe assignment of November 25, 1996, is not sufficient to transfer a guarantee made one month later on [December 6,1996]\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthat guarantee was never legally transferred\u201d to the plaintiff; (4) although Doran had signed waivers of mechanic\u2019s liens without authority to do so in violation of CUTPA, the plaintiff \u201cimpliedly [had] ratified the status quo\u201d because it \u201cknew, or should have known that Doran was signing these [lien], waivers\u201d; (5) the plaintiff had failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Doran had committed fraud by signing waivers of mechanic\u2019s liens without authority to do so; (6) insufficient facts existed \u201cto support a finding that the corporate veil should be pierced\u201d; and (7) Doran had not violated RICO because \u201c[t]he plaintiff is not a financial institution and there is insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim that [Doran had] intended to deceive a lending institution in order to induce a lender to make a loan. There is no evidence that any financial institution suffered any damages as a result of [Doran\u2019s] unauthorized signature on the waivers of mechanic\u2019s liens.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff with respect to its breach of contract claim against Chase Orchards and its CUTPA claim against Doran, but in favor of the remaining defendants with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with its verdict and awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $133,442.68<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against both Chase Orchards and Doran. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The trial court declined, however, to award punitive damages or attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA because the plaintiff knew, or should have known, that Doran had been signing mechanic\u2019s lien waivers on its behalf. This appeal and cross appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We first address Doran\u2019s claims on the cross appeal. Doran claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he had violated CUTPA because: (1) the plaintiff failed to establish that Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s hen waivers proximately had caused the plaintiff to suffer an ascertainable loss; and (2) the plaintiff impliedly had ratified Doran\u2019s conduct. We agree with Doran\u2019s first claim and, therefore, we need not reach his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As a preliminary matter, we first delineate the basic elements of a CUTPA cause of action. \u201cCUTPA provides that \u2018[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). In order to enforce this prohibition, CUTPA provides a private cause of action to \u2018[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a [prohibited] method, act or practice . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a); see generally <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 212-13, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cThus, in order to prevail in a CUTPA action, a plaintiff must establish both that the defendant has engaged in a prohibited act <em>and </em>that, \u2018as a result of this act, the plaintiff suffered an injury. The language \u2018as a result of requires a showing that the prohibited act was the proximate cause of a harm to the plaintiff. See generally <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994). With regard to the requisite causal element, it is axiomatic that proximate cause is \u2018[a]n actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm . . . .\u2019 <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 606, 662 A.2d 753 (1995). The question to be asked in ascertaining whether proximate cause exists is \u2018whether the harm which occurred was of the same general nature as the foreseeable risk\u2019 created by the defendant\u2019s act. . . . <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>212 Conn. 748, 758, 563 A.2d 699 (1989).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 300, 306, 692 A.2d 709 (1997); cf. <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 88, 793 A.2d 1048 (2002) (\u201cnotwithstanding the broad language and remedial purpose of CUTPA, we have applied traditional common-law principles of remoteness and proximate causation to determine whether a party has standing to bring an action under CUTPA\u201d). \u201cAlthough the issue of causation generally is a question reserved for the trier of fact . . . the issue becomes one of law when the mind of a fair and reasonable person could reach only one conclusion . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>supra, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that the trial court properly found that Doran had signed mechanic\u2019s hen waivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>without authority to do so and that this conduct constituted an unfair trade or practice within the meaning of \u00a7 42-110b (a), the trial court nonetheless improperly found that Doran had violated CUTPA because Doran\u2019s conduct was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. The plaintiff conceded at oral argument before this court that it never had filed mechanic\u2019s liens on the municipal land records to recover the cost of the construction materials delivered to the Chase Orchards subdivision. Additionally, at trial, the plaintiff failed to present any evidence to establish that, but for Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers, the plaintiff would have filed mechanic\u2019s liens to recover these costs or, alternatively, would not have extended credit to Chase Orchards for the purchase of these materials in the first instance. Because the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence from which the trial court reasonably could have inferred that the plaintiffs loss had been caused by Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers, we are compelled to conclude that the trial court improperly found that Doran had violated CUTPA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We next address the plaintiffs claims on appeal. The plaintiff claims that: (1) the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Chase Orchards, rather than Chase Associates, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase of construction materials was clearly erroneous; (2) the trial court improperly concluded that the credit agreements executed by Chase and Doran in December, 1996, had not been assigned to the plaintiff; and (3) the trial court improperly found that Doran had not violated RICO by forging mechanic\u2019s lien waivers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly found that Chase Orchards, rather than Chase Associates, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase of construction materials delivered to the Chase Orchards subdivision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cIt is well settled that the existence of a contract is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Burse </em>v. <em>American International Airways, </em>262 Conn. 31, 42, 808 A.2d 672 (2002); see also <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 187, 708 A.2d 949 (1998). \u201cThe law governing [our] limited appellate review is clear. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>give great deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 526, 558-59, 893 A.2d 389 (2006) <em>(Pellegrino, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">At trial, Doran testified that he had ordered the construction materials at issue in the present case on behalf of Chase Orchards, and that he verbally had informed Laurence Laureno, former coowner of Laureno Lumber and a sales representative of the plaintiff, of this fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is undisputed that the plaintiff had delivered the construction materials to the Chase Orchards subdivision, which was owned and being developed by Chase Orchards, and that the payments remitted to the plaintiff had been made by Chase Orchards via corporate checks issued from a Chase Orchards checking account. This evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Chase Orchards, rather than Chase Associates, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase of the construction materials.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly rendered judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to the plaintiffs breach of guarantee claim because the trial court improperly concluded that the December, 1996 credit agreements between Chase, Doran and Laureno Lumber never had been assigned to the plaintiff. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the November 25, 1996 assignment between the plaintiff and Laureno Lumber encompassed all <em>future </em>credit agreements executed in favor of Laureno Lumber and, therefore, included the December, 1996 credit agreements. We conclude that the plaintiffs claim fails regardless of whether the December, 1996 credit agreements properly had been assigned to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u201c[W]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 227, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); see also <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>280 Conn. 605, 612, 909 A.2d 947 (2006) (\u201c[i]f a contract is unambiguous within its four comers, intent of the parties is a question of law requiring plenary review\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under the terms of the credit agreements, Chase and Doran agreed \u201cunconditionally, jointly and severally, [to] guarantee the payment of any and all amounts owed to [Laureno Lumber] <em>by the [b]uyer </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the term \u201cbuyer\u201d is not defined in the credit agreements, we conclude that it plainly and unambiguously refers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the credit applicant, namely, Chase Associates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Enviro Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>279 Conn. 194, 200, 901 A.2d 666 (2006) (\u201cwhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court\u201d). Accordingly, under the terms of these agreements, Chase and Doran agreed to guarantee personally the payment of all amounts owed to Laureno Lumber by Chase Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">As explained in part II A of this opinion, however, the trial court reasonably found that Chase Associates had not contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase of the construction materials delivered to the Chase Orchards subdivision and, therefore, is not liable to the plaintiff for the cost of these materials. Even if we were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>to assume, arguendo, that the December, 1996 credit agreements properly had been assigned to the plaintiff, Chase and Doran nonetheless are not hable to the plaintiff for the cost of the construction materials at issue because Chase Associates is not hable to the plaintiff for the cost of these materials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Stated simply, Chase and Doran agreed to guarantee personally only the debts owed to Laureno Lumber and its assigns by Chase Associates, which is not the corporate entity responsible for the debt at issue in the present case. Accordingly, the trial court properly rendered judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to the plaintiffs breach of guarantee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Lastly, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly found that Doran had not violated RICO by signing waivers of mechanic\u2019s hens with an intent to defraud a financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs RICO claim, finding that \u201c[t]he plaintiff is not a financial institution and there is insufficient evidence to support the plaintiffs claim that the defendant intended to deceive a lending institution in order to induce a lender to make a loan. There is no evidence that any financial institution suffered any damages as a result of [Doran\u2019s] unauthorized signature on the waivers of mechanic\u2019s liens.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation in the trial court requesting that the court articulate, inter alia, the legal and factual basis for its conclusions that the plaintiff is not a financial institution and that it must present actual evidence that a financial institution suffered damages as a result of Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers. The trial court denied the motion for articulation and, thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for review in the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court granted the plaintiffs motion for review and partially granted the relief requested therein, ordering the trial court to articulate the factual basis for its determination that the plaintiff is not a financial institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The trial court subsequently articulated its judgment in relevant part as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff is a general purpose lumber company which sold building supplies to some of the defendants. There was no evidence or any allegation that [the plaintiff] was a financial institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cThere is a split of authority in the federal court concerning whether a nonfinancial institution can base a civil RICO claim on bank fraud through 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. This would appear to present a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u201cTo the best of my recollection, there was no evidence that any financial institution was involved in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u201cThe claim was made in the plaintiffs posttrial brief dated July 21, 2005, that, \u2018[i]t is common knowledge that most financial institutions require title insurance prior to loaning money pursuant to a note and mortgage.\u2019 There was no evidence offered to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201cThere was no direct evidence that any defendant intended to expose a financial institution to loss. . . . While there may have been financial institution loans used for construction, I remember no evidence to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">As previously explained, \u201c[t]he law governing [our] limited appellate review is clear. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court's function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>supra, 277 Conn. 558-59 <em>(Pellegrino, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>RICO provides a private right of action for \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter . . . .\u201d18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 (c).

In its revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had violated CUTPA not only by forging mechanic\u2019s lien waivers, but also by: (1) ordering construction materials for which they knew or should have known they were not going to pay; (2) concealing Doran\u2019s forgery of mechanic\u2019s lien waivers; (3) creating various corporate entities for the purpose of avoiding payment for goods and supplies ordered from the plaintiff; and (4) failing to inform the plaintiff of the appropriate corporate entities that had purchased the goods and supplies for the purpose of avoiding payment. The trial court neither addressed nor resolved these claims, however, and the plaintiff never filed a motion for articulation requesting the trial court to address them.
