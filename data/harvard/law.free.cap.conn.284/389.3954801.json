The plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that her injuries had resulted from negligence on the part of a state employee, James M. Zueco, in parking a department of transportation (department) dump truck so as partially to obstruct a roadway. The defendant appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff after a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) failed to instruct the jury regarding <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>20 Conn. App. 619, 569 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 576 A.2d 538 (1990); (2) failed to direct a verdict for the defendant or to set aside the verdict because the defendant had established that Zueco was not operating the truck for purposes of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 52-556<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and because the plaintiff had presented no expert testimony regarding the applicable standard of care for a state employee parking a truck on the roadway while addressing a hazardous road condition; (3) denied the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury that maintenance vehicles displaying flashing lights legally are permitted to stop and park on a highway pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-251<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 14-290;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (4) denied the state\u2019s motion for remittitur. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, which is dis-positive of this appeal. We therefore reverse the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial. We also address the merits of the defendant\u2019s second and third claims because they are likely to arise on retrial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following relevant facts, as alleged in the plaintiffs complaint, and procedural history. \u201cIn October, 2002, the plaintiff commenced a personal injury action against . . . Michael T. Manetta, Richard Gray, [Zueco and the defendant]. The plaintiff alleged, in part, that on February 26, 2001, she was operating her motor vehicle in an easterly direction on Route 44 in Salisbury. At that time and place, Manetta allegedly was operating a tractor trailer and proceeding west on Route 44 when he negligently maneuvered his vehicle over the double line into the eastbound lane in order to pass a department truck parked partially within . . . the westbound lane. In doing so, Manetta collided with the plaintiffs vehicle, causing her serious injuries. The plaintiff also alleged that the tractor trailer Manetta was operating was owned by Gray, who was doing business as Richard Gray Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201cIn addition, the plaintiff alleged that Zueco was a department employee operating a [truck] owned by the [defendant]. She alleged that on the date in question, Zueco negligently had stopped the truck beneath a ridge on Route 44 in such a manner that the truck partially obstructed the westbound lane. Zueco allegedly failed to use any means of warning to alert drivers that the truck was parked in a manner that obstructed the westbound lane of Route 44. The plaintiff alleged that, pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, the [defendant] was liable for Zucco\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cThe [defendant] and Zueco filed a joint motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims against them. Zueco argued that, as a state employee acting in the course of his employment, he is immune from the liability alleged in the complaint. The state argued that \u00a7 52-556 does not grant the plaintiff a cause of action against it because the truck was parked and was not being operated by Zueco at the time of the collision. After the plaintiff deposed Zueco, she filed an objection to the motion to dismiss. The [trial] court granted the motion to dismiss the claims against Zueco and the [defendant] . . . [finding] that there was no temporal congruence between Zucco\u2019s operation of the truck and the accident in which the plaintiff was injured. The truck was parked at the time of the accident and was not being operated by Zueco. The [trial] court, therefore, granted the motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff appealed [from the trial court\u2019s decision granting Zueco and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss], claiming that the court improperly [had] concluded that Zucco\u2019s stopping or parking the truck did not constitute operation of the motor vehicle for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. She argued, therefore, that the [trial] court improperly granted the motion to dismiss as to the [defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>84 Conn. App. 535, 536-38, 854 A.2d 84, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 582 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that \u201cthe [trial] court improperly granted the [defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss because, as a matter of law, Zueco was operating the truck at the time of the collision.\u201d Id., 542. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed in part the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Thereafter, the matter was tried to a jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded damages against the defendant, Manetta, and Gray in the total amount of $1,780,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury regarding what the defendant calls the <em>\u201cRivera </em>[exception\u201d under <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624. More specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that if the state truck was being used as a warning device or protective barrier at the time that the plaintiff was injured, the defendant was immune from liability because the truck was not being \u201coperated\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. The plaintiff asserts, in response, that the trial court properly instructed the jury in accordance with <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 541-42. We agree with the defendant, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We begin our analysis of this claim with the standard of review. \u201cWhen reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . Failure to charge precisely as proposed by a defendant is not error where the point is fairly covered in the charge. . . . Instructions are adequate if they give the jury a clear understanding of the issues and proper guidance in determining those issues.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>278 Conn. 428, 437, 899 A.2d 563 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal, we review briefly prior appellate precedent construing \u00a7 52-556. \u201cIt is well settled in Connecticut that, under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the state cannot be sued unless, by legislative enactment, it consents. . . . [Section] 52-556 creates a cause of action against the state and represents a statutory exception to the common law rule of sovereign immunity.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 622. Section 52-556 provides that \u201c[a]ny person injured in person or property through the negligence of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state against personal injuries or property damage shall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury.\u201d The statute does not define the phrase \u201cwhen operating a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-556.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Appellate Court, however, addressed this issue in <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624. In <em>Rivera, </em>the plaintiff in a wrongful death action claimed that the trial court improperly had rendered summary judgment in favor of the state based on its conclusion that a state employee was not operating a truck at the time of the accident. Id., 621-22. The undisputed facts in <em>Rivera </em>had established that an employee drove a state truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>to a point on an interstate highway to assist in the cleanup of a fatal accident. Id., 620. The employee parked the truck partly in the travel lane and partly on the left shoulder of the highway approximately 500 feet from the accident site. Id. The employee then exited the vehicle, leaving the truck\u2019s engine running, its strobe lights and four way flashers on and flares on the road behind the vehicle. Id. The employee\u2019s \u201cpurpose [in so doing] was to alert oncoming drivers to the debris from the accident that was obstructing the highway.\u201d Id. Approximately two hours later, while the truck was still parked in the same location, the vehicle of the plaintiffs decedent collided with the truck and the decedent was killed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Appellate Court examined the phrase \u201cwhen operating a motor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 52-556, and concluded that it \u201cimplies a simultaneousness of negligent operation and injury, because \u2018when\u2019 denotes the time or exact moment at which something is done.\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 622. Moreover, after examining other cases that had interpreted the term \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle within the context of other statutes, the Appellate Court held that \u201c[t]he general rule established by these cases and others in the context of various statutes is that operation of a motor vehicle occurs when there is a setting in motion of the operative machinery of the vehicle, or there is movement of the vehicle, or there is a circumstance resulting from that movement or an activity incident to the movement of the vehicle from one place to another.\u201d Id., 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In <em>Rivera, </em>both parties had agreed that the truck was being used as a warning signal, and not as a motor vehicle. Id. On the basis of those facts, the Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he truck was not parked incident to travel. It was placed on the highway, not because that was a convenient or an ordinarily appropriate place to park, but because its placement would alert drivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to the danger ahead.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court therefore affirmed the judgment of the trial court in <em>Rivera </em>granting summary judgment in favor of the state on the ground that the vehicle was not being operated for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Appellate Court addressed this issue again in the first appeal in the present case, <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 535. In that appeal, the plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the claims against the defendant prior to trial based on the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. Because the plaintiff appealed from a dismissal of the case prior to trial, the Appellate Court relied primarily on Zucco\u2019s deposition testimony in determining what the evidence at trial might be. Id., 541. The deposition testimony established that: \u201cZueco was operating the truck on a designated route during which time he looked for highway maintenance problems. At a place close to the point of the collision, he saw water washing out of a driveway. He parked the truck next to the driveway because he was concerned that the water would freeze on the roadway. Zueco left the truck\u2019s motor running and exited the vehicle. He did not place any flares, cones or flags about the vehicle, although the strobe lights were operating. He had . . . positioned the truck in a manner to protect himself while he dug a ditch on the shoulder of the road. When he finished digging the ditch, he set about to get back into the truck.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On the basis of that deposition testimony, the Appellate Court concluded that, \u201c[t]he truck that Zueco was operating on the date of the accident was the means of locomotion he used to follow a designated route of state highway to correct maintenance problems he discovered. When he came upon the water running onto the roadway in Salisbury, he parked the truck with its motor running adjacent to the driveway so that he could exit the truck to perform the required maintenance. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>this set of facts, we conclude, as a matter of law, that Zueco was operating the truck within the meaning of \u00a7 52-556. He had parked the truck as an activity incident to moving it from one place to another along his designated maintenance route to fulfill his responsibilities for the department. There was, consequently, a temporal congruence between the operation of the truck and the plaintiffs injury.\u201d Id., 541-42. The Appellate Court thus concluded that the trial court improperly had granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and remanded the case for further proceedings. Id., 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">At trial after the remand in the present case, the defendant requested instructions relating to the use of the truck as a warning device and a protective barrier. The trial court denied the state\u2019s request, however, and instructed the jury as follows. \u201cThe plaintiff seeks to hold the [defendant] responsible for the negligence of [Zueco], She seeks to do that based upon [\u00a7 52-556], which makes the [defendant] responsible for personal injuries caused by the negligence of any state employee when operating a motor vehicle owned by the [defendant], The [department] has admitted that [Zueco] was an employee of the [department] and has stipulated that the parked dump truck was owned by the [defendant]. It is the law that if [Zueco] had parked the state truck as an activity incident to moving it from one place to another along his designated maintenance route to fulfill his responsibilities, he was operating the truck as that word is used in \u00a7 52-556, even though the truck was parked and he was outside of it at the time of the accident. In that case the [defendant] is liable for any negligence of [Zueco].\u201d The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction was improper because it failed to explain, consistent with <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624, that if, at the time of the plaintiffs injuries, the truck was being used as a warning device <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>or a protective barrier, it was not being \u201coperated\u201d under \u00a7 52-556. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The trial court\u2019s instruction properly explained that if the truck was parked incident to travel for road maintenance, Zueco was operating the truck for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. This explanation is consistent with both <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624, and <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 536-38. The trial court\u2019s instruction, however, was incomplete. The instruction failed to instruct the jury that it also should consider whether the truck was being used as a warning device or as a protective barrier, and, if the jury found that it was, it must find for the defendant because the truck was not being \u201coperated\u201d under \u00a7 52-556. The trial court\u2019s instruction, therefore, did not provide the jury with proper guidance and a clear understanding of the issues that it was to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u201cThis does not end our inquiry, however. We have repeatedly recognized that [i]t is axiomatic . . . that not every error is harmful. . . . [W]e have often stated that before a party is entitled to a new trial ... he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. ... An instructional impropriety is harmful if it is likely that it affected the verdict. ... In determining whether an instructional impropriety was harmless, we consider not only the nature of the error, including its natural and probable effect on a party\u2019s ability to place his full case before the jury, but the likelihood of actual prejudice as reflected in the individual trial record, taking into account (1) the state of the evidence, (2) the effect of other instructions, (3) the effect of counsel\u2019s arguments, and (4) any indications by the jury itself that it was misled.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith v. Greenwich, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">At the trial in this matter, the defendant presented evidence regarding Zucco\u2019s use of the truck as a warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>device or protective barrier. Specifically, Zueco testified that he had parked the truck in the manner that he did so as to protect himself and to warn drivers of unsafe roadway conditions caused by the water. The plaintiff introduced evidence regarding whether Zueco had parked the truck incident to travel, namely, that he drove the truck along his regular maintenance route and parked it for approximately four minutes while he addressed a maintenance issue along the roadway. The jury, however, was not instructed that it must make a finding as to whether the truck was being used as a warning device or a protective barrier, or whether it was parked incident to travel for road maintenance. In the absence of a complete instruction on the key issue of the state\u2019s liability, we must conclude that the case was not fairly presented to the jury and it is likely that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the trial court\u2019s instruction properly presented the case to the jury because the instruction was consistent with <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Manetta, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 535. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Allison </em>required the trial court to instruct the jury as it had done. We disagree. The Appellate Court did state that, <em>\u201c[o]n this set of facts, </em>we conclude, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that Zucco was operating the truck within the meaning of \u00a7 52-556.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 541-42. That conclusion, however, was based on Zucco\u2019s pretrial deposition testimony, not on evidence presented at trial. The trial court therefore was not bound by the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[Zucco] had parked the truck as an activity incident to moving it from one place to another along his designated maintenance route to fulfill his responsibilities for the department.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 542. It was for the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>to decide after considering all the evidence whether the truck was being used as a warning device or a protective barrier or whether it was parked incident to travel for road maintenance purposes. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Because of our conclusion that this case must be retried, it is appropriate for us to give guidance on issues that are likely to recur upon retrial. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>249 Conn. 809, 830, 734 A.2d 964 (1999) (\u201c[b]ecause of our conclusion that the plaintiff has established her right to a retrial on all [her claims] . . . it is proper for us to give guidance on issues that are likely to recur on retrial\u201d). Thus, we will address the defendant\u2019s next claim that the trial court improperly denied its request to charge the jury that, under \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a state truck being used for mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>nance purposes and displaying flashing lights is permitted to stop on a highway. The plaintiff responds that the trial court correctly denied the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the jury instruction requested by the defendant was a misstatement of the law and was not relevant because, although \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290 exempt certain operators of equipment from prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 14-251, such exemption does not demonstrate that Zucco\u2019s actions in parking the truck on the highway were not negligent. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The standard of review pertaining to claims of improper jury instructions is set forth in part I of this opinion. Section 14-251 prohibits, inter alia, vehicles from parking on highways and makes violation of that statute an infraction. Section 14-290 exempts maintenance vehicles displaying flashing lights from the prohibitions of \u00a7 14-251. In the present case, the plaintiff alleged in her complaint that Zueco negligently had parked the truck, that Zucco\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries, and that the defendant is liable for her injuries pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. She did not allege that Zueco violated \u00a7 14-251; Zueco was not charged with a violation of \u00a7 14-251; and there was no evidence presented at trial regarding whether Zueco had violated \u00a7 14-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The defendant asserts that the trial court improperly denied its request for an instruction under \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290 because these statutes establish that parking the truck on the roadway does not, in and of itself, constitute negligence on the part of a state employee engaged in road maintenance. It is well established, however, that \u201c[w]hile violation of a statute is negligence, compliance with a statute is not necessarily due care . . . .\u201d D. Wright, J. Fitzgerald &amp; W. Ankerman, Connecticut Law of Torts (3d Ed. 1991) \u00a7 38, p. 73; W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 36, p. 233. Indeed, in a similar case, this court concluded that \u201c[w]hile parking in violation of [what is now \u00a7 14-251] would constitute negligence, it does not follow that the statute authorizes the parking of a vehicle upon the traveled portion of the highway without other precautions than those expressly required by statute.\u201d <em>Caviote </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>116 Conn. 569, 574, 165 A. 788 (1933). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court need not instruct the jury regarding \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290 because those provisions do not address the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion to direct a verdict or to set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff failed to present any expert evidence regarding the applicable standard of care. The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence under \u00a7 52-556 because she failed to produce any expert testimony regarding the appropriate standard of care to be exercised when parking a truck along the road to perform maintenance tasks. In response, the plaintiff asserts that such expert testimony was not necessary and would have been inadmissible, because the question of whether Zueco had deviated from the standard of care when he obstructed the roadway did not go beyond the knowledge and experience of the jurors who were the fact finders in the present case. Moreover, the plaintiff claims that the jurors heard the relevant and necessary evidence regarding the reasonableness of Zucco\u2019s conduct from other witnesses. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We begin with the standard of review by which we evaluate this claim. \u201cThe standard of review governing our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>aside the verdict is well settled. The trial court possesses inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court\u2019s opinion, is against the law or the evidence. . . . [The trial court] should not set aside a verdict where it is apparent that there was some evidence upon which the jury might reasonably reach their conclusion, and should not refuse to set it aside where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles ....

Indeed, in <em>Marquardt &amp; Roche/Meditz &amp; Hackett, Inc. </em>v. <em>Riverbend Executive Center, Inc., </em>74 Conn. App. 412, 426, 812 A.2d 175 (2003), the Appellate Court concluded that expert testimony was not required to demonstrate the difficulty of backing a vehicle out of a parking space, noting instead that that question \u201cis one which our legislature expects all operators of motor vehicles to consider on a regular basis when using public streets.\u201d Id., 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We conclude that the factual issues raised in the present case involved a commonplace activity with which most jurors are familiar, namely, the parking of a motor vehicle on a public roadside. Moreover, the jurors heard significant testimony from Richard Binkowski, a state trooper and accident reconstructionist who had investigated the accident; Michael Cei, an accredited accident reconstructionist; and Manetta, the driver of the tractor trailer that had struck the plaintiff and a former supervisor with the New York department of transportation. Binkowski and Cei both testified about their opinion regarding the cause of the accident, including the role that the placement of the truck played <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>in the accident. Binkowski, Cei and Manetta all testified that there was adequate room for Zueco to have parked the truck without blocking the roadway. The defendant\u2019s expert witness on reconstruction, Stephen Benanti, also confirmed that there was adequate space for Zueco to have parked the truck so as not to block the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In addition, several photographs of the accident scene were admitted into evidence at trial. These photographs depicted the roadway, including the space available on the shoulder of the roadway, and the curves in the roadway. The photographs also depicted the placement of the truck on the roadway, the road conditions at the time of the accident and the general accident scene. In addition to the testimony of Benanti, Cei, and Manetta, these photographs were available for the examination of the jury to assist them in applying their own knowledge to determine whether Zueco had parked the truck negligently. See <em>Bader </em>v. <em>United Orthodox Synagogue, </em>148 Conn. 449, 454, 172 A.2d 192 (1961) (\u201c[p]hotographs . . . were admitted in evidence and available for the examination of the [jurors], who, by the application of their own knowledge and under proper instructions from the court, could determine without the aid of any expert whether the conduct of the defendant constituted . . . negligence\u201d). After considering the evidence adduced at trial, in light of the issues that the jury was asked to decide, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant or to set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff failed to present any expert testimony regarding the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> The plaintiff also named Michael T.

Whether Zucco was operating the truck within the meaning of \u00a7 52-556 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the time of the accident was a factual question for the jury to determine after trial and proper instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> Our resolution of this issue also is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly failed to direct a verdict for the defendant or to set aside the verdict because the evidence demonstrated, as a matter of law, that Zueco was not operating the truck within the meaning of \u00a7 52-556 at the time of the accident. The defendant claims that the evidence in the present case established that the truck was being used as a warning signal, and that, under <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 624, when a vehicle is being used as a warning device or a protective barrier, it is not being operated for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. As we have explained previously herein, however, there was conflicting evidence at trial regarding whether the truck was being used as a warning device or a protective barrier, or whether the truck was parked incident to travel while Zueco performed his maintenance duties. It was, therefore, a question of fact for the jury to determine whether the truck was being \u201coperated\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-556. We have repeatedly acknowledged that \u201cit is the jury\u2019s role as the sole trier of the facts to weigh the conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>274 Conn. 790, 802, 877 A.2d 739 (2005). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly fail to direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiff or to set aside the verdict under <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>supra, 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> See footnotes 4 and 5 of this opinion for the text of \u00a7\u00a7 14-251 and 14-290.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> The defendant, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 16-37, moved for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case-in-chief and at the close of the evidence.
