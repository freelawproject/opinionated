Sup. 476, 486, 939 A.2d 641 (2006). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The state of Connecticut owns and operates Brainard Airport. On December 19, 2003, Connecticut Hangars, LLC (Connecticut Hangars) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13b-42 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with the state department of transportation concerning a parcel of land within the airport, measuring approximately 315,885 square feet, for the construction, maintenance and management of hangars. The term of the lease is for thirty years with an option to extend for two additional five year periods. The lease provides for Connecticut Hangars, as lessee, to build and develop six hangars for the storage of aircraft and aircraft equipment through a common interest community and to sell units in the community as leasehold condominium units. The lease further provides that title to all materials purchased for the construction of the facility, as well as all real property, including but not limited to improvements constructed or installed, shall vest in the state and that Connecticut Hangars shall have \u201cno property rights therein or in the Facilities except the right to occupy and use the Leased Premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On May 24, 2004, Connecticut Hangars executed a condominium declaration creating a leasehold common interest community, pursuant to the Common Interest Ownership Act, General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., known as Connecticut T-Hangar Condominium (condominium), a leasehold condominium. The declaration provides that the real property of the condominium is subject to the lease from the state, the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>which will terminate the common interest community, and that the declaration is subject to and subordinate to the terms and conditions of the lease. All condominium units are restricted to use as airplane hangars for the storage of aircraft and related equipment, and the use of the units and the common elements is subject to the bylaws and rules of the association. The declaration also sets forth certain restrictions on use, alienation and occupancy, including a right of first refusal retained by Connecticut Hangars as the declarant. Finally, pursuant to the declaration, there is no separation of a unit and its leasehold interest, and the lease controls any conflict between the declaration and the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Subsequent to the creation of the common interest community, Connecticut Hangars conveyed to each plaintiff, by various warranty deeds, unit ownership of designated hangar units of the leasehold condominium, with prices ranging from approximately $48,000 to $60,000. The deeds conveyed a partial assignment of Connecticut Hangar\u2019s interest in the lease agreement between the state as landlord and Connecticut Hangars as tenant, including an undivided interest in the unit\u2019s share percentage of the common elements. Each warranty deed further set forth the specific obligation of the grantee to convey the unit and its appurtenant interest in the condominium to the grantor free and clear of all encumbrances except those set forth in the declaration within thirty days prior to the end of the lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">On or about June, 2005, the defendant imposed a tax on the property of the plaintiffs purporting to assess real property taxes on the various condominium hangar units located at Brainard Airport for the 2004 grand list. Pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, the plaintiffs commenced the present action seeking relief from what they claimed was an improper assessment based on the exception provided under \u00a7 12-64 (c) (1) for \u201cland . . . belonging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>to or held in trust for the state of Connecticut at . . . any . . . state-owned airport . . . .\u201d The defendant responded by denying that the assessments were improper and filing a counterclaim, essentially asserting that \u00a7 12-64 (c) is inapplicable because each plaintiff owns a taxable property right by virtue of having received warranty deeds to their individual hangars at the airport. The plaintiffs and the defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment, each conceding that there were no issues of material fact and each claiming entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs following its granting of their motion for summary judgment and its denial of the defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">After having examined the record and the briefs and having considered the arguments of the parties, we are persuaded that the summary judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiffs should be affirmed. The central issue of the applicability of the exemption from municipal property tax to the plaintiffs\u2019 ownership interest in the leasehold interest under \u00a7 12-64 (c) properly was resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on that issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion set forth therein.
