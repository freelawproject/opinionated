The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) consolidated two separate cases against him for trial and instructed the jury that the evidence in each case was cross admissible to establish \u201c \u2018a characteristic method in the commission of criminal acts\u2019 (2) denied the defendant\u2019s request to waive his presence at the probable cause hearing; (3) admitted a postmortem report at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing in violation of the confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions; (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress certain eyewitness identifications; and (5) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and motion for a new trial because the state, without prior notice to the defendant, elicited in-court identifications from two eyewitnesses who previously had not identified the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes. Additionally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly introduced facts not in evidence during his closing argument, thereby depriving the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and, therefore, reverse the judgments of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In connection with two separate incidents, the defendant was charged in two informations. In the first information, the defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a) (4). In the second information, the defendant was charged with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). The first information pertained to an armed robbery that had occurred on December 17, 2001, at a Burger King restaurant located at 914 New Britain Avenue in the city of Hartford (Burger King case). The second information pertained to an armed robbery that had occurred on March 23, 2002, at Empire Pizza, a restaurant located at 861 New Britain Avenue in the city of Hartford (Empire Pizza case). The trial court consolidated the two cases against the defendant for trial, and the jury found the defendant guilty of all charges. Thereafter, the defendant moved for a new trial, claiming, in part, that the trial court improperly had consolidated the two cases against him for trial. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgments of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts regarding the first information. On December 17, 2001, at approximately 6:30 p.m., two masked and armed men dressed in dark clothing entered a Burger King restaurant located at 914 New Britain Avenue in Hartford. The first gunman, whom witnesses described as short, heavyset and Hispanic, guarded the door to the restaurant while the second gunman, whom witnesses described as short, slender and African-American, jumped behind the counter and instructed the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ees to empty the contents of the cash registers into a black backpack. After the cash registers had been emptied, the African-American gunman ordered the assistant manager of the restaurant, Julissa Chaparro, to \u201ctake [him] to the safe.\u201d Chaparro led the gunman to the manager\u2019s office where the safe was located and emptied the contents of the safe as instructed. As she did so, the gunman repeatedly apologized and said, \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to do this to you.\u201d Once the safe was empty, both gunmen fled the restaurant and Chaparro contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Thereafter, Daniel Goicochea, a patrol officer with the Hartford police department, received a dispatch informing him of the robbery. He recalled that a vehicle suspected to have been involved in multiple robberies in the surrounding area had been missing from its typical location on Grafton Street earlier in the evening. Goicochea drove in the direction of Grafton Street to determine whether the vehicle had returned. On his way to Grafton Street, Goicochea spotted the vehicle driving in front of him and began to follow it. The driver of the vehicle parked in front of a residence located at 66 Grafton Street and two men matching the descriptions of the perpetrators of the Burger King robbeiy exited the vehicle. Goicochea instructed the two men to stop and, in response, they immediately fled north on Grafton Street. Goicochea pursued the two men and successfully apprehended Eliseo Bennett, who matched the description of the short, heavyset, Hispanic gunman. Bennett, who had an air pistol in his possession, was arrested and charged with robbery in the second degree in connection with the Burger King robbery. Bennett subsequently confessed to his participation in the robbery and informed the police that the defendant, also known as \u201cP.O.,\u201d was the other gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts regarding the second information. On March 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>2002, at approximately 9:30 p.m., a lone masked gunman dressed in dark clothing entered the Empire Pizza restaurant located at 861 New Britain Avenue in Hartford. The gunman went behind the counter and repeatedly ordered the co-owner of the restaurant, Antonios Antonaras, to \u201cgive [him] the money.\u201d Antonios Antonaras opened the cash register, and told the gunman to \u201c[t]ake the money and go.\u201d As the gunman was emptying the cash register, Victor Arce, an employee of Empire Pizza, attempted to subdue him physically. A struggle ensued, and the gunman shot Arce in the chest and abdomen, wounding him fatally. The gunman then fled on foot while Tammy Antonaras (Antonaras), the co-owner of the restaurant, and Wanda Carrasquillo, an eyewitness who was situated outside of the restaurant, each contacted the police. Antonaras, who had made eye contact with the gunman briefly during the robbery, described him as African-American, between five feet, two inches tall and five feet, five inches tall, and weighing about 150 or 160 pounds. Carrasquillo, who had seen the gunman flee the restaurant, described him as African-American, approximately five feet, three inches tall and weighing about 130 pounds. Both Antonaras and Carrasquillo later identified the defendant as the gunman. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CONSOLIDATED THE BURGER KING AND EMPIRE PIZZA CASES FOR TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The defendant first claims that he was substantially prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s consolidation of the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases for trial because the jury improperly was permitted to consider the evidence adduced in each case while deliberating on the defendant\u2019s guilt in the other if it found that the evidence established \u201c \u2018a characteristic method in the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>sion of criminal acts.\u2019 \u201d The state responds that the trial court properly permitted the jury to consider the evidence in both the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases cumulatively if it found that the evidence established a common scheme or plan, but, even if it did not, the evidentiary impropriety was harmless. We agree with the defendant and, therefore, reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to sever, and the state moved to consolidate, the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases for trial. At the hearing on the parties\u2019 motions, the state claimed that, if the cases were to be tried separately, evidence in one case would be admissible in the trial of the other to establish that the defendant had a common scheme or plan to rob fast-food restaurants located on New Britain Avenue. The state therefore claimed that separate trials would afford the defendant no significant benefit, and that consolidation was appropriate. Alternatively, the state claimed that consolidation was appropriate under <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 722-24, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987), because the two cases involved discrete and easily distinguishable factual scenarios. The defendant responded that the evidence in the two cases lacked sufficient similarity to be cross admissible under the common scheme or plan exception, and that it would be prejudicial to consolidate the two cases for trial in light of the violent manner in which the Empire Pizza robbery had been committed. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for consolidation and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In its final charge to the jury, the trial court issued the following relevant instruction: \u201cNow, while you must separately consider each charge, you may, as you deliberate on the two separate charges, consider the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>dence of the one charge in the case of the other for the sole purpose, if you find that it is credible to do so, as to whether or not it establishes a characteristic method in the commission of criminal acts. You may not consider such evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate a criminal propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u201cYou may consider the evidence of one case in the other case solely for the purpose of whether or not it establishes a characteristic method in the commission of criminal acts and you may only do that if you believe the evidence and, further, find it logically, rationally, and conclusively supporting the issue for which it is being offered, but only, as I said, as it may bear on the issue of a characteristic method of criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, if you do not believe such evidence or, even if you do, if you find that it does not logically, rationally, and conclusively support the issues for which it is being offered, then you may not consider the testimony in the other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u201cYou may not, just because you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime charged in one case, use that conclusion to find that the defendant is a bad person; and, therefore, more likely to have committed the crime charged in the other case. That you may not do.\u201d At the conclusion of the trial court\u2019s charge, the defendant took exception to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The principles that govern our review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for joinder or a motion for severance are well established. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-57 provides: Whenever two or more cases are pending at the same time against the same party in the same court for offenses of the same character, counts for such offenses may be joined in one information unless the court orders otherwise. See also Practice Book \u00a7 41-19 ([t]he judicial authority may, upon its own motion or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>motion of any party, order that two or more informations, whether against the same defendant or different defendants, be tried together). In deciding whether to sever informations joined for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb. . . . The defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that the denial of severance resulted in substantial injustice, and that any resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cWhere evidence of one incident can be admitted at the trial of the other, separate trials would provide the defendant no significant benefit. It is clear that, under such circumstances, the defendant would not ordinarily be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the offenses for a single trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cSubstantial prejudice does not necessarily result from a denial of severance even where evidence of one offense would not have been admissible at a separate trial involving the second offense. . . . Consolidation under such circumstances, however, may expose the defendant to potential prejudice for three reasons: First, when several charges have been made against the defendant, the jury may consider that a person charged with doing so many things is a bad [person] who must have done something, and may cumulate evidence against him .... Second, the jury may have used the evidence of one case to convict the defendant in another case even though that evidence would have been inadmissible at a separate trial. . . . [Third] joinder of cases that are factually similar but legally unconnected . . . presents] the . . . danger that a defendant will be subjected to the omnipresent risk . . . that although so much [of the evidence] as would be admissible upon any one of the charges might not [persuade the jury] of the accused\u2019s guilt, the sum of it will convince them as to all. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cDespite the existence of these risks, this court consistently has recognized a clear presumption in favor of joinder and against severance . . . and, therefore, absent an abuse of discretion . . . will not second, guess the considered judgment of the trial court as to the joinder or severance of two or more charges.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 519-21, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u201cThe court\u2019s discretion regarding joinder, however, is not unlimited; rather, that discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Consequently, we have identified several factors that a trial court should consider in deciding whether a severance may be necessary to avoid undue prejudice resulting from consolidation of multiple charges for trial. These factors include: (1) whether the charges involve discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes were of a violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant\u2019s part; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial. ... If any or all of these factors are present, a reviewing court must decide whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>270 Conn. 337, 375, 852 A.2d 676 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 722-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Admission of Evidence of Uncharged Misconduct to Establish Common Scheme or Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly consolidated the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases for trial because it improperly concluded that the evidence in each case was admissible in the trial of the other to establish a common scheme or plan. As previously explained, if evidence of a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>dant\u2019s uncharged misconduct is cross admissible to establish a common scheme or plan, then separate trials ordinarily would afford the defendant no significant benefit and the trial court\u2019s joinder of the offenses for a single trial will not result in substantial prejudice. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 527 (trial court properly consolidated cases because \u201cif the cases . . . had been tried separately, evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with each victim would have been admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 464, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988) (\u201c[t]he trial court properly joined the two cases for trial because, in the event of separate trials, evidence relating to each of the cases would have been admissible in the other\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 68, 71-72, 530 A.2d 155 (1987) (trial court properly consolidated cases because evidence of defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct would have been admissible to prove identity).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we review our jurisprudence regarding the admissibility of evidence of uncharged misconduct. Such evidence generally is inadmissible, unless it falls within a well established evidentiary exception. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>acts of a person is admissible ... to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, common plan or scheme, absence of mistake or accident, knowledge, a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime, or to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. . . . On the other hand, evidence of crimes so connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime, is admissible. The rules of policy have no application whatever to evidence of any crime which directly tends to prove that the accused is guilty of the specific offense for which he is on trial. . . . We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence. First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. . . . Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 521-22; accord Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5. \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only whe[n] abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 661, 835 A.2d 895 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The standard by which the admissibility of evidence of uncharged misconduct is measured generally will depend on two factors: the purpose for which the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>dence is offered, and the type of crime with which the defendant has been charged. For example, when a defendant is charged with a sex crime and evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct is offered to establish that the defendant had a common scheme or plan to engage in sex crimes, the admissibility of the proffered evidence is evaluated pursuant to a liberal standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 332 n.1, 904 A.2d 101 (2006) (\u201cour holdings in sexual assault cases that prior sexual misconduct is viewed more liberally than other types of prior misconduct should not be disturbed\u201d). In cases that do not involve sex crimes, such as the present case, however, we apply a more stringent standard to determine whether evidence of uncharged misconduct is admissible to establish a common scheme or plan. An examination of our case law reveals that, although this court recently and repeatedly has addressed the liberal standard of admissibility applicable to sex crime cases; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 519-27; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 819-28, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 352-68; <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 388-402, 844 A.2d 810 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 656-65; <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 789-94, 785 A.2d 573 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 59-63, 644 A.2d 887 (1994); we have not had the opportunity to address the more stringent standard applicable to nonsex crime cases since <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>235 Conn. 402, 405, 665 A.2d 897 (1995) (per curiam) (affirming judgment of Appellate Court on basis of that court\u2019s \u201cthoughtful resolution of [the] issues\u201d), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 464-66, which was decided in 1988. A review of our case law further reveals that, although we have been consistent in our application of this stringent standard, we have been inconsistent in our articulation and explanation of the principles that guide our analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>7 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>App. 75, 83, 507 A.2d 1033 (1986) (\u201cthere is some discrepancy in the cases as to the factors governing the admissibility determination when evidence of prior misconduct is offered to prove a common scheme\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Accordingly, we take this opportunity to analyze carefully our jurisprudence concerning the admissibility of evidence of uncharged misconduct offered to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan in nonsex crime cases, and to clarify the principles that govern our review. We turn first to the general purpose and scope of the common scheme or plan exception. Evidence of uncharged misconduct, although inadmissible to prove a defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity to engage in criminal behavior, is admissible \u201c[t]o prove the existence of a larger plan, scheme, or conspiracy, of which the crime on trial is a part.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (6th Ed. 2006) \u00a7 190, pp. 754-55. To prove the existence of a common scheme or plan, each crime must be \u201can integral part of an overarching plan explicitly conceived and executed by the defendant or his confederates.\u201d Id., p. 755; see also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 4.19.9, p. 237 (\u201cThe exception for common plan or scheme admits evidence of conduct that forms part of an overall plan. This exception requires that the misconduct be connected to a \u2018common\u2019 plan or scheme and not be isolated or unconnected conduct of a similar nature.\u201d). Evidence of such a plan is relevant to the charged crime because it bears on the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive, and hence the doing of the criminal act, the identity of the actor, and his intention, where any of these is in dispute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 133-34, 486 A.2d 637 (1985), quoting C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 190, pp. 448-49; see also 1 E. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence (Rev. Ed. 1999) \u00a7 3:21, p. 114 (\u201c[p]roof that the defendant entertained a plan, including the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>charged crime, is logically relevant to show the defendant\u2019s identity as the criminal\u201d); 1 E. Imwinkelried, supra, p. 115 (proof that defendant entertained plan logically relevant to demonstrate that \u201c[t]he charged and uncharged crimes both are effects of the same cause, the plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In addition to these general principles, our analysis reveals the existence of two separate and distinct categories of cases in which we have applied the common scheme or plan exception. In the first category, which consists of what most accurately may be described as \u201ctrue\u201d common scheme or plan cases, the nature of the charged and uncharged crimes combined with connecting evidence, if any, gives rise to a permissive inference that an overall scheme or plan existed in the defendant\u2019s mind, and that the crimes were executed in furtherance of that plan. In the second category of cases, which consists of what most accurately may be described as \u201csignature\u201d cases, the charged and uncharged crimes appear to be separate and discrete criminal acts, but the method of commission exhibits the existence of a \u201cmodus operandi,\u201d \u201clogo,\u201d or \u201csignature,\u201d which, when considered in combination with other factors, such as the proximity of time and place of commission, gives rise to a permissive inference that the crimes were executed in furtherance of an overall common scheme or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In the first category, which is composed of \u201ctrue\u201d common scheme or plan cases, the nature of the uncharged misconduct and the charged crime, or the existence of connecting evidence, reveal \u201ca genuine connection between the crimes in the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1 E. Imwinkelried, supra, \u00a7 3:23, p. 124. As Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>fessor Edward J. Imwinkelried explains in his treatise entitled \u201cUncharged Misconduct Evidence\u201d: \u201cThe [uncharged] act can be probative of a true plan even when it is dissimilar to the charged crime. There need not be exact correspondence between all the crimes involved in the plan. The defendant\u2019s burglary of a pawn shop can be used to show the defendant\u2019s plan to obtain the weapons for a robbery. The defendant\u2019s theft of a car can be employed to show the defendant\u2019s plan to use the car as a getaway vehicle in a kidnapping or robbery. The defendant\u2019s theft of a uniform is evidence of the defendant\u2019s plan to masquerade as a guard in order to rob an armored car. The dissimilarity between the charged and uncharged crimes does not negate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>value of the uncharged crime as evidence of the existence of the plan including the charged crime.\u201d Id., \u00a7 3:22, p. 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 128, exemplifies the first category of cases. In <em>Shindell, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of arson in the second degree and two counts of conspiracy to commit arson in the second degree. Id., 129. \u201cThe four counts related to two fires, one on November 23, 1974, and the other on November 29, 1974, both of which occurred at BB-SS Ann Street in New Haven.\u201d Id. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial court admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct pertaining to the defendant\u2019s participation in other arsons, attempted arson, vandalism and filing of false insurance claims. Id., 133. Specifically, the trial court admitted evidence that the defendant had sold the Ann Street property, as well as five additional properties located in New Haven, in a single transaction to Peter Cappola, his coconspirator in the crimes charged. Id., 129-30. The defendant and Cappola entered into a sales agreement that contained a \u201c \u2018windfalls profit clause\u2019 \u201d that required them to share equally the insurance proceeds from the destruction of any of the buildings situated on the five properties. Id., 130. Upon realizing the extent to which the buildings were insured against vandalism, theft, fire and loss, the defendant and Cappola decided to destroy the buildings and recoup the insurance proceeds. From June through November, 1974, the defendant and Cappola, either personally or through their agents, intentionally vandalized and set fire to various properties, including 36-38 Ann Street, filed false insurance claims concerning those properties, and split the proceeds equally pursuant to the terms of the windfalls profit clause. Id., 130-33. Additionally, with respect to the remaining properties, the defendant and Cappola filed false insurance claims for vandalism, theft and loss of rents. Id., 132. The trial court admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the evidence of uncharged misconduct because it concluded that the evidence was \u201crelevant to the defendant\u2019s motive, intent and involvement in a common plan or scheme.\u201d Id., 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s admission of uncharged misconduct evidence \u201camounted to an impermissible attack on his character in violation of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\u201d Id., 133. We disagreed, concluding that the trial court properly had admitted the evidence because it \u201cwas relevant and material to show a larger continuing plan, scheme, or conspiracy, of which the present crime[s] on trial [were] apart.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 136. In arriving at this conclusion, we noted that, \u201c[a]ll the various properties involved were part of a single sales transaction, a package deal executed under a common sales agreement and subject to nearly identical mortgage terms. Insurance proceeds collected on losses to any of the buildings were divided pursuant to the same windfall profits arrangement. Each of the key participants in the various offenses played a role that remained constant throughout: the defendant advised Cappola, dealt directly with the appraiser, and filed and pressed the insurance claims; Cappola hired and instructed the actual perpetrators of the arsons and vandalism, set the scenes for the fires by strategically placing the gasoline in the buildings and signed the claims and letters prepared by the defendant. In addition, all the offenses occurred within less than a year, most within ... six months.\u201d Id., 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant claimed, however, that the evidence was inadmissible because it \u201clacked the requisite grade of similarity\u201d to the charged crimes. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 134. We rejected this claim, noting that \u201cthe defendant misconstrues the specific basis upon which the trial court admitted this evidence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>degree of similarity between the crime charged and the other crime is only at issue when the latter is an <em>unrelated incident which, because of certain particularly distinguishing features that it shares in common with the charged offense, is probative to show that the same individual committed both. </em>In such a case, the evidence is offered [t]o prove other like crimes by the accused so nearly identical in method as to earmark them as the handiwork of the accused. . . . [M]uch more is demanded [in cases involving unrelated incidents] than the mere repeated commission of crimes of the same class, such as repeated burglaries or thefts. <em>The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a </em>signature.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 134-35. Because the evidence of uncharged misconduct at issue in <em>Shindell, </em>did not consist of \u201cunrelated incidents that could only be connected to the charged crimes by showing a high degree of similarity in the modus operandi of their commission\u201d; id., 135; but, rather, exhibited a \u201csubstantial number of . . . [connecting] factors\u201d indicating the existence of a common scheme or plan to commit insurance fraud, we concluded that the admissibility of the evidence did not depend on the degree of similarity shared by the charged and uncharged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In the second category, which consists of signature cases, this court concluded that evidence of uncharged misconduct was admissible to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan because the factual characteristics shared by the charged and uncharged crimes were \u201csufficiently distinctive and unique as to be like a signature\u201d and, therefore, it logically could be inferred that \u201cif the defendant is guilty of one [crime] he must be guilty of the other.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 661, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987) (evidence of prior burglary and robbery admissible in defendant\u2019s felony murder trial to establish common scheme or plan because crimes were proximate in place and time, same perpetrators were involved, all victims were highly vulnerable, and excessive violence was used).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>199 Conn. 146, 506 A.2d 100 (1986), is illustrative of the second category of cases. In <em>Mandrell, </em>the defendant was charged in relevant part with robbery in the first degree and assault of a victim sixty years or older in the second degree. Id., 147. The charges arose out of an incident in which the defendant and an accomplice had robbed a liquor store located at 350 Asylum Avenue in Hartford. Id., 148. In the commission of the robbery, the defendant\u2019s accomplice threatened the clerk of the store with what the clerk believed to be a gun, forced the clerk to lay down on the floor in the back room, and bound and gagged him. Id. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>after, the defendant, who had attempted to open the cash register unsuccessfully, ordered his accomplice to unbind the clerk and return him to the front of the store. The defendant, gesticulating wildly and using profanity, forced the clerk to open the cash register. The clerk subsequently was escorted to the back room, where he was bound and struck in the head twice with a bottle. Id., 148-49. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the state sought to introduce testimony concerning a robbery that the defendant had committed five years prior to the crimes charged. The evidence established that the defendant and an unidentified accomplice previously had robbed a liquor store located at 280 Asylum Avenue in Hartford. Id., 150. During that robbeiy, the defendant had grabbed a customer by the neck, put a gun to the customer\u2019s head and assaulted the customer physically, while the defendant\u2019s accomplice forced the clerk to open the cash register. The defendant, while using profanity, then forced the customer and the clerk to lie down on the floor of the back room, where the defendant struck the clerk in the head twice with a bottle. Id., 150-51. The trial court admitted the evidence of uncharged misconduct to prove, inter alia, the existence of a common scheme or plan. Id., 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had admitted the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct. Id., 150. In addressing this claim, we noted that, \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes is relevant to identity, a common scheme, or an element of the crime presently charged, if the methods used are sufficiently unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the person who performed one misdeed also did the other. Much more is required than the fact that the offenses fall into the same class. The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>[187 Conn. 348, 354, 446 A.2d 382 (1982)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 151-52. With this standard in mind, we examined the factual similarities shared by the charged and uncharged crimes: \u201cboth robberies took place in liquor stores located close to each other on Asylum Street in Hartford and were committed by two black males. In each robbery the defendant was identified as using profanity and exhibiting aggressive, violent behavior, the store clerk was forced to lie down on the floor in the store\u2019s back room and the clerk was twice struck on the head with a liquor bottle.\u201d Id., 152. We also noted the dissimilarities between the charged and uncharged crimes: a gun was displayed openly in the uncharged robbery only; the two robberies were committed at different times of day and five years apart (although the defendant was incarcerated during much of this time period); bottles of different sizes were used to strike each clerk in the head. Id. Despite these dissimilarities, we concluded that the trial court properly had admitted the evidence of uncharged misconduct to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan because \u201cthe methods used in the two crimes were sufficiently similar and unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the defendant committed both crimes.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We never previously have articulated why we employ the \u201csignature test,\u201d which is probative of the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime charged, to ascertain the existence of a common scheme or plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Ibraimov, </em>supra, 187 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>354 (\u201cEvidence of other crimes or misconduct of an accused is admissible on the issue of <em>identity </em>where the methods used are sufficiently unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the person who performed one misdeed also did the other. Much more is required than the fact that the offenses fall into the same class. <em>The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signatures </em>[Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Accordingly, we take this opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The signature test ordinarily is used to determine whether evidence of uncharged misconduct is admissible under an evidentiary exception separate and distinct from the common scheme or plan exception, namely, the identity exception. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (b). Specifically, the test is used to discern whether evidence of uncharged misconduct is admissible to prove the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime charged. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Payne, 219 Conn. 93, 100, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991); <em>State </em>v. Sierra, 213 Conn. 422, 430, 568 A.2d 448 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The signature test is pertinent to the common scheme or plan inquiry, however, when the state seeks to establish the existence of an overall plan in the defendant\u2019s mind based <em>solely </em>on the similarities shared by the charged and uncharged crimes. This is because, when evidence of uncharged misconduct is sufficiently similar to the charged crime so as to rise to the level of a signature, modus operandi, or logo, it also is likely to exhibit \u201csuch a concurrence of common features . . . [as] naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which [the charged and uncharged crimes] are the individual manifestations.\u201d 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev. Ed. 1979) \u00a7 304, p. 249; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>supra, 7 Conn. App. 88 (\u201c[w]here evidence of prior misconduct is sufficiently similar to the facts and circumstances of the charged offense to be admissible for the propose of proving that the same individual committed both crimes, i.e., to be admissible under the identity exception, then there is some likelihood that the evidence is also relevant and admissible for the purpose of proving a common scheme or system of criminal activity\u201d). Stated another way, when the charged and uncharged crimes exhibit the same modus operandi, it is likely that both crimes had been committed in furtherance of an overall plan or scheme in the defendant\u2019s mind. It is the existence of this permissive inference that an overall plan existed that explains our use of the signature test in the second category of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>132 Conn. 370, 44 A.2d 708 (1945), is a paradigmatic example. In <em>Barnes, </em>four defendants were charged with conspiracy to steal fur coats from furriers located in Stamford and Norwalk. The evidence adduced at trial revealed that, on the night of October 11, 1944, the four defendants had entered two small fur stores and had stolen fur coats in a similar manner: one defendant distracted the proprietor of the store by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>requesting his assistance while two defendants blocked the proprietor\u2019s view and the fourth defendant concealed a fur coat on her person. Id., 371. At the defendants\u2019 trial, the trial court admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct relating to the defendants\u2019 subsequent attempt to steal a fur coat. The evidence revealed that, two hours after they had visited the Stamford and Norwalk stores, the defendants had visited a New Haven furrier, where the proprietor observed one of the defendants attempting to conceal a fur coat beneath her skirt. Id. The proprietor contacted the police, and the defendants subsequently were arrested. A search revealed that each of the defendants had \u201cthree or four large pins generally known as horse blanket pins\u201d; id., 372; that presumably had been used to pin the fur coats beneath the defendants\u2019 skirts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On appeal, the defendants conceded that the evidence of uncharged misconduct was admissible to prove identity, but maintained that it was inadmissible for any other purpose. Id. We rejected this claim, noting that evidence of uncharged misconduct is admissible to establish \u201ca common scheme embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We concluded that, because the charged and uncharged crimes \u201cmight almost be described as identical . . . [e]very requirement of the exception to the rule [had been] fully met.\u201d Id., 373. We therefore concluded that the trial court properly had admitted the evidence of uncharged misconduct to establish a common scheme or plan. In <em>Barnes, </em>the marked similarity of the modus operandi of the charged and uncharged crimes, coupled with proximity of time and place of commission, supported the inference that the defendants had an overall scheme or plan to steal fur coats, and that both the charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and uncharged crimes had been executed in furtherance of this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Although this permissive inference may arise in some, if not many cases, we caution that it will not arise in <em>all </em>cases. As the Washington Court of Appeals aptly observed, \u201c[something more than the doing of similar acts is required in evidencing design, as the object is not merely to negative an innocent intent, but to prove the existence of <em>a definite project </em>directed toward completion of the crime in question.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>36 Wash. App. 746, 751, 677 P.2d 202 (1984); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>313 Ill. App. 3d 491, 505, 729 N.E.2d 934 (2000) (\u201cIn determining whether multiple crimes have been committed as part of a common design, scheme, or plan, we find it far more sensible to focus on the defendant\u2019s state of mind or purpose in committing the offenses than on the factual similarities of the offenses. Our conclusion in this regard is supported by the fact that similarities between crimes is the focus for determining the admissibility of other-crimes evidence to establish the existence of modus operandi. In fact, we suspect that confusion between the concepts of common design, scheme, or plan, and modus operandi . . . has led to the line of cases on which the [s]tate relies.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); see also 29 Am. Jur. 2d 514-15, Evidence \u00a7 448 (1994) (\u201cSome courts consider the defendant\u2019s modus operandi as part of, or closely related to a scheme or plan. But more generally, the term modus operandi suggests that since the defendant acted in a similar and unusual or distinctive manner previously, it is more likely that he, rather than someone else, did the act on the occasion of the charged crime, so that the inference is from modus operandi to the identity of [the] defendant as the culprit.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Thus, when seeking to admit evidence pursuant to the common scheme or plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>exception, \u201cit is not enough to show mere similarity between the [charged and uncharged] crimes\u201d; 1 E. Imwinkelried, supra, \u00a7 3:23, p. 124; because \u201c[standing alone, a series of similar acts does not establish the existence of a true plan. A series of similar robberies could be the result of separate decisions to rob.\u201d Id., pp. 124-25. Accordingly, to establish the existence of a true plan in the defendant\u2019s mind based <em>solely </em>on the marked similarities shared by the charged and uncharged crimes, the state must produce sufficient evidence to: (1) establish the existence of a signature, modus operandi, or logo; <em>and </em>(2) support \u201ca permissive inference that both crimes were related to an overall goal in the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d Id., p. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We need not provide a laundry list of factors that support such a permissive inference. A review of our jurisprudence reveals, however, that one of the most decisive factors is the proximity of time and place of commission of the charged and uncharged crimes. Accordingly, when both the charged and uncharged crimes exhibit the existence of a signature, and were committed within the same limited geographic area and time period, a permissive inference ordinarily arises that the charged and uncharged crimes were the individual manifestations of a true plan in the defendant\u2019s mind. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 464-65 (crimes tried jointly committed in same vicinity of city, at similar time of day and within three days of each other); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 661 (charged and uncharged crimes committed \u201cin the same general neighborhood\u201d and six days apart); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 152 (charged and uncharged crimes committed on same street in Hartford and five years apart, but defendant was incarcerated during much of intervening period); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 680, 469 A.2d 760 (1983) (charged and uncharged crimes committed \u201cin adjoining towns and . . . within three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>weeks of each other\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 371-72 (charged and uncharged crimes occurred in nearby towns within hours of each other).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In sum, we conclude that evidence of uncharged misconduct is admissible in nonsex crime cases to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan only if it supports a \u201cpermissive inference that both crimes were related to an overall goal in the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d 1 E. Imwinkelried, supra, \u00a7 3.23, p. 125. Two distinct avenues exist by which the proponent of the uncharged misconduct evidence may seek to establish the existence of this permissive inference. First, the nature of the charged and uncharged crimes, combined with connecting evidence, if any, may give rise to an inference that a common scheme or plan existed. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 134-35. In this category of cases, the admissibility of the evidence does not depend on the degree of similarity shared by the charged and uncharged crimes, but, rather, on the extent to which it is probative of the existence of an overall plan in the defendant\u2019s mind. Id. Second, when the charged and uncharged crimes appear to be separate and discrete criminal acts, but the proponent of the evidence claims that a common scheme or plan may be inferred from the modus operandi of the crimes, the crimes must share sufficient marked similarities so as to rise to the level of a signature <em>and </em>must support a permissive inference that they were committed in furtherance of an overall scheme or plan. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 152; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 373. In nonsex crime cases, regardless of the avenue by which the evidence of uncharged misconduct is admitted, once admitted, it is relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s motive, intent and identity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 133-34. This is because the evidence necessarily gives rise to the inference that the defendant had an overall plan that encompassed the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of the charged and uncharged crimes and, therefore that the <em>defendant, </em>rather than <em>someone else, </em>committed the crime charged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn now to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. In the present case, the state did not adduce evidence revealing a direct connection between the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies. Compare id., 135. Likewise, the nature of the crimes, namely, armed robbery and felony murder, do not give rise to an inference that the charged and uncharged crimes necessarily were executed in furtherance of an overall scheme or plan. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 549, 461 A.2d 981 (1983) (defendant charged with larceny by false promise, element of which is to \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d and, therefore, common scheme or plan evidence was admissible). Rather, it is the modus operandi of the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies that, the state claims, indicates the existence of a plan in the defendant\u2019s mind. Accordingly, we must evaluate the similarities shared by the two crimes to determine whether they are sufficiently distinctive and unique as to rise to the level of a signature. If, and only if this standard is met, do we proceed to consider whether the similarities shared by the crimes also give rise to an inference that an overall common scheme or plan existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In evaluating the similarities shared by the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies, we note that the inference that the defendant committed both crimes \u201cdoes not arise . . . from the mere fact that the charged and uncharged offenses share certain marks of similarity, for it may be that the marks in question are of such common occurrence that they are shared not only by the charged crime and [the] defendant\u2019s prior offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>but also by numerous other crimes committed by persons other than [the] defendant. On the other hand, the inference need not depend upon one or more unique or nearly unique features common to the charged and uncharged offenses, for features of substantial but lesser distinctiveness, although insufficient to raise the inference if considered separately, may yield a distinctive combination if considered together.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 172, 471 A.2d 949 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Our review of the record in the present case reveals that the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies were executed in a dissimilar manner: the Burger King robbery occurred at 6:30 p.m. during the dinner rush hour when the restaurant was full of customers, whereas the Empire Pizza robbery occurred nearly three months later, at 9:30 p.m., when the restaurant was devoid of customers; the Burger King robbery was committed by two gunmen, whereas the Empire Pizza robbery was committed by a lone gunman; no one was injured during the course of the Burger King robbery, indeed, the primary gunman repeatedly apologized and said to the employees, \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to do this to you,\u201d whereas the gunman in the Empire Pizza robbery violently shot and killed one of the employees; and the gunmen in the Burger King robbery fled the scene by automobile, whereas the gunman in the Empire Pizza robbery fled the scene by foot.

Because the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies do not share any distinctive marks of similarity from which it logically may be inferred that the same person committed both crimes, the trial court improperly concluded that the evidence in each case was admissible in the other case to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The state nonetheless claims that the trial court properly admitted the evidence of uncharged misconduct because the defendant\u2019s <em>postcriminal conduct </em>in each case was unique and distinctive in that the defendant engaged in a pattern of self-defeating behavior whereby he implicated himself in each crime. In support of this claim, the state relies on the following additional facts that the jury reasonably could have found: (1) the defendant admitted to Evelyn Reyes, the owner of the Short Stop Grocery, which is located adjacent to Empire Pizza, that he had committed the Burger King robbery; (2) sometime after the Burger King robbery, the defendant tried to sell Reyes a black handgun; (3) sometime after the Empire Pizza robbery, the defendant purchased merchandise at the Short Stop Grocery with a $50 bill, which was highly unusual; (4) the defendant informed Michael Bogan, his cell mate in April, 2002, that, although he was not involved in the Empire Pizza robbery, the victim \u201cshouldn\u2019t [have] tried to stop it and that it wasn\u2019t his money anyway, and that . . . the killing was probably an accident, was most likely an accident\u201d; (5) the defendant informed Brian Foley, a detective with the Hartford police department, that he might or might not know information relevant to the Empire Pizza robbery; (6) when Foley, in an attempt to play a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game with the defendant informed him that the perpetrator of the Empire Pizza robbery had not worn a mask, the defendant responded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cAre you crazy? Do you think I would actually rob a place without wearing a mask?\u201d The state claims that \u201c[a]ll of the differences in the commission of the two robberies . . . lack legal significance in connection to the singular aspects of his modus operandi that involved continuously acting in a way that was self-defeating and ensured his apprehension as the perpetrator of the two robberies.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We acknowledge that there may be unique circumstances in which a defendant\u2019s posicriminai conduct gives rise to an inference that both the charged and uncharged crimes had been executed in furtherance of a common scheme or plan, but the facts of this case do not support such an inference. Although the evidence on which the state relies indicates that the defendant carelessly and recklessly implicated himself in the commission of the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies, it does not indicate that the defendant had an overall scheme or plan that encompassed the commission of both the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies. Simply stated, under the circumstances of the present case, the defendant\u2019s inculpatory postcriminal conduct simply is too slim an evidentiary reed upon which to admit evidence of uncharged misconduct under the common scheme or plan exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The defendant claims that, in light of the trial court\u2019s improper admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct in both the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases, the trial court improperly consolidated the two cases for trial under <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 722-24. The state responds that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary impropriety, if any, was harmless, and that its consolidation of the two cases was proper under the <em>Boscarino </em>standard. Because the defendant has pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>vided us with a fair assurance that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary impropriety substantially affected the verdicts in both the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">As previously explained, consolidation of factually similar but legally unrelated cases is appropriate and proper under circumstances in which the jury is capable of assessing the merits of each case fairly and independently in accordance with the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions. To determine whether the jury possesses such capability, the court must consider the following factors: (1) whether the crimes charged involve discrete and easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes charged involve brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant\u2019s part; (3) whether the trial was unduly lengthy or complex; and (4) if any of the first three factors are present, whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>256 Conn. 214, 218-20, 772 A.2d 571 (2001) (per curiam) (trial court properly consolidated cases for trial because crimes charged were discrete and easily distinguishable, did not involve brutal or shocking conduct, trial was not unduly lengthy or complex and jury properly was instructed to consider each case separately); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>243 Conn. 523, 533-37, 707 A.2d 1 (1998) (same); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 722-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We need not decide in the present appeal whether the trial court abused its discretion in consolidating the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases for trial under the <em>Boscarino </em>standard. This is because the <em>Boscarino </em>standard seeks to discern whether a jury that has been <em>properly instructed </em>to consider the evidence adduced in each case separately and independently has the capability to follow these instructions in light of the factual and legal complexity of the trial and the possibly preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>dicial nature of the evidence presented. Thus, under the circumstances of the present case, in which the jury was <em>improperly instructed </em>that it <em>could consider </em>the evidence adduced in the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases <em>collectively </em>if it found the evidence to establish \u201ca characteristic method in the commission of criminal acts,\u201d application of that standard would require us to assume a set of facts that does not exist. Accordingly, the fundamental predicate for application of the <em>Boscarino </em>standard is absent from the present case, and we express no opinion with respect to whether consolidation would be appropriate with properjury instructions under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">To determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the improper admission of common scheme or plan evidence in both the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases, we turn to well established evidentiary principles. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 352. As we recently have noted, \u201ca nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 357; see also id., 392-93 <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring) (\u201cThe \u2018more probable than not\u2019 standard suggests that if our appellate minds are in equipoise on the question of the harm caused by a trial error, the error is deemed to be harmless and the defendant has not carried his burden of establishing harm. ... I am persuaded that, if the defendant successfully brings our minds to that point of equipoise, then we do not have a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict, and the defendant should be granted a new trial. In other words, whether the error was serious enough to require a new trial should not, in my view, rest on such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>finely honed knife\u2019s edge.\u201d). \u201c[W]hether [the improper admission of evidence] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s' case, whether the testimony was cumulative . . . the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and . . . the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. . . . Because the present case involves the improper admission of uncharged misconduct evidence, the most relevant factors to be considered are the strength of the state\u2019s case and the impact of the improperly admitted evidence on the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We turn first to the strength of the state\u2019s cases. At the outset, we note that the primary issue in dispute at the defendant\u2019s trial was identity, namely, whether the defendant was the person who had committed the Burger King and Empire Pizza robberies. In the Burger King case, the state adduced the following relevant evidence with respect to the issue of identity: (1) the testimony of Eliseo Bennett, the defendant\u2019s coconspirator and accomplice in the Burger King robbery, identifying the defendant as the primary gunman; (2) the testimony of Julissa Chaparro, the assistant manager of Burger King, identifying the defendant as the primary gunman; and (3) the defendant\u2019s admission to Evelyn Reyes that he had committed the Burger King robbery. In light of the foregoing evidence, we conclude that, overall, the state\u2019s evidence in the Burger King case was strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">With respect to the Empire Pizza case, the state\u2019s identity evidence primarily consisted of: (1) the testimony of Reyes, the owner of the Short Stop Grocery, which is located adjacent to Empire Pizza, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defendant had been in her store shortly before the robbery; and (2) eyewitness identifications made for the first time at trial by Antonaras and Carrasquillo, both of whom were subjected to extensive cross-examination with respect to their opportunity to view the perpetrator of the robbery and the belated timing of their identifications. The defendant presented evidence in support of a third party culpability defense. Kenneth Robinson, a longtime friend of the defendant, testified that he was at Empire Pizza and the Short Stop Grocery shortly before the robbery and that, although he had not seen the defendant, he saw a person matching the description of the gunman: an African-American or Hispanic individual dressed in a black, hooded sweatshirt who was approximately five feet, six inches or five feet, five inches tall. In light of the lack of physical evidence connecting the defendant to the robbery, and the conflicting evidence with respect to the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime, we conclude that the state\u2019s evidence in the Empire Pizza case was not particularly strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">We next turn to the impact of the improperly admitted evidence on the trier of fact. That is, we must next determine the extent to which the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence in the Empire Pizza case impacted its verdict in the Burger King case and, conversely, the extent to which the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence in the Burger King case impacted its verdict in the Empire Pizza case. In doing so, we keep in mind that, \u201c[jjoinder gave the state the opportunity to present the jury with the intimate details of each of these offenses, an opportunity that would have been unavailable if the cases had been tried separately.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We begin with the Burger King case. Although the state\u2019s evidence in the Burger King case was strong, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>admission of the evidence relating to the Empire Pizza case was harmless. It is well established that, \u201c[a]ny improper evidence that may have a tendency to excite the passions, awaken the sympathy, or influence the judgment, of the jury, cannot be considered as harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 106. The evidence relating to the Empire Pizza case not only involved the commission of an armed robbery, but it also involved the commission of a felony murder during the course of that robbery. This evidence, which the jury explicitly was permitted to consider while deliberating on the defendant\u2019s guilt in the Burger King case, impermissibly suggested to the jury that the defendant had a bad character or a propensity to engage in criminal behavior and, further, that the defendant was a violent and dangerous individual. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 360-61 (\u201cuncharged misconduct evidence that portrayed the defendant as intimidating, hot-tempered, inclined to threaten other people and capable of using a knife to back up his threats was unduly prejudicial because it impermissibly suggested that the defendant had a bad character and a propensity for criminal behavior\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 106 (trial court\u2019s improper admission of evidence of attempt to commit second robbery was likely to excite passions of jurors and, therefore, was harmful); <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 32-33, 425 A.2d 560 (1979) (trial court\u2019s improper admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s gun collection was likely to excite passions of jurors and, therefore, was harmful). Because the trial court\u2019s improper admission of this evidence was likely to have excited the passions of the jurors, we conclude that it was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">With respect to the Empire Pizza case, as previously noted, the state\u2019s evidence linking the defendant to the crimes charged was not particularly strong. The trial court\u2019s improper admission of evidence revealing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>defendant\u2019s culpability in the Burger King robbery therefore impermissibly suggested to the jury that the defendant was \u201cpredisposed to commit the crimes charged\u201d and, as such, provided the jury with a prejudicial basis on which to base its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 106; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 367-68 (trial court\u2019s improper consolidation of multiple cases for trial and improper admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct in each case was not harmless); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 437 (improper admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct likely \u201cinfluenced the jury to believe that the defendants were violent persons predisposed to commit, in conjunction with one another, the alleged offenses for which they were on trial\u201d). Accordingly, the defendant has provided us with a fair assurance that the admission of this evidence substantially affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The trial court\u2019s improper instructions to the juiy concerning the cross admissibility of the evidence adduced in the Empire Pizza and Burger King cases further undermines our confidence in the verdicts. The trial court instructed the jurors that, although they \u201cmust separately consider each charge, you may, as you deliberate on the two separate charges, consider evidence of the one charge in the case of the other for the sole purpose, if you find that it is credible to do so, as to whether or not it establishes a <em>characteristic method in the commission of criminal acts.\u2019'' </em>(Emphasis added.) Not only did this instruction fail to inform the jury of the very purpose for which the evidence of uncharged misconduct had been admitted, namely, to establish the existence of a common scheme or plan in the defendant\u2019s mind, but it also misstated the evidentiary standard by which the existence of this plan must be proven. See part I A of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judgments of conviction in the Burger King and Empire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Pizza cases must be reversed. Upon remand, if the state again moves to consolidate the Burger King and Empire Pizza cases for trial, it is left to the considered judgment of the trial court to determine whether consolidation would be appropriate under <em>State </em>v. Boscarino, supra, 204 Conn. 722-24, in accordance with the principles articulated in the body of this opinion, including, of course, the precepts that the evidence in each case is not cross admissible to establish a common scheme or plan, and that an order of consolidation must be accompanied by adequate and proper jury instructions cautioning the jury to consider the evidence in each case separately and independently. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 521 (within discretion of trial court to consolidate or sever multiple cases for trial); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 723 (criminal defendant has \u201cright to the jury\u2019s fair and independent consideration of the evidence in each case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY DENIED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST TO WAIVE HIS PRESENCE AT THE PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his request to waive his presence at his probable cause hearing because the state had failed to proffer a legitimate reason to compel his presence. The state responds that it had proffered a legitimate reason to compel the defendant\u2019s presence, namely, to identify the defendant as the peipetrator of the crimes charged. Alternatively, if we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, the state claims that any impropriety was harmless. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s request to exclude himself from the probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. At the commencement of the probable cause hearing, the defendant moved to waive his presence in court during the testimony of any potential eyewitnesses. The defendant claimed that it would be prejudicial \u201cto allow an additional viewing when sometime down the road there\u2019s going to be most likely a trial in this matter where the issue of identification is going to be fairly highly contested.\u201d The state objected to the defendant\u2019s request, noting that, although the defendant \u201cenjoys [a right] to be present for the proceedings, there\u2019s no corresponding right for him to be absent.\u201d The state further claimed that the potential eyewitnesses previously had identified the defendant via a photographic array, and that alternate witnesses were not available to provide the crucial link \u201cbetween the person [depicted in] the photograph . . . and the defendant . . . .\u201d In response, the defendant offered \u201cto stipulate that the person [depicted] in the photograph is [the defendant] and that [he] was the person [previously] identified by the eyewitnesses.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court canvassed the defendant, and determined that his waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">At this point, the state claimed that the trial court should deny the defendant\u2019s request because the defendant\u2019s absence from the hearing would thwart \u201cany possible in-court identification\u201d and would \u201cthereby, postpone, perhaps by years, any opportunity for an in-court identification to occur. And, from the passage of time, alone, the state might be put at a disadvantage because of the [witnesses\u2019] memories or perhaps change in appearance of the defendant from this time to that.\u201d The defendant responded that an in-court identification was not germane to the probable cause proceedings and that the identity of the defendant adequately could be established through the proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>stipulation. The state claimed, however, that the issue of identity \u201cis germane now because the state has to prove, at this hearing, that there is probable cause that this defendant, that\u2019s sitting here today, committed these crimes to permit the prosecution to continue. And the fact that counsel is willing to stipulate to something does not remove that burden from the state.\u201d The trial court observed that \u201cthe state has the burden of proving identification in all cases. Even in cases in which the identification is not, actually, disputed . . . .\u201d The trial court, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 464, 619 A.2d 453 (1993), further noted that the defendant does not have a right \u201cto absent himself for tactical purposes.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It is well established that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his prosecution; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>271 Conn. 724, 732, 859 A.2d 898 (2004); including a probable cause hearing conducted pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8 (a), of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, and General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>399 U.S. 1, 9, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L.

A criminal defendant does not, however, have a concomitant right to be absent from such proceedings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 464-66 (defendant did not have constitutional right to be absent from hearing on motion to suppress eyewitness identifications). \u201cIndeed, federal courts have held that a trial court, pursuant to rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has the right and the obligation to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the defendant\u2019s presence at all stages of a trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cannatella, 597 </em>F.2d 27 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. Moore, 466 F.2d 547, 548 (3d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1111, 93 S. Ct. 920, 34 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1973) (rule 43 does not vest a right of absence in a defendant; fifth amendment right against self-incrimination is not violated by compelling the defendant\u2019s presence).\u201d <em>State </em>v. Reddick, supra, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We therefore review the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to exclude himself from the probable cause hearing for abuse of discretion. See id., 467 (reviewing trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to exclude himself from suppression hearing under abuse of discretion standard); see also Practice Book \u00a7 44-10.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 467. Additionally, \u201c[t]he propriety of the court\u2019s action on the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude must be gauged at the time it made its ruling.\u201d Id., 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cThe probable cause hearing is designed to safeguard an accused\u2019s rights by requiring the state to demonstrate, at an early stage of the prosecution, that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is sufficient to warrant a prosecution in connection with the particular charge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 27, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). The burden is on the state to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>sufficient evidence to \u201cwarrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the [defendant has] committed the crime[s] with which he [is] charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 598, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). In light of this burden, we previously have concluded that the state is \u201centitled to elicit [eyewitness] testimony on the issue of identification through the usual mode of putting [the eyewitness] on the witness stand and asking him to identify his assailant if his assailant was present in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 729, 595 A.2d 322 (1991); cf. General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b) (\u201c[n]o motion to suppress or for discovery shall be allowed in connection with such hearing\u201d). Accordingly, the state proffered a legitimate reason to compel the defendant\u2019s presence at the hearing, namely, to establish the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged through an in-court identification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendant claims, however, that the state adequately could have established the element of identity through the proffered stipulation coupled with the testimony of eyewitnesses who previously had identified the defendant via a photographic array and, therefore, an in-court identification was unnecessary and no legitimate reason existed to compel the defendant\u2019s presence at the hearing. We disagree. Although a prior out-of-court identification, standing alone, likely would have been sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crimes charged, the state legitimately sought to introduce additional evidence of identity to bolster the strength of its case. Accordingly, a legitimate governmental reason existed to compel the defendant\u2019s presence, and the trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The defendant claims, however, that the trial court improperly denied his request because an in-court eye-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>witness identification inherently is suggestive. See <em>State </em>v. Tatum, supra, 219 Conn. 727-32 (concluding that in-court identification procedure inherently is suggestive, but not unnecessarily or impermissibly so). Our thorough review of the record reveals, however, that the defendant did not raise this claim before the trial court, nor did he request less suggestive in-court identification procedures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that this claim is not preserved for our review. See <em>West Farms Mall, LLC </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>279 Conn. 1, 28, 901 A.2d 649 (2006) (\u201c[t]o review [a] claim, which has been articulated for the first time on appeal and not before the trial court, would result in a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 82, 848 A.2d 395 (2004) (\u201cWe have stated repeatedly that we ordinarily will not review an issue that has not been properly raised before the trial court. . . .

Ed. 2d 177 (2004).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The state responds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>that <em>Crawford </em>is inapplicable to pretrial hearings, but, even if the postmortem report improperly was admitted, the impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because ample evidence existed to support the trial court\u2019s probable cause determination. Because we conclude that the admission of the report was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not determine whether <em>Crawford </em>applies to a probable cause hearing, or whether the postmortem report is testimonial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing, the following relevant evidence was admitted into evidence with respect to the charge of felony murder. Antonios Antonaras testified that, during the course of the Empire Pizza robbery, the victim attempted to subdue the gunman physically. A struggle ensued, during which the gunman shot the victim twice. The gunman immediately fled the restaurant, and the victim collapsed to the floor. Dana Peterson, a police officer with the Hartford police department, testified that she arrived at Empire Pizza soon after the shooting had occurred, and that she found the victim \u201clying on the floor nonresponsive.\u201d She immediately checked his vital signs, and discovered that he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. She began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and did not stop until the ambulance crew arrived to transport the victim to the hospital. Thereafter, Gregory Gorr, a crime scene technician in the evidentiary services division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Hartford police department, testified that he had observed an autopsy conducted on the victim\u2019s body by an associate medical examiner, during which the examiner removed a spent bullet from the victim\u2019s body. The trial court also admitted the postmortem report, which lists the cause of the victim\u2019s death as a \u201cgunshot wound of chest and abdomen,\u201d and the manner of his death as a \u201chomicide,\u201d over the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that \u201cthere is no question at all\u201d that the state had adduced sufficient evidence to establish that the victim had been murdered during the course of a felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54c.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201cAt the outset, we note that our standard of review for the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings depends on whether the claimed error is of constitutional magnitude. . . . The court\u2019s ruling that the admission of the report entry did not violate the constitutional mandates of <em>Crawford . . </em>. raises a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. [I]f an [evidentiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 592, 910 A.2d 931 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>279 Conn. 493, 508, 903 A.2d 169 (2006) (deprivation of counsel in violation of sixth amendment at probable cause hearing subject to harmless error analysis because \u201cthis court has required the automatic reversal of a conviction due to error at the probable cause hearing <em>only when the error was a lack of sufficient evidence to justify the finding of probable cause\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>It is well established that, \u201c[t]he quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause at a preliminary hearing is less than the quantum necessary to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial .... In making its finding, the court had to determine whether the government\u2019s evidence would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the accused [had] committed the crime. . . . The quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but is substantially less than that required for conviction. Our cases have made clear that [t]here is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause, and [t]hat line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 720-21, 570 A.2d 174 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 135, 659 A.2d 683 (1995) (\u201cproof of probable cause requires less than proof by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Assuming without deciding that the trial court improperly admitted the postmortem report in violation of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that this evidentiary impropriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ample evidence existed to support the trial court\u2019s probable cause determination. The evidence presented at the probable cause hearing established that, after the gunman had shot the victim, the victim collapsed to the floor, was unresponsive and had no vital signs. The victim was unable to be resuscitated, and the medical examiner found a bullet in the victim\u2019s body while performing an autopsy. This evidence was more than sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was the gunshot wounds inflicted during the course of the robbery. Accordingly, the alleged evidentiary impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and a new probable cause hearing is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY DENIED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS CERTAIN EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Lastly, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the pretrial and trial eyewitness identifications made by Antonaras. The defendant claims that the pretrial photographic array presented to Antonaras was unnecessarily suggestive because seven of the eight individuals depicted were customers of Empire Pizza. Additionally, the defendant claims that the identification was conducted in an unnecessarily suggestive manner because \u201ca kind of competition\u201d was introduced between Antonaras and her husband with respect to their ability to identify a suspect, and Antonaras was encouraged to use \u201cher fingers to block out the parts of the face other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>eyes . . . .\u201d The defendant further claims that Antonaras\u2019 identification of the defendant was unreliable because she had observed the masked perpetrator only briefly during the course of the robbeiy, and her initial description of the perpetrator does not match the physical appearance of the defendant. The state responds that neither the pretrial photographic array nor the manner in which it was conducted was unnecessarily suggestive, but, even if it was, Antonaras\u2019 identification of the defendant nonetheless was reliable because she had a clear view of the perpetrator and she expressed absolute certainty with respect to the accuracy of her identification. We conclude that the pretrial identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive and, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress \u201cany pretrial or in-court identification of the defendant which the state intends to use at [the] defendant\u2019s trial\u201d because \u201c[t]he identification procedure employed was unnecessarily suggestive\u201d and \u201c[a]n in-court identification would be irretrievably tainted by the prior illegal identification and would thus lack an independent basis.\u201d The trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion. At the hearing, both Antonaras and Brian Foley, a detective with the major crimes division of the Hartford police department who had presented the photographic array to Antonaras, testified with respect to the manner in which the identification procedure had been conducted. Three days after the Empire Pizza robbery, both Antonaras and her husband, Antonios Antonaras, arrived at the police station to attempt to identify the perpetrator of the robbery from a photographic array. The array contained eight photographs, each depicting an individual with similar physical characteristics. After directing Anto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>naras and her husband to separate rooms, Foley presented Antonaras with the array and \u201ctold her to carefully look at each [photograph] individually and that it\u2019s just as important to identify the innocent as it is to identify the guilty.\u201d Additionally, Antonaras read, signed and dated the following cautionary instructions, which were displayed prominently on the back of the array: \u201cYou will be asked to look at a group of photographs. The fact that the photographs are shown to you should not influence your judgment. You should not conclude or guess that the photographs contain the picture of the person who committed the crime. You are not obligated to identify anyone. It is just as important to free innocent persons from suspicion as to identify guilty parties. Please do not discuss the case with other witnesses nor indicate in any way that you have identified someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Upon viewing the array, Antonaras became very nervous, and indicated to Foley that she recognized seven of the eight individuals depicted as persons who previously had patronized Empire Pizza.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>was unable to identify initially the perpetrator of the robbery, she focused her attention on two individuals, both of whom previously had patronized Empire Pizza, because they shared a distinctive physical characteristic with the perpetrator, namely, widely spaced eyes. Foley then removed the photographic array from the room, and brought it to Antonios Antonaras to determine whether he could make a positive identification.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Foley subsequently returned with the array, at which point he and Antonaras began to discuss the fact that, because the perpetrator had worn a ski mask, the only facial feature she had seen was his eyes. Foley therefore suggested to Antonaras that she should \u201cuse her hands, her fingers, to cover portions of the face that the mask might cover.\u201d Thereafter, Antonaras isolated the eyes of the two individuals, and positively identified a photograph of the defendant, stating \u201c[t]hat\u2019s him, I\u2019ll never forget those eyes.\u201d Foley asked Antonaras if she was 100 percent positive about the accuracy of her identification, and Antonaras responded affirmatively. At the suppression hearing, Antonaras testified that she had identified the defendant because \u201cthe eyebrows were arched, the eyes are bulging and they were far apart, exactly the way I remember it,\u201d and that she was \u201c[q]uite certain\u201d about the accuracy of her identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Antonaras also testified with respect to her opportunity to view the perpetrator during the robbery, explaining that she had seen him from a distance of approximately ten or twelve feet, and that she had made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>eye contact with him briefly. Because the perpetrator\u2019s ski mask had a very large eye opening, Antonaras was able to observe the color and character of his eyes, which were dark and bulging, and the shape of his eyebrows, which were arched. Antonaras also offered the following physical description of the perpetrator: African-American, between five feet, two inches and five feet, four inches tall, and weighing approximately 150 or 160 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s suppression motion, finding that, \u201cthere is not a scintilla of evidence that the court credits that would show anything suggestive in the [photographic] array shown to [Antonaras] or to the procedure utilized during her inspection of that [photographic] array. While unnecessary, in view of that finding, I will also find that, in the totality of the circumstances, the identification was overall reliable. The claims that the defense has go to the weight not the admissibility of the identification, which is another way for saying that that\u2019s grist for the jury\u2019s mill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u201c[B]ecause the issue of the reliability of an identification involves the constitutional rights of an accused . . . we are obliged to examine the record scrupulously to determine whether the facts found are adequately supported by the evidence and whether the court\u2019s ultimate inference of reliability was reasonable. . . . [T]he required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless rehable based on an examination of the totality of the circumstances. ... To prevail on his claim, the defendant has the burden of showing that the trial court\u2019s determinations of suggestiveness and reliability both were incorrect. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201cFurthermore, [w]e will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling [on evidence] only where there is an abuse of discretion or where an injustice has occurred . . . and we will indulge in eveiy reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . Because the inquiry into whether evidence of pretrial identification should be suppressed contemplates a series of factbound determinations, which a trial court is far better equipped than this court to make, we will not disturb the findings of the trial court as to subordinate facts unless the record reveals clear and manifest error.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 547-48, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In accordance with these principles, we first address whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. \u201cBecause, [generally, [t]he exclusion of evidence from the jury is ... a drastic sanction, one that is limited to identification testimony which is manifestly suspect . . . [a]n identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive only if it gives rise to a veiy substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 548. To determine whether a photographic array is unnecessarily suggestive, a reviewing court considers various factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the degree of likeness shared by the individuals pictured; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>203 Conn. 159, 175, 523 A.2d 1284 (1987) (\u201c[w]hile the inclusion of lookalikes in a photographic array may enhance the reliability of the viewer\u2019s identification of a particular photograph, the failure to include lookalikes does not, in itself, render an identification procedure suggestive\u201d); (2) the number of photographs included in the array; see <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 383, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968) (danger of misidentification \u201cwill be increased if the police display to the witness only the picture of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>individual who generally resembles the person he saw\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 244, 476 A.2d 550 (1984) (\u201c[i]t has been generally recognized that the presentation of several photographs to witnesses, including that of the suspect ... is by itself a nonsuggestive and constitutionally acceptable practice, in the absence of any unfairness or other impropriety in the conduct of the exhibit\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); (3) whether the suspect\u2019s photograph prominently was displayed or otherwise was highlighted in an impermissible manner; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 726 (\u201c[a]ny array composed of different individuals must necessarily contain certain differences [and] [d]ifferences in the size and color composition of photographs in and of themselves do not render an array . . . unnecessarily suggestive\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); (4) whether the eyewitness had been told that the array includes a photograph of a known suspect; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 556, 757 A.2d 482 (2000) (\u201cIt is proper for a court, in determining whether an identification procedure was unduly suggestive, to consider the fact that a police officer tells a victim that a suspect is in a photographic array. . . . Such a statement, however, is not enough to render an identification procedure unduly suggestive.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); (5) whether the eyewitness had been presented with multipie arrays in which the photograph of one suspect recurred repeatedly; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 535, 539 A.2d 80 (1988) (\u201c[although we have recognized that pictorial recurrence can be suggestive in that it increases the risk of misidentification . . . the recurrent use of a defendant\u2019s photograph in successive arrays is not presumptively suggestive\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); and (6) whether a second eyewitness was present during the presentation of the array. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 238-39, 362 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>A.2d 925 (second eyewitness was present during identification procedure, but she \u201cdid not say or do anything before, during, or after the complaining witness\u2019 identification to influence her selection\u201d), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The defendant claims that the composition of the photographic array was unnecessarily suggestive because Antonaras recognized seven of the eight individuals depicted as patrons of Empire Pizza.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We reject this claim. The trial court reasonably could have inferred from Antonaras\u2019 testimony that, although she recognized the defendant, and six other individuals, as persons who had patronized Empire Pizza at some point in time during the restaurant\u2019s thirty year history at 861 New Britain Avenue, she personally was not familiar with any of them. See footnote 16 of this opinion. The defendant has failed to cite any authority, and we are aware of none, to support the proposition that the inclusion of individuals merely recognizable by, but not known to, an eyewitness, renders a photographic array unnecessarily suggestive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>86 Conn. App. 409, 415-16, 861 A.2d 548 (2004) (photographic array was not unnecessarily suggestive even though witness recognized three of eight men depicted), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 922, 867 A.2d 838 (2005). To the extent that the composition of the array might have led Antonaras to speculate that the police suspected that an Empire Pizza patron had committed the robbery, we note that this speculation would not have focused Antonaras\u2019 attention on the defendant, nor on any individual in particular, because the majority of individuals included in the array had patronized Empire Pizza at some point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>We further reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the pretrial identification had been conducted in an unnecessarily suggestive manner. The trial court reasonably could have found that the removal of the photographic array did not introduce an element of competition into the identification procedure, but, rather, enabled Antonaras to regain her composure and focus more intently on the task at hand. Additionally, the trial court reasonably could have found that Foley\u2019s suggestion to isolate the eyes of the individuals pictured did not suggest to Antonaras \u201cthat she was very close in her initial narrowing down of the eight photographs to two,\u201d but, rather, offered a more refined technique to compare the facial features of the individuals depicted with her own recollection of the masked perpetrator. Lastly, the defendant\u2019s insistence that Foley improperly impressed upon Antonaras \u201cthe need to make an identification from this particular photo [graphic] array\u201d is contradicted by the testimony of Foley and Antonaras, which emphasized Foley\u2019s repeated instructions to look at each photograph slowly and carefully because it is \u201cjust as important to identify the innocent as it is to identify the guilty.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the pretrial identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The judgments are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...
