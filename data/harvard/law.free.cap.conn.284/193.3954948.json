Bellemare, appeals, following our grant of certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>judgment of the Appellate Court affirming in part<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered in favor of the defendant, Wachovia Mortgage Corporation. The principal issue in this certified appeal is whether the trial court properly applied the three year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the plaintiffs claim for damages arising from the defendant\u2019s failure to provide a release of mortgage to the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>claims that, because the trial court should have applied the six year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-576,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Appellate Court incorrectly upheld the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs claim for damages was time barred. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The following facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn or about May 31, 1998, William A. Bellemare and the plaintiff sold their home at 225 Citizens Avenue . . . [in] Waterbury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The [home was] subject to a mortgage held by the defendant. On June 18, 1998, the plaintiffs counsel sent the defendant a check in the amount of $31,729.34 as payment in full of the mortgage loan balance due to the defendant. The defendant received the sum in satisfaction of the loan . . . but [allegedly] failed to execute and deliver a release of the mortgage to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201cIn April, 2003, the plaintiff, upon discovering that the release had not been recorded in the land records, demanded a release of the mortgage and damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the amount of $5000 pursuant to \u00a7 49-8. The defendant provided the requested release, dated May 13, 2003, but declined to pay the sum of $5000. On December 22, 2003, the plaintiff filed a three count complaint against the defendant. The [plaintiff] . . . sought damages (1) pursuant to \u00a7 49-8, (2) under [the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.] and (3) for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cIn its answer, the defendant acknowledged that the loan had been paid in full but maintained that a timely release of the mortgage and a duplicate release had been sent to the plaintiffs counsel. The defendant also raised as special defenses to all counts that the claims were barred by applicable statutes of limitation and filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts on the basis of these special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThe [trial] court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds asserted. For the CUTPA count, the court relied on CUTPA\u2019s three year statute of limitations. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (f). As to the remaining counts, the court concluded that the plaintiffs claims sounded in tort and, therefore, were barred by \u00a7 52-577, the statute of limitations applicable generally to tort actions.\u201d <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>94 Conn. App. 593, 595-96, 894 A.2d 335 (2006). The trial court thereafter rendered judgment for the defendant on all counts of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment, claiming, inter alia, that a cause of action brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-8 does not sound in tort but, rather, in contract, and that, because the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions, namely, \u00a7 52-576, allows such an action to be brought within six years of the alleged breach, her claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not time barred. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part, and this certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The sole issue we address on appeal is whether the trial court improperly applied the three year statute of limitations of \u00a7 52-577 to the first count of the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleged, in the first count of her complaint, that the defendant had violated \u00a7 49-8 by failing to provide a release of mortgage within sixty days of the satisfaction of the underlying debt. The defendant claims that \u00a7 52-577 is the statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 49-8 and that the trial court properly concluded, therefore, that that claim was time barred. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We begin our analysis with the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 6-7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Public policy generally supports the limitation of a cause of action in order to grant some degree of certainty to litigants. See, e.g., <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>DeCholnoky, </em>280 Conn. 190, 206-207, 905A.2d 1135 (2006); <em>Tarnowsky v. Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 296, 856 A.2d 408 (2004); <em>DeLeo </em>v. <em>Nusbaum, </em>263 Conn. 588, 596, 821 A.2d 744 (2003). \u201cThe purpose of [a] statute of limitation . . . is . . . to (1) prevent the unexpected enforcement of stale and fraudulent claims by allowing persons after the lapse of a reasonable time, to plan their affairs with a reasonable degree of certainty, free from the disruptive burden of protracted and unknown potential liability, and (2) to aid in the search for truth that may be impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, disappearance of documents or otherwise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>DeCholnoky, </em>supra, 206-207. Therefore, when a statute includes no express statute of limitations, we should not simply assume that there is no limitation period. Instead, we borrow the most suitable statute of limitations on the basis of the nature of the cause of action or of the right sued upon. See, e.g., <em>Woody </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>965 F. Sup. 691, 692 (E.D. Pa. 1997); <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>879 F. Sup. 28, 30 (E.D. Pa. 1995); <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins of Texas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kenneco Energy, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>962 S.W.2d 507, 518 (Tex. 1998); cf. <em>Gazo </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>255 Conn. 245, 263, 765 A.2d 505 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In the present case, although the existence of a mortgage suggests that the plaintiffs claim sounds in contract, the duty that allegedly was breached was created by statute. We first note that \u201c[t]he fundamental difference between tort and contract lies in the nature of the interests protected. . . . The duties of conduct which give rise to [a tort action] are imposed by the law, and are based primarily upon social policy, and not necessarily upon the will or intention of the parties.\u201d W. Prosser, Torts (3d Ed. 1964) \u00a7 93, p. 634. Furthermore, other courts have held that, when a plaintiff seeks to recover damages for the breach of a statutory duty, such an action sounds in tort. See, e.g., <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 195, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974) (damages action pursuant to statute sounds in tort because it defines new legal duty and authorizes courts to compensate plaintiff for injury caused by defendant\u2019s wrongful breach of duty); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>592 F.2d 364, 368-69 (7th Cir.) (liability for breach of duty imposed by statute sounds in tort), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 829, 100 S. Ct. 56, 62 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On the other hand, \u201c[c]ontract actions are created to protect the interest in having promises performed. Contract obligations are imposed because of [the] conduct of the parties manifesting consent, and are owed only to the specific individuals named in the contract.\u201d W. Prosser, supra, \u00a7 93, p. 634. In short, \u201c[a]n action in contract is for the breach of a duty arising out of a contract; an action in tort is for a breach of duty imposed by law.\u201d <em>Gazo </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In the first count of her complaint, the plaintiff sought damages for the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 49-8. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-8 (c), \u201c[t]he mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>gagee . . . shall execute and deliver a release within sixty days from the date a written request for a release of such encumbrance (1) was sent to such mortgagee . . . .\u201d There is no allegation in this count of the complaint that a term of the mortgage contract had been breached. In fact, the mortgage contract may be silent with regard to the issuance of a release, may provide for a longer or shorter time period for the issuance of a release, or may be vague or uncertain as to the period for the issuance of a release.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the duty to release the mortgage that the plaintiff complained of in the first count of her complaint did not arise from the mortgage contract but, rather, from \u00a7 49-8, which also prescribes damages for a breach of that statutory duty. Therefore, such a breach is tortious in nature and not contractual.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In addition, employing the plaintiffs analysis would lead to multiple statutes of limitation being applicable to the duty created by \u00a7 49-8. We note that the damages provision set forth in \u00a7 49-8 (c) applies to both \u00a7 49-8 (a), which deals with mortgages, and \u00a7 49-8 (b), which applies to an ineffective attachment, lis pendens or other lien. Section 49-8 provides that a release must be executed and delivered within sixty days of the date of a written request for a release of, inter alia, a satisfied mortgage or an ineffective attachment, lis pendens or hen. An attachment, lis pendens or lien may be based on claims that do not arise out of a contractual relationship. Thus, for example, an attachment to secure a potential judgment in a negligence action would, under the plaintiffs theory, result in the application of the tort statute of limitations to the duty of \u00a7 49-8 to execute and deliver a release. If the attachment were based on an obligation arising out of a contract, however, the plaintiff would apply the contract statute of limitations to that duty. Thus, the duty established by \u00a7 49-8 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>release an invalid encumbrance within sixty days would have multiple statutes of limitation depending on the situation. Applying multiple statutes of limitation to a singular duty created by statute is an odd result, one that we generally attempt to avoid. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 574-75, 910 A.2d 931 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Furthermore, the cause of action created by \u00a7 49-8 is akin to an action for slander of title. \u201cSlander of title is a <em>tort </em>whereby the plaintiffs claim of title [to] land or other property is disparaged by a letter, caveat, mortgage, lien or some other written instrument . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) D. Wright, J. Fitzgerald &amp; W. Ankerman, Connecticut Law of Torts (3d Ed. 1991) \u00a7 167, p. 447. A cause of action for slander of title consists of \u201cany false communication which results in harm to interests of another having pecuniary value . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>QSP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>256 Conn. 343, 359 n.15, 773 A.2d 906 (2001). See generally 5 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 623A (1981). In other words, slander of title is a falsehood published to third parties that is not withdrawn after a demand by the titleholder, which impugns the basic integrity or creditworthiness of an individual or a business. See <em>QSP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 359 n.15. It follows, therefore, that A may bring an action for slander of title when B improperly records a mortgage against the deed to A\u2019s home and does not correct such an impropriety upon A\u2019s demand. Such an action lies in tort and is akin to an action for damages pursuant to \u00a7 49-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Nevertheless, the plaintiff claims that the six year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-576 is applicable in this case because an action based on \u00a7 49-8 sounds in contract. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that such a cause of action sounds in contract because \u00a7 49-8 is, in effect, a liquidated damages clause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We long have held that contracting parties may decide on a specified monetary remedy for the failure to perform a contractual obligation. See, e.g., <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>273 Conn. 296, 306, 869 A.2d 1198 (2005). \u201c \u2018[T]he law is well established in this jurisdiction, as well as elsewhere, that a term in a contract calling for the imposition of a penalty for the breach of the contract is contrary to public policy and invalid, but a contractual provision fixing the amount of damages to be paid in the event of a breach is enforceable if it satisfies certain conditions.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u201c \u2018A provision for liquidated damages, on the other hand, is one the real purpose of which is to fix fair compensation to the injured party for a breach of the contract. In determining whether any particular provision is for liquidated damages or for a penalty, the courts are not controlled by the fact that the phrase \u201cliquidated damages\u201d or the word \u201cpenalty\u201d is used. Rather, that which is determinative of the question is the intention of the parties to the contract. Accordingly, such a provision is ordinarily to be construed as one for liquidated damages if three conditions are satisfied: (1) The damage which was to be expected as a result of a breach of the contract was uncertain in amount or difficult to prove; (2) there was an intent on the part of the parties to liquidate damages in advance; and (3) the amount stipulated was reasonable in the sense that it was not greatly disproportionate to the amount of the damage which, as the parties looked forward, seemed to be the presumable loss which would be sustained by the contractee in the event of abreach of the contract.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In the present case, \u00a7 49-8 is not akin to a liquidated damages clause because, although the damages may be difficult to prove, they did not arise from an agreement of the parties, and the parties, therefore, could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>had the intent to liquidate damages. In addition, the purported liquidated damages provision set forth in \u00a7 49-8 is not related to \u201cthe amount of the damage [that] . . . seemed to be the presumable loss [that] would be sustained . . . in the event of a breach of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 307. In fact, \u00a7 49-8 (c) cannot be related to \u201cpresumable loss[es]\u201d that would be sustained by a party in the event of a violation of \u00a7 49-8 because the amount of damages under the statute is fixed under all circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-8 (c) (providing for \u201cdamages to any person aggrieved at the rate of two hundred dollars for each week after the expiration of such sixty days up to a maximum of five thousand dollars\u201d). Therefore, in order for that portion of \u00a7 49-8 to be analogous to a liquidated damages clause, the statute would have to foresee that the damages for the failure to release <em>all </em>ineffective liens, lis pendens, and attachments and all satisfied mortgages are not greatly disproportionate to $200 for each week after the expiration of the sixty day period, up to a maximum of $5000. Because the amount of damages foreseeable in such actions can vary greatly, depending on the different underlying factual circumstances surrounding every transaction, we disagree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 49-8 is akin to a liquidated damages clause. In fact, it is more analogous to a penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Having determined that an action for damages under \u00a7 49-8 sounds in tort, we conclude that the defendant was entitled to judgment in its favor because the plaintiff had failed to bring her claim within three years of the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 49-8, in accordance with \u00a7 52-577. In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 49-8 occurred in July, 1998, when the defendant allegedly failed to provide the release of mortgage. The plaintiff commenced this action, however, in December, 2003, more than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>years after the statute of limitations had expired. Accordingly, the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\"> We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages under General Statutes \u00a7 49-8 is barred by the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577?\" <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>280 Conn. 901, 907 A.2d 88 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em> </em>We note that the Appellate Court reversed that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing as time barred the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>94 Conn.
