The trial court rendered judgment for the defendants on all counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Gonzalez then filed this appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claiming that the trial court improperly determined that (1) \u00a7 9-410 (c) is not void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) \u00a7 9-410 (c) does not constitute an unconstitutional restriction of free speech and associational rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 10 and 14, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>As set forth in the companion case of <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>284 Conn. 554, 937 A.2d 13 (2007), the record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. \u201cOn July 19, 2007, the Hartford Democratic town committee endorsed certain candidates for the offices of mayor of the city and members of the court of common council. The next day, Gonzalez, who had not been endorsed, filed an application for primary petition and a candidate consent form to obtain petitions for her to appear on the Democratic ballot for the primary that was to be held on September 11, 2007. On July 24, 2007, several individuals filed an application for primary petition and a candidate consent form to obtain petitions for them to appear as a challenge slate on the Democratic ballot for the primary. The challenge slate\u2019s consent form named Andrea Comer, Eric Crawford, Maria Diaz, David Morin, Paolo Mozzicato and Beatriz Roman as candidates for the court of common council and Jonathan Clark as a candidate for the office of mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cTo qualify to appear on the ballot in the 2007 Democratic primary, the candidates were required to submit to Surgeon petitions containing the verified signatures of 5 percent of the enrolled Democratic electors in Hartford, which Surgeon had determined to be 1392 electors. The petition forms, which are included in a packet provided to municipal registrars of voters by the secretary of the state and which the circulators obtained from Surgeon, contained the following warning: \u2018Circulator: Read separate Instruction Sheet before circulating.\u2019 The instruction sheet provides in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>part: \u2018Circulator ... No person may circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office. . . . Any petition page circulated in violation of these provisions of the law must be rejected by the registrar.\u2019 The deadline for filing the petitions to appear on the ballot for the September 11, 2007 primary was August 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cGonzalez and approximately eighteen volunteers, including the other plaintiffs in this action, circulated the petitions, collected signatures in support of Gonzalez\u2019 candidacy and submitted the petitions to Surgeon in batches from July 20 through August 2, 2007. After submitting what they believed to be sufficient signatures to qualify Gonzalez to appear on the ballot, several people who had circulated petitions for Gonzalez then circulated petitions on behalf of the challenge slate candidates, which included mayoral candidate Clark. On the evening of August 1, 2007, Surgeon telephoned Gonzalez and informed her that she had obtained enough signatures to appear on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cThereafter, Surgeon reviewed the petitions to verify that they complied with the requirement of \u00a7 9-410 (c) that \u2018[n]o person shall circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position . . . .\u2019 Upon discovering that several persons who had circulated and submitted petitions on behalf of Gonzalez also had circulated and submitted petitions on behalf of the challenge slate, which included Clark as a mayoral candidate, Surgeon determined that she was required to reject the petitions that had been submitted by these circulators. See General Statutes \u00a7 9-410 (c) (\u2018any petition page circulated in violation of this provision shall be rejected by the registrar\u2019). After consulting with the secretary of the state\u2019s office, Surgeon determined that any petitions that had been circulated and submitted on behalf of Gonzalez before the challenge slate had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>submitted its consent form on July 24, 2007, could be accepted, regardless of whetfier the circulator of the petitions subsequently had circulated petitions for the challenge slate. On August 8, 2007, the deadline date for filing the petitions, Surgeon informed Gonzalez that she had rejected some of the petitions submitted on Gonzalez\u2019 behalf. Several days later, Surgeon determined that neither Gonzalez nor the challenge slate had obtained enough signatures on valid petitions to qualify to appear on the primary ballot. On August 13, 2007, Surgeon provided to Carey the names of the candidates who were qualified to appear on the ballot. Carey was responsible for preparing the primary ballot and distributing absentee ballots twenty-one days before the primary, which was August 21, 2007. On August 14, 2007, Clark filed a formal withdrawal of his candidacy for mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cOn August 20, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a four count complaint in the Superior Court alleging that Surgeon improperly had rejected the petition forms filed on behalf of Gonzalez because: (1) there was no violation of \u00a7 9-410 (c) with respect to the petitions that had been circulated on behalf of Gonzalez before any petitions had been circulated on behalf of the challenge slate (first count); (2) \u00a7 9-410 (c) applied only to bona fide candidates and Clark was not a bona fide candidate (second count); (3) \u00a7 9-410 (c) is unconstitutionally vague (third count); and (4) \u00a7 9-410 (c) unconstitutionally restricts political speech and associational rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 10 and 14 of the state constitution (fourth count). The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the form of an order declaring that the petitions filed on her behalf were not invalid, that she was qualified as a Democratic candidate for the office of mayor, that her name should be placed on the ballot for the September 11, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>primary and that new absentee ballots be mailed or, in the alternative, that Carey be prohibited from mailing absentee ballots until final resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking an ex parte injunction prohibiting Carey from distributing the absentee ballots on August 21, 2007. The challenge slate candidates filed a separate action seeking similar relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiffs withdrew their request for an ex parte temporary injunction and the trial court denied the challenge slate candidates\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order. The trial court consolidated the two actions and ordered a hearing on the requests for a temporary injunction to commence on August 24, 2007. On August 22, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a verified amended complaint making substantially the same allegations and seeking substantially the same relief as in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201cAfter trial commenced on August 24, 2007, the parties agreed that the trial court should convert the hearing on the claim for a temporary injunction to a full trial on the merits. At trial, the court heard evidence that the challenge slate had asked Clark to run for the office of mayor for the sole reason of securing an advantageous placement on the ballot, as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 9-437.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also heard evidence that Clark always had intended to withdraw his candidacy if and when the challenge slate qualified to appear on the ballot.\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 558-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cOn August 29,2007, the trial court issued its decision in which it rendered judgment for the defendants on all counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint. The court determined that, as to the first and second counts of the complaint alleging statutory violations, [t]he usual civil standard of preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate burden of persuasion .... With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Surgeon should not have rejected the petitions that had been circulated on Gonzalez\u2019 behalf before the circulation of the petitions for the challenge slate under \u00a7 9-410 (c), the court concluded that the claim found no support in the plain language of the statute. The court also relied on the legislative history of the statute, which indicated that its purpose was to eliminate some specific abuses that have been observed to have occurred during primaries from time to time. By prohibiting circulation of petitions for rival candidates, the bill would prevent the somewhat unfair tactic of siphoning off votes of a strong rival to a weaker one, thereby increasing the circulator\u2019s relative strength. 21 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1978 Sess., pp. 1455-56, remarks of Representative Elmer W. Lowden. The court concluded that accepting petitions submitted by a circulator who later circulated petitions for another candidate would undermine this legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201cThe trial court also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 9-410 (c) referred only to bona fide candidates for office and did not apply to the circulation of a petition for a placeholder candidate. The court pointed out that the statute made no distinction between serious candidates and straw candidates. In addition, the court reasoned that it would place an unreasonable burden on registrars to determine the subjective intent of each candidate for office on a case-by-case basis. Finally, the court determined that to limit the application of \u00a7 9-410 (c) to the circulation of petitions for bona fide candidates for office would not advance the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>purpose of the statute, which was to prevent candidates from engaging in tactics that had the effect of siphoning votes from a strong rival candidate to a weaker rival.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 562-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 9-410 (c) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not clearly specify whether circulators were prohibited from circulating petitions for multiple candidates at separate times or whether it applied to petitions for placeholder candidates for the same office, the trial court concluded that the statutory language was clear as to both questions. With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 free speech claims under the state and federal constitutions, the trial court first determined that, because the burden that \u00a7 9-410 (c) imposed on free speech rights was slight, the statute was not subject to strict scrutiny but required only a \u201clogical justification.\u201d The court concluded that the state\u2019s interest in discouraging unfair election tactics was a sufficient justification and the statute was, therefore, constitutional. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants on all counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Thereafter, Gonzalez filed this appeal, claiming that the trial court improperly had determined that \u00a7 9-410 (c) is not unconstitutionally vague and that the statute does not unconstitutionally restrict free speech rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We first address Gonzalez\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 9-410 (c) is not void for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, Gonzalez claims that the statute is vague because it does not clearly delineate which petitions should be rejected when a person has circulated petitions for multiple candidates. Rather, she claims, the statute is ambiguous as to whether it required Surgeon to reject all of the petitions circulated by such persons or whether she was authorized to accept petitions that had been circulated for Gonzalez before any petitions had been circulated on behalf of the challenge slate by the same persons. She further claims that the statute is vague as to whether it refers only to bona fide candidates or also to \u201cplaceholder\u201d candidates. Finally, she argues that, because \u00a7 9-410 (c) implicates first amendment rights; see part II of this opinion; we should apply a more stringent vagueness test than we apply to ordinary civil statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cThe purpose of the vagueness doctrine is twofold. The doctrine requires statutes to provide fair notice of the conduct to which they pertain and to establish minimum guidelines to govern law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ment. The United States Supreme Court has set forth standards for evaluating vagueness. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. ... [A] law forbidding or requiring conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates due process of law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cSecond, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications. . . . Therefore, a legislature [must] establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cThird, but related, where a vague statute abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic [f]irst [a]mendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201cThese standards should not ... be mechanically applied. The degree of vagueness that the [constitution tolerates \u2014 as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement \u2014 depends in part on the nature of the enactment. . . . The [c]ourt has . . . expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe. And the [c]ourt has recognized that a scienter require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ment may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the [party] that his conduct is proscribed. . . . [PJerhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the [constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 802-804, 640 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the challenged language of \u00a7 9-410 (c). The statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person shall circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position, and any petition page circulated in violation of this provision shall be rejected by the registrar. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-410 (c). With respect to Gonzalez\u2019 claim that the statute is vague as to whether it required Surgeon to reject all of the petitions circulated by such persons or whether she was authorized to accept petitions that had been circulated for Gonzalez before any petitions had been circulated on behalf of the challenge slate by the same persons, we have concluded in the companion case of <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 566, that \u201cthe statute\u2019s reference to \u2018any petition page circulated in violation of this provision\u2019 is ambiguous.\u201d We also have concluded, however, that the legislative history, as well as the practical application of the statute, compels the interpretation that the registrar was required to reject all petition pages filed by any person who had circulated petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated for an office. Id., 568-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">This court previously has held that when the meaning of a statute is clear from the statute\u2019s context, purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and legislative history, the fact that the language of the statute may be susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation does not render it unconstitutionally vague. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211, 221, 700 A.2d 1 (1997) (rejecting vagueness challenge to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217a in part because legislative history established clear meaning); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 555-56, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (although language of death penalty statute supported defendant\u2019s interpretation, rule of lenity did not require court to adopt defendant\u2019s interpretation when context and legislative history of statute clearly supported contrary interpretation);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>23 Conn. App. 272, 278, 580 A.2d 71 (1990) (rejecting vagueness challenge to General Statutes \u00a7 26-142a because legislative history established clear meaning). Because the meaning of the challenged portion of \u00a7 9-410 (c) is clear from the statute\u2019s purpose, practical application and legislative history, we conclude that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, even under the more stringent vagueness test that we apply to statutes impheating first amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Gonzalez also claims that \u00a7 9-410 (c) is unconstitutionally vague because it does not clearly define whether the word \u201ccandidate\u201d refers only to bona fide candidates or also refers to placeholder candidates. We have concluded in the companion case of <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 570-71, that, because \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>410 (c) makes no distinction between bona fide candidates and placeholder candidates, it necessarily refers to <em>any </em>candidate. We adopt the reasoning of that case herein and, accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We next address Gonzalez\u2019 claim that \u00a7 9-410 (c) violates the first amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, Gonzalez contends that \u201c[ljimiting circulators to only one political candidate in a particular [primary] election is a severe restriction of their [f|irst [a]mendment rights.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, she contends that the statute does not effectively eliminate the type of conduct that the legislature intended to target, namely, maneuvers by one candidate intended to secure a place on the ballot for a nonserious candidate for the purpose of siphoning votes to that candidate from a third, stronger candidate. She further contends that the trial court improperly failed to apply strict scrutiny to the statute. We reject all of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We first consider whether the trial court applied the proper level of scrutiny. \u201cThe [United States] Supreme Court has identified two different, although overlapping, kinds of rights that the [f]irst [a]mendment grants: the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right of qualified voters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively. Both of these rights, of course, rank among our most precious freedoms. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 787, 103 S. Ct. 1564, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1983) (quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 30-31, 89 S. Ct. 5, 21 L. Ed. 2d 24 [1968]).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cWhile the role of voter is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure, <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 433, 112 S. Ct. 2059, 119 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1992) . . . the rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation; laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters, <em>Anderson </em>[v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 786] .... Accordingly, the [United States] Supreme Court has minimized the extent to which voting rights cases are distinguishable from ballot access cases. <em>Burdick </em>[v. <em>Takushi, </em>supra, 438]. In either context, [o]ur primary concern is with the tendency of ballot access restrictions to limit the field of candidates from which voters might choose. <em>Anderson </em>[v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>supra, 786]</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cYet not every regulation that limits the field of candidates is constitutionally suspect, let alone unconstitutional. As noted above, a state possesses significant power to structure its own elections. Moreover, as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes. Id. [788] .... Accordingly, in resolving a challenge that pits a [s]tate\u2019s power to regulate its elections against the rights secured by the [f]irst [a]mendment, we cannot resort to any litmus-paper test that will separate valid from invalid restrictions. Id. [789] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cInstead, we must first ascertain the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>by the [f]irst and [fourteenth [amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate. Id. We must make that assessment not in isolation, but within the context of the state\u2019s overall scheme of election regulations. <em>Lerman </em>v. <em>[Board of Elections], </em>232 F.3d 135, 145 (2d Cir. 2000). The [United States] Supreme Court has underscored that in assessing the extent to which a given set of candidate restrictions burdens [f]irst [a]mendment rights, our review is neither formalistic nor abstract. Instead, we must turn a keen eye on how the electoral scheme functions <em>in fact; </em>indeed, it is essential to examine in a realistic light the extent and nature of [the scheme\u2019s] impact on voters. <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 143, 92 S. Ct. 849, 31 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\u201cIf our realistic assessment yields the conclusion that the electoral scheme lightly or even moderately burdens [f]irst [a]mendment rights, we apply a relaxed standard of review, according to which the restrictions generally are valid so long as they further an important state interest. <em>Lerman </em>[v. <em>Board of Elections, </em>supra, 232 F.3d 145]. On the other hand, if we conclude that a law imposes severe burdens, we apply strict scrutiny, which requires that the law be necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Id.; see also <em>Bullock </em>[v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 147] ([b]ut under the standard of review we consider applicable to this case, there must be a showing of necessity . . . ).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopez Torres </em>v. <em>New York State Board of Elections, </em>462 F.3d 161, 183-84 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. granted, 549 U.S. 1204, 127 S. Ct. 1325, 167 L. Ed. 2d 72 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">With these principles in mind, we address as a preliminary matter the question of whether \u00a7 9-410 (c) implicates protected first amendment rights of voters and candidates. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the circulation of initiative petitions \u201cinvolves the type of interactive communication con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ceming political change that is appropriately described as \u2018core political speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 421-22, 108 S. Ct. 1886, 100 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1988); see also <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 182, 186, 119 S. Ct. 636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999). In support of this conclusion, the court in <em>Meyer </em>reasoned that \u201c[t]he circulation of an initiative petition of necessity involves both the expression of a desire for political change and a discussion of the merits of the proposed change. . . . This will in almost every case involve an explanation of the nature of the proposal and why its advocates support it<em>.\" Meyer </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 421. As at least one circuit court has recognized, this reasoning also applies to the circulation of petitions to appear on a primary ballot. See <em>Lerman </em>v. <em>Board of Elections, </em>supra, 232 F.3d 146 (citing <em>Meyer </em>in support of conclusion that circulation of petitions to appear on primary election ballot constitutes core political speech); see also <em>Citizens for John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>794 F.2d 1254, 1257 (7th Cir. 1986) (\u201claws controlling [ballot] access affect rights of both speech and association\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 9-410 (c) implicates core political speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We next consider the \u201ccharacter and magnitude\u201d of the burden that \u00a7 9-410 (c) imposes on political speech. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopez Torres </em>v. <em>New York State Board of Elections, </em>supra, 462 F.3d 184. Like the trial court in the present case, we find the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Citizens for John W. Moore Party, </em>to be particularly instructive on this question. In that case, the court considered the constitutionality of a provision of the Illinois Election Code that stated: \u201c[N]o person shall circulate or certify petitions for candidates of more than one political party ... to be voted upon at the next primary or general election. \u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>Citizens for John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>supra, 794 F.2d 1255-56. One of the plaintiffs, John W. Moore, and several of his associates had circulated petitions to put Moore on the primary ballot as a Democratic candidate for the office of state senator. Id., 1255. Moore qualified, but he withdrew his candidacy before the election. Id. Moore and his associates then circulated petitions to put Moore on the general election ballot as the \u201c \u2018Citizens for John W. Moore Party\u2019 \u201d candidate for the state House of Representatives. Id. The defendant election commission rejected many signatures contained in the second set of petitions because they had been collected by circulators who previously had circulated petitions for Moore as a Democratic candidate. Id. Moore then brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois claiming that the statutory provision was unconstitutional. Id., 1256. The District Court concluded that \u201cthe statute affects rights secured by the first and fourteenth amendments but found the effect small.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that the provision did not impose \u201can unconstitutional burden.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[t]he [District [C]ourt found the burden [imposed by the election code provision] slight, and we concur. The statute applies only to circulators who switch parties during an election season. . . . [I]t does not diminish the pool of people available to circulate petitions .... It does not increase the number of signatures anyone needs to get on the ballot or the number of circulatorhours necessary to appear .... The statute does not affect the ability of \u2018used\u2019 circulators to speak. They may campaign for anyone to their hearts\u2019 content; Moore\u2019s friends could have done everything for him in his second race except collect signatures. [The election code provision] does undercut the <em>value </em>of the circulators\u2019 speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>to Moore and his friends, and what undercuts the value of speech implicates the first amendment. . . . But this was true, as well, in cases such as <em>Heffron </em>[v. <em>International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 101 S. Ct. 2559, 69 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1981)] and <em>[Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 104 S. Ct. 3065, 82 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1984)], in which the [United States Supreme] Court allowed regulation by neutral values.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Citizens for John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>supra, 794 F.2d 1260. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the statute was constitutional as applied to circulators who had filed petitions on behalf of others. Id., 1263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In the present case, the challenged portion of \u00a7 9-410 (c) prohibiting any person from circulating petitions for more than \u201cthe maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position\u201d affects only persons who have circulated petitions for the maximum number of candidates for one office and want to switch their support to another candidate or candidates for the same office and those who support one candidate or slate of candidates but want to circulate petitions for additional candidates for tactical reasons. As in <em>Citizens for John W. Moore Party, </em>the provision does not prevent such persons from supporting whatever candidate they choose in any manner they choose <em>except </em>by circulating petitions, it does not significantly diminish the pool of people available to circulate petitions for a particular candidate and it does not increase the number of signatures that must be collected on behalf of a particular candidate. We conclude, therefore, that the burden imposed by \u00a7 9-410 (c) is slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The cases in which courts have determined that restrictions on the circulation of ballot access petitions imposed a severe burden are distinguishable. In <em>Meyer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the court considered the constitutionality of a Colorado law that made it a felony to pay persons to circulate petitions to place a proposed state constitutional amendment on the general election ballot. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 486 U.S. 415-16. The court found that the law \u201crestricts political expression in two ways: First, it limits the number of voices who will convey [the proponents\u2019] message and the hours they can speak and, therefore, limits the size of the audience they can reach. Second, it makes it less likely that [the proponents] will gamer the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the ballot, thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.\u201d Id., 422-23. Accordingly, the court concluded that the law was subject to \u201cexacting scrutiny.\u201d Id., 420. In <em>Buckley, </em>the court considered, inter alia, the constitutionality of a Colorado law that required persons who circulated initiative petitions to be registered voters. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., </em>supra, 525 U.S. 192-93. The court found that the provisions decrease \u201cthe pool of potential circulators as certainly as that pool is decreased by the prohibition of payment to circulators\u201d; id., 194; thereby reducing the size of the audience that the circulators could reach and limiting their ability to secure placement of the initiative on the ballot. Id., 195. Accordingly, the court concluded that the law was not \u201cwarranted by the state interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection, informing voters) alleged to justify\u201d the law, without stating explicitly whether those state interests were required to be compelling. Id., 192; see also <em>Lerman </em>v. <em>Board of Elections, </em>supra, 232 F.3d 146 (New York law requiring that witnesses to ballot access petitions be residents of political subdivision in which office is to be voted for \u201cseverely burdens political speech by \u2018drastically reducing] the number of persons . . . available to circulate petitions\u2019 \u201d); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Bysiewicz, </em>242 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Sup. 2d 164, 170 (D. Conn. 2003) (residency requirement for witnesses to petition signatures in \u00a7 9-410 [c] \u201cdrastically reduce[d] the persons available to circulate petitions\u201d and was unconstitutional). In all of these cases, the controlling consideration was that the law under review significantly reduced the pool of potential circulators. The provision of \u00a7 9-410 (c) at issue in the present case does not eliminate any persons from the pool of eligible circulators. The statute merely requires any person who wants to participate in the petition process to choose one candidate or slate of candidates for whom he or she will circulate petitions. Thus, \u00a7 9-410 (c) restricts the pool of available circulators only in the sense that it requires candidates to compete for them. Accordingly, we conclude that these cases are not controlling.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Because the provision of \u00a7 9-410 (c) prohibiting any person from circulating petitions \u201cfor more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position\u201d imposes only a slight burden on core political speech, we conclude that the provision is not subject to strict scrutiny. Rather, \u201cwe apply a relaxed standard of review, according to which the restrictions generally are valid so long as they further an important state interest.\u201d <em>Lopez Torres </em>v. <em>New York State Board of Elections, </em>supra, 462 F.3d 184; see also <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 788 (\u201cthe [sjtate\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In the companion case of <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 566-67, we stated that \u201c[t]he relevant portion of \u00a7 9-410 (c) was enacted in 1978 in response to certain events that had occurred during a municipal primary in New Britain. See Public Acts 1978, No. 78-125 (P.A. 78-125); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Elections, 1978 Sess., p. 11, remarks of Claire Jacobs, vice chairman of the state elections commission. According to Jacobs, it was believed that a candidate in that primary had circulated petitions for another candidate for the same office in order to draw votes from a third, stronger candidate. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, pp. 11-13. Gloria Schaffer, then secretary of the state, testified in support of P.A. 78-125 that the legislation was designed to eliminate some specific abuses that have occurred and by prohibiting the circulation of petitions for rival candidates, the bill would [prevent] . . . the somewhat unfair tactics of siphoning off the votes of a strong rival to a weaker one . . . . Id., p. 4.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held with respect to restrictions on ballot access for candidates in a general election that \u201ca [s]tate has a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot. ... In so doing, the [s]tate understandably and properly seeks to prevent the clogging of its election machineiy [and to] avoid voter confusion .... Moreover, a [s]tate has an interest, if not a duty, to protect the integrity of its political processes from frivolous or fraudulent candidacies.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 732-33; see also <em>Citizens of John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>supra, 794 F.2d 1260 (\u201cthere is ... a potential for confusion if a circulator identified as the agent of one party suddenly solicits signatures for another party or an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>candidate\u201d); <em>Citizens of John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>supra, 1261 (state has interest in preventing \u201cmaneuvers that could affect the quality of the candidates who will be on the ballot\u201d). The United States Supreme Court also has held that the state has an interest in restricting \u201cindependent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel\u201d and in imposing a \u201cbarrier to a [political] party fielding an \u2018independent\u2019 candidate to capture and bleed off votes . . . that might well go to another party.\u201d <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We conclude that this reasoning applies equally to restrictions on ballot access for candidates in primary elections. The purpose of the relevant provision of \u00a7 9-410 (c) is to prevent the creation of frivolous candidacies intended solely to siphon votes from another candidate of the same party for the benefit of a favored candidate. If a political party\u2019s capacity to field an independent candidate in a general election for the puipose of siphoning votes from another party\u2019s candidate constitutionally may be restricted, then, a fortiori, an individual\u2019s capacity to qualify as a candidate in a primary election for the purpose of siphoning votes from another candidate of the same party constitutionally may be restricted. The legislature reasonably could have concluded that such conduct tends to be motivated by pique or personal interests rather than the genuine interests of the party or public, clogs the election machinery, creates voter confusion and unreasonably interferes with the party\u2019s long-term political goals. Moreover, the legislature reasonably could have believed that requiring candidates to compete for circulators would increase the quality of the candidates and invigorate the electoral process. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 9-410 (c) furthers important state interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Gonzalez claims, however, that \u00a7 9-410 (c) is ineffective in achieving its purpose because \u201c[c]andidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>could simply enlist additional circulators to help a weaker candidate circulate petitions and therefore avoid violating the statute. \u201d We disagree. The legislature reasonably could have believed that, even though the provision would not restrict the pool of eligible circulators, it would make it significantly more difficult for a siphon candidate to recruit circulators and to qualify to appear on the ballot. In any event, a statute that imposes only a slight burden on free speech may be less than perfectly effective without transgressing constitutional limits. <em>Citizens of John W. Moore Party </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>supra, 794 F.2d 1262. We conclude, therefore, that the provision of \u00a7 9-410 (c) that \u201c[n]o person shall circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position\u201d does not violate the right to free speech or association under the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\"> This appeal was argued on September 19,2007, pursuant to an expedited briefing and argument schedule.
