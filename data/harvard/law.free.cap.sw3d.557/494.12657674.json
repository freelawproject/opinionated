In one point on appeal, Rodgers asserts the trial court erred in overruling his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence in that there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he caused physical injury to Victim. Finding no merit to Rodgers' point, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

She was paralyzed on one half of her body, and was in the intensive care unit at the hospital. On June 18, 2015, Rodgers-Victim's blood relative-forcibly held a pillow over Victim's face and mouth until he was removed by hospital staff. Victim gasped for air when the pillow was removed, and her face was \"beet red.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rodgers was charged by felony information with the class C felony of domestic assault in the second degree, pursuant to section 565.073,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for \"knowingly caus[ing] physical injury to [Victim] by holding a pillow over her face to prevent her from breathing and [Victim] and [Rodgers] were family or household members in that [Victim] and [Rodgers] were adults who were related by blood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rodgers waived his right to a jury trial and a bench trial commenced on April 21, 2017.

The trial court denied that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court found Rodgers guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the class C felony of domestic assault in the second degree. The trial court sentenced Rodgers to three years in prison, to be served concurrently with other sentences he was currently serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal followed. Rodgers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence because there was insufficient evidence to show that he caused physical injury to Victim.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence is limited to whether the State has introduced adequate evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could have found each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

Rodgers' challenge is that there was insufficient evidence to show that he knowingly\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     caused physical injury\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The applicable charging information in this case asserted that \"on or about June 18, 2015, ...

She was \"totally paralyzed on one side and very weak.\" Rodgers yelled at Victim, grabbed a pillow, and forced it down over her face, fully covering Victim's mouth and nose. Victim \"couldn't fight him off because she was flaccid from her stroke.\" Hospital staff yelled at him to stop, but Rodgers persisted. Eventually, hospital staff were able to physically pull Rodgers away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A nurse who witnessed the incident was concerned that Victim \"would quit breathing and die.\" When hospital staff removed the pillow from Victim's face, her face was \"beet red\" and she gasped for air.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that Rodgers knowingly caused \"physical pain, illness, or impairment of physical condition[ ]\" to Victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State v.
