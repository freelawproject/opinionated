The first is whether a taxpayer who claims lack of notice from the taxing entity as a defense must pursue an available administrative remedy upon learning of the claimed tax liability. The second question is whether a taxpayer can avoid tax liabilities at trial based on affirmative defenses which were never raised in a defensive pleading. Under the facts of this case, we answer the first question \"yes\" (one must pursue administrative remedies) and the second question \"no\" (you can't rely on affirmative defenses you never pled). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The City of El Paso filed suit on May 18, 2009, over property taxes allegedly owed on some twenty-six specifically identified tracts of land that were or had been owned by Mountain Vista Builders, Inc. The tax\n   liabilities were claimed for various years between 2006 and 2008. Mountain Vista answered the suit, filing a general denial. In the years that followed, the City filed various partial non-suits over some of the specific tracts, apparently as the parties resolved the tax liabilities for specific pieces of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By the time the case was eventually set for trial in April of 2015, the only remaining claims involved the 2006 taxes owed on three specific tracts of land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mountain Vista did not contest that it owned those parcels on January 1, 2006, which is the relevant date for assessing property taxes. TEX.TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.07(a) (West 2015)(providing that generally property taxes are the personal obligation of the person who owns the property on January 1st of the year for which the tax is imposed). Instead, Mountain Vista presented testimony below that it was developing the properties by building homes, and in turn selling the developed tracts to interested buyers. For the time periods when Mountain Vista owned the properties, it forwarded any tax bill that it received to its accountant for payment. And as those home sales closed at the title company, any outstanding taxes due on the land should have been addressed before title passed to the new owners. According to Mountain Vista, the title company should have been alerted to any notice of a tax deficiency prior to closing. Mountain Vista's owner testified that he had no personal knowledge of what the title company had done with regard to identifying what taxes were due on the property at the time of closing. For the particular subdivision at issue, Mountain Vista built and sold some sixty homes and all the parcels were sold to the eventual buyers by 2010 or 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mountain Vista also presented evidence that its procedure of paying the taxes was hampered by the El Paso Central Appraisal District (CAD) which sent some tax notices to the wrong address. Mountain Vista had apparently changed its business address in 2009 and 2011. By 2013, Mountain Vista sent a certified letter to the CAD providing a correct address for all its tax notices. But even as late as 2015, some tax notices were delivered to the wrong address. Mountain Vista learned of the claimed delinquent tax bills on these properties from its bank around 2011. By that time, all the properties had been sold. The title company that closed the sales had gone out of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the bench trial, the City objected to much of this evidence. The City contended below that any claim of lack of notice must be first be presented to the CAD, and failing that, Mountain Vista failed to exhaust its administrative remedies which denied the district court jurisdiction over that defense. Mountain Vista agreed that it never filed any formal protest with CAD. The City also contended that Mountain Vista's general denial would not support any of its apparent arguments which were in the nature of affirmative defenses and therefore must be specifically pled. The trial court overruled each of these objections and eventually entered a take nothing judgment against the City. The trial court made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law which support that judgment on somewhat intertwined grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, the trial court entered findings supporting Mountain Vista's contention\n   that the taxing authority was sending tax notices to the wrong address. Second, the court entered a number of findings supporting Mountain Vista's claim that when any developed property was sold, the title company would have obtained from the City an amount shown as due, and would have paid that amount from the closing funds. According to the findings, the CAD published the amount of any tax due. The title company which handled the closing on the property asked the City for any amounts of tax due. The City would have responded and the title company would have been paid any amounts claimed as due. Finding of Fact No. Nine specified that the City \"allowed the closing on each and every parcel without indicating there was any other amount outstanding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court further found that no penalties and interest were due because the disputed taxes had been paid. The court expressly found any claim for additional amounts was \"waived.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We view the findings of fact and conclusions of law as addressing four possible defenses which the trial court accepted: (1) the taxes were already paid; (2) the City failed to provide notice of the tax due (and thus cannot claim penalties and interest); (3) the City's conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the closing sale conducted by the title company waived its right to seek additional sums; or (4) the City's conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the closing process estopped it from claiming any additional taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City brings three issues for review. It first contends that any claim of lack of notice must have been raised to the CAD in an administrative proceeding, and because Mountain Vista failed to do so, the district court had no jurisdiction over that defense. Second, the City claims that any evidence or finding based on an unpled affirmative defense is improper. Finally, in Issue Three, it attacks the portion of the trial court's judgment taxing costs against the City. Mountain Vista has not favored us with a brief. We sustain all three points and reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Texas Tax Code provides detailed administrative procedures for a property owner to contest its property taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 41.01 -.71 (West 2015);\n   <em>\n    Cameron Appraisal District v.

The Tax Code itself provides that unless the ground was raised administratively, affirmative defenses (other than some exceptional defenses not germane here) cannot be raised in a suit to collect delinquent taxes. TEX.TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 42.09. We recently applied this jurisdictional bar against a taxpayer who did not timely appeal an adverse administrative determination of a tax protest, and later attempted to raise the same issue as a counterclaim and defense in a tax delinquency suit.\n   <em>\n    Rio Valley, LLC v.

Similar to the claim here, the basis of the counterclaim and defense in\n   <em>\n    Rio Valley\n   </em>\n   was a claimed failure by the taxing authority to provide notice of tax bills, notice of delinquency, or notice of appraised property values.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909948\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/482/#p487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 485 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F-Star Socorro, L.P. v.

TEX.TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 31.01(a). If the tax is unpaid and becomes delinquent, the \"collector for a taxing unit shall deliver a notice of delinquency to each person whose name appears on the current delinquent tax roll.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093238\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/399/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 33.04(a).

And failure to give proper notice may be a defense to at least the penalties and interests that apply to unpaid taxes. Section 33.011 of the tax code provides that the governing body for a taxing unit \"shall waive penalties and may provide for the waiver of interest on a delinquent tax\" if some act or omission of the taxing unit (or its employees or agents) was to blame for the tax delinquency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300090\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/707/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 33.011(a)(1). To invoke this provision, the underlying tax must be paid not later than the 21st day after the date the taxpayer knows or should know of the delinquency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093238\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/399/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mountain Vista expressly argued below that the lack of notice prevented the assessment of interests and penalties being sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But this seems precisely the sort of question the CAD should have first addressed. It had the exclusive jurisdiction to first decide if an employee or agent committed an act or omission covered by Section 33.011. The CAD could have engaged in the rather complicated process of untangling the date when particular payments on the subject lots were made (or not made). It had access to the various notices that it would have sent out on these properties along with the addresses used, none of which were made a part of the appellate record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When the City objected that lack of notice must first be decided by the CAD, the trial court raised the paradox of how a party can challenge the lack of notice if they never received the notice in time to raise the issue. Before 2007, that paradox was in play because a party's timetable for raising a challenge to the tax might have expired by the time they learned about the tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indus.

Mountain Vista's representative testified he learned of these outstanding taxes sometime in 2011, although perhaps the suit filed in 2009 might also have provided notice. Whichever date is correct, a protest could have been filed within 125 days and fallen under the purview of Section 41.44(c-3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rio Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909948\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/482/#p487\">\n    441 S.W.3d at 488-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly holding that notice given after effective date of Section 41.44(c-3) would trigger application of that provision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Given that an avenue for challenging notice was available to Mountain Vista, we conclude any defense built on lack of notice should have been raised with the CAD at least within 125 days from when Mountain Vista learned of these particular tax delinquencies.

The City also objected as some of the evidence was admitted. Accordingly, we sustain Issue Two.\n   <em>\n    F-Star Socorro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945003\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/281/103/#p107\">\n    281 S.W.3d at 107-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding waiver of payment and off-set defenses in tax delinquency suit where the defenses were not pled).

In Issue Three, the City complains that TEX.TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 33.49 expressly prohibits that taxation of costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945003\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/281/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 33.49(a) (\"... a taxing unit is not liable in a suit to collect taxes for court costs, including any fees for service of process or electronic filing, an attorney ad litem, arbitration, or mediation, and may not be required to post security for costs.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Wichita Falls v.

We need not address whether the issue is waived, however, because we have reversed the judgment based on our resolution of Issues One and Two, which necessarily negates the taxation of costs. For that reason, we sustain Issue Three. To the extent this issue arises in this case in the future, we trust the trial court will follow the mandate of Section 33.49(a) and the Texas Supreme Court opinions which have applied it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hughes, J., not participating\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The tracts were identified in certified delinquent tax statements as property Account No. U819-999-011F-0017 (1.3388 acres); No. U819-999-011L-0013 (22.6305 acres); and No. U819-999-011E-0041 (0.7990 acres).
