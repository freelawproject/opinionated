PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 49.04, 49.09(b)(2) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). The trial court found appellant guilty, and after finding two prior felony conviction enhancements to be true,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   assessed punishment at twenty-five years imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205970400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.42(d). In his original brief, appellant complains the trial court erred by: (1) refusing to appoint a new attorney on the day of trial; (2) admitting blood sample evidence; (3) allowing fingerprint expert testimony and admitting prior judgments authenticated thereby; and (4) finding the evidence was sufficient to show two prior felony convictions. In his supplemental briefs, he asserts two additional issues, which we construe together: (1) the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce blood sample evidence at trial that was collected without a warrant and in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights; and (2) Section 724.012(b)(3)(B) of the Texas Transportation Code, which the State relied on to justify the search, is unconstitutional as applied. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   State trooper David Anguiano stopped appellant for driving without wearing a seat belt. Upon approaching appellant's car, Anguiano \"smelled the strong odor of some sort of alcoholic beverage coming from him\" and saw numerous open alcoholic beverages spread throughout the vehicle. Anguiano observed that appellant's movements were slow and that he had glassy, blood-shot eyes. After further investigation, including administering the standardized field sobriety tests, Anguiano\n   arrested appellant for driving while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Anguiano testified that appellant made \"a statement to the fact that it was a felony D.W.I. for him.\" Anguiano then \"ran [appellant's] information\" with his in-car computer and verified appellant's criminal history with the communications operator who informed Anguiano that appellant had two prior DWI convictions. Due to appellant's allegedly belligerent behavior, a different officer transported appellant to the hospital while Anguiano followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hospital, Anguiano tried to obtain appellant's consent to take a blood specimen. When consent was not forthcoming, Anguiano informed appellant the blood draw was mandatory. Approximately one hour after the initial traffic stop, a certified medical technologist took a sample of appellant's blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Anguiano did not obtain a search warrant to collect appellant's blood sample. Instead, Anguiano relied solely on Texas Transportation Code section 724.012(b)(3)(B), which he interpreted to mean \"you're authorized to conduct a mandatory blood draw on-if we have probable cause to believe that the person has two previous convictions ... for D.W.I. ...\" After the blood was drawn and delivered to the Texas Department of Public Safety lab, Emily Bonvino, a forensic scientist, performed a chemical analysis of appellant's blood. During trial, she testified that appellant's blood sample contained .21 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Over appellant's objection on constitutional grounds, the trial court admitted the blood evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BLOOD DRAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant complains that the results of the blood test should have been excluded because his blood sample was taken in violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. amend. IV. The State argues that appellant's blood was seized pursuant to the Fourth Amendment exception of consent because section 724.012(b) of the Texas Transportation Code implies a person's consent to a blood draw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. \u00a7 724.012(b) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). The State also defends the blood draw under the automobile, search-incident-to-arrest, and special needs exceptions.

The State asserts that section 724.012(b) and a search warrant signed by a magistrate are collateral sources of authority. This interpretation is incorrect. While we agree with the State that the language of section 724.012(b) requires an officer to obtain a blood sample if the officer learns that a\n   DWI suspect has two previous DWI convictions, there is no language in the statute giving the officer authority to effect a search without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
