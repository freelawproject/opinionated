Attorneys raise four points on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in entering a judgment for sanctions of $75,000 because Attorneys did not act in bad faith and were not afforded the procedural protections provided by Rule 55.03; (2) the trial court erred in granting Father's motion for sanctions and entering a judgment for $25,000 in favor of Father because Attorneys did not engage in sanctionable conduct, Father failed to comply with the procedural protections required by law, and there was no evidence that Father incurred any additional attorney's fees as a result of Attorneys' conduct; (3) the trial court erred in entering a sanctions judgment for a total of $100,000 because the penalty was punitive in nature and the trial court failed to provide Attorneys with the procedural protections required by Rule 36.01 for a finding of criminal contempt; and (4) the trial court erred in granting Father's motion for sanctions in violation of both the Missouri and United States Constitutions, Rule 55.03, and Judicial Canons 2A and 3B because the trial court relied on improper evidence, and Attorneys were deprived of both notice and a hearing at the time the evidence was received.

The court then entered judgment, finding that Attorneys had \"violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 4-3.4, regarding contact with opposing parties' expert witnesses and Rule 56.01 of the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure\"; that their \"behavior ... in the above cause[ ] ha[d] been in bad faith, ... abusive to the Court, opposing counsel and their own client, as well as a threat to the legal process, the legal profession, and the community at large.\" The court ordered sanctions in the amount of $75,000, payable to Father.

More specifically, Attorneys argued that (1) the trial court erred in granting Father's motion for sanctions in violation of both the Missouri and United States Constitutions, Rule 55.03, and Judicial Canons 2A and 3B because the trial court relied on improper evidence, and Attorneys were deprived of both notice and a hearing at the time the evidence was received; (2) the trial court erred in granting sanctions pursuant to its inherent authority because there was no evidence of bad faith; and (3) the trial court erred in entering a sanctions judgment because the penalty was punitive in nature and the trial court failed to provide Attorneys with the procedural protections required by Rule 36.01 for a finding of criminal contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We rejected Mother's challenge to the court's refusal to disqualify itself for bias because none \"of the cited instances of purportedly prejudicial conduct r[o]se to a level requiring recusal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371956\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/71/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371956\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/71/#p74\">\n    at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, we issued specific directions on remand regarding the nature and scope of the hearing to be held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   On remand, the circuit court is ordered to provide proper notice of a hearing to Ms. Pingel, Mr. Davis, and their law firm on the motion for sanctions and alleged bad-faith conduct and to conduct a limited hearing. Because the motion for reconsideration of the court's oral pronouncement of the sanction judgment specified that counsel were precluded at trial from presenting the testimony of Dr. Gentry relating to their letter to Dr. Schwartz, they may present this witness and testimony to the extent it differs from or adds anything to the Gentry affidavit filed with their motion to intervene. If the parties and circuit court agree that additional witnesses, evidence or argument would clarify the issues, such evidence may be introduced and such argument may be heard. The court may, on remand, consider all of the proceedings to date and the filings, motions, actions by counsel in open court, and evidence adduced in this proceeding to date, and prior proceedings in reaching its decision regarding sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993869\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/856/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Francis v. Wieland\n   </em>\n   was issued, Father's counsel served a notice on Attorneys of her intent to call the matter up for a hearing. All parties appeared on May 1, 2017, at which time the court set the hearing for July 21, 2017. Over the objection of Father's counsel and the GAL, the trial court advised Attorneys that it would allow them to present whatever evidence they wished, but they would be limited to a total of two hours in which to do so. Though Attorneys protested, claiming they needed two days to present evidence, they, in fact, concluded their case in just over one hour. Attorneys presented testimony from Dr. Gentry, Attorney Davis, Attorney Pingel, and former Missouri Supreme Court Judge Edward \"Chip\" Robertson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Attorney Davis testified that the 260-page request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was actually a draft document that had been signed and submitted in error. Attorney Davis acknowledged intentionally scheduling a deposition for a Saturday in direct violation of the court's order, but claimed that Saturday was the only day his witness was available. Attorney Davis further testified that the deposition of Father took so long because Father was a recalcitrant witness and offered many evasive responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Attorney Pingel testified that she believed they were operating within the bounds of the law in communicating with Dr. Schwartz and that they were extending professional courtesy in giving her the opportunity to correct perceived factual inaccuracies in her report. Dr. Gentry testified that he believed a letter to Dr. Schwartz, pointing out any factual errors, was professionally appropriate. Attorney Pingel further testified that their contact with Dr. Schwartz was permissible under the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Hamid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993869\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/856/51/\">\n    856 S.W.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 1993). Robertson testified that he participated in the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   decision while serving on the Missouri Supreme Court, and he understood the case to hold that, \"once the expert has been identified and a report has been given or even in this case as a deposition has been given it's perfectly within the\n   rules to have an ex parte conversation provided it is merely to correct and that sort of thing.\" Robertson further testified that, before a court may sanction counsel under its inherent authority, there must be evidence that counsel acted in bad faith, and he did not see anything he would find amounting to bad faith in the case. Robertson also testified that, when sanctions are ordered, the money usually does not go to the opposing party but instead goes into the court registry or to a charity of the judge's choice. He further indicated that, if monetary sanctions were ordered payable to the opposing party or opposing counsel, there typically needed to be evidence that the opposing party was forced to expend money unnecessarily as a result of the sanctionable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court entered a new Judgment for Sanctions. In the new judgment, the court found that, despite Attorney Davis's testimony, the request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was intentionally filed, knowing that they would require opposing counsel and the court to take steps, involving time and cost, to address it. With respect to the Saturday deposition, the court noted that Attorney Davis failed to seek consent or leave of the court before scheduling the deposition, in an intentional violation of the court's order. As to the letter to Dr. Schwartz, the court rejected Attorney Pingel's characterization of it as a mere offer to correct factual inaccuracies and found, instead, that it was \"more akin to witness tampering,\" which would not be permissible under\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that, \"upon the opportunity provided pursuant to the Mandate of the Court of Appeals, no reasonable explanation has been provided for the behavior mentioned herein or in this Court's previous Judgment for Sanctions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court then addressed the amount and nature of the sanctions to be imposed. In doing so, the court first discussed the amount of fees Attorneys had charged in order to determine what an appropriate amount for sanctions would be. The court noted that Attorneys had received more than $400,000 in fees, which the court found \"is not normal or reasonable for a ... custody modification case, no matter what the issues may be or how complex they may be.\" The court determined that \"[t]he mere charging of such a fee in a case of this nature shocks the conscience of the Court and holds the legal profession out for public ridicule and unnecessary criticism.\" Then, relying on Robertson's testimony, the court modified its previous sanctions judgment so that the $75,000 award would be divided up amongst various charities rather than given to Father, but the court also determined that sanctions in the form of attorney's fees were warranted to compensate Father for fees he incurred in responding to Attorneys' abusive pleadings, and it determined that $25,000 was an adequate amount. Attorneys appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"A trial court's imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    A.J.H. ex rel.

Here, as the trial court found, Attorneys' letter to Dr. Schwartz accused her of being \"incorrect\" and \"unfair\" and repeatedly emphasized Attorneys' connection with Dr. Schwartz's colleagues \"in an apparent attempt to pressure Dr. Schwartz to change her report and therefore, her testimony.\" The letter specifically identified Dr. Gentry when \"giving information as to how Dr. Schwartz's interview and testing process was not like that of the other experts.\" The trial court concluded that the letter itself went beyond mere requests for corrections and instead was \"more akin to witness tampering.\" We agree and see no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Regarding the discovery propounded on the GAL, Attorneys merely argue that it was conducted in good faith; they do not address the court's concern about their threat to compel the minor child to respond if the GAL failed to do so.

Attorneys also do not address the court's concerns about their misrepresentation regarding ethical complaints against Dr. Utley or the excessively lengthy deposition of Father.

When the hearing was held on remand, Attorneys were fully aware of the conduct the trial court found to have been conducted in bad faith, and they fully participated in the hearing, even beyond the scope of that allowed in our mandate. But the court nevertheless found that \"no reasonable explanation has been provided for the behavior mentioned\" in either sanctions judgment.

But the court's judgment modifying the prior sanctions judgment in this manner was expressly based on \"the legal analysis provided by [Attorneys'] own expert witness[, Robertson]\" at the remand hearing. Because Robertson's testimony, upon which this claim of error is based, exceeded the scope of our mandate in\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

The sanctions judgment was not a criminal contempt judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In their third point on appeal, Attorneys argue that the $100,000 sanctions judgment was punitive in nature and, thus, had to comply with the procedural protections afforded by Rule 36.01 pertaining to criminal contempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To begin, nothing in either the 2016 or 2017 sanctions judgments reflects a purpose to punish. Rather, both judgments expressly state that the purpose of ordering the monetary sanctions is \"to encourage and 'provide incentive' [to Attorneys] to behave appropriately\" and \"discourage [Attorneys] from further behavior which is in bad faith,\" and \"deter this type of conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, even though \"[t]he power of criminal contempt [also] springs ... from the inherent power of the courts to protect the judicial system,\"\n   <em>\n    Teefey v.

In other words, we have already determined that the trial court could properly rely on the very evidence Attorneys now claim was improperly before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the case upon which Attorneys purportedly relied when drafting their 44-page letter to Dr. Schwartz-\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Hamid\n   </em>\n   -expressly put them on notice that the manner in which they discussed potential corrections with Dr. Schwartz might very well cross the line into the crime of witness tampering or a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Despite the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   opinion's express warning that, \"when ... an attorney emphasizes his or her connections with an expert's colleagues or superiors-especially when unrelated to the case-it may constitute a form of pressure on an expert's decision to testify,\" and, \"[i]n some circumstances, such pressure may constitute a violation of an attorney's ethical duties or the criminal law,\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993869\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/856/51/\">\n    856 S.W.2d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Attorneys nonetheless repeatedly cited Dr. Gentry in their letter to Dr. Schwartz when strongly suggesting that Dr. Schwartz's methodology was flawed and claiming that Attorneys were simply providing her an opportunity to correct factual errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, even if we had not granted the trial court express authority to consider the very evidence about which Attorneys now complain, and even if the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   opinion had not put Attorneys on notice that their conduct might be problematic, on remand, Attorneys received a hearing at which they were presented with the very opportunity they claim to have been denied-a full hearing to explain how their conduct did not amount to bad faith. Though Attorneys complain that the hearing was limited, as we noted in subsection A above, Attorneys were permitted by the trial court-contrary to our mandate-to present\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence they wished, and yet they still failed to convince the court that their conduct was rooted in anything other than bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Point IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The trial court did not err in its judgment ordering monetary sanctions against Attorneys either under its inherent authority or pursuant to Father's motion.
