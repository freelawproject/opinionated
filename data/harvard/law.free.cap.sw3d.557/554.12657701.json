It later sought reimbursement of those payments from any settlement proceeds the employee might receive from an allegedly liable third party. Ordinarily, Texas law grants it that right. But the policy in this case includes an endorsement waiving the carrier's right to recover from the third party sued by the employee. The carrier concedes it can't recover directly from the third party but insists it can recover indirectly from any settlement the third party pays to the employee. Standing on over twenty years of unanimous case law to the contrary, as well as Texas Department of Insurance rulings consistent with that case law, we disagree. The carrier signed away its right to recover benefits it paid to the employee and received a higher premium in exchange for assuming that risk. It cannot now seek to indirectly recover the same proceeds it agreed not to pursue directly. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   James Wedel, a truck driver for Cactus Transport, Inc., was injured on the job. The accident occurred while he was loading asphalt at a terminal owned by Western Refining Company, L.P. Wedel received workers'-compensation benefits from Cactus's insurance carrier, Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company (Underwriters). But he separately sued Western Refining for alleged negligence contributing to his accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To gain access to its terminals, Western Refining required Cactus to furnish workers'-compensation coverage to its employees. Western Refining also mandated that Cactus's workers'-compensation policy \"contain a waiver of subrogation rights\" against Western Refining. The parties agree this meant the policy must include a waiver of Underwriters' right to seek reimbursement directly from Western Refining for benefits Underwriters paid under Cactus's policy. It is also undisputed that Cactus paid a higher premium in exchange for Underwriters' assumption of that risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Underwriters nonetheless intervened in Wedel's lawsuit against Western Refining, asserting subrogation rights against it for past and future medical expenses and indemnity payments. Relying on the policy's subrogation waiver, Western Refining argued Underwriters had no right to recover. Underwriters later non-suited its intervention. Wedel and Western Refining then began settlement negotiations but reached an impasse when Underwriters announced it would seek reimbursement from any settlement paid to Wedel. Wedel then joined Underwriters as a third-party defendant. He moved for summary judgment declaring Underwriters had waived its right to recover any proceeds from the lawsuit, whether directly from Western Refining or indirectly from Wedel's recovery from Western Refining. The trial court granted summary judgment for Wedel. The court of appeals affirmed, concluding Wedel established that Underwriters \"contractually waived its statutory right of subrogation and this waiver encompasses the\n   right of reimbursement [against the employee] as well.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381633\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/518/615/#p630\">\n    518 S.W.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630 (Tex.

The parties call it a \"subrogation waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. DEP'T OF INS., TEXAS WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY MANUAL : WC 42 03 04 A (2d reprt. 2011). It reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   TEXAS WAIVER OF OUR RIGHT TO RECOVER FROM OTHERS ENDORSEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   We have the right to recover our payments from anyone liable for an injury covered by this policy.

Moreover, construing the waiver to insulate an employee would violate the waiver's proviso that it not \"operate directly or indirectly to benefit anyone not named in the schedule.\" Taken as a whole, Underwriters contends, the provision can be interpreted only to waive its \"subrogation right\" against Western Refining, a right Underwriters considers statutorily distinct from its \"reimbursement right\" against the employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Wedel insists the waiver also bars Underwriters' right to reimbursement from any proceeds he recovers from Western Refining. The waiver relinquishes Underwriters' \"right to recover\" from Western\n   Refining, which includes direct recovery from Western Refining or indirect recovery from funds it pays to Wedel. Either way, Wedel argues, the proceeds constitute a recovery from Western Refining even if they first pass through him. Wedel further points out that this is the only waiver of subrogation rights the department has approved for use in Texas. And every court that has interpreted it has concluded that it waives a carrier's right to reimbursement from an injured employee's recovery. He also maintains that Underwriters' interpretation of the waiver frustrates the rationale for paying a higher premium for the waiver. The practical effect of Underwriters' reading of the waiver, Wedel claims, would be that he could settle with Western Refining for only an amount that would satisfy Underwriters' eventual reimbursement claim against him. This scenario effectively forces the third party to reimburse the carrier, which is exactly what the employer paid a higher premium to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"A declaratory judgment granted on a traditional motion for summary judgment is reviewed de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Kachina Pipeline Co. v.

In light of the unanimity in these decisions, we find it noteworthy, though not dispositive, that the department has not substantively altered the endorsement. If the department believes its endorsement has been misinterpreted, it certainly has had ample time to revise the text and clarify its intent. Instead, two recent administrative orders the department's Division of Workers' Compensation\n   benefit-review officers have issued construing the waiver reflect an interpretation consistent with unanimous judicial precedent. TEX. DEP'T OF INS. ,\n   <em>\n    Decision and Order\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. HE-10324483-02-CC-HI043 (Apr. 21, 2014) (\"Carrier waived its right to reimbursement and/or subrogation under Texas Labor Code \u00a7 417.001 and \u00a7 417.002.\"); TEX. DEP'T OF INS. ,\n   <em>\n    Decision and Order\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. HW-11293057-01-CC-HW42 (Mar. 29, 2016) (\"Carrier contractually waived its statutory right to subrogation as to the workers' compensation benefits paid to the Claimant, which include reimbursement for benefits it has paid or credit for benefits it will pay in the future.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The courts' and the department's interpretations are consistent with the endorsement's plain language. The endorsement is titled \"Texas Waiver of Right to Recover from Others Endorsement\" and provides that a carrier that agrees to the endorsement waives its \"right to recover.\" It then recognizes the carrier's \"right to recover our payments from anyone liable for an injury covered by this policy\" but provides that the carrier \"will not enforce that right against\" the named third party. The question is whether an effort to collect from settlement proceeds that third party pays to an injured employee-an obvious end-around to avoid the waiver-is any less an attempt to \"enforce\" the right the carrier has contractually waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We conclude it is not. Under the endorsement, the waiver of a carrier's \"right to recover\" from the third party named in the schedule includes both a direct recovery from the third party and an indirect recovery from proceeds the third party pays to an injured employee. There is no meaningful difference between the two. Under either scenario, the reimbursement the carrier attains flows from the third party. True, the waiver speaks to the carrier's right to recover from liable third parties, not injured employees. But any settlement the employee receives from the carrier\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a recovery from a liable third party. Once paid, the money belongs to the employee, but it did not exist before the third party made the payment to dispose of the employee's lawsuit. The waiver's language does not compel us to ignore the source of the proceeds the carrier seeks to capture simply because they flowed through the employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Both Underwriters and the dissent argue, however, that we must read the endorsement in light of the separate and distinct rights of a workers'-compensation carrier to \"subrogation\" and \"reimbursement\" found in Labor Code sections 417.001 and 417.002 -the former being the carrier's ability to \"enforce the liability of the third party in the name of the injured employee,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 417.001(b), and the latter being the statutory mandate that the \"net amount recovered by a claimant in a third-party action shall be used to reimburse the insurance carrier,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 417.002(a). Considered against this statutory backdrop, Underwriters and the dissent contend the endorsement addresses only a carrier's subrogation interest, not its statutory right to recover proceeds from an injured employee who settles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Courts that have considered the distinction in this context-including the court of appeals in this case-have rejected it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wedel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381633\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/518/615/#p630\">\n    518 S.W.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n construing Sections 417.001 and 417.002, we observe that an insurance carrier's right of subrogation encompasses the right of reimbursement, and consequently encompasses the right to recover for benefits paid and to a credit against future benefits.\");\n   <em>\n    SM Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206100303\">\n    2012 WL 6100303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"Courts applying Texas law do not distinguish between a carrier's subrogation\n   and reimbursement rights in the Worker's Compensation Act context.\");\n   <em>\n    Buckland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009995\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/882/440/#p445\">\n    882 S.W.2d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] carrier's subrogation interest includes its right to reimbursement as well as its right to future amounts for which it is relieved of liability.\"). But even if we accepted the distinction, our reading of the waiver would not change. Although the endorsement may be called, colloquially, a \"subrogation waiver,\" neither the word \"subrogation\" nor \"reimbursement\" actually appears in its text. Whether the two amount to independent statutory rights is a question separate from and unnecessary to interpreting the waiver's language. The question, as we see it, is simply whether the carrier's waiver of its \"right to recover\" against the third party is limited to only a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   recovery against the third party. And we see nothing in the waiver compelling that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, Underwriters' and the dissent's reading of the waiver undermines the rationale for having such a waiver in the first place. The carrier requires a higher premium payment on policies that include the waiver. Why? Because the carrier is giving up the right to seek reimbursement from a liable third party if it has to pay workers'-compensation benefits following an accident. If an accident occurs, the carrier is on the hook regardless of fault and cannot proceed directly against the third party. But what if it could sit back and wait for the employee to recover from the third party and then get the same money from him? The practical effect would be that the third party's cost for resolving the case has increased, likely by the amount it would have had to pay the carrier if there had never been a waiver. The carrier's pending reimbursement claim will be taken into account during settlement negotiations and influence the amount necessary to dispose of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This is not speculation-it is exactly what happened in this case. Settlement negotiations halted once Underwriters announced its intention to seek reimbursement from those proceeds. Despite the waiver, Underwriters sought the same money through the back door that it could not get through the front. Underwriters' position drove up the cost of settling the case, with Underwriters poised to claim the same money from Wedel that it could not get from Western Refining. Under these facts, the value of the case is the same as if there had been no waiver at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nor are we persuaded that the waiver's admonition that it \"shall not operate directly or indirectly to benefit anyone not named in the Schedule\" allows the carrier to pursue the employee's settlement. First, if our reading of the waiver benefits the employee at all, it benefits the third party-the one named in the Schedule-more. As explained above, the third party is better off if the carrier cannot recover against the employee, because the third party is then free to negotiate with the employee without a carrier's pending reimbursement claim driving up the cost to settle. Again, this is the reason for the waiver and the corresponding higher premium in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9458762\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/59/254/#p259\">\n    59 S.W.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The third party having the benefit of the waiver is free to negotiate a settlement with the injured employee without having to pay additional to the employee to cover any subrogation of compensation of workers' compensation benefits.\"). In the event of an accident for which it was liable, Western Refining preferred to face only the injured employee rather than both the employee and his employer's workers'-compensation carrier-and required Cactus to pay a premium for that privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, although the employee might on occasion incidentally benefit from the waiver, he benefits less than the third party, if\n   at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9458762\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/59/254/#p259\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The fact the third parties' settlement amount is lowered doesn't necessarily mean the employee is benefitted.\"). Certainly, a carrier's claim for reimbursement can drive up the cost of settling an injured employee's claim. But it does not necessarily follow that the employee will net a smaller recovery; it means only that the injured employee and the settling third party will have to take the carrier's reimbursement claim into consideration. The liable third party might ultimately pay more overall to satisfy both claims, but this would not necessarily benefit the injured employee. It is conceivable that a third party might be unable to be as generous in settling with an injured employee as it would if it did not have to also satisfy a carrier's reimbursement claim. But it is also possible that the injured employee would receive the same amount either way. In any event, the possibility that an injured employee might indirectly benefit from the waiver in some cases does not cancel out the fact that the liable third party benefits more in every case that includes a subrogation waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The dissent reads the waiver more narrowly. Its interpretation of the text is not unreasonable, but text is rarely interpreted on a blank slate. As we have mentioned, in this case we interpret the waiver's language to effect agency intent, and the department has acquiesced in decades of unanimous precedent from our courts of appeals and a federal district court interpreting the waiver as Wedel urges and has affirmed that interpretation in its own administrative rulings. We still must ask if the waiver's plain language supports that interpretation-the practical fallout of our reading of a policy cannot control the meaning we assign to the text used. But in this case, we see nothing in the waiver's language that compels us to undercut decades of settled and unanimous precedent, the department's interpretation of its own waiver, or the allocation-of-risk considerations for using a subrogation waiver-and charging a higher premium for it-in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The waiver in this case forecloses Wausau's right to recover from a liable third party.

Second, the endorsement on which Wedel bases his argument was obtained by Wedel's employer, Cactus, to comply with Western's written contractual requirement that Cactus's workers' compensation policy be endorsed with a waiver of the carrier's right of subrogation. The requirement was not that the policy be endorsed to waive the carrier's right to both subrogation\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    reimbursement. Third, the endorsement to Wausau's policy, according to its plain, explicit language, only precluded Wausau from \"enforc[ing] [its] right\" against Western to recover for payments Wausau paid to Cactus's employees.

But, under such circumstances, section 417.002 effectively relegates the carrier to paying benefits and then waiting on the employee to prosecute a third-party action. If the employee chooses not to do so, or if the employee does not succeed in recovering on a third-party action, then the carrier has no pathway for recovering from a third party for the benefits it paid, or will pay, to the employee. Under section 417.002, it is only if the employee recovers from a liable third party that the carrier has the right to be reimbursed, and even then, the statute does not give the carrier the right to\n    recover its costs in addition to reimbursement for the amounts paid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In sum, where the carrier has subrogation rights under section 417.001, it is entitled to directly bring and directly participate in suits against third parties. Under that section, the subrogated carrier is in charge of its own destiny as to prosecuting a third-party claim to recoup payments it has made to the injured employee, obtaining credit for those it is obligated to make in the future, and recovering its costs, including attorney's fees, in addition to reimbursement. When the carrier has only reimbursement rights pursuant to section 417.002, it is neither in charge of its own destiny vis-a-vis prosecuting a third-party claim nor statutorily entitled to recover its costs in addition to the amount it paid, or will pay, to the employee from the amount received from the third party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    So when does the statutory language matter? That is, in which situations does a carrier not have subrogation rights but has only reimbursement rights? As explained below, under the clear, plain language of sections 417.001 and 417.002, this is one such situation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

The Meaning of the Language Is Clear\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Court says that the actual intent of the parties when entering into workers' compensation contracts in Texas is immaterial because the policy forms are mandated by a state agency.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 557 (citing\n    <em>\n     Progressive Cty.

It also notes that \"[i]n construing such forms, we strive to 'determine the ordinary, everyday meaning of the words to the general public.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 557 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Progressive Cty.

The problem is that the Court does not adhere to this latter statement regarding construing this form.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    As related to this controversy, the Terminal Agreement was simple and clear. It required Cactus to maintain workers' compensation insurance that contained a \"waiver of subrogation against the Western Entities,\" with \"Western Entities\" being defined as \"Western, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies, and their respective officers, agents and employees.\" What the contract did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    require was waiver of the carrier's statutory right of reimbursement, as is provided for by section 417.002 of the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The endorsement to Cactus's policy began by reiterating Wausau's statutory right to recover payments it made under the policy \"from anyone liable for an injury covered by this policy.\" In the next sentence, Wausau agreed that it would \"not enforce our right against the person or organization named in the Schedule, but this waiver applies only ... where you are required by a written contract to obtain this waiver from us.\" The endorsement contained no additional language waiving rights as to any other person or entity. And the written contract between Cactus and Western required only that the workers' compensation policy be endorsed \"to contain a waiver of subrogation against the WESTERN ENTITIES.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court concludes that \"the waiver of a carrier's 'right to recover' from a third party named in the schedule includes both a direct recovery from [Western] and an indirect recovery from proceeds paid by [Western] to an injured employee,\" such as Wedel.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 558. It further posits that \"[t]here is no meaningful difference between the two.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 558. I disagree with both conclusions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    As to the first statement, the policy waives only Wausau's right to recover from Western. Recovery by Wausau from Wedel, regardless of whether those funds originated with Western, is not waived by the policy language because under these facts, Wedel is not a person \"liable for an injury covered by this policy.\" The Court asserts that a reading of the language to waive only subrogation rights against third parties instead of waiving both subrogation rights as well as reimbursement rights, as referenced in section 417.002, \"undermines the rationale for having such a waiver in the first place.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 559. The response to that statement is four-fold. First, the endorsement language specifies that it precludes Wausau from exercising its rights \"against the person or organization named in the Schedule,\" which is just what Western contracted for. Second, the endorsement unambiguously and simply specifies that the endorsement \"shall not operate directly or indirectly to benefit anyone not named in the Schedule.\" Wedel is not named in the schedule, yet the Court's interpretation manifestly benefits him both directly and indirectly. And there is no evidence or contention that Western's contractual requirement for waiver of subrogation by the carrier was intended to benefit Cactus or its employees who might be injured. Third, the Act specifies that carriers have rights of both subrogation as\n    to third parties liable for injuries to covered employees and reimbursement in the event the carrier does not have or does not assert a right of subrogation against a third party like Western. And fourth, Western's requirement was transparently intended to protect the interests of the Western Entities, as specified in its contract with Cactus and as discussed below, not to benefit Cactus's employees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    As to the Court's second statement, a brief review of the previous discussion regarding subrogation and reimbursement, as addressed by sections 417.001 and 417.002, demonstrates that there indeed is a meaningful difference in how the two are treated by the Act. First, the Act addresses the two in different sections. TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 417.001, .002. Second, an insurer who is subrogated to the rights of another-such as Wausau is, or would be except for the waiver, subrogated to the rights of Wedel-steps into the shoes of the party to whose rights it is subrogated and obtains all the rights of that party related to recovery of amounts paid to it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Guillot v. Hix\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997412\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/838/230/#p232\">\n     838 S.W.2d 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 232 (Tex. 1992) (stating that the rights conferred by subrogation are derivative of the subrogor's interests, to which the subrogee succeeds). The right of reimbursement in section 417.002 does not afford the carrier such extensive rights and, in most instances, will result in a lesser recovery than would be obtained under section 417.001.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Further, the Court goes beyond the language of the endorsement and talks about the \"rationale for having such a waiver.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 559. But \"rationale\" does not trump the express language of the endorsement in context of the statutory provisions. By implying that it does, the Court second-guesses and encroaches on the Legislature's exercise of its policy-making function when it enacted sections 417.001 and 417.002 and their clear, separate treatment of subrogation and reimbursement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Town of Flower Mound v. Stafford Estates Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241404\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/135/620/#p628\">\n     135 S.W.3d 620\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 628 (Tex. 2004) (\"[T]he State's public policy is reflected in its statutes.\" (quoting\n    <em>\n     Tex. Commerce Bank, N.A. v.

Further, the Court's \"rationale\" discussion fails to justify its position. The rights of subrogation and reimbursement are distinct and have different characteristics, as noted above. A waiver as to subrogation alone provides value to both a policy holder and potential third-party defendant. A waiver of subrogation prevents claims and lawsuits brought by a carrier-whose business generally is adjusting and paying claims with money received through premiums and collateral activities like recovering on subrogation claims and litigating regularly-to recover benefits paid to covered employees, even if the employees choose not to bring suit. This alone would be worth a premium to a policy holder, such as Cactus, that is seeking to interact or do business with an entity such as Western. And it would be of value to Western to have a workers' compensation carrier, whose business model includes litigating, removed from the decision-making process regarding potential third-party claims and suits against Western. Finally, even if Western intended to acquire a waiver as to both subrogation and reimbursement (an intent not expressed in the simple, clear language of its agreement with Cactus), we have consistently held that the intent of parties to an insurance contract does not matter-it is the policy language that matters.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Greene v.

It waives only Wausau's right to assert a claim against or sue an alleged tortfeasor (such as Western) if that tortfeasor is party to a written contract requiring the waiver. Here, the only parties to the written contract were Cactus and Western. Because Wedel is not a party to that contract, the endorsement does not apply to impair Wausau's rights as to him-which are the rights of reimbursement specified in section 417.002 of the Act. And to the extent the Court discusses the premiums paid by Cactus for the endorsement, how the premiums were calculated is beyond anything in this record other than the parties do not dispute that Cactus paid a premium for the endorsement to its policy. The question is: What did the endorsement do and thus what did Cactus pay for? The answer is: It clearly and unambiguously waived only Wausau's right to \"enforce our right [to recover payments] against the person or organization named in the Schedule.\" That person or organization was not Wedel, it was the \"Western Entities.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Noticeably absent from the contract between Western and Cactus, as well as from the endorsement, is any indication that Cactus or Western intended for Wedel or any other Cactus employee who was injured on the job to receive a double recovery in the nature of both workers' compensation benefits and recovery from Western on a third-party claim. Further, permitting Wedel to receive both workers' compensation benefits and a recovery from Western free of Wausau's right to reimbursement amounts to a clear benefit in violation of the endorsement's explicit provision stating that \"[t]his endorsement shall not operate directly or indirectly to benefit anyone not named in the Schedule.\" To reiterate, Wedel is not named in the schedule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The Court discusses the practicalities of the carrier's subrogation and reimbursement rights under the statute and the endorsement, and says that those rights cause problems in settling claims like those Wedel made against Western.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 557. But such problems have existed since the Legislature enacted workers' compensation statutes and created the need to balance the interests of injured workers, carriers, and employers who pay premiums for insurance and whose premiums are affected by losses. There simply is unavoidable tension where multiple parties, with differing interests and motivations, are contesting liability for injuries, liquidating claims based on alleged liability for injuries, and allocating proceeds in settlement of claims. But those practicalities should not be the basis for interpreting language of an insurance policy endorsement. The language itself should be the basis. Nor should courts simply substitute their idea of a preferred settlement process for the unambiguous language of a binding contract.\n    <em>\n     Fiess v.

The Act is a detailed product of over one hundred years of adjusting various provisions in it by the Legislature with input from the various interests involved in the workers' compensation system. Sections 417.001 and 417.002 reflect that detail. So does the waiver endorsement promulgated by TDI.

I agree. The Court is correct that the\n    <em>\n     Buckland\n    </em>\n    opinion quotes a TDI waiver that is substantively the same as the one at issue in this case.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 559 (citing\n    <em>\n     Buckland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009995\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/882/440/#p445\">\n     882 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    441 ). In\n    <em>\n     Buckland\n    </em>\n    , however, the court of appeals stated, without analyzing the policy's language, that \"a carrier's subrogation interest includes its right to reimbursement as well as its right to future amounts.\"\n    <em>\n     Buckland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009995\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/882/440/#p445\">\n     882 S.W.2d at 445\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Wausau contends that the court's conflation of subrogation and reimbursement extended the approved waiver language beyond its plain meaning. Again, I agree. As discussed above, the language of the TDI-originated form waiver simply does not address a carrier's statutory right of reimbursement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court also notes that\n    <em>\n     SM Energy\n    </em>\n    addressed the same TDI waiver language and the issue was the same as presented here.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 557-59 (citing\n    <em>\n     SM Energy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206100303\">\n     2012 WL 6100303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 ). But again, without full analysis of the endorsement's language, the district court concluded that the endorsement waived the carrier's rights as to both subrogation and reimbursement on the basis that \"[c]ourts applying Texas law do not distinguish between a carrier's subrogation and reimbursement rights in the Worker[s'] Compensation Act context.\"\n    <em>\n     SM Energy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206100303\">\n     2012 WL 6100303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9. I disagree with this analysis as Texas law-the Workers' Compensation Act-clearly distinguishes between the two rights.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 417.001, .002.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    At the end of the day, while persuasive, the referenced opinions are not binding on this Court pursuant to our constitutional charge. TEX. CONST. art. IV, \u00a7 3 (stating that the Court's appellate jurisdiction shall be final). And the legislative acceptance doctrine-which the Court substantively references and which comes into play where interpretations of statutory law such as the sections of the Act involved here, are concerned-applies only where the relevant provisions have \"been interpreted by a court of last resort or given a longstanding construction by a proper administrative officer.\"\n    <em>\n     Tex.

This Court has never decided the issue before us today. And though the Court notes decisions of TDI administrative judges regarding the question, \"[a]nother element of the legislative acceptance doctrine is that the statute at issue must be ambiguous. Under the doctrine of legislative acceptance, an administrative agency's\n    construction of a statute cannot contradict the statute's plain meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     Fleming Foods of Tex., Inc. v.

Moreover, appeals from both TDI decisions the Court references remain pending in the courts-one in a district court and one in a court of appeals.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Liberty Mut.

But, as explained, neither the language of the endorsement nor that of sections 417.001 and 417.002 support the conclusion that subrogation and reimbursement are treated as one and the same. Authorities concluding otherwise are simply not consistent with language of the waiver and the relevant statutory provisions. Neither is the Court's conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Finally, while the \"decades of settled and unanimous\" case law the Court references does not serve as valid, binding precedent, even if it did, the doctrine of stare decisis is not absolute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sw.

Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Insurance policies and their endorsements are to be construed according to their plain language. Here, the endorsement did just what Cactus and Western contracted for: it waived Wausau's right to sue or make a claim against Western for the payments it made to and for the benefit of Wedel. If, as the Court says, the \"rationale\" for Wausau's endorsement requires waiver of both the carrier's right of subrogation and its right of reimbursement,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 559, then the rationale should be effected by the parties, who contract for the waiver, and TDI, which prescribes the language for such waivers. But the solution is not for the Court to construe an unambiguous insurance policy endorsement to say something it does not say. I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-97\">\n     Wausau argues that the endorsement did not waive its statutory right to subrogation, only its right to recover for payments it made. In my view, the distinction, if any, is not determinative of the issue before us and need not be addressed because the endorsement did not waive Wausau's reimbursement right. The Court refers to the rights in question as Wausau's rights of subrogation and reimbursement. I will do likewise to avoid confusion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-98\">\n     Both James Wedel and his wife, Michelle, were parties to the suit filed against Western.
