He raises five points on appeal challenging the trial court's grant of Defendants' various motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
