The plaintiffs seek declaratory and prospective injunctive relief to stop numerous public officials named as defendants from continuing to engage in allegedly ultra vires acts in connection with the operation of the county's truancy program. After several hearings on numerous motions filed by the parties, the trial court signed a final judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' claims and assessing attorney's fees and sanctions against the plaintiffs and their attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs and their attorneys raise twelve issues. In their first two issues, the plaintiffs and their attorneys contend that the final judgment is void and that the trial judge should have been disqualified. In their remaining issues, the plaintiffs and their attorneys contend that the trial judge erred in granting a Texas Citizens Participation Act motion to dismiss filed by certain defendants and denying a \"counter\" motion to dismiss filed by the plaintiffs, granting certain defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction and Rule 91a motions, denying class certification, and awarding sanctions and attorney's fees. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants are Verakisha Roach and Jeremy Brady, the parents of children who received summonses to appear in a Fort Bend County truancy court, and their attorneys at trial, Deron Harrington, Susan Soto, Carol Anhalt, and Percy Isgitt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees are numerous Fort Bend County public officials, including the county judge and county commissioners, the school district trustees, judges of the Fort Bend district and county courts at law, a magistrate, a justice of the peace, and a chief probation officer, all in their official capacities only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time this case arose, former section 25.094 of the Texas Education Code, titled \"Failure to Attend School,\" provided that truancy was punishable as a class C misdemeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants allege that problems with truancy enforcement began in the 2007-2008 school year, when the Fort Bend Independent School District (FBISD), the Fort Bend County Juvenile\n   Board,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the County Commissioners, and the former Chief Juvenile Probation Officer, created the \"Saved by the Bell\" program to aggressively enforce school attendance. In implementing the program, appellants contend that FBISD attendance specialists issued computer-generated and fraudulently notarized failure-to-attend-school complaints that were not based on probable cause or personal knowledge, resulting in thousands of fraudulent complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants assert that more problems arose after the Legislature passed House Bill 2132, a 2011 law providing for the appointment of magistrates with limited powers to assist courts with truancy jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of following that law, appellants allege that the County Judge and Commissioners, in coordination with FBISD trustees and members of the Juvenile Board, participated in a scheme to create and fund an unauthorized \"Truancy Court\" in which the appointed magistrate was considered to be the equivalent of a judge with actual truancy jurisdiction. Appellants allege that the Truancy Court operated beyond its statutory authority by, among other things, issuing summonses to appear without authorization and conducting pretrial hearings after not guilty pleas, contrary to the express provisions of HB 2132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants further allege that the Precinct 3 Justice of the Peace issued a \"blanket\" referral order of truancy filings to the unauthorized Truancy Court and that FBISD attendance specialists and others were permitted to directly issue summonses in the name of the Truancy Court. Appellants maintain that automated attendance data, rather than the personal knowledge or investigation of any individual, was the sole basis for these summonses. Further, appellants allege, the computer-generated summonses were fraudulently notarized by FBISD employees. Appellants allege that this scheme constituted ultra vires acts by the named public officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2015, appellants received truancy complaints ordering them and their children to appear in the Truancy Court. Both retained Harrington as their attorney. On Friday, April 24, Harrington met with FBISD officials and presented a draft petition naming FBISD, the County, and numerous public officials and employees as defendants. The petition alleged three counts, and sought declaratory and prospective injunctive relief and attorney's fees. The FBISD superintendent told Harrington that the school district would take \"immediate remedial action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following Monday, April 27, FBISD's attorney informed Harrington that FBISD was immediately suspending its existing truancy procedures, including referring students to Truancy Court, while conducting a review of the program. The next day, the Truancy Court issued a press release postponing all plea dockets until further notice. No further referrals to the Truancy Court were ever made. On May 5, Harrington was notified by a county prosecutor that the truancy case against Brady's son had been dismissed. The truancy complaint against Roach's son was dismissed just over a week later, on May 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 6, 2015, represented by attorneys Harrington, Soto, Anhalt, and Isgitt\n   (collectively, the Attorneys), Roach filed suit as next friend of her son and a putative class of other similarly situated minor children, their parents, and unknown adults against the various public officials and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   About three weeks later, on May 30, the Legislature passed HB 2398, which decriminalized truancy and instituted new procedures for initiating civil truancy proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, HB 2398 provided that all criminal truancy complaints or convictions and all other documents relating to an offense would be automatically expunged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new law would become effective on September 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 24, 2015, Roach filed a first supplemental petition adding Brady as next friend of his son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Roach and Brady (collectively, the Parents) filed several amended petitions, adding and dropping defendants and revising their claims. The live petition at the time of the final judgment was the sixth amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Motions at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In their sixth amended petition, the Parents requested declaratory and prospective injunctive relief as to eighteen counts of alleged ultra vires acts by appellees and alleged violations of due process in connection with the FBISD's former truancy enforcement procedures and the operation of the Truancy Court. The Parents also sought certification of a class of similarly situated individuals, as well as attorney's fees, costs, and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellees filed various motions to dismiss the Parents' claims. Those appellees sued in their official capacity as the Fort Bend County Judge and County Commissioners, the Precinct 3 Justice of the Peace, and the Truancy Court magistrate (the Fort Bend County Defendants)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a plea to the jurisdiction. Those appellees sued in their official capacity as FBISD trustees (the FBISD Defendants)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for sanctions and attorney's fees. Matthew \"Kyle\" Dobbs, sued in his official capacity as the Chief Probation Officer of the Fort Bend County Juvenile Probation Department (Dobbs), filed a Rule 91A motion to dismiss, a plea to the jurisdiction, and a motion for attorney's fees and sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Those appellees sued in their official capacity as members of the Fort Bend County Juvenile Board (the Judicial Defendants)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a Rule 91a motion to dismiss and a motion for attorney's fees and sanctions. Unlike the other public officials, the Judicial Defendants also filed a Texas Citizens' Protection Act (TCPA) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response to the Judicial Defendants' TCPA motion to dismiss, the Parents filed a document titled \"Counter Anti-SLAPP Motion, Motion for Sanctions, and Attorney's Fees\" against the Judicial Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parents later filed a similarly titled motion to dismiss in which they requested the same relief and additionally sought dismissal of the Judicial Defendants' and Dobbs' Rule 91a motions (collectively, the counter-TCPA motion). In the counter-TCPA motion, the Parents also sought sanctions and attorney's fees under the TCPA against both the Judicial Defendants and Dobbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Proceedings in the Trial Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on the parties' various motions on August 26, 2017. During the hearing, the court indicated that it would deny the Parents' counter-TCPA motion, but because not all issues were reached, the hearing was continued until the next available date on the court's docket. Although the court declined to sign an order denying the Parents' counter-TCPA motion on August 26, the Parents filed an interlocutory appeal that same day. The hearing resumed on September 22, at which time the trial court orally rendered judgment on the remaining issues, including sanctions and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 27, 2017, the trial court signed a final judgment granting the appellees' dispositive motions; denying the Parents' counter-TCPA motion; dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice; awarding certain appellees attorney's fees and costs; and assessing monetary sanctions against Roach, Brady, and the Attorneys. That same day, the Parents filed a second interlocutory appeal of the trial court's order denying their counter-TCPA motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Parents and the Attorneys then filed post-judgment motions including a motion for new trial, motion to modify the judgment, and request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Parents and the Attorneys jointly appealed the final judgment on December 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, the Parents and the Attorneys raise twelve issues: (1) the final judgment is void because it was signed after the Parents appealed the denial of their counter-TCPA motion staying all proceedings in the trial court; (2) the trial judge should have been disqualified because he was a party in his official capacity as a Juvenile Board member and had a personal interest in the litigation; (3) the trial court failed to adequately specify the basis for the sanctions awarded; (4) the trial court erred in granting sanctions against\n   the Parents and the Attorneys for filing the lawsuit; (5) the trial court erred in failing to explain the reasons for sanctioning the Parents; (6) the sanctions awarded were excessive; (7) the FBISD Defendants, Judicial Defendants, and Dobbs are not entitled to recover appellate attorney's fees; (8) the trial court erred in denying the Parents' TCPA motion; (9) the trial court erred in granting the Judicial Defendants' TCPA motion; (10) the trial court erred in granting the FBISD Defendants' and Fort Bend County Defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction; (11) the trial court erred in granting the Judicial Defendants' and Dobbs' Rule 91a motions; and (12) the trial court erred in denying class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We address issues three through seven related to sanctions and appellate attorney's fees last, but otherwise address the issues in the order presented, beginning with issue one concerning whether the final judgment is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Validity of the Final Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In their first issue, The Parents and the Attorneys contend that the final judgment is void because it was signed after the Parents appealed the denial of their counter-TCPA motion, which had the effect of staying all proceedings in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 51.014(b) (providing that an interlocutory appeal of the denial of a TCPA motion to dismiss stays all proceedings in the trial court pending resolution of that appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The TCPA's Purpose and Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The TCPA's purpose is to \"encourage and safeguard the constitutional rights\" of people to \"petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law\" while simultaneously protecting an individual's right \"to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 27.002 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (Tex. 2015) (orig. proceeding) (observing that the TCPA's purpose \"is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits\"). To accomplish its purpose, the TCPA contemplates a summary process, requiring judicial review of the pleadings and limited evidence, typically within 150 days following service.\n   <em>\n    Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 589-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Generally, once a TCPA motion to dismiss is filed, a hearing on the motion \"must be set not later than the 60th day after the date of service of the motion unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing, upon a showing of good cause, or by agreement of the parties, but in no event shall the hearing occur more than 90 days after service of the motion.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem Code \u00a7 27.004(a). In the event that the court cannot hold a hearing in the time required by subsection (a), \"the court may take judicial notice that the court's docket conditions required a hearing at a later date, but in no event shall the hearing occur more than 90 days after service of the motion\" unless the court allows discovery as provided in subsection (c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.004(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court must rule on a TCPA motion to dismiss \"not later than the 30th day following the date of the hearing on the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.005(a). If the court does not rule on a TCPA motion to dismiss within the time prescribed, \"the motion is considered to have been denied by operation of law and the moving party may appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.008(a).

The Final Judgment is Not Void\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   According to the Parents and the Attorneys, the trial judge indicated at the August 26 hearing that he was going to deny the Parents' counter-TCPA motion but did not make a final ruling, and therefore the motion was denied by operation of law on September 26, thirty days after the hearing date.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.008(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parents and the Attorneys assert that the Parents' August 26 notice of interlocutory appeal, although prematurely filed, was effective to stay all proceedings in the trial court after September 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 51.014(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 27.1(a) (\"In a civil case, a prematurely filed notice of appeal is effective and deemed filed on the day of, but after, the event that begins the period for perfecting the appeal.\"). Because the final judgment was signed on September 27, after the proceedings were presumably stayed, the Parents and the Attorneys contend that the judgment is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Contrary to the Parents' premise that the trial court's September 27 judgment is void, a judgment signed during a stay imposed by section 51.014 is not void, but is merely voidable.\n   <em>\n    Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320519\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/919/#p923\">\n    341 S.W.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (Tex. 2011). Accordingly, a party must lodge a timely objection in the trial court to preserve a complaint about a trial court's actions in violation of a stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320519\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/919/#p923\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320519\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/919/#p923\">\n    at 923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Parents and the Attorneys have not directed us to a timely objection to the trial court's September 27 judgment in the record, and we have found none. Indeed, the record shows that the Parents filed post-judgment requests for relief after the judgment was signed. Assuming for purposes of argument that the August 26 notice of appeal initiated a stay, the Parents' failure to complain about the trial court's action in rendering a final judgment during the stay waived any error related to the stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320519\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/919/#p923\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We therefore overrule the Parents' and the Attorneys' first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Motion to Disqualify the Trial Judge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Parents initially sought to recuse the trial judge, the Honorable Brady Elliott, because he was also a member of the Juvenile Board. After the motion to recuse was denied, the Parents filed a motion to disqualify Judge Elliott. The Parents also amended their petition to add Judge Elliott and all of the district and county judges as defendants because they were all members of the Juvenile Board by virtue of their position as judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   An assigned judge denied the motion to disqualify. The claims against Judge Elliott in his official capacity were then severed from this case and assigned a new cause number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In their second issue, the Parents contend that Judge Elliott should have been disqualified because he was a party in his official capacity as a member of the Juvenile Board. The Parents allege that Judge\n   Elliott's participation in the Juvenile Board's decisions to authorize, fund, and support the Truancy Court demonstrate that he has a personal or pecuniary interest in the case. In support of their allegations, the Parents point to Juvenile Board meeting minutes in 2011 reflecting Judge Elliott's participation in discussions relating to funding the Truancy Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees respond that the Parents offer only conclusory allegations and no proof that Judge Elliott should be disqualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Texas Constitution provides that \"[n]o judge shall sit in any case wherein the judge may be interested.\" Tex.

The Parents requested (1) declarations that the alleged acts were ultra vires and violations of due process, and (2) prospective injunctive relief prohibiting these acts in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As noted in the statement of facts, four months after the Parents filed this lawsuit, the Legislature permanently did away with criminal truancy as of September 1, 2015, when HB 2398 became effective. Since then, Texas law has mandated that \"[t]ruant conduct may be prosecuted only as a civil case in a truancy court.\" Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 65.003(b). The change in the law not only did away with criminal truancy, it completely revamped the civil procedures for handling truancy cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, all convictions, complaints, and documents relating to a truancy offense under the former law must be expunged.

Accordingly, the Parents' request for declaratory relief concerning the past conduct of the FBISD Defendants and the Fort Bend County\n   Defendants in connection with the former criminal truancy system is moot because a justiciable controversy no longer exists and a decision on past conduct would be advisory only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Speer v.

For example, the Parents assert that the FBISD Defendants and the Fort Bend County Defendants could continue to: issue fraudulent and statutorily noncompliant truancy referrals; create an unauthorized stand-alone \"Truancy Court\"; have a magistrate function as a truancy court; or allow an actual truancy court judge to issue blanket referrals to the magistrate.

Even before the new legislation became effective, FBISD informed the Parents that they were immediately suspending truancy referrals, and there have been no criminal truancy referrals since that time. Moreover, all of the alleged ultra vires and unconstitutional acts in the Parents' live petition concern conduct allegedly taken within the framework of the former criminal truancy system. The Parents make no allegations that any ultra vires act has occurred under the new civil system, and they have offered no evidence of any such actions.

Additionally, the court found that the amount and types of sanctions awarded under Chapter 10 were \"based on all of the pleadings, motions, evidence, and arguments of counsel, including but not limited to the cumulative amount of attorney's fees incurred\" by the FBISD Defendants and the Judicial Defendants, and by \"the factors enumerated by the ABA's Standards and Guidelines for Practice Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" As to the FBISD Defendants, the trial court also found that at the time the Parents' lawsuit was filed, and at all times afterwards, \"it was frivolous, unreasonable, and without foundation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As an initial matter, the Judicial Defendants, Dobbs, and the FBISD Defendants argue that the Parents and the Attorneys have waived their specificity complaint because it was not raised in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Finally, the Parents and the Attorneys assert that their request for findings of fact and conclusions of law preserved any complaint regarding the trial court's failure to satisfy section 10.005, because if the trial court had made findings (which it did not), the findings would be sufficient to satisfy the specificity requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The thrust of the motion for new trial was that the Parents and the Attorneys' conduct did not warrant the sanctions imposed under any standard.

The request for findings and conclusions was perfunctory and referred only to the final judgment.

Sanctions awarded to the FBISD Defendants are supported by the evidence.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The trial court awarded the FBISD Defendants a total of $144,410 in attorney's fees, to be paid as follows: $5,000 paid by Roach; $5,000 paid by Brady; $2,500 paid by Soto; $2,500 paid by Anhalt; $2,500 paid by Isgitt; and $126,910.77 paid by Harrington. The court also awarded an additional penalty sanction of $50,000 to be paid by Harrington, as well as conditional appellate attorney's fees and $2,377.72 in costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As mentioned above, before filing the lawsuit, Harrington met with FBISD officials on behalf of the Parents to complain about the then-existing criminal truancy system in Fort Bend County. After that meeting, FBISD agreed to immediately suspend its existing truancy procedures and cease making criminal referrals to the Truancy Court. FBISD's counsel also warned that the Parents' proposed lawsuit, if filed, could be viewed as \"premature and frivolous.\" Nevertheless, Harrington expressed the belief that he needed to subject FBISD and Fort Bend County to \"a kick in the nuts\" and a \"cat 5 wind.\" Consequently, on May 6, 2016, the Parents and the Attorneys filed this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief to prohibit the continued operation of the Fort Bend County Truancy Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 25, 2015-nineteen days after the lawsuit was filed-the Legislature passed legislation that repealed and replaced existing criminal truancy laws and provided for the expunction of all previous criminal convictions and complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Despite these actions mooting the Parents' claims, and despite the fact that the Parents' children's truancy complaints were dismissed, the Parents and the Attorneys continued to litigate the case, arguing that the FBISD Defendants could conceivably engage in ultra vires acts in the civil truancy system, even though they remained unable to identify a single instance of such conduct. During this time, the Parents and the Attorneys also multiplied the proceedings by, among other things, amending the Parents' original petition six times to add and delete parties and claims; moving for class certification; seeking to recuse-and then disqualify-the trial judge; and suing the trial judge and every other sitting judge in Fort Bend County. These actions are some evidence supporting the imposition of sanctions against the Parents and the Attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The record also supports the additional sanctions imposed against Harrington. During the sanctions hearing, Harrington admitted that he was aware, and had been advised by FBISD's counsel, of the potential hazards of continuing to proceed with the litigation. Harrington also failed to adequately articulate the basis of the asserted ultra vires claims, despite multiple opportunities to do so. Moreover, Harrington admitted that he had no evidence to support the claims, despite litigating the case for over a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   This evidence is sufficient to support the trial court's findings that the lawsuit was frivolous, unreasonable, and without foundation; presented for an improper purpose; not warranted by existing law or a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law; lacking in evidentiary support; and that the Attorneys did not make reasonable inquiry into the lawsuit's contentions and allegations. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding sanctions, attorney's fees, and costs under Chapter 10 and the Education Code against the Parents and the Attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 10.001 ; Tex. Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 11.161, 22.055. We therefore overrule issue four as to the FBISD Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Sanctions awarded to the Judicial Defendants and Dobbs are supported by the evidence.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Judicial Defendants and Dobbs were awarded $90,700, to be paid as follows: $2,500 paid by Roach; $2,500 paid\n   by Brady; $1,500 paid by Soto; $1,500 paid by Anhalt; $1,500 paid by Isgitt; and $81,200 paid by Harrington. The court also awarded an additional sanction of $80,000 to be paid by Harrington, $1,425.87 for costs, and conditional appellate attorney's fees. As an additional sanction under Chapter 10, the trial court ordered Harrington to complete a specified number of hours of continuing legal education regarding legal pleadings, legal ethics, and the legal concept of ultra vires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The record shows that when the Parents moved to disqualify Judge Elliott on the ground that he had a direct pecuniary and personal interest in the litigation because he was a member of the Juvenile Board, the FBISD Defendants filed a response pointing out that neither Judge Elliott nor the Juvenile Board were then parties-or even mentioned-in the lawsuit. Less than a week later, the Parents and the Attorneys remedied that by filing a third amended petition naming the Judicial Defendants. The Judicial Defendants were added to the lawsuit in November 2015, well after truancy had been decriminalized and criminal truancy referrals were no longer being made. Months later, at the hearing on September 22, 2016, Harrington would admit under oath that as of the date the Judicial Defendants were sued, the Parents and the Attorneys had no evidence that any members of the Juvenile Board were engaged in ultra vires acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Before serving the Judicial Defendants with the third amended petition, in December 2015, Harrington sent a letter to the Judicial Defendants, the FBISD Defendants, and the Fort Bend County Defendants, offering to settle the lawsuit and demanding $135,000 in attorney's fees. After the Judicial Defendants were served, their counsel sent a letter warning the Attorneys that if the claims against the Judicial Defendants were not voluntarily dismissed, the Judicial Defendants would be filing a motion to dismiss under the TCPA that would likely succeed, resulting in dismissal of the lawsuit and an award of attorney's fees and sanctions against the Parents. Harrington dismissed the warning as a litigation tactic. During the sanctions hearing, Harrington testified that could not remember whether he informed his clients about the letter and threat of sanctions, and he denied that he was ethically required to tell them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Parents' third amended petition also continued to name as a plaintiff Corena Valle, as next friend of her daughter, even though Harrington acknowledged for the first time that he did not represent her and had never spoken to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, all of the subsequent petitions, including the sixth amended petition, continued to name Valle as a plaintiff, subjecting her to the possibility of attorney's fees and sanctions-not only as to the Judicial Defendants, but the other defendants as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, the Parents did not add Dobbs as a defendant until April 2016, when the Parents and the Attorneys filed their fifth amended petition-more than six months after the criminal truancy law was repealed. The petition did not allege any specific wrongdoing by Dobbs. And, despite amending their petition for a sixth time, roughly two months after Dobbs filed his Rule 91a motion and moved for attorney's fees and sanctions, the Parents again failed to allege any wrongdoing by Dobbs either before or after the change in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   We conclude that this evidence, and the evidence that also supports an award of sanctions to the Judicial Defendants and Dobbs, supports the trial court's findings that the Parents' lawsuit was presented for an improper purpose, was not warranted by the law, and lacked evidentiary support, and that the Attorneys did not make a reasonable inquiry into the contentions and allegations made in the lawsuit. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions, attorney's fees, and costs under Chapter 10 against the Parents and the Attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 10.001. We overrule issue four as to the Judicial Defendants and Dobbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    X. The Sufficiency of the Explanation of the Reasons for Sanctioning the Parents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In their fifth issue, the Parents contend that the trial court erred by failing to explain the reasons for sanctioning them. As explained in our discussion of issue three, the Parents failed to make the trial court aware of this complaint; therefore, it is not preserved for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). To the extent the Parents contend that there is \"no evidence\" that Roach or Brady engaged in sanctionable conduct, however, we address that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As previously discussed, Roach and Brady continued to prosecute their lawsuit against numerous defendants for many months despite the change in the truancy law and the dismissal of the criminal complaints against their children. Before the sanctions hearing on September 22, 2016, counsel for the Judicial Defendants subpoenaed Roach, Brady, and Valle to appear at the hearing so that they could be questioned about their reasons for filing the lawsuit and why they sued these defendants. In response, Harrington filed a protective order and told them not to come. The trial court denied the protective order, however, and ordered the Parents' counsel to inform the named plaintiffs that they needed to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Brady, a Houston police officer, eventually appeared and testified that his son was mailed a truancy summons in Aril 2015 \"that said they were going to put him in jail,\" which he thought was not right to do to a twelve-year-old boy. Brady engaged Harrington as his attorney to prosecute the case and authorized him \"to do whatever he needed to do to get this stopped so it doesn't happen to other people.\" Brady knew that the law had changed in September 2015 and that the truancy system was \"suspended,\" but he agreed to continue as a named plaintiff because Harrington told him \"it was necessary to continue the litigation.\" Brady could not recall if he ever read the various pleadings, and he did not personally investigate or authorize Harrington to sue the all the judges in Fort Bend County or send the December 2015 demand letter to the Judicial Defendants, the FBISD Defendants, and the Fort Bend County Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Roach never appeared at the hearing. Based on her nonappearance, the trial court invoked the adverse inference rule against her, meaning that any evidence she would have been able to provide to the court regarding the lawsuit would show that she had no knowledge of any of the pleadings that were filed, and no knowledge of any of the actions taken or motions made in the court because of the failure to be informed of those. Valle, who does not speak English, did appear, but once it became apparent that she never authorized Harrington to file suit on her behalf, she was released from the subpoena and excused without being sanctioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Because some evidence supports the trial court's finding that sanctions were warranted against the Parents as well as the\n   Attorneys, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion imposing sanctions against the Parents under Chapter 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 10.001(1), (3), (4) &amp; 10.004(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. The Amount of Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In their sixth issue, the Parents and the Attorneys contend that \"sanctions of $130,000 were excessive.\" In their reply brief, the Parents and the Attorneys clarify that they are complaining about the $50,000 in additional penalty sanction awarded to the FBISD Defendants and the $80,000 in additional sanctions awarded to the Judicial Defendants and Dobbs, both of which were ordered to paid by Harrington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Parents and the Attorneys argue that these sanctions were excessive \"to the extent they were based on groundless pleadings or any other conduct.\" In support of this argument, they cite to a portion of the\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   opinion, in which the supreme court surveyed several cases to illustrate that historically, awards for groundless pleadings in Texas \"have been moderate, at least in monetary terms.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 363-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Chapter 10 provides that when a court determines that a person has violated Section 10.001, the court may impose on the person a sanction that may include any of the following: (1) a directive to the violator to perform, or refrain from performing, an act; (2) an order to pay a penalty into court; and (3) an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by the other party because of the filing of the pleading or motion, including reasonable attorney's fees.

Harrington, an experienced attorney, was the attorney-in-charge throughout the case. He initially presented a draft lawsuit to the County and FBISD and threatened to file it unless certain changes were made to the criminal truancy system, and then, after receiving the requested relief, filed the lawsuit anyway. Harrington was also instrumental in maintaining the lawsuit long after the County's and FBISD's criminal truancy system-and the complaints alleged-ended. Despite warnings from defense counsel that the claims asserted were frivolous, filed in bad faith, and sanctionable, Harrington nevertheless persisted in repeatedly amending the pleadings to eventually include numerous public officials and others who were required to obtain counsel and defend themselves for over a year against ever-morphing claims for prospective injunctive relief unsupported by either cogent allegations or evidence of wrongdoing under the new civil truancy system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in awarding the additional sanctions against Harrington. Moreover, the additional sanctions are less than or roughly equal to the attorney's fees incurred, and thus are no more severe than necessary to satisfy their legitimate purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We overrule the Parents and the Attorneys' sixth issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    XII.
