Brett Busby, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The claims in this case stem from the conveyance of real commercial property from appellants to appellees in order to effectuate a settlement. Following a two-and-a-half-day bench trial, the trial court awarded compensatory and exemplary damages jointly and severally against appellants George Joseph Assets, LLC (GJA) and the Ackel Heirs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively \"the Ackels\") for fraud based on nondisclosure. The trial court also awarded damages and attorneys' fees for breach of an indemnity provision contained in a consent judgment. On appeal, the Ackels contend that the trial court erred in awarding any damages based on fraud because they had no duty to disclose information to appellees Jerilyn Lea Chenevert and J Chenevert Properties, LLC (collectively \"Jerilyn\") in the absence of a fiduciary relationship. The Ackels also challenge the damages awarded to indemnify Jerilyn because they contend no evidence established that Jerilyn actually paid the damages to trigger the indemnification obligation, and because the indemnification clause is unenforceable or was not breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that the trial court properly awarded compensatory and exemplary damages for fraud based on a failure to disclose. A duty to disclose can arise in the absence of a fiduciary relationship where new information makes a prior representation by a party untrue. The evidence supports the trial court's finding that information should have been disclosed to Jerilyn before closing on the conveyance. The evidence also supports the trial court's award of indemnity damages and attorneys' fees because the Ackels agreed in the consent judgment to indemnify Jerilyn for liabilities or claims of GJA's creditors. The trial court heard evidence of two liabilities that were due and owing before closing on the conveyance. The evidence also supports the damages awarded by the trial court, with the exception of two awards of damages for fraud. For those two awards, we suggest a remittitur as explained below. We therefore affirm the trial court's judgment in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment are as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   George Ackel, Jr. owned and operated GJA. GJA in turn owned several commercial buildings and real estate in Texas and Louisiana. In 2009, George died intestate in Louisiana. George's survivors included his estranged wife, Jerilyn, and his four adult children from two prior marriages, the Ackel Heirs. GJA became an asset of George's estate, and Adam Ackel managed GJA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When George died, he and Jerilyn had been married for seven years but were in the process of a divorce. Because George owned real property in both Texas and Louisiana, probate proceedings were filed in both states. In the Louisiana proceeding, Jerilyn challenged the enforceability of a prenuptial agreement she had signed before marrying George. The Louisiana courts upheld the prenuptial agreement, ruling that Jerilyn had no community interest in George's assets in Louisiana. The probate proceedings in both states resulted in protracted litigation between Jerilyn and the Ackels. In an effort to settle the litigation, Jerilyn and the Ackels mediated their dispute and signed a mediated settlement agreement on December 5, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of the mediation, the Ackels agreed to convey to Jerilyn a one-acre parcel of commercial real estate owned by GJA. The one-acre parcel, which the parties call \"the outparcel,\" was part of a seventeen-acre tract of commercial real estate located off of the Katy Freeway in Houston. Garden Ridge Pottery leased and operated a store on the remaining sixteen acres. The outparcel contained the shell of a 10,000 square foot building, part of which GJA had leased to Excel Urgent Care. Under the lease, GJA agreed to pay Excel $100,000 for tenant improvements, payable in four equal payments of $25,000, in order to finish out the space. Excel agreed to pay rent of $8,666.67 per month for the first year, and gradually increasing monthly rent over the following nine years. The settlement between Jerilyn and the Ackels provided that Jerilyn would take the property subject to any current leases, which would include the Excel lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties also agreed at the mediation that Jerilyn would remain living in a condominium George owned in Houston located on Fairdale Lane, provided that she obtain refinancing of the mortgage within 61 days of the closing on the outparcel. If Jerilyn could not obtain the necessary financing for the condo, it would revert back to the Ackels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court handling the Texas probate proceeding signed a consent judgment based on the mediated settlement agreement on May 24, 2012. In the consent judgment, the parties agreed in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the original Mediated Settlement Agreement dated December 5, 2011, (hereinafter the \"MSA\") [attached] hereto as Exhibit \"A\", is hereby made a judgment of this Court and are [sic] fully enforceable at law as if the provisions in said agreements were ordered by this Court directly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Ackel heirs indemnify Jerilyn Lea Ackel from liabilities or claims from any of the\n   Estate's LLC and/or creditors with the exception of the mortgage on the condo at Houston, Texas, unless she relinquishes the property on day 61 if she cannot obtain refinancing on the condo, as hereinafter stipulated in this Consent Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED ... that Jerilyn Lea Ackel shall pay all TI (Tenant Improvement) obligations to the Ackel Heirs at the closing of the commercial property in accordance with the terms of the lease for the existing tenant on the property and in accordance with the original MSA; the Ackel Heirs will substantiate all TI obligations upon payment by Jerilyn Ackel of the TI by a release and indemnification at the closing. In the event Jerilyn Ackel does not have funds to pay the TI, there will be no closing. The property tax for the commercial property is prorated as of the date of the closing. The lease on the property will be turned over on the day of the closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any and all outstanding claims from the lease of the commercial property will be resolved prior to closing to effectuate clear title and purchase of title insurance. All settlement documents regarding the settlement of any claims between the Ackel Heirs and the tenants will be provided at closing. Any settlement regarding the current tenant claims against the commercial property will not require additional payment from Jerilyn Lea Ackel or subject her to any liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By June 2012, and before the closing on the outparcel, GJA and its tenant Excel became involved in litigation alleging Excel's nonpayment of rent, GJA's nonpayment of $100,000 for tenant improvements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and damage resulting from water penetration to the building. Four months later, in October 2012, GJA and Excel settled the lawsuits by executing a confidential settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Excel received a complete rent abatement through May 31, 2013, as reflected in an addendum to the lease agreement that the parties referred to as Addendum No. 3. Excel also received forgiveness of past-due rents owed \"from the inception of the Lease Agreement through May 31, 2013.\" The parties agreed that these rent changes satisfied GJA's obligation to pay for tenant improvements. The agreement further provided that GJA would fix any continuing water penetration problems. The owner of Excel testified that GJA asked that the settlement be designated confidential, though Adam Ackel testified he was not sure who wanted the agreement designated confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 20, 2012, over a month after GJA and Excel settled their dispute, the Ackels and Jerilyn closed on the conveyance of the outparcel. Believing GJA had paid $100,000 to Excel for tenant improvements, Jerilyn tendered $100,000 at closing to the Ackels for the reimbursement of the Excel tenant improvements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jerilyn testified that she expected to begin receiving rent of $8,666.67 per month, increasing monthly thereafter, from the Excel lease. Jerilyn was given an acknowledgement and release of claim for tenant improvements executed by Excel, which stated that the sums due for tenant improvements\n   had been received and paid in full. Adam conceded at trial, however, that GJA had not actually paid $100,000 in cash to Excel and that he did not disclose to Jerilyn the confidential settlement agreement between GJA and Excel, the rent abatement, or Addendum No. 3. He also did not disclose to Jerilyn that Excel alleged continued water penetration problems in the leased space, though the Excel representative stated he believed he sent pictures of water damage after rains to Adam. Adam executed an affidavit on behalf of GJA for the closing stating that no claims or lawsuits remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly after closing, Excel did not pay the rent Jerilyn was expecting. Jerilyn then learned of the rent abatement given to Excel and the continuing water penetration problems. Jerilyn negotiated a further reduction in long-term rent with Excel in order to obtain the resumption of rental payments. Jerilyn stated she gave up $51,000 in rent payments over a three year period, and the lease modification she executed with Excel shows she gave up over $52,000. Jerilyn paid $49,041 to have the water penetration problems corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Jerilyn also received two demands for payment for amounts owed by GJA prior to the closing. GJA had agreed to pay a commission to National UC Realty and NAI Houston for procuring the Excel lease. The commission of $45,033.66 was due by June 2012 when Excel opened for business, but GJA did not pay it and Jerilyn had no knowledge of the commission before closing. She received a demand from the realty company to pay the commission, though she had not yet paid it at the time of trial. In addition, GJA failed to pay a fee owed to WM Architectural Design Foam prior to closing. Jerilyn received a demand to pay a judgment lien WM had filed against the property; she negotiated regarding the amount and paid $3,000 to settle the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Jerilyn testified that as a result of the rent abatement given to Excel, she had no rent coming in and no income. Having paid for the water penetration repairs and paid $3,000 to WM, Jerilyn stated she was unable to refinance the condo and thus had to allow it to revert to the Ackels after the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jerilyn filed this lawsuit against the Ackels, asserting claims including for common-law fraud, statutory fraud under section 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, and breach of an indemnity agreement. The parties tried the case to the bench, and the trial court found in favor of Jerilyn on her claims. Although no findings of fact or conclusions of law were made or requested, the trial court's final judgment provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against defendants for breach of contract and for fraud and for damages;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 defendants' [sic] committed fraud in not disclosing to plaintiffs the Excel settlement and then requiring plaintiffs to pay One Hundred Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($100,000.00) for tenant improvements and for not disclosing the water penetration and such fraudulent conduct was committed knowingly. One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) in exemplary damages is awarded to the plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court awarded the following amounts of compensatory damages to Jerilyn: (1) $45,033 as a result of the defendants' failure to indemnify Jerilyn for amounts due to National UC Realty and NAI Houston; (2) $3,000 as a result of the defendants' failure to indemnify Jerilyn for the amount paid to WM Architectural Design\n   Foam; (3) $100,000 as a result of fraud related to nondisclosure of the rent abatement in lieu of paying for tenant improvements; (4) $51,996 for loss of rental income due to the nondisclosure of the settlement with Excel; (5) $49,041 for the nondisclosure of known water penetration in the Excel leased space; and (6) $332,000 for the loss of the condo in Houston. The trial court awarded attorneys' fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. The Ackels timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their first five issues, the Ackels argue the trial court erred in finding fraud because they contend they had no duty to disclose in the absence of a fiduciary duty. In issue four, the Ackels further challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the damages awarded. In their sixth issue, the Ackels argue that there is no basis for awarding attorneys' fees, making the award \"manifest reversible error.\" In issue seven, the Ackels contend the trial court erred in finding a breach of the indemnification clause in the consent judgment. We address the first five issues together as they concern the Ackels' challenge to the findings of fraud by failure to disclose and resulting damages. We then address the issues regarding breach of the indemnification clause and attorneys' fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Jerilyn testified that Adam told her in connection with the mediated settlement that GJA had to pay $100,000 to the tenant Excel to complete the build-out. He gave her the original lease with Excel showing that the tenant improvement payments were due in four equal installments payable on September 1, 2011, October 1, 2011, November 1, 2011, and December 1, 2011. The documents also indicated that Excel would pay rent of $8,666.67 per month, with increasing rent over the course of the multi-year lease. Jerilyn tendered $100,000 to the Ackels at the closing of the conveyance to reimburse them for the tenant improvements. Unbeknownst to Jerilyn, the Ackels had not paid Excel for the tenant improvements, as required under the original lease, but instead entered into an addendum to the lease allowing for rent abatement until May 31, 2013 in lieu of the tenant improvement payments. The facts that Excel would not have to pay rent as stated in its original lease and that the Ackels had not compensated Excel in full for tenant improvements prior to closing\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   constituted new information that made the Ackels' prior statements to Jerilyn regarding rent amounts and payment for tenant improvements untrue. This evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court's finding of fraud for failing to disclose the Excel settlement and rent abatement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson, Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100831\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/44/200/#p212\">\n    44 S.W.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the evidence supports the trial court's finding that the fraudulent decision\n   not to disclose was made knowingly. Adam Ackel conceded under questioning by the court that he did not disclose this information to Jerilyn because of the confidentiality provision of the Ackels' agreement with Excel, nor did he tell her that information was being withheld based on confidentiality. Dr. Ogunro, the Excel representative, testified that it was GJA's idea to designate the settlement a confidential agreement. Thus, there is sufficient evidence that GJA deliberately chose to withhold the information from Jerilyn and in fact prevented her from gaining access to the information on her own inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The evidence also supports the trial court's finding of fraud based on the Ackels' failure to disclose to Jerilyn the continuing water penetration issues in the Excel leased space. The Ackels stated in the consent judgment that any settlement regarding the Excel claims against the property would not require additional payment from Jerilyn. The settlement agreement between GJA and Excel provided that GJA would \"continue its vigilance with respect to water penetration issues at the Lease Space upon proper notice and proof of water penetration....\" Dr. Ogunro from Excel testified that after the settlement agreement was executed, he sent pictures of continuing water penetration issues to Adam but the problem remained unresolved. Dr. Ogunro thus decided to \"wait until the new landlady came and try to make our case with her.\" Jerilyn had to expend $49,041 to remedy the water penetration issues. Adam conceded he did not disclose the water penetration issues to Jerilyn. We conclude that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the Ackels had a duty to disclose the Excel settlement allowing rent abatement and the ongoing water penetration issues. We overrule the Ackels' first three issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In their fifth issue, the Ackels contend that \"[t]he trial court erred in awarding punitive/exemplary damages as there was no underlying fraud which is [a] necessary finding to support an award of punitive/exemplary damages and therefore was manifest reversible error and an abuse of discretion.\" The only argument the Ackels offer in support of this issue is that the trial court's finding of fraud was based on the \"legally incorrect finding of a fiduciary duty between the parties,\" without which the Ackels had no duty to disclose and thus could not have committed fraud. As explained above, a fiduciary duty is not required to support a finding of fraud in this case. The evidence supports the trial court's finding of fraud committed knowingly. We therefore overrule the Ackels' fifth issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support all but two awards of fraud damages.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In their fourth issue, the Ackels first challenge the award of compensatory damages with the global contention that the damages must fail \"as the trial court was complete [sic] wrong on the applicable law regarding disclosure.\" Having addressed this argument above, we overrule this portion of issue four for the same reasons. The Ackels also challenge several of the damage awards for fraud on grounds that we construe as challenges to the factual sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PNS Stores, Inc. v.

With regard to the $100,000 payment for tenant improvements, the Ackels point out that they complied with their obligation under the consent judgment to obtain a release and indemnification from Excel for the tenant improvement obligation, and that the settlement agreement with Excel was not due to be disclosed before the date of closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We agree with the Ackels that the evidence does not support the full award of $100,000 as fraud damages to Jerilyn, but for different reasons. By awarding Jerilyn $100,000, it appears the trial court utilized the out-of-pocket measure of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sonnichsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311531\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/632/#p636\">\n    221 S.W.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Out-of-pocket damages, which derive from a restitutionary theory, measure the difference between the value of that which was parted with and the value of that which was received.\");\n   <em>\n    Siddiqui v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied). In doing so, the trial court did not accurately measure \"the value of that which was received.\" It is undisputed that Jerilyn paid $100,000 at closing to reimburse GJA for the tenant improvement allowance owed to Excel under the GJA-Excel lease. The evidence also shows, however, that GJA paid for at least part of the tenant improvements by forgiving past-due rent that Excel owed GJA going back to October 2011. Excel, for its part, executed an acknowledgment and release stating that the tenant improvement obligation had been satisfied. Jerilyn therefore received some value from her $100,000 payment for tenant improvements other than zero, making an award of $100,000 excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Jerilyn was harmed, however, because GJA discharged the remainder of its tenant improvement obligation by extending the rent abatement more than six months past the date it knew Jerilyn would acquire the property. The damage to Jerilyn from the non-disclosure of this rent abatement is that she did not receive the benefit of her bargain: the value of the Excel lease as represented. Jerilyn expected to pay $100,000 to reimburse GJA for tenant improvements, and in exchange to obtain property with an existing lease under\n   which she would be paid a certain amount of rent after the closing on November 20, 2012. Under the Excel lease disclosed to Jerilyn, she should have received $8,666.67 in rent from Excel for the month of December 2012, and $8,840.00 for the months of January, February, March, April, and May 2013. The rent abatement that GJA gave Excel in lieu of paying for tenant improvements meant that Jerilyn would receive none of this rent. The evidence supports a conclusion that the difference between the value of the property and lease as represented and the value Jerilyn received is $52,866.67. We therefore sustain the portion of issue four challenging the trial court's award of $100,000 as damages for the Ackels' fraud in collecting Jerilyn's reimbursement for tenant improvements while not disclosing the future rent abatement they gave Excel in lieu of paying for improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Ackels also challenge the award of $49,041, which Jerilyn paid to repair water penetration issues in the Excel leased space. The Ackels contend the water penetration issues were resolved as of the date of the settlement agreement between GJA and Excel, and that \"[f]actually defendants were never put on further notice by Excel in between the time of the settlement and the time of the transfer to plaintiff that there were any further water penetration issues nor was any evidence presented of such at trial.\" To the contrary, Dr. Ogunro of Excel testified he believed he sent pictures of continued water penetration issues to Adam after the settlement agreement, but that Adam did nothing to resolve the problem. The trial court, as the finder of fact, was in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and determine whether notice of the problem was given to the Ackels and should have been disclosed to Jerilyn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Parrimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20750293\">\n    2016 WL 750293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

The evidence is factually sufficient to support the award of $49,041 for water penetration repair, and we overrule this portion of issue four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Ackels next challenge the award of $51,996 for loss of rental income, arguing that Jerilyn's decision to reduce Excel's rent further over the remainder of the lease was her own decision after closing and had \"nothing to do with\" the Ackels. There was evidence, however, that this decision was a consequence of the Ackels' failure to disclose both the rent abatement and the ongoing water penetration problems. Jerilyn testified that she negotiated the reduced rent in order get Excel to resume paying rent so that she would have money to repair the water penetration. Because of the rent abatement that was not disclosed, Excel had no obligation to pay rent for the first six months after Jerilyn acquired the property, which meant Jerilyn had no monthly income. In order to obtain cash flow to pay for water penetration repairs and maintain the Excel tenant, she negotiated a further reduction in rent over the course of three years. Jerilyn testified that she reduced the rent by $51,000, and the lease addendum she executed with Excel shows a reduction over a three year period of over $52,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The trial court's award of $51,996 is within the range of evidence presented and is a consequential damage recoverable for fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sonnichsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311531\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/632/#p636\">\n    221 S.W.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining consequential damages as \"those damages which result naturally, but not necessarily, from the defendant's wrongful acts\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trenholm v.

The evidence is factually sufficient to support the award of damages for loss of rental income, and we overrule this portion of issue four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the Ackels challenge the $332,000 awarded for Jerilyn's loss of the Fairdale condo when she could not obtain financing. The Ackels argue Jerilyn failed to show at trial that she could not refinance because of the fraud, and that any rights she would have had to the condo were subject to the existing mortgage. We conclude Jerilyn did offer evidence of an inability to refinance. She testified that because she had paid $100,000 to the Ackels and then had no rent income coming in and had to pay for repairs to the Excel leased space, she was unable to qualify for a loan and could not obtain financing for the condo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We agree with the Ackels, however, that the trial court erred in awarding Jerilyn the full value of the condo without accounting for the existing mortgage. Under the consent judgment, Jerilyn was awarded the condo subject to that mortgage. The evidence showed that the condo had a market value of between $340,000 and $400,000. Jerilyn testified that a mortgage of $260,000 remained due on the condo. Thus, the evidence supports an award of damages to Jerilyn for the loss of the condo in the amount of at most $140,000. Because the amount awarded for the value of the condo was excessive, we sustain this portion of issue four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the damage awards for breach of the indemnity agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court's judgment also includes two damage awards for breach of the indemnity agreement: $45,033 due and payable for the real estate commission on the Excel lease, and $3,000 paid to settle the WM Architectural Design Foam claim.

We conclude this evidence renders the amount owed for the realty commission sufficiently fixed and certain to trigger the indemnity obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The evidence further established that on August 9, 2012, WM Architectural Design Foam obtained a judgment against GJA for over $11,000 and filed a lien against the outparcel. A writ of execution was issued to satisfy the judgment lien. Jerilyn testified that she paid $3,000 to settle the WM Architectural Design Foam judgment and prevent execution on the writ. Thus, both amounts awarded by the trial court were fixed and certain liabilities from GJA and fall within the language of the indemnity agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingersoll-Rand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11541456\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/997/203/#p207\">\n    997 S.W.2d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In support of their argument that Jerilyn had to show payment of a judgment before she could be indemnified, the Ackels cite several cases involving breach of an indemnity bond by a surety or other analogous agreement by one assuming the debt of another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meier v.

App.-Fort Worth 1913, writ ref'd). We find these cases inapposite because the agreements at issue involved indemnity obligations different from those in the consent judgment signed by the Ackels. We overrule the Ackels' legal sufficiency challenges to the damages awarded under the indemnity agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Ackels also challenge the factual sufficiency of the evidence by arguing that Jerilyn did not establish she had paid the $3,000 to WM Architectural Design Foam or the $45,033 realty commission, noting there are no banking records showing the money was paid. The Ackels also point out that Jerilyn was the landlord at the time\n   she received the invoice from the realty company. As a result, they contend, the obligation passed to her, and her delay in closing on the transaction caused the problems of which she complains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Jerilyn testified that she paid the $3,000 judgment to obtain the release of lien from WM Architectural Design Foam. The lack of bank records does not render this testimony insufficient. Moreover, under the agreement with the realty company, the commissions became due and owing while GJA was the landlord. As explained above, the realty fee is a liability of GJA that was due and should have been paid under the agreement signed by GJA and the realty company prior to conveyance of the outparcel. After examining the entire record, considering both the evidence in favor of and contrary to the trial court's implied finding that the amounts were fixed and certain and that the Ackels failed to comply with the indemnity agreement, we conclude the trial court's finding is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence such as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mar.Overseas Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 971 S.W.2d at 406-07.

Nevertheless, the Ackels are incorrect that the trial court erred in awarding fees. First, the attorneys' fees award is authorized by statute. Jerilyn pleaded for the recovery of attorneys' fees for breach of the indemnity provision in the consent judgment under section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. \"A suit on an agreed judgment sounds in contract....\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title Guar.

Because the evidence is factually insufficient to support the full amounts awarded as fraud damages regarding the Fairdale condo and the rent abatement for tenant improvements, we sustain in part and overrule in part the Ackels' fourth issue. In this situation, we may suggest a remittitur, and we do so here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, L.L.P. v.

The evidence is sufficient to support an award for the loss of the Fairdale condo in the amount of $140,000. The trial court awarded $332,000. We thus suggest a remittitur of $192,000.00. With regard to the rent abatement for improvements, the evidence supports an award in the amount of $52,866.67 for loss of benefit of the bargain. The trial court awarded $100,000. We thus suggest a remittitur of $47,133.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The party prevailing in the trial court should be given the option of accepting the remittitur or having the case remanded for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

If appellees file a remittitur within twenty days from the date of this opinion, we will modify the trial court's judgment accordingly and affirm the judgment as modified.

We explained that if appellees filed this remittitur within twenty days from the date of our original opinion, we would modify the trial court's judgment accordingly. We suggested the following remittitur: (1) $192,000.00 with regard to the Fairdale condo; and (2) $47,133.33 with regard to the rent abatement for tenant improvements. Appellees timely accepted the suggested remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We therefore issue this supplemental opinion.
