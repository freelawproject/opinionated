Boyce, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jelinis, LLC appeals a temporary injunction order in favor of appellees S. Bruce Hiran and Hung N. Yi. Jelinis argues that the trial court erred by enjoining it from (1) evicting Hiran and Yi because\n   they pleaded no cause of action against Jelinis; and (2) taking legal action in the justice court to evict Hiran and Yi because they failed to show that \"the justice court was without jurisdiction to determine possession.\" We reverse and render in part and affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hiran signed a Texas Home Equity Note on June 6, 2006, in the amount of $800,000 payable to Long Beach Mortgage Company. On the same day, Hiran and his wife Yi signed a Texas Home Equity Security Instrument confirming that the loan was secured by residential real property located at 4132 Lehigh Avenue in Houston, Texas. The note and deed of trust were later transferred to Deutsche Bank National Trust Company. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. acted as the loan servicer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellees defaulted on their loan in October 2012. Select Portfolio sent notices of default in December 2012 and May 2013. Appellees ignored the notices Select Portfolio sent them. Deutsche Bank, as trustee, in trust for registered holders of Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-10, filed an Application for Home Equity Foreclosure Order pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 736 on January 22, 2014. Deutsche Bank nonsuited the action and filed suit in the 270th District Court on September 8, 2014, seeking a declaratory judgment and an order authorizing foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deutsche Bank filed a traditional summary judgment motion, contending that (1) it is entitled to a declaration of its right to foreclose on appellees' home and to an order authorizing foreclosure because its summary judgment evidence established that a debt exists, the debt is secured by a lien for a home equity loan, a default under the note and deed of trust exists, and the requisite notices to cure the default have been provided to appellees; and (2) appellees should not be allowed to deny executing the loan documents because Hiran refused to testify at his deposition regarding \"any issues relating to whether he signed the applicable loan documents and refused to provide any handwriting exemplars, based on his assertion of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The 270th District Court granted Deutsche Bank's summary judgment motion and signed a Final Judgment for Declaratory Relief and Order Authorizing Foreclosure on December 3, 2015. This judgment (1) disposed of all claims; (2) awarded \"an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   Judgment\" against appellees authorizing a non-judicial foreclosure sale of appellees' home \"pursuant to the terms and conditions of the subject Texas Home Equity Security Instrument and TEX. PROP CODE \u00a7 51.002 ;\" and (3) ordered that the final judgment \"serves as an Order of Foreclosure of a Home Equity Lien.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Deutsche Bank sold the home at a foreclosure sale to Jelinis on December 6, 2016. Jelinis filed a forcible detainer suit regarding the home on January 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellees filed suit in the 151st District Court on January 30, 2017, naming as parties Long Beach Mortgage Company, Deutsche Bank, and Jelinis, and alleging that the \"actions committed by Long Beach Mortgage Company\" constitute statutory fraud and breach of contract, and that the \"actions committed by Deutsche Bank\" constitute common law fraud and breach of contract. Appellees alleged that, \"although their signatures appear to be valid, certain pages of the Note and Deed of Trust must have been switched by representatives of Long Beach Mortgage Company ... because [appellees]' Home Equity Loan was a fixed rate of 2% interest and, instead, the Note and Deed of Trust attached as exhibits to the Foreclosure\n   Lawsuit are purported to be an adjustable rate note at 7.975% interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellees further alleged that \"the exhibits which are the legal basis for Deutsche Bank's being awarded a judgment authorizing them [sic] to sell [appellees]' Property at a foreclosure sale are fraudulent; therefore, the foreclosure sale of [appellees]' Property should be deemed void and rescinded. Moreover, [appellees] allege[d] that the Home Equity Loan itself was fraudulent as a result of Long Beach Mortgage's representatives switching the loan documents unbeknownst to [appellees]; therefore, [appellees]' home equity loan should be deemed void ab initio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellees requested that the trial court (1) issue a temporary restraining order and then a temporary injunction enjoining Jelinis from selling appellees' home \"as well as from taking any legal action to evict [appellees];\" (2) enter a judgment in favor of appellees \"to rescind the foreclosure sale of\" appellees' home and \"to declare the home equity loan dated June 06, 2006 between [appellees] as well as Long Beach Mortgage Company as void ab initio;\" and (3) enter a judgment against Long Beach Mortgage Company and Deutsche Bank for actual and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Attached to appellees' petition was Hiran's affidavit in which he stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. The subject matter of this lawsuit is the real property and the improvements thereon located at 4132 Lehigh Avenue, Houston, TX 77005 (the \"Property\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. The Property was owned by my wife Hung N. Yi and I on June 06, 2006 on which date we entered into a Home Equity Loan. During the process of entering into the Home Equity Loan, we executed a Texas Home Equity Note (\"Note\") in the amount of $800,000 which was payable to Long Beach Mortgage Company (\"Long Beach\"). In addition, we executed a Texas Home Equity Security Instrument (\"Deed of Trust\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4. ... the Note and Deed of Trust were subsequently transferred to Deutsche Bank National Trust....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   5. During the term of the Note, we began to receive notices that we were past due on the payments of the Note. We did not understand how that could be true since we were making our payments on the Note in full and in a timely manner. Accordingly, we expected that the notices must be a clerical error which will be remedied in due course. As such, we ignored the delinquency notices which we received from SPS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   6. Due to the nature and extent of Plaintiffs' perceived delinquency, Deutsche Bank filed an Application for Home Equity Foreclosure ... [i]n the 270th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas (the \"Foreclosure Lawsuit\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   7. The Foreclosure Lawsuit culminated in a Final Judgment for Declaratory Relief and Order Authorizing Foreclosure and the Property was sold by Deutsche Bank to Jelinis, LLC (\"Jelinis\") at a foreclosure sale on December 06, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   8. During the course of investigating this lawsuit, I informed my legal counsel that we did not execute the Note and Deed of Trust which were attached as exhibits to the Foreclosure Lawsuit. Instead, I assert that, although our signatures appear to be valid, certain pages of the Note and Deed of Trust must have been switched by representatives of Long\n   Beach Mortgage Company (\"Long Beach Mortgage\") because our Home Equity Loan was a fixed rate of 2% interest and, instead, the Note and Deed of Trust attached as exhibits to the Foreclosure Lawsuit are purported to be an adjustable rate note at 7.975% interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court granted appellees' request for a temporary restraining order and set a hearing on appellees' temporary injunction request. Appellees nonsuited their claims against Deutsche Bank without prejudice on February 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Jelinis filed an Objection to Plaintiff's Request for Temporary Injunction on February 23, 2017, arguing that the trial court should not enjoin the justice court from exercising its jurisdiction to hear Jelinis's forcible detainer suit. Jelinis argued that the justice court only loses jurisdiction if \"the right to possession is so interrelated with title so as to make a determination of title necessary before a determination of possession can be made.\" According to Jelinis \"there is a way to determine the issue of possession without reaching the merits of title\" because the \"foreclosed deed of trust created a tenancy-at-sufferance upon foreclosure\" and appellees as tenants at sufferance \"may be removed by a writ of possession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on February 24, 2017. Hiran testified that the note and deed of trust introduced at the hearing and in the 270th District Court proceeding were not the documents he signed because the documents reference an adjustable interest rate of 7.975 percent and his home equity loan was for a fixed interest rate of 2.25 percent. Hiran, who is an attorney, testified that it is \"typical that a contract that was entered into as a fraudulent transaction would be deemed void in [his] legal opinion.\" Hiran also stated that, in his legal opinion, he believed appellees are in \"imminent danger of irreparable harm as the result of the forceful detainer lawsuit that's currently pending in JP court.\" But Hiran acknowledged that the signature on the documents \"appears to be\" his signature and that he did not have a copy of the note and deed of trust he and his wife signed at closing in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court instructed the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of res judicata \"in conjunction with the element of a temporary injunction that is the likelihood of success on the merits,\" so that the court could \"take a look at what actually happened in the 270th, what the proceedings were and whether they do have preclusive effect at all in this lawsuit and, if so, to what extent.\" Jelinis filed a Brief in Opposition to Temporary Injunction as requested by the trial court. In its brief, Jelinis argued that appellees' claims in \"this lawsuit were compulsory counterclaims arising out of the same subject matter as the lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank on September 8, 2014,\" and, therefore, are barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court signed an order granting a temporary injunction on March 10, 2017, enjoining Jelinis from selling appellees' home and from taking any legal action to evict appellees, including pursuing Jelinis's forcible detainer suit in justice court. The court also stated in its order that it \"finds that the final relief granted in the lawsuit in the 270th District Court was only in rem pursuant to TRCP 735 and therefore likely does not have preclusive effect on [appellees'] claims in this suit as a matter of law.\" Jelinis filed a timely interlocutory appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Jelinis argues in two issues that the trial court erred by enjoining it from (1) evicting appellees because they pleaded no cause of action against Jelinis; and (2) taking legal action in the justice court to evict appellees because they failed to show that \"the justice court was without jurisdiction to determine possession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Wade argued the justice court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue of possession to 90 acres because Household Finance \"fraudulently falsified the amount of acreage described within the deed of trust, thereby making it void, and that the resolution of title was a necessary prerequisite to determining the identity of which party had the immediate right of possession.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court of appeals rejected Wade's argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

And, in light of our disposition of Jelinis's second issue, we need not reach its first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's temporary injunction insofar as it enjoins Jelinis from pursuing its forcible detainer suit in justice court to evict appellees and we render judgment denying appellees' request for a temporary injunction. Because Jelinis does not challenge the trial court's temporary injunction order in any other respects, we affirm the remainder of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   ( Frost, C.J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Kem Thompson Frost, Chief Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court enjoined the purchaser of real property at a foreclosure sale from taking action in the justice court to evict the former owners and current occupants of the premises, who claimed that fraudulent alterations of the promissory note they signed to purchase the property rendered the loan documents void and unenforceable. The occupants relied on our recent precedent in\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough v. Household Fin. Corp. III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to argue that the intertwining of issues of title and possession deprived the justice court of jurisdiction to conduct eviction proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the temporary injunction, the majority declines to find intertwining\n   issues and declines to apply the\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough\n   </em>\n   precedent. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough\n   </em>\n   court, the majority does not analyze the effect of the fraud allegations. Nor does the majority consider the legal consequences of fraudulent alterations on the validity and enforceability of the instruments. Instead, the majority reasons that the occupants do not deny signing an instrument containing a tenancy-at-sufferance clause. But, if the occupants are correct that the note and deed of trust are void and unenforceable, and the note and the deed of trust create the tenancy-at-sufferance relationship, then the issues of title and possession still would be intertwined. The occupants challenge the entirety of the loan documents, yet the majority concludes that the occupants have failed to challenge the tenancy-at-sufferance clause. The majority then reasons that the occupants' failure to challenge the tenancy-at-sufferance clause means the issues of title and possession are not intertwined. Both the reasoning and approach are out of step with\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The better course would be to conclude that the occupants' allegations do not show intertwining of title and possession issues because the occupants have not alleged or proved that the purchaser at the foreclosure sale would be unable to enforce the terms of the original note and deed of trust, including the tenancy-at-sufferance clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and procedural background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Appellee Bruce Hiran signed a Texas Home Equity Note payable to Long Beach Mortgage Company. Hiran and his wife Hung N. Yi secured the debt by giving Long Beach Mortgage Company a deed-of-trust lien on their property at 4132 Lehigh. Long Beach Mortgage Company later transferred the note and deed of trust to Deutsche National Bank, as trustee, in trust for registered holders of Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-10. When Hiran defaulted on the note, Deutsche National Bank foreclosed on the deed-of-trust lien and sold the property to appellant Jelinis, LLC at a foreclosure sale. Hiran and Yi, who occupied the property, filed an action in the trial court seeking various forms of relief, including a temporary injunction enjoining Jelinis from obtaining relief in the justice court to evict them from the property. On appeal, Hiran and Yi assert that they were entitled to a temporary injunction because the justice court lacked jurisdiction over the forcible detainer action due to intertwining issues of title and possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Though the note and deed of trust would create a tenancy-at-sufferance relationship between Hiran and Yi and the purchaser of the property at a foreclosure sale, Hiran and Yi assert that fraudulent alterations of the note and deed of trust render the instruments void. Thus, according to Hiran and Yi, the justice court lacks jurisdiction because whether the note and deed of trust are void relates to both title and possession. The trial court granted Hiran and Yi's request for a temporary injunction. Jelinis now challenges that ruling on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Standards governing relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To get a temporary injunction, Hiran and Yi had to prove (1) a claim against Jelinis, (2) a probable right on final trial to the relief sought, and (3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In granting the temporary injunction, the trial court determined that Hiran and Yi have a probable right to the relief they seek-dismissal of the forcible detainer case from the justice court for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Though justice courts have jurisdiction over forcible-detainer actions, they lack subject-matter jurisdiction to resolve title disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only issue in a forcible-detainer action is who has the right to immediate possession of the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The justice court lacks jurisdiction over a forcible-detainer action if the question of title is so intertwined with the issue of possession that possession cannot be adjudicated without first determining title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When there is a basis for determining immediate possession independent from title, the justice court has jurisdiction to hear the forcible-detainer action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To establish a forcible detainer, a plaintiff must prove that a person who refuses to surrender possession of the real property on demand is a tenant or subtenant who falls within one of three statutory categories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a trustee's deed purports to convey real property to a person who was the highest bidder at the foreclosure sale on a deed-of-trust lien and if the person pursues a forcible-detainer action against the former owners of the property, a tenancy-at-sufferance clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the deed of trust allows the person to prove the tenancy status of the former owners and to prove superior right to possession without proving the validity of the person's title to the real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Hiran and Yi do not allege that their signatures were forged. Hiran does not deny that the signature page of the note bears his signature. Hiran and Yi do not deny that the signature page of the deed of trust contains each of their signatures. However, Hiran and Yi assert that Long Beach Mortgage fraudulently switched pages in the note and deed of trust after their execution of the instruments. They allege that Hiran signed a note with a fixed 2% interest rate and to secure the note, Hiran and Yi signed a deed of trust. According to Hiran and Yi, Long Beach Mortgage must have changed the pages so that the fraudulent versions of the note and deed of trust showed a 7.975% adjustable-interest rate. Hiran and Yi assert that this action made the note and deed of trust void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   If the note and deed of trust are void, as Hiran and Yi allege, then Deutsche National Bank would have lacked title to the property and so could not have transferred the title to Jelinis at the foreclosure sale. In addition, if the note and deed of trust are void, then Jelinis cannot rely on the tenancy-at-sufferance clause in the deed of trust to establish a forcible detainer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Thus, if Long Beach Mortgage's alleged fraud in switching out some of the pages in the note and deed of trust would make these instruments void, then that allegation would bear upon Jelinis's ability to prove a superior right to possession as well as Jelinis's title to the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Embracing the Sixth Court of Appeals's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wade v.

But, Hiran and Yi made no such allegations. They did not allege that Deutsche National Bank did not take the note for value, in good faith, and without notice of the alleged alterations, nor did they put on any proof that Deutsche National Bank did not take the note for value, in good faith, and without notice of the alleged alterations. Absent such proof, Deutsche National Bank would be entitled to enforce the note and deed of trust according to the instruments' original terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Hiran and Yi agreed the original terms of the instruments included a tenancy-at-sufferance clause, to deprive the justice court of jurisdiction, they needed to have alleged that the alterations prevented Deutsche National Bank from enforcing the tenancy-at-sufferance clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Yarborough\n   </em>\n   court analyzed the intertwining-of-title-and-possession issue by evaluating the legal consequences of the alleged act that rendered the loan documents void (in that case, forgery). The\n   <em>\n    Yarborough\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that the forgery allegation, if true, would render the deed of trust, including the tenancy-at sufferance clause void, so the court found the requisite entanglement of the title and possession issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   In analyzing today's case, the majority abandons\n   <em>\n    Yarborough's\n   </em>\n   analytical framework.
