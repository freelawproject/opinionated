PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.12(a)(1) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). By a single issue, appellant Tanya Ramirez contends that section 21.12(a)(1) infringes upon her constitutionally protected fundamental rights. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 25, 2014, a grand jury indicted Ramirez under penal code section 21.12(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The indictment alleged that Ramirez violated section 21.12(a)(1) by engaging in sexual intercourse with a student, T.P., a pseudonym, who was enrolled at the high school where Ramirez was employed (Count 1).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 17, 2015, Ramirez filed a motion to dismiss and/or a motion for declaratory judgment, arguing that the statute is not directed at truly protecting children, but rather at criminalizing her fundamental First Amendment right to privacy. In her motion, Ramirez contended that section 21.12 was facially unconstitutional because, in relevant part, it implicated her fundamental right to privacy under the First Amendment, was content-based, and did not satisfy the strict scrutiny standard. On August 8, 2015, the trial court denied Ramirez's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 3, 2015, the indictment was amended. The grand jury indicted Ramirez for violating section 21.12(a)(1) by engaging in sexual intercourse with T.P. and with a second student, B.J., a pseudonym, who was also enrolled at the same high school (Count 2).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Ramirez filed no motion to dismiss the charges against her with regard to B.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 11, 2016, Ramirez pleaded guilty to Count 1 and no contest to Count 2. The trial court convicted Ramirez on both counts and sentenced her to five years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on Counts 1 and 2, with the sentences to run concurrently. Suspending her sentences of confinement, the trial court placed Ramirez on community supervision for seven years and assessed a fine of $4,000 and restitution of $400. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By her sole issue on appeal, Ramirez contends that section 21.12 of the Texas Penal Code infringes upon and criminalizes constitutionally protected fundamental\n   rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. AMEND. XIV \u00a7 1 ; TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.12. She asserts that consensual sex should be included among rights of personal privacy that relate to the fundamental rights of marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ramirez further argues that because section 21.12 implicates what she alleges to be a fundamental right regarding sexual conduct between two consenting adults, we should utilize the strict-scrutiny standard of review and not the rational-basis standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.12. She reasons that because section 21.12 cannot pass the strict-scrutiny test, we should strike it down.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As we explain below, a careful reading of the two leading cases from the United State Supreme Court directs us to conclude that consensual sex is not a fundamental right. And many Texas courts have reached the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Supreme Court Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Obergefell v. Hodges\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Most recently, in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court held that \"same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2605-06,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In so holding, the Court set out the following general principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In addition these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The identification and protection of fundamental rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret the Constitution. That responsibility, however, \"has not been reduced to any formula.\" Rather, it requires courts to exercise reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord them its respect. That process is guided by many of the same considerations relevant to analysis of other constitutional provisions that set forth broad principles rather than specific requirements. History and tradition guide and discipline this inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries. That method respects our history and learns from it without allowing the past alone to rule the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the\n   right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Applying these established tenets, the Court has long held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution.... Over time ..., the Court has reiterated that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n    at 2597-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While Ramirez accurately references these propositions in support of her appellate arguments, we cannot agree with Ramirez's assertion that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   Court, although not dealing with a criminal statute, ... tells us that intimacy between consenting adults is a fundamentally protected right.\" The issue presented in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   is whether same-sex couples have the right to marry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2605\">\n    at 2602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Where an Interest Is Recognized but not Afforded Fundamental Status, the State Need Only Show a Rational Basis for the Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the premise that we would conclude that the right at issue is a fundamental\n   right, Ramirez argues that section 21.12 does not survive strict-scrutiny review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Abell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9962814\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/613/255/#p266\">\n    613 S.W.2d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the court finds a personal privacy right to be fundamental, the [S]tate must show a compelling interest before invading the designated zone of privacy [strict-scrutiny standard].\"). For example, Ramirez contends that, under the strict-scrutiny standard, \"preventing sexual exploitation of Texas 'schoolchildren,' is not the least restrictive means available to carry out the State's interest because it is both overinclusive and underinclusive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because we have concluded that section 21.12 does not involve a fundamental right, Ramirez's strict-scrutiny arguments are not applicable. The standard under which we would review a challenge to a non-fundamental constitutional right is whether the State has shown a rational basis for the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9962814\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/613/255/#p266\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We need not address her strict-scrutiny arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
