Conaway appeals. He argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the State improperly asked prospective jurors during voir dire to make a commitment to find Conaway guilty if certain conditions were met. He also argues that his conviction for kidnapping must be reversed, because there was insufficient evidence to prove that he confined his victim \"for a substantial period,\" as required by \u00a7 565.110.1.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  We affirm.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Judge Welsh retired as an active member of this Court on April 1, 2018, after the submission of this case.

At the time, Conaway no longer had legal custody of the Victim, and the Victim had not seen Conaway \"in a few years.\" The Victim was in the care of Conaway's former girlfriend, Tammy Clavelle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 16, 2015, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Conaway awoke the Victim at Clavelle's home, and told him to get up because they were going to church. Clavelle objected to Conaway taking the Victim and, after they left the house, she called 9-1-1 and followed Conaway and the Victim in her truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officers Terrence Brown and Jeremy Buske were dispatched to respond to the scene. When they arrived, they encountered Clavelle. She pointed to Conaway and the Victim, who were walking in a nearby parking lot. She explained to the officers that she was the Victim's custodian, and that he had been taken by his father, who was not supposed to have the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The officers called out to Conaway to stop. Instead of stopping, Conaway \"picked up the pace, like a fast walk, actually leaving [the Victim] walking away.\" As the officers continued to demand that Conaway stop, he continued walking away, and called the Victim \"to come to him.\" The Victim appeared confused, because the officers were calling him to come to them, while Conaway was calling him in the opposite direction. Ultimately the Victim went to Conaway. Conaway grabbed the Victim's arm and picked up his pace moving away from the officers, telling them that they would not get the Victim, and that if they wanted to take him, they would have to take the Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both officers testified that as they approached, Conaway grabbed the Victim and \"cradle[d] him underneath his arms[,] [a]nd at the same time start[ed] to reach in his pocket as if he had a weapon.\" At this point, the officers drew their guns. Conaway told the officers to go ahead and shoot him, while holding the Victim \"up high, kind of using him to shield himself.\" After\n   Conaway \"fumbl[ed] around\" in his pocket for a while, the officers concluded that he did not have a gun. The officers holstered their firearms, and Officer Brown instead drew his Taser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Officer Brown pointed the Taser at Conaway, \"[Conaway] took [the Victim] and started trying to shield himself with [the Victim].\" Officer Buske testified, \"[Conaway] had [the Victim] immediately in front of him with his arm wrapped around [the Victim] and [Conaway] was holding [the Victim] directly in front of him.\" Conaway continued to ignore the officers' commands to let the Victim go. Officer Brown \"tried to kind of encircle [Conaway] and tr[ied] to come at a different angle[,] [a]nd he would just turn with the child.\" Officer Brown testified that Conaway adjusted his hold on the Victim \"trying to eliminate us from having anywhere to deploy the Taser on him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultimately, Officer Brown walked up to Conaway and shocked him in the face or neck, which was \"the safest location possible to deploy the Taser where the child would not be in any danger.\" Upon being tased, Conaway immediately dropped the Victim, and the officers took Conaway into custody. The officers later discovered that at least one of the prongs of the Taser had shocked the Victim, despite Officer Brown's efforts to use the device solely on Conaway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A recording from the police vehicle's dashboard camera was admitted into evidence and played for the jury. The camera did not capture video of the officers' interaction with Conaway, because of the direction the patrol car was pointing. On the audio, Conaway can be heard repeatedly stating, \"You take me, you take him.\" The dashboard camera's recording indicates that the entire incident, from the officers' arrival at the scene until their restraint of Conaway, lasted approximately 90 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Conaway was charged with the class A felony of kidnapping, in violation of \u00a7 565.110 (Count I); the class C felony of endangering the welfare of a child in the first degree, in violation of \u00a7 568.045 (Count III), and the class D felony of resisting arrest, in violation of \u00a7 575.150 (Count IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of these counts relied on the allegation that Conaway had used the Victim as a shield as the officers were attempting to apprehend him. Thus, in Count I, Conaway was charged with kidnapping by unlawfully confining the Victim \"for the purpose of using [him] as a shield.\" In Count III, Conaway was charged with endangering the Victim's welfare \"by failing to cooperate with police commands while holding [the Victim] in front of defendant's body.\" In Count IV, the State alleged that, in resisting a lawful detention, Conaway \"created a substantial risk of serious physical injury or death to a person in that the defendant used [the Victim] as a shield when the law enforcement officer drew his firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A jury trial was held in August 2016. The prosecutor explained to the venire panel that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [e]ach element [of the charged offenses] must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There's no higher or lower burden with regards to each separate element. They all must be found, they all must be found beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict for each count. Is there anyone who would hold the State to a higher burden and make us prove anything that's maybe not an element? And it's kind of confusing when I\n   say that, but like motive. Motive is why someone does something. Motive is not an element in any of the three counts that we have alleged against the defendant. Is anyone going to have trouble finding-convicting, if you have an unanswered question like why did someone do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defense counsel objected to the question concerning motive. The trial court overruled the objection, but asked the prosecutor to clarify her question. The prosecutor rephrased the question by asking, \"[i]s [motive] something that you would require the State to prove before you would be able to convict?\" In response, three prospective jurors stated that they would hesitate to convict someone of kidnapping his or her own child; none of the venirepersons expressed concerns related to motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After a three-day trial, the jury found Conaway guilty of all three offenses submitted to them: kidnapping, endangering the welfare of a child in the first degree, and resisting arrest. Consistent with the charging instrument, the verdict directors for each offense relied on Conaway's act of using the Victim as a shield when officers attempted to apprehend him. Having found Conaway to be a persistent felony offender, the court imposed sentences of fifteen years on the kidnapping count, seven years for endangering the welfare of a child, and four years for resisting detention, with the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Conaway appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Conaway raises two arguments on appeal. He first argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor's voir dire questioning concerning motive improperly solicited a commitment from the jury. In his second Point, Conaway argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping count, because the State failed to prove that he confined the Victim \"for a substantial period.\" We reject both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Conaway first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State, over his objection, to ask prospective jurors whether they \"would be able to convict\" Conaway without proof of motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The purpose of voir dire is to discover bias or prejudice in order to select a fair and impartial jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court overruled defense counsel's objection to this inquiry, and the Eastern District affirmed. The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   the prosecutor correctly stated that motive was not an element of the charged offenses and asked whether any potential jurors would, nonetheless, require evidence of motive. Neither a negative nor an affirmative answer to this question could reasonably be construed as committing a prospective juror to a particular course of action, i.e., to convict or acquit, or to give credibility and weight to the testimony of any particular witness. To the contrary, the purpose of the prosecutor's question was to determine whether the venire could follow the trial court's instructions and recognize the State's burden to prove all elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088671\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/561/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Manley\n   </em>\n   , Conaway admits that it is permissible for the prosecution to \"ask about motive provided the question is asked in a way that cannot be construed to commit a prospective juror to either convict or acquit.\" In\n   <em>\n    Manley\n   </em>\n   , the prosecution asked jurors whether they would be able to \"make a decision\" if motive evidence were lacking. The Eastern District held that the prosecution's questioning did not inappropriately seek a commitment from jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, the prosecution asked prospective jurors whether \"you would require the State to prove [motive] before you would be able to convict?\" The \"motive question\" in this case was no more objectionable than the questioning in\n   <em>\n    Manley\n   </em>\n   . Asking potential jurors whether they \"would be able to convict\" despite the lack of motive evidence did not ask for their commitment that they would, in fact, convict Conaway if certain conditions were met. The State merely asked jurors whether the lack of motive evidence would\n   <em>\n    prevent them\n   </em>\n   from convicting; it did not ask whether they\n   <em>\n    would necessarily convict\n   </em>\n   if particular circumstances existed.

As\n   <em>\n    Sistrunk\n   </em>\n   makes clear, however, the statutory requirement that a victim be confined \"for a substantial period\" is not a strictly quantitative measure, and the time period during which the Victim was confined in this case is consistent with the \"one or two minutes\" for which the victim was confined in\n   <em>\n    Sistrunk.\n   </em>\n   414 S.W.3d at 600. In addition, Conaway's confinement of the Victim in this case had independent criminal significance: confinement of a person for use as a shield is defined by statute as an aggravated form of kidnapping, without reference to any other offense the perpetrator may be attempting to commit. Finally, Conaway's confinement of the Victim plainly exposed the Victim to a substantial risk of serious injury, either from the firearms which the officers had drawn, or from the Taser which they ultimately deployed. The danger was particularly significant because Conaway confined the Victim \"during a highly volatile and dangerous situation, increasing the likelihood of harm\" to the Victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 604 (discussing\n   <em>\n    State v.

The kidnapping offenses defined in subsections (1) through (3) involve holding a victim for ransom, using a victim as a shield or hostage, or confining the victim in order to interfere with the performance of a governmental function. The legislature deemed the kidnapping offenses defined by subsections (1) through (3) to be more serious than the offenses defined by subsections (4) and (5), because the offenses defined under subsections (1) through (3) are classified as class A felonies, while the offenses defined by subsections (4) and (5) are class B felonies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 565.110.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The official Comment to the 1973 proposed Criminal Code makes clear that the drafters of the kidnapping statute viewed the offenses defined by subsections (1) through (3) as involving inherent risks which were not adequately addressed by other criminal statutes, and that the \"merely incidental\" standard does not apply to such offenses. The Comment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Kidnapping is designed to cover those situations where the confinement or movement of a person without his consent involves a high risk of injury or death,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      or\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   where it creates a harm (including the terror of the victim) that is not adequately covered by another offense.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subsections 1(1), (2) and (3) clearly involve these types of situations and the confinement or movement for these purposes will not necessarily involve the commission of another offense.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Kidnapping is not meant to cover the confinement or movement which is merely incidental to the commission of another offense. For example, many robberies will involve temporary confinement or movement for a short distance (as when the victim is made to move to another part of a room). To take such incidental confinement or movement and punish it as kidnapping would be making two crimes out of what is basically one offense. In these situations the movement or confinement does not add any additional danger to what is already present from the crime of robbery, and there is no purpose served by punishing this movement or confinement as the very serious offense of kidnapping.... How much movement or confinement is needed as a proper basis for kidnapping cannot be defined precisely as it will vary according to the circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     If the defendant has as his purpose the using of the victim as a shield, or holding him for ransom, then almost any movement or confinement should suffice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Removing the victim from his place of residence or business should suffice for any of the listed purposes.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Beyond this, all that can be clear is that the confinement or movement should be considerably more than that which is merely incidental to the\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     commission of another offense.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   A confinement or movement which is incidental to the other offense is not kidnapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The Comment states that kidnapping for the purpose of shielding\n   <em>\n    inherently\n   </em>\n   involves \"a high risk of injury or death\"; that such an act of kidnapping often may not constitute another offense; and that, with respect to\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   kidnapping offense, \"almost any ... confinement\" should be sufficient to support prosecution,\n   <em>\n    without regard\n   </em>\n   to whether the confinement is \"merely incidental\" to another offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The \"merely incidental\" test discussed in\n   <em>\n    Sistrunk\n   </em>\n   is not applicable here, where Conaway was charged under \u00a7 565.110.1(2) with unlawfully confining the Victim \"for the purpose of ... [u]sing the [Victim] as a shield.\" Instead, the question whether a defendant can simultaneously be convicted of kidnapping for the purpose of shielding, and of other offenses arising out of the same conduct, should be addressed under general criminal-law principles. Section 556.041 provides in relevant part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [w]hen the same conduct of a person may establish the commission of more than one offense he or she may be prosecuted for each such offense. Such person may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (3) The offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of such conduct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Conaway's simultaneous prosecution for kidnapping and other offenses was not prohibited by \u00a7 556.041(3). To determine whether prosecution of multiple offenses is barred by \u00a7 556.041(3), we must consider \"whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181531\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/505/384/#p397\">\n    505 S.W.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397 (Mo. App. E.D. 2016). It is true that the State alleged in connection with each offense that Conaway held the Victim in front of his body during his encounter with police. Despite this overlap, each offense required proof of facts which the others did not. For example, to find Conaway guilty of kidnapping, the jury had to find that he \"unlawfully confined\" the Victim, \"for a substantial period,\" \"for the purpose of ... using [him] as a shield.\" To convict Conaway of child endangerment, the State had to prove that the Victim was less than seventeen years old, and that by holding the Victim in front of him, Conaway knowingly created a substantial risk to the Victim's life and health. \u00a7 568.045.1(1). With respect to resisting arrest, the State had to prove that a law enforcement officer was attempting to detain Conaway, and that Conaway knew this; that Conaway fled from the officer to prevent the detention; and that in fleeing, he created a substantial risk of serious physical injury or death to the Victim by using the Victim as a shield. \u00a7\u00a7 575.150.1(1), .5. Given the difference in the elements of the three offenses, the State was not prohibited from prosecuting Conaway for all three offenses, although they arose from the same underlying incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Conaway's position-that the \"merely incidental\" test should apply to kidnapping for the purpose of shielding-would be unworkable. For example, in this case, in addition to kidnapping, Conaway was charged with endangering the welfare of the Victim, and with resisting a lawful detention. Conaway's briefing acknowledges that it is unclear which of those other counts should be considered the \"underlying offense\" for purposes of determining if the kidnapping charge involved \"merely incidental\" conduct. Conaway's confusion on this point is understandable: the fact is, the kidnapping charge in this case\n   <em>\n    has no\n   </em>\n   underlying offense-it is a\n   \"stand-alone,\" independent criminal charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Conaway's approach would be even more difficult to apply in cases in which kidnapping for the purpose of shielding was charged alone, with no additional charges. Under Conaway's suggested approach, if kidnapping was the only charged offense, a defendant would be entitled to scour the criminal statutes to search for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other offense which\n   <em>\n    could have been\n   </em>\n   charged, and then argue that the conduct underlying the kidnapping charge was \"merely incidental\" to the other (uncharged) offense which the defendant's research had discovered. Where a defendant's underlying conduct potentially constitutes multiple different criminal offenses, it is for a prosecutor to decide which offense to charge; a defendant cannot override that exercise of prosecutorial discretion by arguing that another offense\n   <em>\n    could have been\n   </em>\n   charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
