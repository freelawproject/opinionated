In her sole point on appeal, Wife argues that the motion court erred in refusing to modify the Amended QDRO to quantify her 3.675% monthly share of the Pension by replacing the percentage with a specific dollar amount equaling that share. Because we conclude that the terms of the Amended QDRO effectuate the express intent of the parties' dissolution judgment, and thus the motion\n   court did not err in denying Wife's motion, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
