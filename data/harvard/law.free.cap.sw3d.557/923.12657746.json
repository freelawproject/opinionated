Hunter's loans were approved, and A-1 and Hunter executed contracts regarding those loans. Each of the contracts contained the same arbitration agreement (the \"Agreement\"), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   You [the borrower] agree and understand that a claim or demand for recovery of the balance due lender resulting from your default in payment may be asserted by lender in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The complaint alleged NAF worked with creditors behind the scenes to ensure positive outcomes for creditors in intentionally and consistently one-sided arbitrations. Three days after suit was filed, NAF entered into a consent decree requiring it immediately to stop providing arbitration services for consumer claims nationwide, including claims such as Hunter's for which A-1 seeks to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CompuCredit Corp. v.

In her answer, Hunter asserted a counterclaim alleging a violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act and, in an amended answer, Hunter requested certification of a class of all similarly situated borrowers. A-1 filed an application to compel arbitration on Hunter's counterclaim pursuant to the Agreement. Acknowledging NAF could not play the role the parties envisioned for it in the Agreement, A-1 argued the circuit court must designate a new arbitrator under section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

Accordingly, for purposes of analyzing the issue presented in this case, there are two types of arbitration agreements: (1) agreements in which the parties agree to arbitrate regardless of the availability of a named arbitrator, and (2) agreements in which the parties agree to arbitrate before - but\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   before - a specified arbitrator. If the former, section 5 of the FAA authorizes and requires courts to name a substitute arbitrator when the agreement fails to identify one or fails to provide a means for naming a substitute. If the agreement is of the latter type, however, nothing in the FAA authorizes (let alone requires) a court to compel a party to arbitrate beyond the limits of the agreement it made. Employing this analysis, the Court holds A-1 and Hunter agreed to arbitrate before - but only before - NAF and, as a result, the circuit court did not err in refusing to compel Hunter to arbitrate before some other arbitrator under the auspices of section 5 of the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because NAF aggressively marketed its services to lenders such as A-1 (and other entities routinely entering into contracts of adhesion with consumers in which arbitration agreements might easily be inserted), it comes as no surprise NAF's sudden and unforeseen departure from the consumer arbitration landscape has spawned a great deal of litigation over whether and how to enforce arbitration agreements identifying NAF as the arbitrator. And, because the language of the various arbitration agreements differ widely and materially, it comes as no surprise that the results in these cases are less than uniform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In some of these cases, the courts have focused not on whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate before anyone other than NAF but on whether the reference to NAF was an \"integral part of the agreement\n   to arbitrate\" or an \"ancillary logistical concern.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. ITT Consumer Fin. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743561\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/1217/#p1222\">\n    211 F.3d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222 (11th Cir. 2000) (quotation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Daniel A.

It may be these are simply two descriptions of the same analysis. Or it may be the integral/ancillary analysis would allow for a court to name a substitute arbitrator even though the parties had agreed to arbitrate before - but only before - the named arbitrator provided the agreement was not \"integral\" to the arbitration agreement as a whole. The latter prospect is troubling, but this Court need not definitely resolve the matter here because it is clear in the present case both that A-1 and Hunter intended to arbitrate before - but only before - NAF and that this exclusivity was sufficiently integral to the parties' arrangement that A-1 drafted the Agreement to ensure compliance with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Courts \"ascertain the intent of the parties by looking at the words of the contract and giving those words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Ethridge v.

A-1 drafted this provision and it freely chose to require such an agreement from Hunter (and other borrowers) as a condition of obtaining loans from A-1. Having made the choice to insist upon NAF - and only NAF - as the arbitration forum, A-1 cannot now look to section 5 of the FAA to expand the arbitration promise it extracted from Hunter in the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Other considerations support this conclusion. As noted above, the Agreement provides Hunter's claims \"shall be resolved by binding arbitration by the National Arbitration Forum,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     under the Code of Procedure then in effect\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" [Emphasis added.] The 2006 NAF Code of Procedure, submitted as evidence by A-1, provides that only NAF may administer the Code. In other words, the parties agreed to arbitrate pursuant to NAF's Code and, according to NAF, only NAF can apply and administer that Code. This precludes any inference that the parties - despite having named NAF as the only arbitrator before which they would proceed - intended to arbitrate before some other arbitrator in the event NAF was unavailable. Similarly, the requirement in the Agreement that arbitration claims must be filed at NAF's home office in Minnesota or in one of its branches precludes the inference the parties' Agreement extended to arbitrations before any arbitrator other than NAF. Taken as a whole, therefore, the plain language of the Agreement shows Hunter and A-1 agreed to arbitrate before NAF and no other arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To be clear, merely identifying an arbitrator in an arbitration agreement - without more - cannot justify refusing to name a substitute under section 5 of the FAA on the ground the parties' agreement was limited to arbitrating before - but only before - the identified arbitrator. Instead, there must be a basis to conclude the parties' arbitration agreement was limited to the specified arbitrator. Here, the plain language of the Agreement provides that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the circuit court's denial of A-1's application to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Draper, Russell, Powell, Breckenridge and Stith, JJ., and Page, Sp.J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fischer, C.J., not participating.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to RSMo 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    A-1 initially attempted to raise this same claim in a separate point relied on by couching NAF's unavailability in terms of a \"latent ambiguity.\" In its reply brief, however, A-1 conceded this claim is indistinguishable from its first. A-1 also attempted to raise a claim the circuit court erred by failing to appoint an arbitrator under section 435.360, a provision of the Missouri Uniform Arbitration Act (\"MUAA\"), to fill the role envisioned for NAF in the parties' Agreement. This point is not preserved, however, because it was not \"presented to or decided by the trial court.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Nixon v. Am. Tobacco Co.\n    </em>\n    , Inc.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11156689\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/34/122/#p129\">\n     34 S.W.3d 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 129 (Mo. banc 2000). A-1 referenced the MUAA only once in its filings before the circuit court. That reference came in the form of a footnote, which was appended to a sentence arguing the FAA governed the parties' arbitration agreement and required arbitration. This note reads: \"Even if the [MUAA] were to be applied, the results would be the same - arbitration is required in this case.\" This is insufficient to put the circuit court on notice A-1 was asserting section 435.360 as a separate and independent basis for its application to compel arbitration. As a result, this solitary reference was insufficient to preserve the claim for appellate review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Section 5 is a default provision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hall St. Assocs., L.L.C. v.
