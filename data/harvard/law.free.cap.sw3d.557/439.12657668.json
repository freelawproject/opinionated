(\"TracFone\") and City of Springfield (\"City\") have each appealed the trial court's April 3, 2017 \"Second Amended Judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules 81.04(c) and 84.04(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   TracFone's appeal (SD34937) and City's appeal (SD34948) were consolidated. TracFone raises one point of alleged trial court error, and City raises three points of alleged trial court error. Finding no merit in any of the points, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal derives from TracFone's action for declaratory judgment against City. TracFone filed its petition in Greene County, Missouri, seeking a judicial declaration that it was not subject to City's gross receipts license tax (\"license tax\"), pursuant to Springfield Municipal Code of Ordinances, Article XI, \u00a7 70-452,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and owed no back taxes thereunder. City filed a counter-claim seeking a judicial declaration that TracFone was subject to City's license tax, requesting damages in the form of back taxes owed by TracFone, that TracFone be enjoined from violating City's license tax ordinance, and that City be awarded its costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   TracFone and City filed competing motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted City's motion and denied TracFone's. The trial court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that TracFone was subject to City's license tax, and that the sole issue remaining was the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of TracFone's tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During a two-day bench trial, City and TracFone adduced conflicting evidence regarding the amount of TracFone's liability, including expert witness testimony from TracFone's expert, Thomas E. Hilton, and City's expert, Dr. Penny Clayton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court entered its Second Amended Judgment on April 3, 2017. As relevant to this appeal, the trial court made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   55. The Court finds that TracFone is obligated to pay City 6% of its gross receipts from customers as measured by credit card billing addresses within the City of Springfield. Those amounts are reflected in trial exhibits 212-34 and 571 on a quarter-by-quarter basis beginning January 2007 and ending June 2016. That amount totals $585,278.03.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   56. The Court has excluded in the calculation of TracFone's gross receipts the amount received by TracFone from customers for internet access for the periods 2013 through 2015. The reason being that while the Court is satisfied TracFone has the ability to distinguish receipts for internet access for the entire back tax period, and they would not\n   then be subject to tax, TracFone did not adequately respond to City's timely request for this documentation in advance of trial except for the period 2013-2015. Therefore, for the periods in which TracFone provided City records removing internet access receipts, those receipts will not be subject to tax. For the periods in which TracFone did not provide City records removing internet access, those receipts will be included in the gross receipts and subject to the back tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   57. The Court finds that TracFone owes back taxes to City, and that some of those tax obligations date back to January 2007. Therefore the Court will award additional damages to City as interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the past due tax obligation, on a quarterly basis for the amounts past due beginning January 2007 through June 2012 and 3% per annum on past due tax obligation on a quarterly basis for the amounts past due beginning June 2012 through June 2016. That amount totals $95,048.69. The interest calculation is made on the telephone access back taxes only, as the taxes included for internet access is included in the damage award only because TracFone did not provide City the data in advance of trial. The same analysis does not apply to interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   58. The Court finds that TracFone had a reasonable good faith position that it did not owe a gross receipts tax to City based on the language of Springfield City Code Sec. 70-452. Similarly, despite being aware of TracFone's business, and that TracFone was collecting sales tax within the City of Springfield, City never made any effort to notify TracFone of the gross receipts tax, never made any effort to review or audit TracFone's books or business model, and never issued any notice of tax due or notice of delinquent tax obligation before filing a civil lawsuit. Therefore the Court does not award City additional damages as a penalty for non-payment of tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   59. City has requested that Attorney's fees be assessed as additional damages against TracFone. Attorney's fees may only be assessed if allowed by statute, or by contractual agreement, or if special circumstances exist. \"[W]ith few exceptions, each litigant must bear his own attorney's fee.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Henry v.

In one point on appeal, TracFone asserts the trial court erred in finding that TracFone owed $680,326.72 in back taxes and interest to City because the trial court's determination that TracFone is a \"home service provider,\" under the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (\"MTSA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   precludes City from taxing TracFone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In its cross-appeal, City asserts in three points that the trial court erred: (1) in its interpretation and application of City's license tax ordinance because the ordinance was construed to only apply to a portion of TracFone's receipts (revenue sorted by credit card billing address zip codes), when\n   the license tax requires that the license tax be applied to all of TracFone's receipts from providing telecommunications services within City (revenue sorted by Activation Zip Codes); (2) in denying City an award of penalties; and (3) in its application of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (\"ITFA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to TracFone's gross receipts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Principles of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We must affirm the trial court's judgment unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, the judgment is against the weight of the evidence, or the judgment erroneously declares or applies the law.

City suggests that its license tax ordinance \"unambiguously requires that the license tax be applied to all of TracFone's receipts from providing telecommunications services within City (revenue sorted by activation zip code)[,]\" and that the trial court errantly applied the ordinance \"to only apply to a small portion of TracFone's receipts (revenue sorted by credit card billing address zip codes)[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As an initial matter, City is mistaken when it asserts that Point I relates to \"undisputed facts.\" The issue of TracFone's liability was resolved in City's\n   favor in summary judgment-however, the issue of damages was resolved by a contested two-day bench trial. City and TracFone put forward conflicting evidence and conflicting legal theories as to damages, which the trial court resolved in its Second Amended Judgment. City's misapprehension directly undercuts the efficacy of its Point I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As relevant (and fatal) to City's Point I, the trial court made the following findings:\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 \"[City's] Witness Professor Penny Clayton included in her calculation of gross receipts TracFone sales to Walmart and other retailers based on her assumption those sales were not legitimate wholesale/retail sales. The Court finds this assumption not otherwise supported by the evidence, and therefore her conclusion as to back taxes owed to be inaccurate[ ]\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 \"The Court makes a specific finding that the methodology for calculating back taxes as described in the evidence by [TracFone's] witness Thomas E.

City does not challenge (facially or successfully) the trial court's findings, recited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that: the testimony of City's expert witness was \"inaccurate\" and (by implication) not credible; the testimony of TracFone's expert witness was credible and his methodology reliable; and, using \"customer's credit card billing address[es] ... is the best method currently for determining the gross receipts subject to tax under the Springfield City Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There are two distinct methods by which an appellant may challenge the evidentiary basis of a judgment-a not-supported-by-substantial-evidence challenge, and an-against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A not-supported-by-substantial-evidence challenge requires completion of three sequential steps:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) identify a challenged factual proposition, the existence of which is necessary to sustain the judgment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) identify all of the favorable evidence in the record supporting the existence of that proposition; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) demonstrate why that favorable evidence, when considered along with\n   the reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence, does not have probative force upon the proposition such that the trier of fact could not reasonably decide the existence of the proposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   On the other hand, an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge requires completion of four sequential steps:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) identify a challenged factual proposition, the existence of which is necessary to sustain the judgment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (2) identify all of the favorable evidence in the record supporting the existence of that proposition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (3) identify the evidence in the record contrary to the belief of that proposition, resolving all conflicts in testimony in accordance with the trial court's credibility determinations, whether explicit or implicit; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (4) demonstrate why the favorable evidence, along with the reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence, is so lacking in probative value, when considered in the context of the totality of the evidence, that it fails to induce belief in that proposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Houston v.

Namely, City directs that: (1) TracFone failed to file quarterly reports with City, and that penalties should have been assessed, pursuant to section 71.625;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   is not an element of City code section 70-457\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and section 71.625; and (3) the trial court erred in rejecting penalties based on its finding that TracFone did not deviate from City's code willfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   City suggests that the trial court erred in failing to award penalties prior to the third quarter of 2012 because TracFone failed to file quarterly reports with City. City's brief wholly fails to show that its current argument was timely presented to the trial court, pursuant to Rule 84.04(e), and makes no effort at showing what credited evidence City (or TracFone) adduced at trial as to TracFone's alleged failure to file quarterly reports. On appeal, this is City's burden as the moving party-this burden \"shall not be shifted to the [reviewing] court.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Greene County v. Barnett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8981706\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/231/854/#p858\">\n    231 S.W.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858 (Mo. App. S.D. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   TracFone asserts that the record contains no such evidence, and, we-undirected by City-find none. In the absence of credited evidence sufficient to sustain the factual predicate of its legal challenge, City's Point II must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 84.04(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We further observe that City's argument in Point II inappropriately conflates several challenges with distinct standards of review. City contends that the trial court's failure to award penalties under City code section 70-457 was: (1) \"erroneous\"; (2) \"plain error\", (3) \"not supported by any evidence\"; (4) \"not supported by any ... legal authority\"; and (5) \"against the weight of the evidence.\" The defect to such an approach is two-fold. First, the latter four standards are not invoked in City's Point II, in violation of Rule 84.04-argument outside the point relied on is prohibited, and will not be considered.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Jackson v. City of Joplin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299049\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/300/531/#p534\">\n    300 S.W.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (Mo. App. S.D. 2009). Second, each of the five contemplate a completely separate standard of review, and each has a different (and mandatory) attendant analytical framework. City's argument makes no effort-token or otherwise-at conforming its argument to such independent analytical frameworks. Ultimately, as our Supreme Court indicated (in response to a less variegated claim combination): \"These are distinct claims. They must appear in separate points relied on ... to be preserved for appellate review.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ivie\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916869\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/439/189/#p205\">\n    439 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   199 n.11 (citing Rule 84.04). City's Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     City's Point III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Point III, City argues the trial court erred in \"applying the Internet Tax Freedom Act to TracFone's gross receipts[.]\" City suggests that \"the Internet Tax Freedom Act is an affirmative defense[,]\" and TracFone failed to plead or prove which of its charges were for internet access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   City's Point III argument suffers from the same defect as its argument in Point I. Namely, City's argument fails to account for the trial court findings otherwise sufficient to sustain its challenged ruling. As TracFone points out in its response brief, City does not challenge the trial court's finding that: \"Springfield City Code Sec. 70.452 does not apply to receipts from the sale of internet access[,]\" nor does City\n   challenge the trial court's fact finding that: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     City agrees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that its tax ordinance does\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   apply to revenues from internet access.\" (Emphasis added). The underlying premise on which the argument in City's Point III relies is that TracFone's charges \"for Internet access\" \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   subject to taxation[.]\" (Emphasis added). This premise is incompatible with the unchallenged findings of the trial court, as recited\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons discussed at length in our treatment of City's Point I, the argument in City's Point III must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We further observe that City's argument in Point III inappropriately conflates separate challenges, in a manner similar to its argument in Point II. City's argument suggests that reversal is required because the \"\n   <em>\n    trial court erred as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   \" in failing to award City \"judgment on all of TracFone's Airtime revenues sorted by Springfield Activation Zip Codes[,]\" and because the record is lacking in \"\n   <em>\n    sufficient evidence\n   </em>\n   ,\" or \"is\n   <em>\n    wholly devoid of ... evidence\n   </em>\n   ,\" to warrant the trial court's ruling. (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"In appeals from a court-tried civil case, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321942\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/298/#p307\">\n    321 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   307-08 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10120440\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/536/30/#p32\">\n    536 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   32 ). \"[A] substantial[-]evidence challenge, a misapplication-of-the-law challenge, and an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge[,] ... are distinct claims and must appear in separate points relied on to be preserved for appellate review.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Higgins v.
