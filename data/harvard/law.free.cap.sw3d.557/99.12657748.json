App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied) (\"\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   \"). This appeal follows the bench trial on remand. Connie challenges the trial court's final order and decree on division of property and determination of conservatorship. In three issues, Connie contends the trial court abused its discretion by: (1) permitting her trial counsel to withdraw, over her objection, approximately four weeks before trial and without granting a trial continuance; (2) naming Cliff sole managing conservator of the Harrisons' two children; and (3) dividing the marital estate. After careful review of the record, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A trial judge maintains considerable discretion to control disposition of cases \"with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Today's case presents numerous challenges to a trial court's discretionary rulings that, in many respects, balance a litigant's rights against the trial court's broad authority to enforce orders and constrain the litigant's dilatory or obstructive behavior. A litigant's dilatory conduct is especially concerning in a case involving the custody of children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is so because, in a case such as today's that involves conservatorship,\n   access, and possession decisions, the children's best interest must remain the court's primary concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.002. Conservatorship, access, and possession of the Harrison children have been matters of debate since October 2006, when Cliff initially filed for divorce from Connie. The children, who were six and two years old when this case began, have now reached the ages of seventeen and thirteen, with the upheaval of their parents' divorce and the ongoing custody dispute overshadowing the vast majority of their lives. We are now presented with a new appeal involving challenges to custody decisions and other rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Connie and Cliff Harrison were married in February 2000. Both are licensed attorneys. They have a son who was born in 2000 (\"J.H.\") and a daughter who was born in 2004 (\"V.H.\"). Connie and Cliff ceased living together in January 2006; Cliff filed for divorce on October 30, 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    367 S.W.3d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From October 2006 to February 2008, Connie was represented in the divorce proceeding by six different attorneys, and she occasionally represented herself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    at 823-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In January 2010, with trial set to begin in March, Connie's trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw based on Connie's inability to pay attorney's fees. Connie opposed her trial counsel's withdrawal and sought interim attorney's fees. After a hearing, the trial court permitted Connie's counsel to withdraw and denied Connie's motion for interim fees. Connie filed a motion for continuance, but the trial court denied the motion. In March 2010, the trial court called the case for trial, and Connie announced that she was \"not ready.\" Nonetheless, the case proceeded to a jury trial with Connie representing herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following trial, the court signed a final decree of divorce on June 21, 2010. Connie appealed the judgment to this court. Holding the trial court erred by denying a continuance when allowing Connie's trial counsel to withdraw, we reversed and remanded for a new trial in April 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, we affirmed the divorce between the parties as of the date of the decree. Since our remand in April 2012, this case has been preferentially set for trial a number of times, and Connie has alternated between periods of self-representation and representation by numerous attorneys, all of whom have withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2014, after participating in court-ordered mediation, the parties signed a mediated settlement agreement (the \"MSA\"). Connie moved to set aside the MSA the following March, asserting that she had been a victim of family violence, which impaired her ability to make decisions, and the MSA was not in the best interest of J.H. and V.H. She also asserted that \"there has been a change in circumstances\n   since the signing of the mediated agreement.\" But on the motion of the children's amicus attorney, the trial court signed an interim order on parent-child issues incorporating the terms of the MSA on April 10 (the \"Interim Order\"). Consistent with the MSA, the Interim Order named Connie and Cliff joint managing conservators of J.H. and V.H. The Interim Order also provided Connie the exclusive right to designate the children's residence within Harris County, while providing Cliff extended possession of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Connie failed to fully comply with the trial court's Interim Order, as well as other orders. As Connie's violations are relevant to our analysis of the issues she presents, we summarize pertinent examples from the record. In March 2014, Second Baptist School notified Cliff and Connie that the children would not be permitted to enroll again the following school year because the \"continued legal dispute concerning possession and other matters ... has required considerable focus by school employees and has on too many occasions distracted school staff from the school's need to focus on the spiritual and educational needs of all students at the school.\" Thereafter, in May, the trial court signed additional temporary orders authorizing Cliff to enroll the children in private school. Under the terms of that order, if private school was unavailable, then the children were to attend the public schools to which Cliff's home was zoned-Briargrove Elementary and Grady Middle School. Despite these orders, Connie unilaterally enrolled J.H. and V.H. in schools other than those specified by the orders. Further, Connie also violated the orders by withholding J.H. and V.H. from Cliff during his designated visitation times on several occasions. During the summer of 2014, Connie prevented Cliff from seeing or speaking with J.H. and V.H. for numerous weeks. Cliff filed numerous contempt motions against Connie for violating the court's visitation orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 4, 2014, Cliff filed his first amended petition for division of property and to establish a parenting plan. In this petition, Cliff stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties and the AMICUS attorney mediated ... on January 29, 2014. A mediated settlement agreement on the parent-child issues was agreed to and signed by the parties and the AMICUS attorney. Since the signing of that mediated settlement agreement, a material and substantial change has occurred with regard to the children and/or the parties, and as such, the agreements pertaining to the children are not in the best interest of the children. Respondent has engaged in a course of conduct that is injurious to the welfare of the children, and this Court should make appropriate orders for the protection of the children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to conservatorship of the children, Cliff alleged that the continuation of Connie and he as joint managing conservators was no longer in the children's best interest, and he requested that, on final hearing, the court appoint Cliff sole managing conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, on August 19, Cliff filed a motion to set aside the MSA or to modify the Interim Order. Cliff alleged that Connie violated the trial court's orders on several occasions, including withholding J.H. and V.H. during Cliff's designated periods of access, failing to allow communications between Cliff and the children, and engaging in a course of conduct \"designed with the specific intent of alienating the children from their father.\" Cliff sought to be named as the children's temporary sole managing conservator. After a hearing on September 3, the trial court signed an order granting Cliff's motion for temporary\n   orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding the following actions necessary for the safety and welfare of J.H. and V.H. and in their best interests, the trial court: (1) removed Connie as a joint managing conservator, (2) appointed Cliff temporary sole managing conservator, (3) designated Cliff with \"the exclusive right to all periods of possession and access of the children,\" and (4) barred Connie from \"any periods of possession and/or access to the children until further order of the Court or by written agreement of the parties and attorneys.\" At some point before trial, the trial court apparently allowed Connie supervised visitation with J.H. and V.H., although our record does not contain an order so specifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Meanwhile, on September 2, Cliff filed a motion for enforcement of possession and access, in which he alleged that Connie had violated the court's orders concerning possession of and access to the children. In this motion, he requested that Connie be held in contempt, jailed, and fined for various alleged violations. Connie appeared at the hearing on Cliff's motion for enforcement on October 16. In an enforcement order signed October 24, the court: (1) found Connie committed eleven violations of its orders; (2) held Connie in criminal contempt for the violations; (3) fined Connie $3,000; and (4) ordered Connie to pay Cliff's reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs of $25,554.30. The trial court ordered Connie confined to the Harris County Jail for 120 days, but suspended Connie's confinement and placed her on community supervision contingent on Connie paying the attorney's fees and fines and complying with the court's orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Connie failed to pay the fees and fines as ordered, Cliff moved to revoke her probation. Cliff's motion to revoke was set for hearing on December 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In early December 2014, Connie retained new counsel. At that time, Connie faced several hearings on Cliff's motions for enforcement and revocation, as well as a January 20, 2015 trial setting. On December 15, however, Connie's counsel filed a motion to withdraw and a motion for continuance. Both motions were set for hearing on December 18 along with Cliff's motion to revoke.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the December 18 hearing, the court found Connie had violated the terms of her community supervision and ordered Connie jailed for violating the trial court's October 24 order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearings on December 18, 22, and 23, the trial court orally denied the motion for continuance and granted Connie's counsel's motion to withdraw. We discuss those proceedings in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 9, 2015, the trial court conducted a pretrial conference. At that hearing, the trial court ordered Connie and Cliff to exchange with each other a complete set of trial exhibits before 5:00 p.m. that day at Cliff's counsel's office. The trial court further ordered Connie and Cliff to provide copies of their trial exhibits to the amicus attorney by 5:00 p.m. on January 12. At a pretrial hearing on January 16, the trial court learned that Connie failed to\n   exchange exhibits with Cliff on January 9, and failed to serve her exhibits on the amicus attorney by January 12. When questioned by the court, Connie acknowledged she made no attempt to exchange exhibits with either Cliff or the amicus attorney at any time before the January 16 hearing. Both Cliff and the amicus attorney provided their exhibits to Connie. The trial court then ordered Connie to provide her exhibits to Cliff by 1:45 p.m. that day, recessing proceedings to provide Connie time to comply. Proceedings continued at 2:00 p.m. But Connie had only an original copy of her exhibits and was unable to tender copies to opposing counsel or the amicus attorney. Finding that Connie failed to comply with repeated orders to tender exhibits to opposing counsel and the amicus attorney, the trial court excluded Connie's exhibits from evidence at the scheduled jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court instructed all parties to appear at 8:30 a.m. on January 20 to resolve any outstanding pre-trial matters then begin trial. Connie was not represented by counsel and she failed to appear at 8:30 a.m. Cliff, his counsel, and the amicus attorney appeared timely. At approximately 9:30 a.m., Cliff, the only party who filed a jury demand and paid a jury fee, waived his right to jury trial and requested a bench trial. Connie still was not present. Testimony commenced to the bench. Connie did not arrive in the courtroom until about 10:15 a.m. At that time, Cliff was testifying. Connie notified the trial court that she had filed a motion to recuse the trial judge. The trial court denied the motion to recuse, but recessed proceedings until the administrative judge could rule on the motion. After the administrative judge denied the motion to recuse, proceedings recommenced around 1:30 p.m. At that time, Connie objected to proceeding with trial without a jury. The trial court overruled her objection and proceeded with the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Cliff testified to facts bearing on the relevant disputed issues, predominantly custody. Cliff provided examples of Connie's conduct that Cliff considered dishonest and manipulative. For instance, Cliff testified that Connie attempted to buy an expensive home without Cliff's consent or knowledge; Connie forged her name on checks, cashed them, and then lied about it; and Connie deceived Cliff about various home improvements and credit cards. According to Cliff, Connie repeatedly violated court orders regarding J.H. and V.H., by secreting the children from Cliff, attempting to alienate them from Cliff, enrolling them in unapproved schools for the 2015-2016 school year, and communicating with them when she had been ordered to refrain from doing so. Cliff also described several physical altercations with Connie.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Connie cross-examined Cliff extensively regarding whether he called her names or behaved inappropriately toward her in front of J.H. and V.H. after the two separated. Cliff, for the most part, acknowledged he had frequently spoken to Connie in a derogatory manner, but denied that he had ever done so in front of the children. Cliff acknowledged that he had likely sent Connie disparaging text messages. He repeatedly denied that he had ever \"beaten up\" Connie in front of J.H. or V.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Another key issue involved Second Baptist School's decision declining enrollment to the Harrison children for the 2015-2016 school year. The lower school principal, Tamara Gallagher, testified via deposition that J.H. and V.H. were not permitted to\n   re-enroll because of Connie's repeated school policy violations. Gallagher explained that Connie frequently violated school policy. For example, Connie interrupted teachers or pulled the children out of class during school hours, arrived late for pick-up but refused to sign a late form, failed to sign in when she arrived for school visits during school hours, argued with school personnel to alter disciplinary decisions concerning the children, and frequently called to change pick-up instructions very close to dismissal times. Gallagher stated that the school never had a problem with Cliff. She agreed that but for the repeated violations of school policies by Connie, J.H. and V.H. would still be permitted to attend Second Baptist School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Cliff testified that the children's inability to continue attending Second Baptist School was \"very hard\" on the children because it was the only school they had ever attended. Cliff enrolled J.H. and V.H. in counseling; he enrolled in counseling himself on the recommendation of the daughter's counselor. V.H.'s counselor testified that she believed Connie's conduct warranted supervised visitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I feel that the supervised visits should continue.... [B]ased on what I've experienced or been made aware of throughout this proceeding, there was [sic] a lot of rules that weren't being followed during visitation and around visitation, and a lot of distress around visitation handoffs and things of that nature, and I think the structure of the supervised visits provides a level of comfort and stability for [V.H.]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I base my recommendation [of continuing supervised visitation] on lots of things; not just what the father says and what the mother says but the clinical presentation of the child, the-my experience during therapy over the weeks.\n   <em>\n    And in my clinical opinion, supervised visits are in the best interest for [V.H.] at this time\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added). J.H.'s counselor also testified. He stated that J.H. has no fear of either parent, loves them both very much, but would like this case to be over. J.H. also expressed a strong preference to return to Second Baptist School for the next school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to Cliff, Connie has no sense of boundaries or appropriate behavior when it comes to dealing with or confronting people. She inappropriately inserts herself into situations, such as teacher-student relationships. Cliff testified that Connie could be \"manipulative\" in dealing with the children. Cliff stated that the children seem to be benefiting from their therapy. He indicated that there are \"no major\" concerns between J.H. and V.H. and the children of Cliff's then-fianc\u00e9e, Heather Fitzsimmons-they were working on blending the family. Cliff explained that J.H. and V.H. are both aware of the ongoing proceedings, but he does not discuss it with them. He acknowledged that the children probably know more about the proceedings than they should. Cliff stated that he avoids altercations with Connie by simply avoiding being around her alone. He believed that he can control himself around Connie, but he had concerns about whether Connie can control herself around him. Connie, on the other hand, stated that she did not think she and Cliff could operate as joint managing conservators of the children based on Cliff's \"rage\" towards her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Connie's sister, Sue Yen Vasquez Davis, testified via deposition. Connie and Davis had not spoken in several years. Davis agreed that Cliff had \"always demonstrated good judgment\" around J.H. and V.H. She described Cliff as a \"good father,\" \"nurturing,\" and \"patient.\" She had no concerns about Cliff's ability to raise J.H. and V.H. She also agreed that she would\n   have \"no hesitancy\" in leaving her own children in Cliff's care. When asked similar questions regarding Connie, Davis notably stated she had either \"no comment\" or \"no opinion.\" For example, Davis had no comment on whether Connie was physically violent, had a propensity to initiate arguments, had a \"paranoid tendency,\" or was psychologically stable. Davis would offer no opinion as to whether Connie was deceptive or combative. She also had no opinion regarding her feelings toward Connie. When asked if she would leave her own children in Connie's care, Davis responded, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   During trial, the trial court afforded Cliff and Connie equal, but reasonably limited, time to present their evidence and cross-examine witnesses. During the trial, the trial court repeatedly reminded Connie how much time she had used and how much time remained. Despite the trial court's reminders, when Connie's allotted time expired, Connie argued she lacked sufficient time to present all her desired evidence. The court granted Connie an additional hour to present further evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After hearing evidence and the parties' arguments, the trial court orally rendered judgment on February 12, 2015, and signed the final judgment on March 26, 2015. The trial court appointed Cliff sole managing conservator of J.H. and V.H. and named Connie possessory conservator. The court ordered that Connie have supervised possession of J.H. and V.H. for four hours, twice a month. The court further enjoined both parties from making disparaging remarks about the other, and from discussing this or any future litigation regarding conservatorship issues in the presence of J.H. and V.H. Finally, as is relevant to this appeal, the trial court awarded Cliff the former marital home. Connie timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Connie challenges (1) the trial court's decision to permit Connie's counsel to withdraw one month before trial without granting a continuance, (2) the trial court's conservatorship determination, and (3) the trial court's division of property. All of these rulings are subject to an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    367 S.W.3d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (abuse-of-discretion standard applies to both grant of motion to withdraw and denial of motion for continuance);\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Facts Regarding the Withdrawal of Connie's Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Cliff filed for divorce from Connie on October 30, 2006. From that date until the parties' first divorce trial in March 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Connie employed at least six different lawyers, each of whom withdrew for various reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    367 S.W.3d at 823-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (detailing Connie's legal representation history during that time period). When not represented by counsel, Connie represented herself. She also represented herself at the first divorce trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Post-remand, Connie retained a number of new attorneys in succession, each of whom withdrew. On September 5, 2014, Connie consented to the withdrawal of her then counsel of record. At that time, trial was preferentially set for mid-January 2015. Connie represented herself from September until early December 2014, when she retained Sara Razavi Zand as counsel. When Connie retained Razavi Zand, upcoming settings included the December 18, 2014 hearing on Cliff's motions to revoke probation and for enforcement, and a January 20, 2015 trial setting. On December 15, 2014, less than two weeks after Connie had retained her, Razavi Zand filed a motion to withdraw as Connie's counsel, as well as a motion for continuance, neither of which are contained in our record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The December 18 hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At the December 18 hearing, the trial court first heard Cliff's motion to revoke Connie's probation. Razavi Zand represented Connie on the motion to revoke probation. After hearing testimony from Connie and Cliff, and after considering argument of counsel, including Razavi Zand on Connie's behalf, the trial court ordered her probation revoked and committed her to 120 days in the Harris County jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the court revoked Connie's probation, Razavi Zand requested a continuance of the preferential trial setting so that Connie could obtain new counsel. Cliff objected to further continuances: \"[T]his is our fourth preferential trial setting just since the remand. It does not include the prior trial settings. Every time we get close to trial, we get the same motion for continuance. We get the same motion for fees, and then we get a withdrawal. It happens every single time.\" The children's amicus attorney, while not urging that the continuance be denied, noted, \"I do believe that these children deserve finality, just like I said back in 2010; and here we are four years down the road and they still don't have that finality. [J.H.] has been in\n   litigation for more than half his life, and he knows it. He's tired of it; and, so, I think the children deserve to be children and move about.\" The trial court denied the motion for continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Razavi Zand then presented her motion to withdraw, which Connie (and Cliff) opposed. Razavi Zand articulated her reasons for withdrawing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   At this time, Your Honor, there is a big conflict of interest. There are reasons that I cannot at this point ethically and-I cannot ethically represent [Connie] pursuant to our Disciplinary Rules ... that we follow, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   There's a conflict of interest. The conflict of interest arose on Monday, and the conflict of interest-there is now a bigger conflict of interest that has occurred within the past 48 hours that would prevent me from properly representing [Connie] moving forward....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The conflict that I'm referring to is a conflict between my client and I that prevents me from properly representing her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   As far as, like I said, without going into the events that have occurred within the past 48 hours, more so within the past 48 hours, this is not a conflict of interest in the traditional sense that there is another client that it conflicts or anything like that. It's a personal conflict that has arisen between my client and myself where I cannot ethically and morally represent-and maybe I shouldn't use the word \"morally.\" I can't properly represent her in my personal capacity, and my personal interests are-would be put in front of my client's interests at this time....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The basis of my motion to withdraw would be that I cannot ethically and properly represent her with this conflict that has arisen between my client and myself. Nothing outside of my client and myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court initially granted Razavi Zand's motion to withdraw, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I want to be very clear that I don't want to create a policy in this court of letting attorneys withdraw from representing clients that they were recently retained by. However, if this is going to be as you [Razavi Zand], as an officer of the court, have conveyed to this Court that it would subject you to ethical violations with the State Bar, certainly I'm not going to require that you remain on the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   However, I have denied the continuance in this matter, Ms. Harrison. So, and you have an observer here in court today and I don't know the extent of what you have in the works, but you need to be prepared for trial in January.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Cliff's counsel then asked the trial court to reserve its ruling until Connie had an opportunity to speak to an observer-an attorney-to determine if he would agree to represent Connie. The court agreed to withhold ruling and hear further argument on Razavi Zand's motion to withdraw on December 22, when the court had scheduled a jail review hearing on Connie's contempt sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The December 22 hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On December 22, Razavi Zand represented Connie during the jail review portion of the hearing, proposing various courses of action by Connie to pay Cliff's attorney's fees and, thus, secure release from jail. The trial court declined to release Connie from jail at this point because Connie had not articulated a specific plan to pay the attorney's fees. The trial court set a second jail review hearing for a date in January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Razavi Zand then re-urged her motion to withdraw, explaining that her conflict\n   with Connie was \"so egregious\" as to preclude continued representation: \"Because under the disciplinary rule[s], it is a mandatory withdrawal.... I am so conflicted out, due to the egregious conduct that has occurred between my client and myself, that my personal interests have now far exceeded my ability to advocate for Ms. Harrison.\" However, the trial court was not able to complete this hearing, and it recessed until the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The December 23 hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On December 23, the trial court resumed argument on Razavi Zand's motion to withdraw. Connie opposed Razavi Zand's withdrawal if it left her without counsel. She also insisted that Razavi Zand did not have cause to withdraw. Connie testified that Razavi Zand's real reason for withdrawal was financial. Also, Connie stated that Razavi Zand told her she was involved in a lawsuit against the trial judge's husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When questioned, Razavi Zand stated that she disagreed with Connie's implication that Razavi Zand sought to withdraw \"for some other purpose than [Connie's] conduct.\" Razavi Zand stated unequivocally that she was not withdrawing for the reasons Connie suggested. Instead, Razavi Zand clarified that Connie's actions formed the basis for her request to withdraw. She inquired of Connie: \"Would you agree with me that I have informed you\n   <em>\n    that there are certain actions that you have done\n   </em>\n   , prior to my filing, post my filing of my Motion to Withdraw, that I have informed you those were one of many reasons why I was withdrawing?\" (Emphasis added.) Connie responded to this question by affirming that, while she did not want to waive her attorney-client privilege, Razavi Zand had stated reasons for withdrawing, though Connie did not \"agree[ ] with those reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Razavi Zand verified that she had some of Connie's case files at her office and that she would be able to deliver those files to whomever Connie designated, but Connie stated that she had no one who could accept these files on her behalf. Connie explained that she had not been able to retain other counsel due to her confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the close of the hearing, the trial court allowed Razavi Zand to withdraw. The court ordered Razavi Zand to deliver Connie's files on January 2, 2015, a date the trial court scheduled for Connie's next jail review hearing. The trial judge explained that she was ruling only on the motion to withdraw at this hearing, and she could address other pending matters at either the January 2 or January 9 hearings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial setting was January 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Razavi Zand stated that, due to Connie's actions, Razavi Zand could not place Connie's interests above her own:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [T]he conflict at this point is so egregious that I cannot continue to make these arguments and-have to stay on the case.

Connie also suggested that Razavi Zand filed her motion to withdraw because Razavi Zand was involved in a lawsuit against the trial judge's purported husband. But Razavi Zand stated that any such lawsuit was not the reason for her withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on our record, Connie has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in accepting Razavi Zand's statement of the grounds for her motion to withdraw. Razavi Zand explained that her continued representation of Connie would have caused Razavi Zand to violate the disciplinary rules by compromising her fiduciary duties to Connie. Under such circumstances, Razavi Zand was required to withdraw as Connie's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Here, the trial court possessed abundant knowledge of this matter's prolonged history bearing upon whether Connie was entitled to a continuance in December 2014. The record reflects that Connie retained upwards of a dozen different attorneys over the course of this case, hiring at least half of them following our remand. Many of these attorneys withdrew-often with Connie's blessing-before trial settings, resulting in a pattern of trial postponements. Connie consented to the withdrawal of her previous counsel in September 2014, when Connie was aware of the January 2015 trial setting. Connie did not retain Razavi Zand until early December 2014-a little over a month before trial. Less than two weeks into Razavi Zand's representation of Connie, Razavi Zand moved to withdraw based on Connie's actions. On this record, Connie's serial employment of attorneys, continuing unabated following remand,\n   reasonably could be viewed as undertaken for dilatory purposes, which the court could balance against her requested continuance.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    367 S.W.3d at 834-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Serial hiring and firing of attorneys for dilatory purposes would be a legitimate concern to be balanced against a requested continuance in appropriate circumstances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In support of her argument, Connie also cites cases in which courts reversed the denial of a continuance when counsel withdrew.\n   <em>\n    Villegas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9979550\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/711/624/#p626\">\n    711 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626 ;\n   <em>\n    Harrison I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316961\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/367/822/#p835\">\n    367 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   831-34 ;\n   <em>\n    McAleer v.

The trial court scheduled a pretrial conference for January 9, the date by which the parties were to have exchanged their respective\n   trial exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 166(l). However, Connie did not have her exhibits prepared to exchange at the pretrial conference, so the trial court recessed proceedings and ordered Connie to exchange exhibits with Cliff's counsel by 5:00 p.m. that day. Connie assured the court that she could exchange her exhibits by that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Connie failed to appear or contact Cliff's counsel that day. Also, Connie did not make arrangements to exchange exhibits with Cliff's counsel or the amicus attorney at any time between January 9 and the next pretrial conference scheduled for January 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   When January 16 arrived, the trial court learned that Connie still had not provided her exhibits to opposing counsel and the amicus attorney, despite Connie's representation that she would do so by the close of business on January 9. The trial court again provided Connie with additional time to exchange her exhibits, ordering her to provide copies to all counsel by 1:45 p.m. on January 16. The trial court warned Connie that if she failed to provide her exhibits to opposing counsel and the amicus attorney by that time, the court would exclude them: \"So any documents that you intend to tender to [opposing counsel] will occur inside this courtroom at 1:45. If they're not tendered to [opposing counsel] at 1:45, then, they're excluded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Connie failed to meet this third deadline. When Connie arrived in the courtroom (fifteen minutes late) on the afternoon of January 16, she still did not have her exhibits ready to provide to opposing counsel.

She also spent a substantial portion of her allotted time cross-examining Cliff on domestic violence issues. The court did not strike any portion of Connie's pleadings or defenses.

During Connie's offer of proof, Cliff raised numerous additional objections to the admissibility of Connie's exhibits. The trial court considered those objections-effectively reconsidering its pretrial ruling to exclude them-and sustained the vast majority of Cliff's legal objections. We focus only on those exhibits Connie specifically identifies in her briefing: 4, 7, 8, 10.1-10.3, 11.2, 12, 14.1, 15-17, 135, 166-169, 183, 185, 189, 191-192, 195-200, and 215. These exhibits include (a) handwritten letters purportedly from Cliff, (b) screen shots of various text messages purportedly from Cliff that contain derogatory language, (c) undated photos depicting bruises or lacerations on what we are led to believe is Connie's person, (d) undated photos showing some type of damage to property, (e) hospital records unaccompanied by a business records affidavit, and (f) unsworn witness statements describing a July 2014 altercation between Connie and Cliff, described\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   During the hearing on Connie's offer of proof, Cliff objected on hearsay grounds to exhibits 7, 135, 183, 185, 189, 191, 192, and 195-200. He objected to exhibits 10.1-10.3, 11.2, 12, 14.1, 135, 166-169, 183, 185, 189, 191-192, and 195-200 because Connie had not produced them during discovery. He objected on improper predicate grounds as to exhibits 183, 185, 189, 191-192, and 195-200. Finally, Cliff objected to exhibit 8 on the grounds that Connie had not offered it during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sustained Cliff's alternative objections to the exhibits Connie tendered to the court during her offer of proof, with the exception of exhibits 4B and 215, which the court had admitted as part of Cliff's trial exhibits. The trial court also reserved her rendition of judgment until after Connie's offer of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Connie has not raised as an issue or argued that the trial court erred in sustaining Cliff's hearsay and other legal objections to her exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus we have no cause to review the trial court's decision to exclude Connie's exhibits on these alternative grounds. Additionally, if the exhibits were properly excluded on hearsay or other legal grounds-which Connie does not challenge-any error in the trial court's pretrial ruling excluding the exhibits for failure to timely exchange them is harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Moreover, Connie has not shown that the particular excluded exhibits she identifies in her briefing are controlling on a material issue dispositive to the case and not cumulative. The record does not support Connie's argument that the specific exhibits she cites would have controlled the domestic violence issue in light of the totality of the evidence the court heard on the subject, including other evidence Connie presented. Indeed, Cliff acknowledged certain facts on cross-examination that duplicated at least some of Connie's exhibits. For example, Cliff acknowledged that he had used derogatory language in his interactions\n   with Connie, which is what many of Connie's exhibits-the screen shots of text messages-served to show.

Evidence of Domestic Violence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the second portion of her attack on the trial court's custody determination, Connie asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in designating Cliff sole managing conservator of J.H. and V.H. because Cliff has a \"history of domestic violence.\" Although a trial court has \"wide latitude\" in making conservatorship determinations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Connie contends that discretion is limited by Texas Family Code section 153.004, which applies when there is a history or pattern of domestic violence in the family. Specifically, section 153.004 provides, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (a) In determining whether to appoint a party as a sole or joint managing conservator, the court shall consider evidence of the intentional use of abusive physical force ... by a party directed against the party's spouse ... committed within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (b) The court may not appoint joint managing conservators if\n   <em>\n    credible\n   </em>\n   evidence is presented of a history or pattern of ... physical ... abuse by one parent directed against the other parent....\n   <em>\n    It is a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of ... physical ... abuse by that parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a child.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Tex.

But Cliff disputed her testimony and denied Connie's allegations. Connie also contends uncontroverted evidence of Cliff's domestic abuse exists in the form of a 2006 assault charge to which Cliff pleaded \"no contest\" to pushing Connie, and protective orders relating to the 2006 incident as well as a separate 2014 incident. Although a single incident of physical violence could constitute a history of physical abuse, the fact finder could also consider Cliff's explanation of what occurred and the amount of time that passed since the event in weighing whether a history of abuse was shown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Contrary to Connie's characterization, the evidence conflicted substantially regarding Cliff's alleged history of family violence against Connie. Cliff described the 2006 incident resulting in his indictment for misdemeanor assault of a family member. According to Cliff, Connie attempted to engage him in a verbal dispute, but he walked away and went to bed. Connie pursued him, demanding they talk. When he refused, Connie told Cliff they were divorcing and demanded Cliff move out immediately. Cliff ignored Connie, and she started packing his things in a box. Connie began screaming, which woke up V.H. Cliff attempted to take the box from Connie and Connie shoved Cliff. Cliff shoved Connie back and she fell and hit her head. Connie began screaming, ran out of the room, and called the police. Ultimately, Cliff pleaded \"no contest\" to a misdemeanor assault charge and served nine months deferred adjudication community supervision. The state dismissed the charges after Cliff successfully completed his community supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Connie's description of this incident differed markedly from Cliff's. According to Connie, she asked Cliff about a female she heard he had been seen with, and Cliff became very angry. Cliff then threw her against the wall, choked her, and banged her head against a closet door. When V.H. began crying, Cliff dragged Connie by the hair and told her to \"get your baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Connie also described several other purported violent assaults by Cliff during their marriage, during which she claimed Cliff screamed at her and hit her head against various objects. Connie did not report any of these other incidents to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Cliff briefly described another incident that occurred in 2010, when Connie threw a basket of food at him in a restaurant. A restaurant server who witnessed this incident testified via deposition. The server saw Connie yell at Cliff; then, she threw a basket of fries, hitting Cliff in the back. Connie continued yelling at Cliff as Cliff walked away to the bathroom. According to the server, Connie screamed to the manager, \"He hit me. He hit me. I'm calling the cops. He hit me.\" The server confirmed, however, that Cliff never touched Connie, and when officers arrived, the server told them what had happened. According to the server, Cliff never raised his voice to Connie and \"was pretty submissive.\" Connie refuted the server's testimony, claiming that she never threw anything at Cliff. Instead, according to Connie, Cliff came into the restaurant, cursed at her, and shoved her\n   into some type of standing object. No charges resulted from this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Another altercation between Cliff and Connie occurred in July 2014. Again, the parties' respective accounts differed vastly. According to Cliff, he went to retrieve J.H. and V.H. from Connie for a scheduled summer visitation. The children were not at Connie's home, but J.H. arrived at Cliff's home that evening. V.H. did not arrive. Cliff dropped J.H. off at Boy Scout camp the next day, and then he again attempted to retrieve V.H. from Connie. Connie initially was not home, but when she arrived, Cliff asked where V.H. was; Connie did not reply, and Cliff called the police. Connie proceeded into her home and locked the door. About 45 minutes later, the police arrived. An officer announced himself and knocked on Connie's door, but no one answered. Both the officer and Cliff eventually left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   According to Cliff, later that day, he returned to Connie's home, this time accompanied by his then-girlfriend, Heather Fitzsimmons. He knocked on Connie's door, but no one answered. Cliff and Fitzsimmons left; they returned again later that evening. When they arrived, Connie's car was in the driveway, with Connie inside the car. Cliff parked behind Connie's car. Cliff described a brief physical altercation between himself and Connie, in which he stated that she pushed him and he \"moved\" her off him. According to Cliff, Connie then twisted and fell, and began screaming, \"Assault, assault, assault.\" Cliff stated he filmed part of this altercation on his cell phone, but Connie slapped his phone out of his hand, took it, and refused to return it. The cell phone video was admitted into evidence and played. Police were called; when they arrived at the scene, Cliff claimed that Connie had stolen his phone and Connie claimed that Cliff had assaulted her. According to Cliff's \"find my phone\" application, his cell phone was inside Connie's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Connie, on the other hand, stated that Cliff blocked her car in the driveway, and Fitzsimmons came up to the car and grabbed her hands. Connie emphatically and repeatedly claimed that Cliff \"body slammed\" her to the ground, causing significant bruising to her head and body, and that V.H. and two others witnessed this incident. Police were called to the scene, but no one was immediately arrested. Connie was transported to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   One of the responding officers testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [Cliff] said that he had shown up to pick up his daughter, and that there was a disagreement on the custody and a physical scuffle had happened between both parties; but it was really more of a, his girlfriend came-it is not a very-not a very long scuffle, but that his girlfriend had, kind of-was trying to break everybody up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The officer acknowledged that he did not see the \"scuffle,\" and that everyone was separated when he arrived. According to this officer, Cliff seemed truthful. The officer did see a small bump on Connie's head, but she was fully clothed and he could not see any other bruises or scratches. Connie told him that she had fallen to the pavement during the scuffle. Cliff reported to the officer that his cell phone was missing, so officers proceeded to the hospital to follow up with Connie; she refused to permit the officers to look for Cliff's phone at her home. The officer stated that Cliff's cell phone was \"pinging\" at Connie's address, and it was not in Cliff's truck or on Cliff's person. This officer described Cliff as cooperative and Connie as uncooperative. The Harris County District Attorney's Office declined charges that night, but Connie followed up and assault charges were later brought against Cliff\n   for this incident. However, a Harris County grand jury \"no-billed\" Cliff, so no further legal action was taken against Cliff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Thus, of the three specific instances detailed in our record, the parties provided materially different accounts of events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106338\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/109/108/#p111\">\n    109 S.W.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the trial court could have reasonably credited Cliff's version of events, the court's decision was not an abuse of discretion, and we overrule this portion of Connie's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Supervised Visitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The trial court found that it would not be in the children's best interest to appoint Cliff and Connie as joint managing conservators. The court appointed Cliff as sole managing conservator and Connie as possessory conservator. The court further found that a standard possession order (\"SPO\") was inappropriate or unworkable. Accordingly, the court limited Connie's visitation with the children to four hours of supervised visitation on the Saturdays following the second and fourth Friday of each month. The court found that its orders concerning possession and access for Connie were not \"more restrictive than necessary to provide for the safety and welfare of the children.\" Connie contends that \"the imposition of supervised visitation with such a restrictive period of access was an abuse of discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Texas Family Code provides guidelines for determining the periods of possession for a possessory conservator. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.192(b).

For example, Connie's detrimental and disruptive behavior resulted in Second Baptist School's refusal to enroll J.H. and V.H. for the 2015-16 academic year. Cliff testified about numerous occasions when he arrived at Second Baptist School to pick up the children only to be told Connie had already taken them. On those occasions, Connie routinely refused to respond to Cliff's texts, emails, or phone calls. A Second Baptist School principal, Tamara Gallagher, confirmed Connie's disruptive behavior and agreed that, but for Connie's repeated school policy violations, the children would have been permitted to re-enroll at Second Baptist School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Another parent at Second Baptist School, whose son was friends with J.H., described her experiences with Connie. She related several occasions when Connie dropped off J.H. and V.H. for a play date, but did not return as promised. This parent also testified that Connie had a reputation among the Second Baptist School community for untruthfulness. According to this parent, Connie's repeated disrespectful actions lead the parent's family to sever their relationship with Connie. As the parent stated, \"[Connie's] manipulative. She's not a truthful person. We cannot trust her; and quite frankly, we're a little afraid of what kind of person she is.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Connie also displayed an inability or unwillingness to comply with prior court orders based on the children's best interest. For example, the court granted Cliff the right to determine enrollment for J.H. and V.H. following Second Baptist School, yet Connie unilaterally enrolled them in schools without Cliff's knowledge. And, after the trial court removed Connie as a joint managing conservator, Connie repeatedly attempted to access J.H. and V.H. in violation of court orders restricting her access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Cliff testified regarding the deterioration in Connie's behavior and her inability to make sound judgments regarding the children. He testified about Connie's manipulative behavior, stating that she withheld J.H. and V.H. from him in attempts \"to extort letter agreements\" from Cliff regarding custody. He also described extended periods of time when Connie kept J.H. and V.H. from him during his court-ordered periods of possession. In an attempt to alienate Cliff from his children, Connie wrote letters to J.H. and V.H. in which she blamed Cliff for \"keeping them apart.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Testimony from Connie's sister also supported a finding that supervising Connie's visitation was not more restrictive than necessary to protect the children's best interest. Describing Cliff as a good father, Connie's sister testified that she had never seen Cliff do or say anything that concerned her about Cliff's parenting abilities. Yet, tellingly, she declined to express an opinion when asked similar questions about Connie's parenting abilities. Connie's sister stated that she would not leave her own children with Connie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Testimony from the children's counselors also supports the order. V.H.'s counselor recommended that Connie's supervised visitation continue. Speaking bluntly, it was the counsellor's clinical opinion that supervised visits with Connie were in V.H.'s best interest. J.H.'s counselor testified that J.H. did not fear either parent and loved both parents very much. The counselor also reported that J.H.'s supervised visit with his mother had gone very well and J.H. would like this case to be over.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that maintaining supervised visits and limiting Connie's periods of possession were the minimal restrictions necessary to protect the children's best interests. The record reflects that Connie displayed an inability to follow court orders grounded on the children's best interests, secreted the children\n   from Cliff when she shared custody with him, and attempted to alienate the children from Cliff.

Cliff appeared at 8:30, as did the amicus attorney. Connie did not appear. The court waited on Connie before beginning pretrial proceedings. By 9:00\n   a.m., Connie had not appeared or contacted the court. Cliff's counsel and the amicus attorney for J.H. and V.H. announced ready for trial.

The trial court recessed to start pretrial proceedings off the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   At 9:15 a.m., the trial court returned to the record, noting that Connie still had not appeared. The court announced that it deemed Connie's non-appearance as a waiver of jury trial. Then, the court clerk informed the judge that Connie had made a \"late call\" to the court at 9:07 or 9:08 a.m. The record does not reflect what Connie told the clerk. However, the court noted that Connie's late call came long after she was ordered to appear. The court further stated that Connie previously disobeyed orders to appear and was \"habitually late,\" disregarded the pretrial order to exchange exhibits with Cliff's counsel, and \"disobeyed the Court's order to appear back in court\" to exchange exhibits the previous Friday. At approximately 9:30 a.m., Cliff withdrew his request for a jury trial. Connie still had not appeared, so the trial court provided the parties who were present time to prepare for the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   At 9:42 a.m., Cliff's counsel and the amicus attorney presented their opening statements. At 9:56 a.m., the court began taking testimony from Cliff.

The Supreme Court of Texas held that a trial judge has no discretion to refuse to enter judgment on an MSA based solely on the court's determination that the agreed custody terms are not in the child's best interest because Family Code section 153.0071 does not grant trial courts the option to deny judgment on that basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088612\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/411/445/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088612\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/411/445/\">\n    at 457-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   are fundamentally different from those presented here. In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , this is not a situation where the trial court refused to enforce a validly executed MSA because, in the court's view, the custody terms contained therein were not in the children's best interest. Rather, the trial court incorporated\n   the MSA terms into the Interim Order it signed in April 2014. From April until September 2014, the parties shared custody of the children under the Interim Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, and based on events occurring after the MSA was signed and after the entry of the Interim Order-including the trial court's findings that Connie materially failed to comply with the MSA terms to the children's detriment-Cliff amended his petition to allege that a material and substantial change had occurred and the custody terms (which were incorporated into the Interim Order) were no longer consistent with the children's welfare. Cliff moved for temporary orders on parent-child issues, which the trial court granted on September 3, 2014, signing an order that day. Pursuant to these orders, the trial court removed Connie as a joint managing conservator of J.H. and V.H., and appointed Cliff temporary sole managing conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   This is a case where the trial court signed orders incorporating the terms of an MSA, but was subsequently presented with amended pleadings and a motion to modify the orders based on changed circumstances and found that modification was in the children's best interest. We think this case is more akin to those in which parties have entered into an MSA prior to divorce, but, based on allegations and evidence of a material or substantial change in circumstances, modification of conservatorship becomes necessary to protect the child's best interest after the divorce.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Connie and Cliff did not agree to set aside the MSA. Also, though Connie\n   at one time purported to withdraw consent to the MSA based on an assertion of family violence, our ruling today is not based on any parties' withdrawal of consent to the MSA but rather on the trial court's discretion to modify custody provisions based on a party's failure to comply with MSA terms in a manner detrimental to the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Based on the record before us, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   is not controlling because the record does not show that the trial court denied a motion to enter judgment on the MSA based on a broad best interest inquiry. Further, Connie has not shown that, once the trial court issued orders incorporating the MSA, it lacked authority to modify those orders on Cliff's motion based on events occurring after the MSA and further temporary orders were signed. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion when it incorporated the terms of the MSA into the Interim Order, which the court then modified on Cliff's motion after determining that the children's safety and welfare required the modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, Connie has not established that the trial court abused its discretion in making its conservatorship, possession, and access orders.

We deny Connie's motion to supplement for the following reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    The appellate court, the trial court, or a party may request that the record be supplemented with items that were part of the trial record but omitted from the appellate record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(d). In Connie's motion, she asks this Court to order the court reporter to supplement the record with her exhibits numbered 221-251, which she contends were tendered to the trial court during her offer of proof. The record reflects, however, that Connie never tendered these exhibits to the trial court during the offer of proof but only exchanged the cited exhibits with opposing counsel. The court reporter expressly noted that, during the offer of proof, these exhibits were \"exchanged and discussed,\" but \"none were formally identified, offered or admitted by the Court.\" Additionally, Connie did not file a formal bill of exception, which is necessary to complain about a matter that would not otherwise appear in the record. Tex. R. App. P. 33.2. The record cannot be supplemented with items that were not part of the trial record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(d) (providing for supplementation of reporter's record with\n    <em>\n     omitted\n    </em>\n    items).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    Further, in the motion, Connie implicitly acknowledges that exhibits 221-251 were not part of her offer of proof because she argues that the trial court \"shut down the offer of proof after exhibit 220 and instructed Connie to leave the courtroom.\" Connie did not raise an issue in her opening brief challenging the trial court's handling of Connie's offer of proof or complaining about the absence of exhibits 221-251 from the record. Because Connie asserts this argument for the first time in her post-submission filings, we do not consider it as a ground for reversal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smith v.
