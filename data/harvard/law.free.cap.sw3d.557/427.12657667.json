Although not raised in his amended motion, Butler now claims the judgment issued by the trial court contains a clerical error, and he asks this court to remand the case with instructions to issue a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order. Finding no error, we affirm the motion court's denial of Butler's motion for post-conviction relief. Because Butler's request for remand is not properly before this court, his request is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 17, 2012, Zachary Lisle, a confidential informant, contacted the Clay County Drug Task Force because he had arranged to buy one pound of marijuana for $950 from someone named \"L.C.\" Deputy Sharon Taylor was working as a sergeant for the Task Force at the time. She met Lisle and had him outfitted with a recording device. Lisle and Deputy Taylor then went to a Walgreens parking lot at the intersection of Antioch Road and Vivion Road where Lisle arranged to complete the transaction with L.C. A \"cover team\" of police officers was situated nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to Deputy Taylor's instruction, Lisle called L.C. to tell him that they were at the parking lot and ready to buy the marijuana. Lisle and L.C. exchanged additional phone calls and text messages before a man carrying a duffle bag approached Deputy Taylor and Lisle's vehicle. Deputy Taylor asked whether that man was L.C., and Lisle responded, \"Yeah. That's our man.\" At trial, Deputy Taylor identified Butler as the man who approached the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Butler came around to the passenger's side of the vehicle where Lisle was sitting, and Deputy Taylor rolled down the window. Butler leaned in the window and fumbled with his bag. Deputy Taylor saw Butler's hand move upward, and she spotted a gun, which Butler pointed in her face while demanding she give him the money and car keys. Deputy Taylor complied. At that point, Butler pointed the gun at Lisle and demanded Lisle's phone. Once Butler had the money, keys, and phone, he ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While running, Butler threw the keys into the grass. A member of the cover team chased Butler on foot across the parking lot toward the street. A white Ford Explorer arrived, and Butler jumped into the passenger side of the vehicle, which then drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Josh Davis, an off-duty detective specializing in drug enforcement, was picking up a prescription at the Walgreens and saw Butler running toward the street. Detective Davis got in his car, called 911, told the dispatcher what he saw, and followed the Ford Explorer into Jackson County and onto Paseo Boulevard. Kansas City police officers stopped the Ford Explorer at the intersection of Truman Road and Paseo Boulevard. Butler jumped out of the vehicle and ran. The officers who pulled the vehicle over chased Butler and apprehended him. Once Butler was in custody, the officers retraced Butler's footsteps and found some of the money that Deputy Taylor had surrendered to Butler. The rest of the money was found in both the Ford Explorer and Butler's pockets. Lisle's cell phone, however, was not recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, Special Agent Harry Lett of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives searched the intersection of Truman Road and Paseo Boulevard\n   for the firearm Butler had pointed at Deputy Taylor. Though the area had not been secured overnight, Agent Lett found a firearm similar to the one described by Deputy Taylor in an alleyway underneath some weeds. A magazine and live ammunition were also recovered, but no useful fingerprints were found on these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State charged Butler as a persistent offender with two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 569.020,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   two counts of armed criminal action in violation of \u00a7 571.015, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 571.070. One robbery charge and related armed criminal action charge involved Butler's actions toward Deputy Taylor; the second robbery charge and related armed criminal action charge involved Butler's actions toward Lisle. Before trial, the State dismissed the unlawful possession of a firearm charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also before trial, an investigator from the Public Defender's office interviewed Lisle. Shortly after that interview, trial counsel informed Butler of counsel's plans to depose Lisle and Deputy Taylor so he would have their sworn statements to use for impeachment at trial. The Public Defender's office, however, declined to provide funding for the depositions, so they did not occur as planned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, the State asked Deputy Taylor how the Clay County Drug Task Force works with confidential informants. She testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It depends on what kind of charges they have. Sometimes if they have the, the charges and they're all narcotics related, if there is not a huge amount, or is a big charge, then they're, we approach them and say, hey, we can work with you to make a discharge, work your charges with us in exchange for you to introduce to the big drug dealers out there. So, we can start working them doing undercover, undercover buys and, you know, working charges on them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to a question about her ability to function effectively as a task force member without confidential informants, Deputy Taylor testified that she needed informants because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I]n that environment, it's not easy for me to come to a drug dealer and say, hey, I want to buy drugs from you, because they don't [know] me, they don't trust me. So, the way to work our way in is by working with somebody they trust. And if you're new in that, in that world, per se, you are not a trusted person, so they will not sell [to] you, they will not talk to you, they just, they don't even want to see you around them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, in response to a question about the proximity of backup officers during an undercover drug buy, Deputy Taylor said, \"it varies, depending on, on the location, because some of the drug dealers have counter surveillance, we have to be careful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Lisle testified that he did not have a good memory of the robbery because it was brief and shocking and he was high at the time. Initially, he said he could not remember a gun, but he later remembered seeing one. He testified that he \"basically\" remembered the gun and that Butler\n   was the person with the gun who took Lisle's cell phone and the money. Lisle admitted that, when interviewed after the robbery, he truthfully told police that Butler had a gun, but he later claimed that the police were \"egging [him] on\" and \"driving [him] crazy,\" so he told them \"everything they told me to say.\" Lisle also admitted that Butler spoke to him before trial, telling Lisle to contact trial counsel and say that there had been no gun and that the robber had only a drawstring bag. Lisle felt \"pressured under the moment\" to contact Butler's trial counsel. Lisle vacillated as to whether he was under pressure from Butler when he later spoke with the investigator. Lisle also testified that Butler did not \"personally pressure\" him but that, if he did not do what Butler wanted him to do, it was not \"going to be too good for [Lisle], honestly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The investigator testified that Lisle had told her he was so high the day of the robbery that he remembered seeing only a drawstring bag; he could not remember a gun, and, if there had been a gun, he could not have said what kind of gun it was. Lisle just wanted to \"go back to his girlfriend in the motel, but detectives told him he was not going anywhere until he wrote a statement, or else he was going to jail.\" Lisle also told the investigator that he was not under any pressure to talk with her and that he did not remember what he had said in his statement to police or whether he had identified the right person in the lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The jury found Butler guilty of robbery and armed criminal action based on his conduct toward Deputy Taylor, but the jury found him not guilty of robbery and armed criminal action involving his conduct toward Lisle. The trial court sentenced Butler as a persistent offender to consecutive terms of thirty years' imprisonment for robbery and twenty years' imprisonment for armed criminal action. Although the State did not plead or prove, and the trial court did not find, Butler to be a Dangerous Offender, the judgment stated, \"The defendant has been found beyond a reasonable doubt to be a: Dangerous Offender ( 558.016 RSMo ).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On direct appeal, Butler challenged the admissibility of the firearm located by Agent Lett, arguing that the firearm was neither logically nor legally relevant to the charges against him.\n   <em>\n    State v. Butler\n   </em>\n   , WD76747, memo. at 5 (Mo. App. W.D. April 7, 2015). This court rejected Butler's admissibility challenge, finding that Deputy Taylor's testimony alone was sufficient to admit the firearm as \"the firearm\" involved in the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. We affirmed Butler's convictions and sentences on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880928,6880949\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/897/\">\n    457 S.W.3d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2015). We issued our mandate on April 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Butler timely filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and amended Rule 29.15 motions, and the motion court held an evidentiary hearing, during which trial counsel and Butler, among others, testified. Trial counsel testified that \"our whole trial strategy wrapped around trying to show that [Butler] just merely stole some money and never had a weapon to actually commit the offense of robbery or armed criminal action.\" Trial counsel also testified that he was an experienced trial attorney at the time of Butler's trial. As to Butler's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Deputy Taylor's testimony about \"big drug dealers out there,\" trial counsel testified that, while he did not have a trial strategy regarding that testimony, he did not consider an objection to Deputy Taylor's testimony to be \"a lawful objection.\" Regarding Butler's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to depose Lisle, counsel testified that the funds for depositions were not approved,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the lack of a deposition did not limit counsel's ability to effectively cross-examine Lisle; counsel was able to both fully cross-examine Lisle and discredit him on several issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Butler testified that, if trial counsel had deposed Lisle, counsel would have learned that the incident was just a drug buy and that Butler did not have a weapon. Butler further testified that he informed trial counsel of the information Butler had about Lisle and that counsel was able to use that information to cross-examine Lisle. The State then asked Butler, \"So whether [Lisle] was deposed or not, [counsel] still got to use the same information to your benefit; correct?\" Butler replied, \"Yes.\" With respect to his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to depose law enforcement personnel involved in his arrest, Butler testified that, had counsel taken those depositions, he would have been able to show the police investigation was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The motion court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law denying Butler's amended Rule 29.15 motion. As to Butler's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Deputy Taylor's testimony, the motion court concluded that Butler failed to show that an objection would have been meritorious. The court noted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Taylor's testimony, regarding why undercover informants are used by the drug squad and their purpose, does not associate [Butler] with any specific prior crime or prior drug dealing. Taylor did not testify that [Butler] was a career drug dealer and did not testify or allude that she had dealt with him in the past. Taylor's testimony does not specifically reference any uncharged drug dealing and therefore it does not constitute prior criminal or bad act testimony. Taylor's testimony did not amount to propensity evidence-it was both logical and relevant evidence in that it gave the jury a general background on why confidential informants are used by law enforcement agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court also concluded that Butler was not prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to object to Deputy Taylor's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding Butler's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to depose Lisle, the motion court found that Butler did not prove either deficient performance or prejudice. In support of its conclusion, the court noted that, \"[a]t the evidentiary hearing[,] both [trial counsel and Butler] acknowledged and agreed that [counsel] was still able to vigorously cross-examine [Lisle] even without a deposition. In fact, [Butler] was found not guilty with respect to the robbery of [Lisle].\" Finally, with respect to Butler's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to depose the State's other witnesses, the court concluded that Butler failed to prove either deficient performance or prejudice where he did not provide any specific information about what those depositions would have established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Butler appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We \"review[ ] the denial of [a motion for] post-conviction relief to determine whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

In this third point, Butler claims the trial court committed a clerical error and asks this court to remand his case for issuance of a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order.

He claims that the Public Defender's office's refusal to pay for depositions amounted to a constructive denial of the assistance of counsel and prejudice should be presumed or, alternatively, Butler was prejudiced because trial counsel was unable to impeach the State's witnesses using their prior sworn statements. The motion court rejected Butler's claim, finding that he failed to prove either deficient performance or prejudice.

On appeal, Butler complains primarily about the fact that trial counsel failed to depose Lisle, but Butler does not show a reasonable probability that deposing Lisle would have changed the outcome at trial. In fact, given the shifting accounts Lisle gave concerning what he witnessed on May 17, 2012, we have no assurance as to precisely what Lisle would have said if he had been deposed following his conversation with the Public Defender's investigator; thus, Butler fails to show a reasonable probability\n   that deposing Lisle would have altered the outcome. At the evidentiary hearing, both trial counsel and Butler acknowledged and agreed that trial counsel was still able to vigorously cross-examine Lisle without a deposition. And trial counsel was able to impeach Lisle's testimony by presenting his prior inconsistent statements through the testimony of counsel's investigator. Through cross-examination of Butler and direct examination of the investigator, trial counsel was able to impeach Lisle on the key issues raised by Butler-whether Butler had a gun, whether Lisle's statement to police after the robbery was truthful, and whether Butler pressured Lisle to recant his statement to police. In fact, trial counsel was so successful in impeaching Lisle that Butler was found not guilty with respect to the charged crimes against Lisle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, in a situation like this, where there is overwhelming evidence of guilt, a movant fails to establish\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Dawson v.

Police followed that vehicle until it stopped and Butler fled on foot. He was arrested shortly thereafter. Police found the stolen money in the Ford Explorer, in Butler's pockets, and on the path he took during the foot pursuit. Deputy Taylor testified about the incident and specifically about Butler's use of a gun. A gun matching the description of the one described by Deputy Taylor was found the next day in the same area. Thus, the evidence overwhelmingly established that Butler committed the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to the depositions of the State's other witnesses, Butler alleged no facts and presented no evidence of any potential testimony that would have been discovered from those depositions that would have benefitted his defense. Butler merely relied on his own conclusory allegation that depositions would have \"been able to expose that their investigation was inadequate,\" which provided no explanation of what potential testimony would have established such a conclusion. Conclusory post-conviction allegations of prejudice without specific evidence showing how the alleged deficient performance would have led to a likely different result are insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Giammanco v.

The judgment states, \"The defendant has been found beyond a reasonable doubt to be a: Dangerous Offender ( 558.016 RSMo ).\" The parties agree that the statement is an error; the State did not plead or prove, and the trial court did not find, that Butler is a Dangerous Offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Butler asks this court to remand the case with instructions to the circuit court to enter a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order correcting\n   the error. In support of his position, Butler cites Rule 29.12(c), which states, in part, \"[c]lerical mistakes in judgments ... may be corrected by the court at any time after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\" He also argues that remand is appropriate here because this court currently has supervisory authority over the judgment below and Rule 84.14 directs us to \"reverse or affirm the judgment or order of the trial court, in whole or in part, or give such judgment as the court ought to give ...

Thus, we decline to remand this case for correction of the judgment\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   in the underlying case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As the State noted, Butler has recourse to correct the error in his judgment.
