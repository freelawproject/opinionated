Beck, II, appeals from his convictions of three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy and one count of first-degree child molestation. He contends the verdict directors did not ensure a unanimous verdict; the information was vague and failed to state an offense; the State's conduct and statements during closing arguments were improper; the court erroneously allowed an expert to opine that the victim was sexually abused; the court erroneously limited his ability to cross-examine the victim about sexual abuse perpetrated upon her by another person; and the court erroneously denied him a hearing on his\n   allegation of alleged juror misconduct. For reasons explained herein, we affirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beck was the biological father of A.O., who was born on November 18, 2000, after Beck separated from A.O.'s mother. Beck did not acknowledge that A.O. was his daughter until DNA tests proved it when A.O. was four years old. A.O. lived with her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beck's primary residence was his mother's (\"Grandmother\") house in Blue Springs. At some point after the DNA test, A.O. began visiting Grandmother and Beck occasionally at Grandmother's house, but she did so less frequently than her older brother and sister, who were also Beck's children. After A.O. visited Beck, she never wanted to talk with her mother about the visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When A.O. was five or six years old and in preschool or kindergarten, she was sleeping in the bedroom she usually slept in at Grandmother's house while Beck was on the computer in that room. A.O. saw that Beck was \"looking at pictures of women on the Internet.\" He told A.O. to come over to him. Beck pulled down her pants, put his hands on her hips, and put his penis in her anus. He then put his penis in her mouth, his hands on her head, and told her to \"suck it like a lollipop.\" Beck told A.O., \"This will be our little secret.\" A.O. thought Beck was a \"scary guy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Afterwards, A.O. walked to the bathroom, where she encountered Grandmother. Grandmother asked A.O. what Beck was doing. A.O. told Grandmother that Beck was looking at pictures of naked women on the Internet. Grandmother did nothing. A.O. believed that, even if Grandmother had known what Beck was doing, Grandmother would have allowed it to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beck anally sodomized A.O. on five or six occasions. Beck also continued to make her perform oral sex on him, \"more [times] than [she] can count.\" Some of the sexual abuse occurred when she was alone in her bedroom, while other incidents occurred when A.O. was sleeping in her sister's room, while her sister was either sleeping or was not there. On one occasion, A.O.'s little brother, who was one or two years old at the time, was watching television with A.O. in her bedroom when Beck came in and anally sodomized her. On another occasion, when A.O. was sleeping in her sister's room without her sister there, Beck came in the room around 2:00 a.m. A.O. tried to wrap herself in her covers, but Beck anally sodomized her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When A.O. was eleven years old and her grandfather was visiting, she was sleeping in a bedroom in the basement when Beck came downstairs. He made her perform oral sex on him, anally sodomized her, and tried to put his penis in her vagina, but she struggled and was able to stop him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On another occasion, when A.O. was eleven or twelve years old, in the fifth grade, and was sleeping in her sister's room without her sister there, Beck made her perform oral sex on him, anally sodomized her, placed his fingers in her vagina, placed his mouth on and licked her vagina, and then placed his penis against her vagina and tried to put his penis in her vagina. Just the tip of Beck's penis went inside her vagina because A.O. struggled and \"wouldn't let him.\" Beck asked her if she was a virgin. A.O. told him that she was a virgin and that she hated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beck sexually abused A.O. for the last time when she was twelve or thirteen years old. A.O. made a tentative disclosure of the abuse, although not in detail, to her closest friend at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Several years after the abuse stopped, Beck asked A.O. to go out to dinner with him to celebrate her fifteenth birthday. A.O.'s sister encouraged her to go, so A.O. went because she did not want to \"seem weird about it.\" During the dinner, Beck apologized to her and asked if she could ever forgive him for what he had done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.O. later disclosed the sexual abuse to her cousin, but A.O. made her cousin promise not to tell anyone. When A.O. was telling her cousin about the abuse, she seemed \"distant, like emotionless almost,\" which was contrary to her usually happy and bubbly personality. A.O.'s cousin agreed not to tell anyone, but she knew it was not right to keep it to herself so she told a trusted teacher and a school counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An investigator from Children's Division contacted A.O.'s mother and told her about A.O.'s statement that Beck had sexually abused her. A.O. then told her mother and sister about the abuse. A.O.'s sister, who was living with Beck at Grandmother's house at the time, immediately moved out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.O.'s mother went to the police station and filed a police report. The police requested that A.O. participate in a forensic interview at Child Protection Center (\"CPC\"). During the interview, which was videotaped, A.O. described several acts of sexual abuse that Beck committed against her over the years at Grandmother's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.O. was taken to Children's Mercy Hospital, where she underwent testing for sexually-transmitted diseases and a physical exam by Emily Killough, M.D., a doctor specially trained in child sexual abuse. Before examining A.O., Killough reviewed A.O.'s forensic interview summary, met with A.O. and a family member who was with her, and obtained A.O.'s medical history. Killough found that A.O.'s physical exam was normal. According to Killough, in the vast majority of child sexual abuse cases where the abuse occurred several years before it was reported, the physical exam is normal because the mucosal tissue in the anogenital area heals quickly and stretches easily and, if there were any bruising, redness, or abrasions, they would be gone by the time of the exam. Therefore, according to Killough, the expected finding in a child sexual abuse case is a normal physical exam. Based upon A.O.'s history, including her disclosure of abuse, and the physical exam, Killough diagnosed A.O. with child sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The police arrested Beck. Following his arrest, Beck waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and gave a brief statement to a detective. The interview was short because the officer smelled alcohol on Beck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State initially charged Beck with three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy and one count of first-degree child molestation. In each count, the State alleged that the acts occurred \"on or between November 18, 2005 and November 17, 2014,\" which was when A.O. was between the ages of five and thirteen. Prior to trial, the State filed an amended information alleging that the act referenced in the first count of statutory sodomy, which was Beck's placing his genitals in A.O.'s anus, occurred \"on or between November 18, 2005 and November 17, 2012,\" which was when A.O. was between the ages of five and eleven. The dates for the acts referenced in the other counts remained the same. At the close of all the evidence at trial, the State filed a second amended information alleging that the acts referenced in all four counts occurred \"on or between November 18, 2005 and November 17, 2012.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the jury trial, Beck testified in his defense. He admitted that he did not acknowledge A.O. to be his daughter prior\n   to the DNA test, and he admitted that he told A.O. that he did not like her. Beck denied ever sexually abusing A.O. Beck claimed that his apology to A.O. during her fifteenth birthday dinner was for his telling her that he did not like her and not for his having sexually abused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Beck testified that he was either out of the state or the country for significant periods of time between November 2005 and November 2012. Specifically, Beck testified that, in 2005, he was in Arizona during November and December; in 2006, he lived with Grandmother only during the months of January and February and was \"on vacation\" for the rest of the year; in 2007, he was in dive school in Florida from March to October; in 2008, he worked for six months as a diver in Louisiana and then three months in Guam before he got sick with tuberculosis and was hospitalized for two months; in 2009, he worked as a diver in Louisiana, Guam, and Costa Rica from January until July or August; in 2010, he worked in Alabama on the BP oil spill in April and was gone for six months; and in 2011, he worked in Louisiana from January through August.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beck brought in some of his dive logs to support his testimony about where he was for a few of these time periods. Although he claimed to have records to support where he was for all of the time periods to which he testified, Beck did not bring those records to court. Moreover, Beck admitted that that there were several periods between November 2005 and November 2012 when he was staying at Grandmother's house and A.O. was there. Beck also admitted that he did not tell the police during his initial interview after his arrest that he was out of the state and the country for periods of time between November 2005 and November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury found Beck guilty on all counts. The court sentenced him to concurrent terms of twenty years in prison for each of the three first-degree statutory sodomy counts and fifteen years in prison for first-degree child molestation. Beck appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point I-Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Point I, Beck contends the circuit court erred in submitting the verdict directors for all four charges. He argues that there was evidence of multiple acts pertaining to each count of the second amended information, but the verdict directors failed to specify a particular incident. He asserts that, by failing to specify a particular incident, the instructions did not ensure a unanimous jury verdict. Beck concedes that he failed to object to the instructions at trial. Therefore, review is for plain error only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 30.20, this court has discretion to review \"plain errors affecting substantial rights ... when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" \"For instructional error to constitute plain error, the defendant must demonstrate the trial court so misdirected or failed to instruct the jury that the error affected the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The verdict director for Count III was Instruction No. 11, and it stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   As to Count III, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   First, that on or between November 18, 2005 and November 17, 2012, in the County of Jackson, State of Missouri, the defendant knowingly placed defendant's mouth on A.O.'s vagina,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, that such conduct constituted deviate sexual intercourse, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Third, that at the time A.O. was a child less than twelve years old,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Then you will find the defendant guilty under Count III of statutory sodomy in the first degree under this instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At trial, A.O. testified that Beck put his mouth on her vagina when she was in the fifth grade. A.O. said that this occurred when she was sleeping in her sister's room. When asked at trial whether he touched his mouth to her vagina \"one time or more than one time,\" A.O. responded, \"That happened one time.\" A.O.'s trial testimony\n   was consistent with what she told the forensic interviewer on this issue. During her CPC interview, she described the incident in more detail, but she repeatedly affirmed that she was referring to the \"one time\" and \"that time\" when Beck put his mouth on her vagina, when she was eleven or twelve years old, and when she was sleeping in her sister's room. Because there was no evidence of multiple distinct criminal acts, the jury's conviction of Beck for first-degree statutory sodomy as charged in Count III was unanimous and specific.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12375977\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/633/#p642\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As for the remaining counts, the verdict director for Count I, first-degree statutory sodomy based upon Beck's placing his penis in A.O.'s anus, was Instruction No. 5.

She was asleep in her bedroom, and Beck was in the same room, on the computer, looking at pictures of women on the Internet. Beck told her to come over to him, pulled down her pants, put her hands on her hips, and put his penis in her anus. Although A.O. testified that Beck anally sodomized her five or six times, she did not testify at trial about any other specific incidents of anal sodomy. In her CPC interview that was played for the jury, however, A.O. told the forensic interview about other specific incidents of anal sodomy, including one time in the presence of her little brother, who was watching television in the same room; another time when she was sleeping in her sister's room, he came in the room at 2:00 a.m., and she tried to wrap herself in her covers; another time when she was eleven years old and was sleeping in the basement; and another time when she was eleven or twelve years old and was sleeping in her sister's room without her sister there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Despite evidence of at least five specific incidents in which Beck put his penis in A.O.'s anus, the verdict director did not comply with\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   . The State did not elect the particular criminal act on which it would rely to support the charge; nor did the verdict director specifically describe the separate criminal acts presented to the jury and instruct the jury that it must agree that at least one of those acts occurred.\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318430\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/150/#p154\">\n    344 S.W.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During her CPC interview, A.O. told the interviewer about that incident, which she said happened when she was eleven or twelve years old. She also told the interviewer that, during that incident, Beck placed his fingers in her vagina. Additionally, A.O. told the forensic interviewer that, during the incident that occurred in the basement when she was eleven years old, Beck tried to put his penis in her vagina.

The evidence further showed that Beck also touched A.O.'s genitals with his hands during the incident that occurred when she was eleven or twelve years old, in fifth grade, and sleeping alone in her sister's room. Because the verdict director for Count IV did not specify a particular act of Beck's touching A.O.'s genitals with either his genitals or his hands and did not caution the jury that it must unanimously agree on the specific act committed, jurors could have relied on any of these three acts to find Beck guilty of first-degree child molestation.

All four counts in the second amended information alleged that the act referenced in each count occurred \"on or between November 18, 2005 and November 17, 2012, in the County of Jackson, State of Missouri.\" Beck argues that the charges were insufficient because they did not allege a specific time and did not allege a specific place in Grandmother's house where the abuse occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Beck concedes that he did not raise any objection to the second amended information at trial. When the sufficiency of the charging instrument is raised for the first time after the verdict, the Supreme Court has held that it will be \"deemed insufficient only if it is so defective that (1) it does not by any reasonable construction charge the offense of which the defendant was convicted or (2) the substantial rights of the defendant to prepare a defense and plead former jeopardy in the event of acquittal are prejudiced.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in response to the State's request to file the second amended information which narrowed the scope of the time alleged from between A.O.'s fifth and fourteenth birthdays to between A.O.'s fifth and twelfth birthdays, defense counsel told the court that he wanted \"the record to reflect that\" he and Beck had prepared for trial for events within the dates alleged in the first amended information, that is, up to A.O.'s fourteenth birthday. Defense counsel also told the court that the filing of the second amended information \"doesn't change the trial strategy at all.\" Beck has failed to demonstrate that the time period alleged in the second amended information substantially prejudiced his ability to prepare his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Likewise, Beck has failed to demonstrate that the time period alleged in the second amended information prejudiced his ability to plead former jeopardy in the event of an acquittal. In the second amended information, Beck was charged with committing three acts of first-degree statutory sodomy and one act of first-degree child molestation between November 18, 2005, and November 17, 2012. Beck cannot be successively prosecuted or punished for any additional acts of first-degree statutory sodomy or first-degree child molestation encompassed by the charged time period.

Kenneth Boles, another friend of Beck's family, testified that he saw the assistant prosecutor nodding her head, \"showing disgust,\" and gesturing like she did not believe what defense counsel was saying during his closing. Grandmother testified that she observed the assistant prosecutor \"shaking her head in disgust\" and \"mouthing something\" during defense counsel's closing. Early, Boles, and Grandmother believed the jury could see the assistant prosecutor's actions. Defense counsel told the court that he \"heard sounds behind [him]\" during his closing argument, but he \"had no idea who it was.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Beck argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying this claim because the assistant prosecutor's actions constituted an improper \"personal unsubstantiated attack on the character and ethics of opposing counsel,\" in violation of his constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, and a fair and impartial jury. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Where, as here, the circuit court made no factual findings, \"we 'must assume that all facts were found in accordance with the result reached.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2015). Applying these principles, we assume that the court did not believe the testimony of Beck's family and friends about the assistant prosecutor's alleged conduct. Indeed, the court was present during closing arguments and had the opportunity to observe counsel and the jury. The court was in a better position to observe whether the alleged conduct occurred and, if it did, whether there was any prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2009). Deferring to the circuit court's credibility determinations and its superior ability to determine not only whether the alleged conduct occurred and, if so, whether it resulted in prejudice, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Beck's motion for a new trial on this basis. Point III is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point IV-State's Closing Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In Point IV, Beck contends the circuit court erred by not\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   intervening\n   during the State's closing argument when the State referred to Grandmother as an \"enabler\" of Beck. He concedes that he did not object to this comment at trial.

The record further showed that, after Beck first assaulted A.O., she told Grandmother about Beck's looking at pictures of naked women on the internet in her presence and Grandmother did nothing about it. Additionally, A.O. testified, without objection, that she believed that, even if Grandmother had known about the sexual abuse, she would not have said anything and would have allowed it to go on. It was not improper for the State to infer from this evidence that Grandmother was an \"enabler\" of Beck. Furthermore, Beck has not demonstrated that the State's characterization of Grandmother as an enabler had a decisive effect on the jury.

He argues that, because Killough's diagnosis was based on A.O.'s statements to her, Killough's diagnosis was designed to corroborate A.O.'s credibility and was more prejudicial than probative.

Killough did not state that Beck was guilty of the abuse, nor did she comment on A.O.'s veracity.

Specifically, the State explained that, in A.O.'s forensic interview, she denied that anyone else had done \"something to her body which she did not want him or her to do.\" In depositions, however, A.O. indicated that her older brother had sexually abused her. The State believed that Beck intended to impeach A.O. with this evidence. In a pretrial hearing on the State's motion, Beck argued that he did, in fact, intend to impeach A.O. with this evidence as a \"prior inconsistent statement\" and argued that it \"has nothing to do with rape shield.\" The court sustained the State's motion in limine to exclude it.

Thus, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Madsen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , this evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Beck's request to cross-examine A.O. regarding\n   whether she lied in her prior statements about it. Point VI is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point VII-Alleged Juror Misconduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In Point VII, Beck contends the circuit court erred in denying his requests for various forms of post-trial relief including a new trial, a hearing, an order permitting defense counsel to interview the jurors, an order permitting defense counsel to call Juror No. 1 as a witness in the hearing on the motion for new trial, and an order granting his motion to produce Juror No. 1's employment records. All of these requests for relief were based upon Beck's claim that he belatedly recognized Juror No. 1 as someone he believed was a pod officer assigned to the same pod in the Jackson County Jail where he spent a month before being released on bond. Although Juror No. 1 was excused prior to deliberations, Beck argues that he was \"possibly prejudiced by the presence of Juror No. 1 in the jury during the trial\" because \"there is a possibility that Juror No. 1 could have imparted prejudicial information to the other jurors while she sat on the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   During voir dire, Juror No. 1 stated that she had worked for the Jackson County Department of Detention in downtown Kansas City for six years and nine months but left two weeks before trial. Juror No. 1 stated that there was nothing about her employment or separation that would render her unable to be fair and impartial to the State or the defense. She indicated that she did not know Beck. Defense counsel did not challenge Juror No. 1 for cause or raise a peremptory challenge, so she served on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   During the trial, the State complained that the defense was strategizing near where Juror No. 1 was sitting during a recess. Defense counsel told the court that he was aware of Juror No. 1's presence during the recess but denied that she could hear him. Additionally, the State complained that Juror No. 1 had been falling asleep throughout the trial. The court and the parties discussed Juror No. 1's falling asleep on two other occasions later in the trial. Following closing arguments, the court announced its intention to dismiss Juror No. 1 and gave the parties the opportunity to object. Both parties stated that they had no objection to her dismissal, so she was dismissed prior to deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In an affidavit attached to his motion for new trial, Beck alleged that, when Juror No. 1 was excused just before deliberations, he recognized her as someone he \"believed\" was his pod officer when he was detained in the Jackson County Jail for approximately one month before being released on bond. He averred that he did not recognize her as his pod officer until that time because of the seating arrangement in the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   During the hearing on his motion for new trial, Beck testified that the last time he took a look at Juror No. 1, at \"the very end\" of trial, he \"thought that she looked familiar.\" He reiterated that he did not recognize her earlier in the trial because of the seating arrangement in the jury box and because he was instructed not to look at the jury. On cross-examination, Beck admitted that Juror No. 1 would have been the last juror in and the first juror out every time the jury entered and exited the courtroom during the trial. He admitted that he recognized her when she was dismissed prior to deliberations. He testified that he did not tell the court about it at that time, however, because he \"was in shock.\" Defense counsel argued that Juror No. 1 \"may well have said to the other jurors during informal discussions that she recognized him because he was in the jail.\" The court overruled Beck's requests for relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We will not disturb the circuit court's ruling on a claim of juror misconduct unless we find an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

She also indicated that she did not know Beck. If Beck wanted to know whether she worked as his pod officer in the course of her employment and possibly recognized him from that context, he could have brought the matter to the court's attention and requested leave to ask her those questions outside the hearing of the other venire members. He did not. \"A venireperson cannot be found to have intentionally concealed an answer to a question that was never asked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10023364\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/939/882/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10023364\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/939/882/#p883\">\n    at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Moreover, given the attention that was placed on Juror No. 1 throughout the trial due to her sleeping and Beck's strategizing near where she was sitting during a recess, and the fact that Juror No. 1 was the last juror in and the first juror out every time the jury entered and exited the courtroom during the trial, the court could have found Beck's claim that he did not recognize her until she was dismissed to be implausible. Even if the court did believe that Beck failed to recognize Juror No. 1 until she was dismissed, however, Beck admitted that he did not bring it to the court's attention at that time. A defendant claiming juror misconduct must call such fact to the court's attention as soon as he learns of it and has the opportunity to report it.\n   <em>\n    State v.
