Pfeiffer, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following a jury trial, Mr. Terry Lee Lutes (\"Lutes\") was found guilty of two counts of child molestation in the first degree, for which Lutes was sentenced by the Circuit Court of Caldwell County, Missouri (\"trial court\"), to two consecutive twelve-year terms of imprisonment. Lutes appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lutes argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in: (1) admitting evidence of his three prior sex crimes involving minor females; (2) refusing to permit him from asking a question during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   regarding his prior convictions; and (3) admitting evidence of the child victim's out-of-court statements. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March of 2014, while staying with his daughter and granddaughter (L.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), Lutes\n   placed his finger in L.B.'s vagina, removed his finger to lick it, and then re-inserted his finger in L.B.'s vagina. Thereafter, he compelled L.B. to hold his penis and masturbate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State charged Lutes with two counts of child molestation in the first degree, as a prior offender, for manually touching the vagina of his then six-year-old granddaughter, L.B., and for forcing L.B. to touch his penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to trial, the State moved to be allowed to admit evidence pursuant to article I, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution. The State presented certified copies of three previous pleas of guilty Lutes had made to sexual crimes involving minors. The pleas of guilty resulted in the following: (1) a 2004 conviction for statutory rape in the second degree for having sexual intercourse with a sixteen-year-old victim in 2001; (2) a 1994 conviction for two counts of sexual assault in the first degree for having sexual intercourse with a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old victim in 1994; and (3) a 1993 conviction for sexual assault in the first degree for having sexual intercourse with a fourteen-year-old victim in 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lutes objected to the admission of the evidence, arguing, as relevant to his appeal, that the prior convictions were not legally relevant to the charged crime because they were too remote in time and dissimilar in circumstances. The trial court concluded that the propensity evidence was both logically and legally relevant and that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Thus, the evidence of the three convictions was admitted at trial over Lutes's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Lutes was aware that the trial court intended to allow his conviction history to be admitted at trial, his trial counsel requested that he be allowed to ask the following question as \"his record\" of the question he wished to ask during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of the venire panel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I anticipate that the Prosecutor Joe will present during the course of this trial evidence of Terry Lutes' prior criminal conviction history regarding child molestation of other young women. Would that fact cause anyone here knowing that that could be presented to you as jurors present a problem in any one of you being fair and impartial as jurors in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State objected, and the trial court responded that, \"I'm not going to let you ask\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   [question].\" (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel did not submit an alternately phrased proposed question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the first trial, L.B. was present and testified, but that proceeding resulted in a mistrial. In anticipation of the second trial, the subject of the instant appeal, the State made numerous attempts at ensuring L.B.'s presence at the trial, including service of a subpoena by the Wabaunsee County, Kansas Sheriff's Department commanding her to appear and testify and obtaining an order from a judge in Kansas to compel her attendance. A return of service showed that the order was served to L.B.'s address. L.B.'s father, however, informed the State that he refused to bring L.B. back to Missouri to testify. Hence, at the second trial, L.B. did not appear. The State argued that L.B. was, therefore, \"unavailable\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   to testify when various objections were made by Lutes to the admission of evidence requiring L.B.'s unavailability at trial, including a video-recording of L.B.'s testimony at the first trial. The trial court admitted the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The evidence at the second trial was as follows. In 2014, L.B., her mother, and her half-brother went to live with her half-brother's grandparents, John Giese (\"Giese\") and Lynda Sloan (\"Sloan\"). L.B. and her family lived downstairs while Giese and Sloan lived upstairs. In March of 2014, Lutes came to stay with L.B.'s family for a few days. Giese walked downstairs one of those mornings and saw L.B. sleeping on Lutes's bare chest, which bothered Giese.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In L.B.'s video-recorded testimony from the first trial, L.B. testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [W]hen it was bedtime, [Lutes] said, \"Come here,\" and I did because I was really tired and I just woke up to get a glass of water.... So he grabbed my hand and he put it down his pants, and then he rubbed it on his bad spot, and then he took his finger and he licked it and he put it in my private-my bad spot, and-he started to lick it again-and he kept doing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Sunday after Lutes had left, L.B.'s mother asked Giese to come downstairs. Giese testified that L.B. told him that Lutes \"in the middle of the night put his finger down-down there and ... she said he shook, and-and he put ... his finger in her, and then stuck it in his mouth and licked it.\" He also testified that L.B. indicated that Lutes also had her play with his penis. Giese accompanied L.B. and her mother to the local police department. L.B. was taken to St. Joseph, Missouri, for a forensic interview and to Children's Mercy Hospital for a SAFE\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   exam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Forensic interviewer Trenny Wilson (\"Wilson\") testified about the interview she conducted with L.B., which was video-recorded. In the video, L.B. described Lutes touching the inside of her \"peepee\" with his finger and putting his finger in his mouth and then sliding it back into her \"skin.\" She said Lutes also put her hand in his pants and forced her to touch his \"boy's bad spot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lutes presented no evidence in his defense. He was found guilty on two counts of child molestation in the first degree and sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment on each count to be served consecutively. Lutes now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In Point I, Lutes argues the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to introduce evidence of his three prior convictions for statutory rape and sexual assault, under article I, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution, because he contends the evidence was not legally relevant in that any probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court's decision to admit Lutes's three prior convictions for sexual assault of female minors under article I, section 18(c), like all claims of evidentiary error, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and will not be disturbed unless this court finds that the trial court's exercise of discretion was clearly against the logic of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, this court reviews the decision of the trial court for prejudice, not mere error, and will reverse only if we find that the error was so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387752\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/534/813/#p818\">\n    534 S.W.3d at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Propensity evidence is \"evidence of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or acts used to establish that a defendant has a natural tendency to commit the crime charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, Lutes argues that the State should have gone further. Lutes cites to a\n   <em>\n    discretionary\n   </em>\n   provision of the Uniform Law, section 491.420.1, providing that in addition to the actions taken above, the court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   also issue a certificate that includes a recommendation \"that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to assure his attendance in this state.\" Lutes argues that good faith and due diligence\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   that the State request that the child be seized from her custodial parent by law enforcement and compelled to attend trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We disagree.

Indeed, the two considerations are inversely related. For example, an inference of propensity might be proper notwithstanding a significant\n   time lapse between the prior crime and the charged crime if the two crimes are highly similar.

For this reason, the courts upholding the admission of evidence of prior sexual misconduct have focused on the particular circumstances of the charged and uncharged offenses which support the existence of such a \"generally consistent pattern[ ] of behavior\": the age of the victims; the defendant's familial or quasi-familial relationship to the victims, and the manner in which he gained access to them; the manner in which the defendant \"groomed\" his victims before initiating sexual contact; the physical location in which the sexual misconduct occurred; the circumstances and tactics which allowed the defendant to be alone with the victim in a secluded location; the specific nature of the sexual conduct, including the manner in which that conduct was initiated, and the manner in which it escalated; and the violence, threats, or inducements the defendant employed to perpetrate the sexual offense, and to keep the victim from reporting the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   states that \"[p]rior acts of child molestation are relevant when the acts were 'committed in a manner similar to the charged offense.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387752\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/534/813/#p818\">\n    534 S.W.3d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). So in this case, what are the similarities in the manner in which the various offenses were committed? I can find none.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     None\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   of the circumstances cited in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   , or other cases on which they rely, are present in this case. Lutes' prior convictions involved conduct which occurred twelve or more years prior to the charged offenses. Given the remoteness in time from the charged offenses, a relatively high degree of similarity between the charged and uncharged offenses should have been required before evidence of Lutes' prior convictions was admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, that similarity simply does not exist. The State charged Lutes with inserting his finger into the vagina of his six-year-old granddaughter, and with\n   directing his granddaughter to hold and stroke his penis with her hand. Each of Lutes' prior convictions involved sexual intercourse with fourteen- to sixteen-year-old females. The nature of the actions in the earlier and present cases are completely different. The nature of the victims are also dissimilar. The present case involves Lutes' six-year-old granddaughter, with whom he was staying at the time of the charged offenses. The earlier cases involve fourteen- to sixteen-year-old females to whom Lutes was apparently not related, and with whom he was not residing. The fact that the charged offenses involve a prepubescent child to whom Lutes is related, while the earlier offenses involved unrelated teenagers, is a significant distinguishing feature between the earlier cases and the present one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The most that can be said in this case is that both the charged and prior offenses were felony sexual offenses committed against minor females. Under the caselaw discussed above, this is not enough to support the admission of evidence of Lutes' prior offenses; in none of the earlier cases was the relationship between the charged and uncharged offenses as attenuated as here. Because of the remoteness in time of Lutes' prior convictions, and the dissimilarity of those offenses to the present charges, the evidence of Lutes' prior offenses had minimal-if any-probative value for proving that Lutes had a propensity to commit the sort of offenses he is alleged to have committed against his granddaughter. In these circumstances, the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of those prior crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The admission of evidence of those prior offenses merits reversal for a new trial. \" 'If evidence of a prior crime is not admissible under any exceptions to the general rule prohibiting its admission, the admission is presumed to be prejudicial.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. S.D. 2005). In this case, although the State limited the evidence admitted to only that evidence revealed by the charging instruments and judgments in Lutes' prior prosecutions, the essence of the charges-that Lutes had sexual intercourse with multiple fourteen- to sixteen-year-old females at a time when he was between twenty-eight and thirty-seven years old-would inherently prejudice Lutes' defense. In addition, the State emphasized the evidence in closing argument, arguing that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   [the victim's] account is not the entirety of the case against Mr. Lutes.... There's been evidence produced that Terry Lutes has the propensity to commit sex crimes against female minors.

Now, this time the victim is his granddaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The State argued that, \"[w]e know, based on prior convictions, what Mr. Lutes is into.\" In these circumstances, and given the minimal legitimate probative value of the evidence, the erroneous admission of this highly prejudicial evidence requires that Lutes be given a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Even if\n   </em>\n   Lutes' prior convictions of sex offenses were properly admitted, reversal\n   for a new trial is required, because the circuit court prohibited him from asking prospective jurors during voir dire whether they could be fair and impartial, despite the fact that he was a convicted felony sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As the majority recognizes, a meaningful opportunity to examine potential jurors is an essential component of a fair trial.

In the same vein, there is a very real danger that venire members will hold biases against persons-like Lutes-who have previously been convicted of felony sex offenses against minors, and will believe them to be guilty of any later-charged offense, without considering the evidence in the particular case. Lutes was accordingly entitled to conduct voir dire to determine whether any member of the venire panel held a \"preconceived bias\" against persons with prior sex-offense convictions, and I do not read the majority opinion to disagree with that general proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Although not disputing that a defendant is\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   entitled to conduct voir dire examination concerning his prior convictions, the majority holds that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit such examination in this case, because \" 'the manner of asking' the proposed\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question by Lutes was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   factually\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   legally accurate.\" Maj. Op. at 395. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Lutes had been convicted on three occasions of non-forcible sexual intercourse with females between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years old. Lutes' counsel's description of his prior offenses as involving \"child molestation of other young women\" adequately described the prior convictions for purposes of argument before the circuit court as to whether voir dire examination would be permitted. Given that Lutes' prior offenses consisted of acts of statutory rape, describing those acts as \"child molestation\" did not minimize the seriousness of the offenses. Moreover, although counsel's proposed voir dire question referred to the victims of Lutes' prior offenses as \"young women,\" this could not have been misleading given that the question described Lutes'\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   as consisting of \"\n   <em>\n    child\n   </em>\n   molestation.\" While Lutes' proposed voir dire question may have been somewhat imprecise, it was not inaccurate, and any defects in the wording of this hypothetical question could not justify the circuit court in wholly denying Lutes the opportunity to conduct voir dire on this critical issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The majority also finds that Lutes' proposed question was not\n   <em>\n    legally\n   </em>\n   accurate, because it failed to recognize that the jury could properly consider Lutes' prior convictions as evidence of his guilt, by virtue of Article I, \u00a7 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution. I once again disagree. Lutes' proposed voir dire question did not suggest that the jury could not\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   his prior convictions in determining his guilt. Instead,\n   he proposed merely to ask them whether they could remain \"fair and impartial\" despite the fact that Lutes had prior convictions for sexual offenses against minors. Fairly read, Lutes' question only proposed to ask prospective jurors what he was entitled to ask: whether they would fairly and impartially consider all of the evidence in the case, despite the fact that he had prior felony sex convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In any event, I reject the majority's premise that the circuit court actually subjected counsel's proposed voir dire question to such careful parsing, and based its ruling on the purported wording defects the majority identifies. Trial counsel and the court discussed at length whether counsel would be permitted to ask venire members about the \"propensity evidence\" which would be admitted concerning Lutes' prior convictions of sexual offenses. Even before trial counsel formulated his proposed voir dire question, the court indicated that \"I'm not going to let you do that probably,\" although it\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   allow counsel to ask the venire members \"if they could be fair and impartial in hearing all the evidence.\" Nothing in the record suggests that the circuit court's restriction of voir dire was based on the specific wording of the voir dire question that Lutes' counsel hypothesized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The court's refusal to allow Lutes to voir dire prospective jurors concerning his prior sex-offense convictions justifies a new trial. As explained above, the admission of such acts of prior misconduct created a substantial risk that the jury would convict Lutes without regard to the merits of the present charge. The State elicited the facts of Lutes' prior convictions, and argued in closing that the jury should rely on those convictions to find that Lutes had a propensity to commit offenses like those with which he was charged. Lutes should have been permitted to ask potential jurors whether they could remain fair and impartial, despite the fact that he was a convicted felony sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The circuit court's judgment should be reversed, and the case remanded to that court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    On appeal from a jury-tried case, the appellate court views the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n    <em>\n     State v.

The record shows that Lutes was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for the 2001 conviction. In 1993, Lutes received a sentence of seven years' imprisonment, but was granted five years' probation for his plea of guilty to sexual assault in the first degree. In 1994, presumably in violation of his probation, Lutes was sentenced in another case for two counts of sexual assault to five years' imprisonment on each count to run concurrently but consecutive with another sentence. Although it is unclear as to exactly how much time Lutes spent imprisoned, it is reasonable to infer it was for a significant time during the relevant period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    In response to\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    question, the trial court responded, \"I'm not going to let you ask\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    [question].\" (Emphasis added.)
