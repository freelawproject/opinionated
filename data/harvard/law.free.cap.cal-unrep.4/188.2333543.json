A jury trial was had, plaintiff recovered judgment, and defendant appeals from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial. The contract called for Early Rose merchantable potatoes. It is claimed that there was no evidence at all tending to show that the goods tendered were merchantable. In this, we think, after carefully examining the record, the appellant is in error. There is much testimony to that effect. Appellant seems to conclude, because plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that some of the potatoes had sprouted a little, that .it would necessarily follow that they were not merchantable. But this proposition cannot be sustained. That might depend upon how badly they had sprouted, and perhaps upon the time of the year in which they were to he delivered. Some witnesses testified that the potatoes tendered were salable for table use, or, as the witnesses preferred to say, for shipment. It became a question for the jury, and was submitted to them under instructions which are not complained of here. The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
