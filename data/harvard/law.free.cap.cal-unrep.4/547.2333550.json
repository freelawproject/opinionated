And the prayer was that plaintiff take nothing by his action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>court below found against the defendant upon all the issues raised, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff according to the prayer of his complaint, from which, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">When the plaintiff had introduced in evidence his note and rested his case, the defendant moved the court to appoint a referee to take and report an accounting between plaintiff and defendant. The plaintiff objected, upon the ground, among others, that the parties had settled their accounts in full up to the date of the note, and the note was given for the balance then found due. The court denied the motion, and held that it was premature at that stage of the ease; that under section 639, subsection 1, Code of Civil Procedure, a referee should not be appointed until it is made to appear that there is an issue of fact which requires the examination of a long account; and, also, that the execution of the note by defendant to plaintiff implied a settlement at that time. This ruling is assigned as error, but we think it clearly correct. The defendant was then called and sworn as a witness in his own behalf. It appears from his testimony that there were thpee settlements between the parties\u2014one in November, 1883, one in October, 1885, and one in May, 1888\u2014and that in making the last settlement plaintiff and defendant spent about a week in going over and examining all plaintiff\u2019s accounts concerning his agency business; that, as a result of such examination, a balance of $1,969 was found due from defendant to plaintiff, for which the note in suit was then given; and that defendant then understood that the accounting was full and complete. At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony, he renewed his motion for the appointment of a referee. The plaintiff again objected, and the court denied the motion, holding that it could not be granted under the pleadings as they then stood. . The court said \u201cthat defendant, having alleged that there had been no account stated, embracing the matters intrusted to plaintiff as agent, which allegation set forth in the answer is deemed in law to be denied, might have an accounting of those matters, if such allegation should be found to be true. But the evidence introduced by the defendant, pertinent to said matter, conclusively shows that there was an account stated, embracing the agency business, as well as plaintiff\u2019s claim for wages, that there was a balance struck, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>defendant gave the note sued on for the exact amount of such balance, whereby he promised to pay it.\u201d There was obviously no error in this ruling. Thereafter the defendant moved the court for leave to amend his answer by striking out the part thereof which alleged that the said note was executed and delivered without any accounting or settlement between plaintiff and defendant as to the general business of plaintiff\u2019s said agency, and by inserting the following: \u2018\u2018 That settlements between these parties plaintiff and defendant in regard to the transactions of plaintiff\u2019s agency were had as follows: One about October 1,1883, the next about October 1, 1885, and the last one about May 25, 1888. That defendant kept no books of account of the transactions of plaintiff\u2019s agency, and that said settlements were made upon such books and papers as plaintiff produced at such settlements, and that plaintiff at such settlements stated to defendant that such books and papers so presented by him at such settlements contained all the items of accounts of receipts and expenditures touching his transactions as such agent. That defendant shortly after said last-mentioned settlement, ascertained that the said statements of plaintiff were false, and that plaintiff\u2019s books of account and papers so presented at said settlement, and upon which said settlements were had and made, did not contain a full and complete statement of the items of such receipts and expenditures, aad that plaintiff had received large amounts of money as herein stated, and which did not appear on plaintiff\u2019s said books or other papers at the times of such settlements, and of which defendant at such time and times had no knowledge, and that plaintiff had charged this defendant with large sums of money in said settlements, which were never received' by said defendant, and of which defendant at such time and times had no knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The plaintiff objected to the amendment on the ground, in substance, that it admitted that there were three settled and stated accounts between the parties, the last settlement resulting in the giving the note sued on, and that, while it attempted to set up fraud on the part of the plaintiff for the purpose of having the account opened and re-examined, it failed to state the facts constituting the fraud specifically or sufficiently, but charged it only in general terms. The court sustained the objection, and this ruling is also assigned as error. The code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>provides that \u201cthe court may likewise in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon such terms as may he just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding\u201d: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 473. Applications to amend pleadings are addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and, while that discretion should be liberally and freely exercised to effect the ends of justice, orders granting or refusing such applications will not be disturbed on appeal unless it appears that the court abused its discretion: Emeric v. Alvarado, 90 Cal. 448, 27 Pac. 356; Wixon v. Devine, 91 Cal. 477, 27 Pac. 777. An account stated may be impeached for fraud or mistake (Green v. Thornton, 96 Cal. 67, 30 Pac. 965), but the burden is upon the party seeking to impeach it to set out in his pleading the particular facts constituting the fraud or mistake relied on. \u201cIt is not sufficient to aver fraud in general terms; the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged. This is held in many cases decided by this court. This course of decision commenced at an early date in this state\u201d: Spring Valley Waterworks v. City of San Francisco, 82 Cal. 321, 16 Am. St. Rep. 116, 22 Pac. 910, 1046, and see eases cited. \u201cIn defense to an action on a promissory note, it is not sufficient to plead in general terms want of consideration, and that the note was obtained by fraud. The answer should set out the circumstances under which the note was given, and point out the facts which constitute the fraud\u201d: Gushee v. Leavitt, 5 Cal. 160, 63 Am. Dec. 116. Here the offered amendment fails to point out particularly the facts constituting the alleged fraud of the plaintiff. It charges that Ihe plaintiff, at the time of the settlements, made statements that the books and papers presented by him contained all the items of accounts of receipts and expenditures touching his transactions as such agent, and that defendant shortly after the last settlement ascertained that these statements were false, but it Avholly fails to point out wherein or in what particulars they were false. It also charges that plaintiff had received large amounts of money which did not appear in his books or papers, and of which defendant at that time had no knowledge, but it does not say what amounts, or when or from what source they were received. It also charges that plaintiff had charged defendant with large sums of money which were never received by him, and of which at such time or times he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>had no knowledge, but does not state what the sums \"were, nor under what dates they were charged, nor how defendant could have been ignorant at the time of the settlement as to the money charged to have been paid to himself. Such being the character of the proposed amendment, we do not think it can be said that the court abused its discretion in refusing to allow it to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The defendant next offered \u201cto introduce evidence to prove that plaintiff in the month of July or August, 1883, as the agent of the defendant, sold and delivered to one J. H. Sherez twelve head of mules, the property of the defendant, at the price of one hundred dollars per head; that the said sale was never accounted for or included in the settlements made by plaintiff and defendant, and that said plaintiff represented to defendant that \u00f1o such sale was made.\u201d The plaintiff objected to the offered evidence upon the ground that it appeared from the defendant\u2019s testimony that there had been three settlements between the parties since the date of the alleged transaction, and that, under the pleadings, the evidence was inadmissible to impeach and open up the settlements so made. The court sustained the objection, and the plaintiff excepted to this ruling. We think the ruling proper. The evidence was manifestly offered for the purpose of impeaching and reopening a settled and stated account on the ground of fraud. But this, as we have seen, could not be done under the answer as it was framed and stood when the offer was made. In our opinion the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We concur: Searls, C.; Haynes, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b555-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"ALN\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
