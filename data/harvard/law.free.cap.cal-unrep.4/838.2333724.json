This contention cannot be sustained. The notice of appeal is certainly very awkwardly constructed, but is not ambiguous, and it cannot possibly be construed as an appeal from the judgment therein mentioned. It says nothing about an appeal from the judgment, but gives notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>only that the plaintiff \u2018\u2018 appeals to the supreme court .... from the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, and from an order of said court denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the decision and judgment in the action\u201d; and then follows a description of the judgment to which the said motion of plaintiff related; and the notice then concludes with the words \u201cand from the whole thereof.\u201d These latter words refer to the orders previously mentioned, and indicate that the appeal is from the whole and not a part of said orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">While notices of appeal should be liberally construed, and no appeal should be dismissed because of any misdescription of the judgment or order to which it relates, unless it appears that the respondent has been misled by such misdescription, still this rule is not liberal enough to justify us in holding that the above notice of appeal is or was intended as an appeal from a judgment. In order to constitute such a notice, the paper relied on for that purpose should at least state that the appeal is taken from a judgment; and this, considering the fact that it is not difficult to find words to properly express such an intention, is not a harsh rule. It follows from these views that the cause is not properly on our calendar, the only appeal in the case having already been disposed of; and for this reason the submission thereof is set aside, and the cause stricken from the calendar. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We concur: McFarland, J.; Fitzgerald, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
