The answer simply \u201cdenies that $500 is a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d without stating whether such fee is unreasonably large or unreasonably small or what sum would be a reasonable fee. The court found the amount due on the mortgage notes to be $16,571.65, and fixed and allowed as plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees the sum of $500, and for the payment of these sums ordered a sale of the mortgaged property in the usual mode. Findings of fact were waived, but the amount due on the notes and the sum allowed for attorney\u2019s fees are recited in the decree. The defendant brings this appeal from the final decree, upon the judgment-roll, and without any exceptions; and the only point made is that the court exceeded its discretionary power in fixing and allowing plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and asks that the judgment be modified by deducting from the attorney\u2019s fees $350. There is nothing in the record tending to show any abuse of the discretionary power of the court; and, indeed, for aught that appears, the appellant may have expressly acquiesced in the order fixing the attorney\u2019s fees. I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">We concur: Belcher, C.; Haynes, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b466-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"Ail\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
