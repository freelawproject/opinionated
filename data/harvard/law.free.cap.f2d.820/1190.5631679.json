Under the government contract, pursuant to which the contractor developed the patented invention, the government had exclusive rights in any invention that was reduced to practice during the performance of the contract. The Claims Court held that the invention had been reduced to practice during the performance of the contract and dismissed the complaint. <em>Hazeltine Corp. v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 417, 230 USPQ 721 (1986). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">This case relates to United States Patent No. 3,836,977 (the \u2019977 patent), entitled \u201cAntenna System Having A Reflector With A Substantially Open Construction.\u201d The appellant, Hazeltine Corporation (Hazel-tine), seeks \u201creasonable and entire compensation,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 (1982), for the alleged unauthorized use by the United States of antennas that infringed the \u2019977 patent. The accused antennas are used in the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS or Beacon System) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (Administration). Indeed, \u201cthe only commercial application of the \u2019977 patent appears to be for ATCRBS antennas.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. 439, 230 USPQ at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-18\">A. In late 1971, Hazeltine engineers began studying new approaches to improving the performance of the Beacon System. They wanted to create an \u201copen array\u201d device with \u201chigh reflectivity\u201d that would minimize \u201cwind loading\u201d while enhancing \u201cbacklobe suppression.\u201d The engineers consulted with Hazeltine\u2019s Dr. Wheeler, who suggested a design solution that he believed would achieve those objectives. The Claims Court found that \u201c[t]he \u2019977 patent embodies Wheeler\u2019s conception, which was the subject of Hazeltine Patent Department Docket R3909. Neither [of the Hazeltine engineers] was able to predict confidently that the open array design proposed by Wheeler would satisfactorily solve the ATCRBS problem.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 422, 230 USPQ at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-19\">The engineers built and tested a model that reflected Dr. Wheeler\u2019s suggestions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>The model consisted of a flat aluminum surface 130 inches wide by 43.7 inches high, with an opening 31.6 inches wide by 21.2 inches high. <em>See </em>10 Cl.Ct. at 464-65 (photographs of precontract test model). The opening contained three \u201ctuned reflectors\u201d and five \u201cconductive columns,\u201d made of wooden dowels and aluminum tape, with a single monopole antenna element, all of which \u201conly represented a small segment of a proposed open array antenna.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 422, 230 USPQ at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">\u201cThe results of the tests on the experimental model convinced the involved engineers at Hazeltine that they had a viable solution to the ATCRBS problem. Indeed, Hazeltine planned to propose a tuned reflector antenna in response to an RFP [Request For Proposals] that they anticipated would be forthcoming from TSC [Transportation Systems Center of the Department of Transportation].\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 425, 230 USPQ at 726. There was no further testing of the Wheeler invention before Hazel-tine began performance of the contract with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">B. In September 1972, the Transportation Systems Center (Center) issued a Request for Proposals (Request) to 21 companies, including Hazeltine, soliciting proposals for an \u201cAir Traffic Control Radar Beacon System Modification Kit.\u201d The closing paragraph of the Request transmittal letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">Your attention is invited to the fact that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed procurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The letter was signed \u201cDaniel J. Kelle-her/Contracting Officer.\u201d The Claims Court found that, \u201cas an experienced government contractor, Hazeltine should have known that Kelleher was to be the [Contracting Officer], and there was some testimony that some members of Hazeltine did in fact know.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Request defined \u201cContracting Officer\u201d to include \u201cthe authorized representative of a Contracting Officer acting within the limits of his authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The Request stated that the contract would include the \u201cPatent Rights (Title)\u201d provision required in such contracts under 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 12-9.6102(c) (1973; effective date of regulation was March 12, 1972, <em>see </em>37 Fed. Reg. 4,802 (1972)). That provision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">(a) Whenever any invention, improvement, or discovery (whether or not patentable) is made or conceived or for the first time actually reduced to practice, by the Contractor or his employees, in the course of, in connection with, or under the terms of this contract, ... the Secretary shall have the sole and exclusive power to determine whether or not and where a patent application shall be filed, and to determine the disposition of all rights in such invention, improvement or discovery, including title to and rights under any patent application or patent that may issue thereon____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">(e) Whenever any invention, improvement, or discovery relating to the work called for or required under this contract is constructively reduced to practice by the Contractor or his employees, during the period of performance of the contract, there shall be a prima facie presumption that such invention, improvement, or discovery was conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, in connection with, or under the terms of this contract____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">10 Cl.Ct. at 425-26, 230 USPQ at 726-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Hazeltine submitted two proposals, one of which (\u201cVolume II\u201d) the Center selected for negotiation. There ensued extensive correspondences, conversations, and meetings between members of the negotiation teams of the Center and Hazeltine.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Throughout the negotiations Hazeltine sought \u201c[acknowledgment of the fact that Hazeltine has reduced the invention to practice,\u201d while the Center insisted that, if the invention already had been reduced to practice, \u201cthe Patent Rights clause is self-deleting as to the invention because it does not apply to any invention which [sic] has actually been reduced to practice prior to the execution of a contract.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>427-28, 230 USPQ at 728. The Center\u2019s patent counsel consistently \u201crefused to formally acknowledge whether or not a reduction to practice had actually taken place.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 429, 230 USPQ at 729. The Claims Court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">that no government personnel witnessed the tests conducted by Hazeltine and upon which plaintiff rests its claim that its invention had been reduced to practice. At best, the only possible indication the government had of plaintiff's invention was contained in its Volume II proposal in response to the \u2019070 RFP. A reasonable reading of the record convinces the court that any reduction to practice statements in the various government documents had their origin in plaintiff\u2019s repeated self-serving assertions that its open array antenna idea had been reduced to practice. There is no credible evidence in the record as to how government personnel would have known of such a reduction to practice other than being told it was so by plaintiff\u2019s personnel or by discerning same from plaintiff\u2019s Volume II proposal. There is no persuasive evidence in the record which would support a finding that government personnel were persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s Volume II proposal that its open array antenna had been reduced to practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6v\">10 Cl.Ct. at 430, 230 USPQ at 730. During the negotiations, Hazeltine never communicated directly with Kelleher, the Contracting Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Hazeltine prepared a letter to the Center dated March 6, 1973, which requested that any contract with it include either an exclusion from the standard patent rights clause or an acknowledgment that the open array antenna had already been reduced to practice. The letter was not sent, and the file copy had a written notation that the letter was \u201ccancelled as a result of Tedford\u2019s telecon with DOT wherein the C.O. refused H\u2019s request set forth in the attached letter.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 429, 230 USPQ at 729. Instead, Hazeltine sent a letter to the Center dated March 8, 1973, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">Pursuant to [a recent conversation between Hazeltine and government representatives], Transportation System Center has acknowledged that the subject matter of Hazeltine\u2019s Docket No. R3909, entitled \u201cOpen Array Antennas,\u201d ... has been reduced to practice by Hazeltine with in-house funds and is, therefore, not covered by the \u201cPatent Rights\u201d clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhC\">10 Cl.Ct. at 429, 230 USPQ at 729-30. There is no indication that the Center answered this letter. Hazeltine received the proposed contract (the \u2019598 contract) \u201c[sjubsequent to March 20, 1973,\u201d signed the contract on April 3, 1973, and returned it to the Center. The contract contained all of the standard provisions, including the Patent Rights clause and the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">The rights and obligations of the parties to this contract shall be subject to and governed by the following documents: (a) this award/contract, (b) the solicitation, if any, and (c) such provisions, representations, certifications, and specifications, as are attached or incorporated by reference herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">INTERPRETATION OR MODIFICATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">No oral statement of any person, and no written statement of anyone other than the Contracting Officer, or his recognized representative ..., shall modify or otherwise affect any provision of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">10 Cl.Ct. at 431, 230 USPQ at 730-31. The Claims Court \u201cnoted that the contract made no mention either of an exclusion from the Patent Rights clause or of any agreement that the open array antenna had been reduced to practice.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 431, 230 USPQ at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">The Contracting Officer, Kelleher, signed the \u2019598 contract on or about April 25, 1973. The parties stipulated that Hazeltine actually began contract performance on March 21, 1973, for which Hazeltine was paid under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">The court described the contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-14\">The \u2019598 contract was a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. The court believes it is fair to characterize this contract, at least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>Phase I portion, as a research and development type contract. The \u2019598 contract called for Hazeltine, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201cconduct a comprehensive, detailed, engineering study of the ... ATCRB [sic] interrogator installation, and concurrently, design [a four-foot-high open array antenna] in accordance with [Hazeltine\u2019s Vol-. ume II proposal and the design constraints of the \u2019070 RFP ...].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">10 Cl.Ct. at 431-32, 230 USPQ at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">The \u2019598 contract had two phases. As described by Tedford, Phase I was a \u201cstudy\u201d phase, whereas Phase II, which was optional with the government, was a \u201chardware\u201d phase. Francis J. LaRussa (LaRussa), one of the government\u2019s expert witnesses, was technical monitor on the \u2019598 contract. He described Phase I as \u201cstudy and preliminary design,\u201d with Phase II being to \u201cdesign and build and test the antenna\u201d if the results of Phase I proved satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">10 Cl.Ct. at 432, 230 USPQ at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">\u201cDesign review meetings\u201d were held between Hazeltine engineers and LaRussa, on May 3,1973 and June 22,1973, at which a number of technical problems and possible solutions were discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Hazeltine filed the patent application for the \u2019977 patent on June 25, 1973. The patent issued on September 17, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Effective August 3, 1973, the government exercised its option for Phase II of the contract, which called for the design, construction, and delivery of a full-scale prototype of the open array antenna. Ha-zeltine completed construction of the prototype in January 1974, and tested it in various settings over the succeeding months.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Despite some problems, the test results were sufficiently favorable to lead the government to award a contract to Hazel-tine to deliver ten more of the antennas. Hazeltine was also awarded a subsequent contract to implement further improvements of the open array antennas. Both of these contracts were \u201csole source\u201d contracts, awarded to Hazeltine because of its expertise with respect to the subject antenna.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The government subsequently conducted competitive bidding for the supply of a substantial number of the Beacon System antennas. Hazeltine was not awarded that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">The Claims Court found that, overall, Hazeltine \u201cdid not invest more than $20,-000, including salaries and overhead, in its precontract work relative to the tuned reflector open array antenna,\u201d while Hazel-tine expended $398,000 under the \u2019598 contract, for which the government paid it. 10 Cl.Ct. at 436, 230 USPQ at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">Hazeltine\u2019s suit against the government is based upon the government\u2019s purchase of antennas under contract from Texas Instruments and Radiation Systems, Inc. Hazeltine alleges those antennas infringe the \u2019977 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">C. As the Claims Court noted, \u201cthe critical issue in this case is whether the government has a right, under the Patent Rights clause of the \u2019598 contract, to procure and use the subject antennas, which plaintiff claims are covered by the \u2019977 patent, without liability to Hazeltine.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 439, 230 USPQ at 737. In a lengthy opinion the court ruled that \u201cthe subject of the \u2019977 patent was first reduced to practice during the \u2019598 contract as maintained by\u201d the government, so that the government had unfettered right to use the invention. 10 Cl.Ct. at 419, 230 USPQ at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">Hazeltine contends that the government is equitably estopped to deny that the open array antenna had been reduced to practice prior to the execution of the \u2019598 contract because, during the negotiations leading to the contract, the government had agreed that there had been a reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">In its opinion, the Claims Court meticulously reviewed the extensive documentary and testimonial evidence regarding the precontract negotiations and discussions, and concluded that the government had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>agreed that the invention had been reduced to practice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In order to establish an estoppel, Hazel-tine was required to show that: (1) the government believed that it had expressed agreement with Hazeltine that there had been a reduction to practice, (2) the government intended Hazeltine to enter into the contract in reliance on that agreement, (3) Hazeltine did not know the true facts, <em>i.e., </em>that the government did not agree that the invention had been reduced to practice, and (4) Hazeltine must have relied on the government\u2019s conduct to its detriment. <em>American Elec. Laboratories v. United States, </em>774 F.2d 1110, 1113 (Fed.Cir.1985). All four of these elements must be present to establish estoppel. The Claims Court found that none of them existed. 10 Cl.Ct. at 442-43, 230 USPQ at 739-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">We agree with the Claims Court that Hazeltine did not establish that during the precontract negotiations the government believed that it had expressed agreement that there had been a reduction to practice. Since our affirmance of that determination is sufficient to uphold the Claims Court ruling that there was no estoppel, it is unnecessary to consider the other three elements of estoppel that the court also found lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Hazeltine in effect asks us to review the record <em>de novo </em>and to infer the existence of such an express agreement. We decline to do so, and instead review the Claims Court\u2019s finding of no agreement to determine whether it is clearly erroneous under rule 52(a) of the Rules of the United States Claims Court. We cannot say that the record on this issue required the Claims Court to find that the government had agreed that there had been a reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Indeed, even the item of evidence that Hazeltine contends most supports its position is ambiguous: the letter that Hazeltine sent to the Center (which Hazeltine now refers to as its \u201cbest and final offer\u201d), asserting that the Center \u201chas acknowledged that the [open array antenna] has been reduced to practice.\u201d Page 1193, <em>supra. </em>The Claims Court declined to infer from the Center\u2019s failure to respond that the government thereby acquiesced in Ha-zeltine\u2019s statement of the government\u2019s position. The court\u2019s action constituted an appropriate weighing of the evidence, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">The weakness of Hazeltine\u2019s argument is highlighted by contrasting this case with <em>Bendix Corp. v. United States, </em>600 F.2d 1364, 220 Ct.Cl. 507, 204 USPQ 617 (1979), where the contractor had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI-\">rejected the boiler-plate patent rights article proposed by [the government] and, after many months of negotiation, the parties reached an agreement on terms that were precisely the same as those demanded by [the contractor] when it rejected [the government\u2019s] original proposal. [The government\u2019s] contention that, notwithstanding these facts, [the contractor] somehow is bound by [the government\u2019s] original proposal is simply incomprehensible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-11\"><em>Id., </em>600 F.2d at 1372, 220 Ct.Cl. at 519, 204 USPQ at 623. In that case, the contractor\u2019s insistence resulted in the following language in the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">... the power control disclosed in the attached blueprints ... and all inventions, improvements, and discoveries embodied therein are deemed to have been heretofore actually reduced to practice, and the expression \u201cSubject Invention\u201d ... shall be construed to exclude any of such inventions, improvements and discoveries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-14\"><em>Id., </em>600 F.2d at 1371, 220 Ct.Cl. at 518, 204 USPQ at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">Here, Hazeltine also had sought such a provision, but in the negotiations it ultimately accepted the standard contract language, despite its position that there had been a reduction to practice. In such circumstances, we agree with the conclusion of the Claims Court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\">there was no agreement between the parties or acknowledgement by the government regarding reduction to practice. Assuming such an agreement could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>found, the court holds that the facts are otherwise insufficient, as a matter of law, to estop the government from contesting the bona fides of such an agreement. Plaintiff is and was an experienced government contractor and had its patent staff involved in this matter throughout the negotiation process. Whether consciously or not, plaintiff did not insist on an inclusion of the alleged agreement in the \u2019598 contract. The court will not, on the record before it, do now for plaintiff what plaintiff attempted to do before it executed the \u2019598 contract. The court does not believe that equitable considerations support plaintiff\u2019s position quite apart from the legal deficiencies of its position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">The most that can be said for the pre-contract negotiations is that each party tended to play its cards close to its chest. Both parties recognized the import and impact of the Patent Rights clause on the matter at hand. Each, represented by patent counsel, signed the \u2019598 contract, with said clause contained therein and no exclusion from its coverage or reach provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">10 Cl.Ct. at 444, 230 USPQ at 741 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Under the \u2019598 contract, the government had the exclusive right \"to determine the disposition of all rights\u201d in any invention reduced to practice under the contract\u2014including the right to grant itself an exclusive, royalty-free license. Furthermore, the constructive reduction to practice of an invention during the performance of the contract created a \u201cprima facie presumption that such invention ... was conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of\u201d the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Hazeltine filed the application that ripened into the \u2019977 patent on June 25, 1973, three months after it began work under the \u2019598 contract. As the Claims Court held, the filing of a patent application is a constructive reduction to practice. 10 Cl.Ct. at 446, 230 USPQ at 742; <em>see, e.g., In re Katz, </em>687 F.2d 450, 454, 215 USPQ 14, 17 (CCPA 1982); <em>Pacific Technica Corp. v. United States, </em>11 Cl.Ct. 393, 428 (1986); <em>see also </em>3 D. Chisum, <em>Patents </em>\u00a7 10.05 (1986). Under the \u2019598 contract, therefore, there was a prima facie presumption of reduction to practice during performance of the contract, which Hazel-tine had the burden to overcome by proving that the tuned array antenna was <em>not </em>for the first time actually reduced to practice during the contract. 10 Cl.Ct. at 446, 230 USPQ at 742. The Claims Court held Ha-zeltine failed to carry that burden. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">In the context of a patent rights clause in a government contract, \u201c[rjeduction to practice occurs when it is established that the invention will perform its intended function beyond a probability of failure,\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, </em>670 F.2d 156, 161, 229 Ct.Cl. 323, 214 USPQ 857, 860 (1982), so that whatever \u201cminor adjustments\u201d are thereafter required may be considered mere \u201cperfecting modifications.\u201d <em>Bendix, </em>600 F.2d at 1371, 220 Ct.Cl. at 518, 204 USPQ at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The principal issue is whether prior to execution of the contract there had been a reduction to practice of the embodiment of the invention that claim 1 covers, through the construction of the precontract experimental model described at the outset of this opinion. As the Claims Court pointed out, Hazeltine \u201cproposed no findings supporting a reduction to practice of claims 2-13....\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 448, 230 USPQ at 744. The court also noted that \u201cClaims 2-12 require, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018a plurality of ... antenna elements for radiating wave energy ... \u2019; claim 13 is literally worded differently, but has essentially the same limitations. In claims 6 and 13, the antenna elements are specified as dipoles; in the other claims they are simply 'linearly polarized.\u2019 \u201d Although Hazeltine contends that the embodiments of the invention in claims 2-13 were reduced to practice because the precontract model was \u201cequivalent in structure to the structure defined by claims 2-13,\u201d <em>id., </em>we need not consider that argument because we agree with the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>not even the embodiment in claim 1 was reduced to practice prior to execution of the '598 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The Claims Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">There remains for consideration whether the first experimental model could have served as a reduction to practice of claim 1 of the \u2019977 patent. Claim 1 requires, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca reflector with an open construction\u201d and \u201cat least one linearly polarized antenna element for radiating wave energy, arranged with the polarization of said element substantially parallel to [the] columns\u201d and with the location of the tuned arrays \u201cselected to cause suppression of leakage of said radiated wave energy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">10 Cl.Ct. at 449, 230 USPQ at 745. The court thoroughly analyzed all the evidence relating to the testing of the precontract model, and found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">that claim 1 of the \u2019977 patent, insofar as it relates to a linearly polarized antenna element and suppression of radiation leakage therefrom, reads upon the first experimental model. However, the use of the monopole, and the circumstances of its use, in the testing of the precon-tract experimental model weaken plaintiff's claim that the invention had been reduced to practice as a result of such tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">All of the experts at trial agreed that the precontract test model could not properly be characterized as open. They further agreed that the test results reflected the performance of the entire structure, not just the opening____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-10\">... [T]he size of the opening in the precontract test model ... was not large enough to demonstrate that any observed suppression was due to resonance of the tuned rods____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-12\">The court finds that ... the available patterns did not demonstrate that the tuned reflector itself provided suppression of radiation____ Accordingly, on the facts presented, the court is unable to find that the efficacy of the tuned reflector concept was shown beyond a probability of failure on the basis of tests which merely showed that a large metal sheet containing a relatively small section of tuned array ... performed better than a solid sheet of the same gross dimensions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">10 Cl.Ct. at 450-55, 230 USPQ at 746-50. Hazeltine has not shown that any of these findings is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">Hazeltine criticizes the court\u2019s reliance upon expert testimony, arguing that it should be dispositive that \u201c[t]he evidence at trial demonstrated that the contemporaneous evaluation of Hazeltine\u2019s precontract tests convinced the involved engineers that the Wheeler invention had been reduced to practice.\u201d The question, however, is not whether those engineers believed that the invention had been \u201creduced to practice\u201d\u2014 which is a legal conclusion\u2014but whether the invention would \u201cperform its intended function beyond a probability of failure.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra. </em>We agree with the Claims Court that the repeated assertions by Hazeltine\u2019s engineers at the testing stage of the experimental model that the antenna had been \u201creduced to practice\u201d reflect mainly their wish to exclude the antenna from the patent rights clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">Hazeltine\u2019s contention is further weakened by the type of contract that Hazeltine entered into with the government. An invention that has been reduced to practice\u2014 that will \u201cperform its intended function beyond a probability of failure\u201d\u2014is immediately ready to be adapted for practical use. A contractor with such an invention therefore would reasonably seek a contract with the government for the production of a working prototype, <em>see, e.g., Bendix, </em>600 F.2d at 1371, 220 Ct.Cl. at 518, 204 USPQ at 622; <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 69, 89, 213 Ct.Cl. 395, 431, 193 USPQ 449, 466 (1977); <em>Eastern Rotocraft Corp. v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 429, 431, 181 Ct.Cl. 299, 155 USPQ 729, 731 (1967); <em>Farrand Optical Co. v. United States, </em>325 F.2d 328, 329, 139 USPQ 249, 250 (2d Cir.1963), or at the very least would file a patent application. <em>Cf. Pacific Technica Corp. v. United States, </em>11 Cl.Ct. 393, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>428 (1986) (government prevails because actual reduction to practice occurred during performance of contract, even though application filed before contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The \u2019598 contract had two phases. Phase I, which the Claims Court characterized as a research and development contract, was viewed as a \u201cstudy\u201d and \u201cpreliminary design phase.\u201d Phase II, which would be pursued only if Phase I was successful, involved the design, construction, and testing of the antenna. Because of the development that this project took, with a first stage intended merely to establish feasibility, it is inconsistent with Hazeltine's contention that at the time the contract was executed, the invention had been reduced to practice. 10 Cl.Ct. at 459 n. 38, 230 USPQ at 752 n. 38; <em>see, e.g., McDonnell Douglas, </em>670 F.2d at 158, 229 Ct.Cl. at 324, 214 USPQ at 858. Certainly the government did not believe at that time that Hazeltine already had a fully realized working solution to the problem the Request for Proposals addressed, since that would have made Phase I unnecessary. Indeed, \u201cit was only after the development work was done under Phase I of the \u2019598 contract that the government agreed, in Phase II, to purchase an actual open array antenna.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. at 459, 230 USPQ at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Furthermore, performance of Phase I of the \u2019598 contract demonstrated that, regardless of the precontract perceptions of the parties\u2019 engineers, the open array antenna had not actually been reduced to practice by the precontract model. Significant problems arose during Phase I, which were solved only after several design review meetings and extensive modification and testing of a 4-by-8-foot open array test model. <em>See </em>10 Cl.Ct. at 467 (photograph of contract test model). The necessity of solving these problems, which Hazel-tine\u2019s engineers had not anticipated from the results of testing the crude precontract model, severely weakens the probative value of those engineers\u2019 precontract perceptions of the stage of the invention\u2019s development. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>670 F.2d at 163, 229 Ct.Cl. at 332, 214 USPQ at 861-62; <em>Leesona Corp. v. United States, </em>530 F.2d 896, 910, 208 Ct.Cl. 871, 894, 185 USPQ 156, 167 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The judgment of the Claims Court dismissing the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
