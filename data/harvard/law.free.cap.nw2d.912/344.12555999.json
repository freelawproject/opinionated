Marhula appeals from a judgment dismissing an action contesting a special election in the City of Grand Forks. Marhula argues Grand Forks lacked authority under its home rule charter and city ordinances to designate one voting location for the special election. We conclude Marhula's post-election challenge to the special election is moot, and we affirm the judgment dismissing the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In 2015, the Grand Forks City Council accepted a proposal to commercially develop property known as the Arbor Park area in downtown Grand Forks. Citizens of Grand Forks thereafter petitioned for an initiated measure to require the City Council to reconsider its decision and retain the area as a park. After the City Council declined to reverse its decision, the initiated measure was submitted to the Grand Forks voters. The City Council voted to hold a special election on the measure on June 20, 2017, and to designate one voting location for the entire city at the Alerus Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On June 26, 2017, the canvassing board met and certified there were 180 more \"no\" votes out of 4,722 total votes cast at the special election. This result left in place the city's decision to sell the property for commercial development. On June 27, 2017, Grand Forks executed a contract to sell the property to Green Jacket, LLC, a North Dakota limited liability company, and on August 11, 2017, Grand Forks executed a warranty deed to Green Jacket for the property. The deed stated the property would revert to the city if Green Jacket did not begin excavation on the property before December 31, 2017. According to the Grand Forks mayor, excavation had begun on the property by October 26, 2017, and Grand Forks' reversionary interest in the property was extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Meanwhile, in July 2017, more than ten electors, including Marhula, brought this action under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-03 to\n   contest the special election. The contestants sought to void the special election, alleging: (1) Grand Forks violated its home rule charter and city ordinances by designating one voting location for the entire city; and (2) the canvassing board erred in rejecting two absentee ballots postmarked on the day of the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Grand Forks moved to dismiss the contestants' action, asserting their complaint was not verified as required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-03 and the action was not filed within the time required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-04. The district court denied Grand Forks' motion, ruling the contestants' complaint was properly verified and the action was commenced and filed within fourteen days after the canvassing board's final certification as required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] After an evidentiary hearing, the district court dismissed the contestants' complaint. The court construed the language of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-04-02 in effect on the date of the election to authorize Grand Forks to establish a single voting location for the special election for good and sufficient reasons. The court concluded there were no provisions in the Grand Forks Municipal Code depriving the City of that power and found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The reason the City preferred a single polling place, and specifically the Alerus Center, is that they had difficulty obtaining election workers. Although the City had never canceled an election for lack of workers, obtaining workers was a struggle right up to election day. Also, the City wished to use Grand Forks County electronic poll books. The City and Grand Forks County entered into a Joint Powers Agreement that had the County of Grand Forks agreeing to furnish the machines, as well as training to operate them. Grand Forks County insisted on a single polling place since the County had no time to train workers in several locations. The Alerus Center is located on main roads. It has room to hold voters in the venue in case of inclement weather. The Court finds that these were good and sufficient reasons to have the Alerus Center as a single polling place in the Special Election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court concluded the designation of a single voting location for the special election was not erroneous or fraudulent under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-05(2). The court also concluded that the canvassing board did not err in rejecting two absentee ballots postmarked on the day of the election under the language of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-07-09 and that the rejection of those ballots was not erroneous or fraudulent under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-05(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The contestants appealed, and we subsequently granted a motion by all the contestants except Marhula to dismiss their appeal. Marhula, as the sole remaining appellant, has not raised an issue about the canvassing board's rejection of two absentee ballots postmarked on the date of the election. Issues not briefed by an appellant are deemed abandoned.\n   <em>\n    Bay v.

We therefore do not address that issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Marhula argues Grand Forks' home rule charter gives it authority to establish election procedures and its city ordinances mandate voting within precincts in each ward. He contends Grand Forks lacked authority under those provisions to conduct a special election for the entire city at one voting location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Grand Forks has moved to dismiss Marhula's appeal, arguing that any issues about the conduct of the special election are moot because Grand Forks has sold the property to Green Jacket and no contestants\n   sought to enjoin the sale pending resolution of these judicial proceedings. Grand Forks also argues the contestants did not bring a legal challenge to the designation of a single voting location before the election and the post-election challenge is moot under\n   <em>\n    Brandvold v.

The plaintiffs alleged the 2003 reorganization election was tainted because one of the three original school districts had fraudulently failed to disclose certain debts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. We concluded the 2010 challenge to the 2003 election based upon claimed pre-election irregularities was rendered moot by the completion of the election.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. In construing our declaratory judgment act, we followed decisions under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act from other jurisdictions for the principle that challenges to the result of an election based upon claimed pre-election irregularities that were peculiar to the particular election were moot and not appropriate for declaratory relief once the underlying election had been completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. We concluded the belated challenge to the 2003 election related to particular conduct in a particular election and the completion of that election rendered the post-election challenge moot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. We therefore held the petition for declaratory relief presented no justiciable controversy and the district court did not err in dismissing it for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] In\n   <em>\n    Kerlin v.

Indeed, it has been held that this rule of law is so well established that it should be considered as the common law, controlling in the light of which the statute was enacted and with which the statute must be interpreted and effecting its application, unless the statute in express terms negatives it by a declaration that the election held in disregard of the statute shall be void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Kerlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549113\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nd/25/207/#p213\">\n    25 N.D. at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549113\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nd/25/207/#p213\">\n    141 N.W. at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Marhula's claims relate to particular conduct involving the designation of one voting location for the entire city in a particular special election under the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Brandvold\n   </em>\n   .
