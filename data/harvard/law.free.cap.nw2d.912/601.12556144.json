We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   PERTINENT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, defendant challenges only his sentence, not his convictions. Defendant's domestic-violence conviction arose from an incident in which he repeatedly punched his girlfriend in the face. His witness-intimidation conviction arose after he placed a call to the victim from jail, while he was awaiting trial, during which he told the victim not to come to court for his trial. This call was recorded and admitted into evidence. It was undisputed that defendant had two previous domestic-violence convictions and that he had committed a sufficient number of prior felonies to be charged as a fourth-offense habitual offender. Defendant does not contest these facts on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At sentencing, defendant argued that his sentences should only be enhanced to maximum terms of 15 years as a result of his habitual-offender status. Defendant further argued that his witness-intimidation sentence should be based on the underlying offense of domestic violence without any habitual-offender enhancements. The trial court rejected both arguments, holding that defendant's habitual-offender status warranted an enhancement of his maximum sentence for domestic violence to life imprisonment and indicating that it would proceed on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the trial court based its sentence for witness intimidation on the underlying crime of third-offense domestic violence as enhanced by defendant's habitual-offender status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court sentenced defendant as described. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant argues that he is entitled to resentencing because his sentence for domestic violence was erroneously enhanced under both the domestic-violence statute and the habitual-offender statute. We disagree. Defendant's argument presents a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. See\n   <em>\n    People v.

As stated, it was undisputed that defendant had two prior convictions for domestic violence, and he does not challenge his conviction of third-offense domestic violence. Rather, defendant argues that the domestic-violence statute contains a method for enhancing his punishment based on recidivism and that his sentence should therefore not also be enhanced by the habitual-offender statute, MCL 769.12, which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) If a person has been convicted of any combination of 3 or more felonies or attempts to commit felonies, whether the convictions occurred in this state or would have been for felonies or attempts to commit felonies in this state if obtained in this state, and that person commits a subsequent felony within this state, the person shall be punished upon conviction of the subsequent felony and sentencing under section 13 of this chapter as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) If the subsequent felony is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment for a maximum term of 5 years or more or for life, the court, except as otherwise provided in this section or section 1 of chapter XI, may sentence the person to imprisonment for life or for a lesser term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) If the subsequent felony is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment for a maximum term that is\n   less than 5 years, the court, except as otherwise provided in this section or section 1 of chapter XI, may sentence the person to imprisonment for a maximum term of not more than 15 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In other words, defendant argues that the \"first conviction\" for the purposes of his habitual-offender enhancement should be taken to mean a conviction for a first offense of domestic violence, which is a misdemeanor. MCL 750.81(2). Misdemeanors are not subject to enhancement under the habitual-offender statute, which enhances a defendant's sentence based on prior and subsequent\n   <em>\n    felonies\n   </em>\n   .

Third-offense domestic violence is, as discussed earlier in this opinion, a separate offense arising after two previous convictions; third-offense domestic violence is punishable by a maximum of 5 years' imprisonment.

WITNESS-INTIMIDATION SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by basing his sentence for witness intimidation on an underlying conviction of third-offense domestic violence as enhanced by the habitual-offender statute. We disagree. Defendant's argument involves a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Flick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183186\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/487/1/#p8\">\n    487 Mich. at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20N.W.2d%20295\">\n    790 N.W.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The witness intimidation statute, MCL 750.122, provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (7) A person who violates this section is guilty of a crime as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) If the violation is committed in a criminal case for which the maximum term of imprisonment for the violation is more than 10 years, or the violation is punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years, the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not more than $20,000.00, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) If the violation involves committing or attempting to commit a crime or a threat to kill or injure any person or to cause property damage, the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment\n   for not more than 15 years or a fine of not more than $25,000.00, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant argues that the underlying \"violation\" in the instant case is a first-offense violation of MCL 750.81, i.e., a 93-day misdemeanor. For the reasons stated earlier in this opinion, however, the trial court correctly determined that the underlying offense was third-offense domestic violence, MCL 750.81(4), as enhanced by the habitual-offender statute. The act of\n   witness intimidation was thus \"committed in a criminal case for which the maximum term of imprisonment is more than 10 years, or ... imprisonment for life.\" MCL 750.122(7)(b). Although defendant argues that this reading will produce absurd results, we see nothing absurd about the Legislature's determination to structure the level of punishment for witness intimidation according to the severity of the underlying offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Meter, P.J., and Borello, J., concurred with Boonstra, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     People v.
