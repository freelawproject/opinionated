The prosecutor sought to admit the other-acts evidence to prove identity. \"\n   <em>\n    Golochowicz\n   </em>\n   identifies the requirements of logical relevance when the proponent is utilizing a modus operandi theory to prove identity.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

On remand, the Court of Appeals shall apply\n   <em>\n    Golochowicz\n   </em>\n   to determine whether the other-acts evidence was admissible to prove identity. The Court of Appeals shall consider whether the defendant's other act and the charged offense were sufficiently similar to support this theory of relevance.

In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because\n   we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
