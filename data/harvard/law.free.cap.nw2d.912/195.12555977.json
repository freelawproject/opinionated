On order of the Court, the application is again considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   McCormack, J. (concurring ).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Retroactive laws are often unfair. They upset settled expectations, impose new burdens, and disrupt old agreements. And so we presume laws are prospective unless they say otherwise in very clear terms. The Court of Appeals reaffirmed this foundational principle, and we rightly leave its work in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Pontiac Police and Fire Retiree Prefunded Group Health and Insurance Trust (the Trust) was organized to pay the healthcare benefits of retired police and firefighters. Under the agreement, the city of Pontiac made retirement benefit payments. But in 2012, the city came under the control of an emergency manager, and after following the necessary steps, the emergency manager issued Executive Order\n   225 on August 1, 2012. Order 225 read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Article III of the Trust Agreement, Section 1, subsections (a) and (b) are amended to remove Article III obligations of the City to continue to make contributions to the Trust as determined by the Trustees through actuarial evaluations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The Order shall have immediate effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result, the city stopped contributing to the retirement trust fund, and the Trust sued. The only question for us is whether Order 225 has retroactive effect. If the order is retroactive, the city would not need to make contributions for the period from 2011 to the date the order issued, August 1, 2012. If the order is not retroactive, the city must make the contributions that accrued up until that date. Several million dollars hang in the balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a lengthy procedural journey, the Court of Appeals held that\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine Saline, Inc v.

The dissent agrees that the rules for interpreting statutes apply to interpreting executive orders. (\"There is no doubt that courts must interpret an executive order using the ordinary means of statutory interpretation.\"). Given that, I see no principled way to exempt retroactivity analysis. The settled precedent that governs courts' interpretations of statutes provides a readily understandable set of expectations for interpreting executive orders. If we were to announce some new, yet-unspecified, set of rules to discern retroactive application of executive orders, we would be sending parties off to sea without a compass, and inviting a host of new litigation. Underlying concerns about unfairness do not change, and neither should our rules: emergency managers must clearly demonstrate their intent that an order be retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because these same rules apply, precedent stacks the deck against finding retroactivity here.

In 1990, the Legislature expanded the power of the emergency financial manager to include all matters of finances of a distressed local unit of government and extended the LGFRA to the management of insolvent public school districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Faced with the effects of the Great Recession, in 2011 the Legislature again expanded the powers of the emergency manager in the Local Government and School District Fiscal Accountability Act (LGSDFAA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provided a properly appointed emergency manager with power to declare \"[t]he modification, rejection, termination, and renegotiation of contracts....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In each legislative action described above, the Legislature declared, in identical or similar terms, that \"the public health and welfare of the citizens of [Michigan] would be adversely affected by the insolvency\n   of units of local of government[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to protect against these hazards and remedy the financial crises experienced by insolvent units of government, appointed emergency managers would implement the vast powers bestowed upon them by the state to achieve \"prudent fiscal management.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no dispute that the city of Pontiac was in financial distress and that the Governor properly appointed an emergency manager to address the financial insolvency and instability of the city. Acting pursuant to the LGSDFAA, the city's emergency manager issued Executive Order (EO) 225 on August 12, 2011, which declared, in part, that the city was no longer obligated to make contributions to the police and firefighters voluntary employees' beneficiary associations (VEBA), which is a trust created to provide health insurance to retired police and fire personnel. Specifically, EO 225 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [The Trust is] amended to remove [the] obligations of the City to continue to make contributions to the Trust as determined by the Trustees through actuarial evaluations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Order shall have immediate effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff, the board of trustees of the VEBA, contested the authority of the emergency manager to set aside the contributions to the VEBA on several grounds, and the trial court rejected them in total. Plaintiff appealed. In its March 17, 2015 published opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the emergency manager was authorized to retroactively modify the VEBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the panel concluded that the language of EO 225 only \"remove[d the contractual obligations] of the City [of Pontiac]\n   <em>\n    to continue to make\n   </em>\n   contributions to the Trust[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Focusing on the word \"continue,\" the panel concluded that EO 225 did not set aside the accrued amount of $3,473,923 that was past due and owing to the VEBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The city of Pontiac sought leave to appeal in this Court, arguing that because the past due contribution had not been funded, it was an obligation included within the scope of EO 225. This Court reversed the Court of Appeals and held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   EO 225 clearly states that, as of August 1, 2012, the [city of Pontiac] no longer has an obligation \"to continue to make contributions\" under Article III of the Trust Agreement. It does not differentiate between already accrued, but unpaid obligations and future obligations, and thus by its terms applies to both. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the emergency manager did not intend to extinguish the [city]'s 2011-2012 fiscal year contribution.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court also remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to address an issue not raised or argued by plaintiff in the lower courts: whether the emergency manager's action was impermissible under the test for retroactivity set forth in\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, we asked the Court of Appeals to consider, among other things: \"(1) whether the retroactivity analysis stated in\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   applies to EO 225; [and] (2) if so, whether the extinguishment of the defendant's accrued, but unpaid, 2011-2012 fiscal year contribution by EO 225 is permissible under\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals held that the retroactivity analysis of\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   applied to EO 225 and that application of EO 225 to the nearly $3.5 million past due contribution violated\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city of Pontiac again sought relief in this Court, and we ordered oral argument on the application for leave to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Today, a majority of this Court denies the city's application for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   retroactivity analysis should not apply to action taken by an emergency manager. Simply put, the emergency manager's order was not \"legislative action\" subject to\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   . The Court of Appeals erroneously concluded the\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   retroactivity analysis applies because executive orders are interpreted under the same rules of interpretation applicable to statutes, not the nontraditional rules of statutory interpretation that are designed to evaluate whether a statute applies retroactively. There is no doubt that courts must interpret an executive order using the ordinary means of statutory interpretation. This Court has stated that \"[t]he use of the same rules of construction for both statutes and executive orders or administrative regulations is not illogical because executive orders and administrative regulations are both quasi-legislative in nature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But there is no justification for subjecting the plain language of executive orders to the elevated or\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   degree of certainty required for retroactive application of laws enacted by the Legislature. Here, the Michigan Legislature provided emergency managers with broad authority under the LGSDFAA, including the power to reject, amend, modify, or terminate terms of existing collective bargaining agreements. There is no dispute that this Court agreed that the language of LGSDFAA is \"so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the Legislature intended it to grant duly appointed emergency managers the power to set aside contractual obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The clarity with which the Legislature declared the power of emergency managers appointed under the LGSDFAA alleviates the very reason that heightened review is used to determine\n   whether legislation is retroactive. That is, there can be no doubt that the clear, plain, and direct language of the LGSDFAA afforded the public the \" 'opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly....' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff knew or should have known on March 16, 2011, the date the LGSDFAA became effective and more than a year before the emergency manager exercised that power in the instant case, that a properly appointed emergency manager would have the power to modify any contract. Thus, it cannot be viewed as \"unsettling\" for the city of Pontiac's emergency manager to have exercised power under LGSDFAA to retroactively amend existing collective bargaining agreements through EO 225. Given this understanding, EO 225 should not be subject to the elevated degree of certainty required for retroactive application of laws enacted by the Legislature. Rather, EO 225 should merely be subject to a \"[c]ontemporaneous and practical interpretation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, I believe the Court of Appeals misconstrued this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   , this Court simply provided a multi-factor test to determine whether to apply the canon of presumption against retroactivity. No\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   principle is dispositive on whether legislation may be applied retroactively, but instead the factors are guideposts for courts reviewing the law in question. The plain language of EO 225 is ultimately the best indicator of what the emergency manager intended when issuing EO 225, rather than a court's application of the\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   analysis. Thus, I am not convinced that\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Assuming arguendo that the\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   retroactivity framework applies to EO 225, the panel erred in concluding that retroactive application was impermissible. Preliminarily, I agree with the Court of Appeals that Principle Two does not apply under the facts and circumstances of this case. But I disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   Principle Four \"does not support retroactive application of EO 225 given that a vested right would be affected.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Principal Four is only implicated by an act that is remedial or procedural, and EO 225 is clearly substantive. Thus, I conclude that Principle Four offers little guidance, and the\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   analysis in this case is controlled by Principles One and Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In regard to\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   Principle One-\"whether there is specific language providing for retroactive application\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the language of EO 225 provides for retroactive application. The plain language of EO 225 clearly states that, as of August 1, 2012, the city no longer had an obligation \"to continue to make contributions\" to the Trust. The order's language does not differentiate between already accrued, but unpaid obligations and future obligations, and thus expressly applies to both. This is precisely the reason this Court previously ruled that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the emergency manager did not intend to extinguish the defendant's FY 2011-2012 contribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given\n   that this Court already said EO 225 was \"clear,\" meaning \"free from obscurity or ambiguity : easily understood : UNMISTAKEABLE,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   requiring a greater degree of clarity for that which is already clear strikes me as not only unnecessary but an exercise in futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Executive orders are reviewed by the ordinary means of statutory interpretation, and\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   does not place upon executive orders what amounts to a redundant elevated burden that they be crystal clear to apply retroactively. In regard to\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   Principle Three-keeping in mind that retroactive legislation impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or created new obligations or duties with respect to transactions or considerations already past-there is no doubt that the retiree's vested rights were impaired with the issuance of EO 225. But impairment of vested rights does not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   render retroactive application impermissible. Principle Three only requires the reviewing court to \"keep in mind\" that retroactive application of a law may impair vested rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   And because retroactive application of EO 225 is exactly the purpose of the emergency manager's powers to amend, modify, or terminate terms of existing agreements (i.e., vested rights), I am restrained by the Legislature's determination and will not thwart its prerogative by applying an overly critical view of the very executive orders that the Legislature intended be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals' decision and remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of issues that plaintiff presented in that court but were not decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Wilder, J., joins the statement of Zahra, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The city agreed that we should look at the plain text of Order 225 to determine the emergency manager's intent in its original application brief before this Court.
