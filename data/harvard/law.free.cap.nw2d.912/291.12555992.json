We grant the Petitioners' request for a supervisory writ and direct the district court to enter a judgment dismissing Robert Carvell's complaint against the Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On May 3, 2015, Robert Carvell was injured in a vehicle accident. Carvell arrived at the Emergency Department at St. Alexius Medical Center in Bismarck, where the staff took note of Carvell's injuries. Carvell claims the Petitioners were negligent in failing to treat his fractured and dislocated right middle or third finger. The radiology report from May 3, 2015, provides Carvell's injuries included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Dislocation of the third metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joint with type II fracture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Fracture dislocation at the base of the fourth metacarpal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Dislocation of the fifth carpometacarpal joint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that time, an emergency room physician reduced the dislocation of Carvell's right ring finger and applied a splint to Carvell's right hand, wrist, and forearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The following day, Carvell consented to a surgical procedure to be completed at the Bone &amp; Joint Center by Dr. Pierce, which would include \"[r]ight elbow open reduction and internal fixation and right long and ring finger open reduction and internal fixation.\" The diagnosis listed was: \"right elbow, long and ring finger fractures.\" Another document completed by a nurse practitioner provides that Carvell \"will undergo open reduction and internal fixation of elbow and open reduction and internal fixation of his third, fourth and fifth metacarpal fractures.\" Dr. Pierce's surgical report provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Right unstable olecranon process fracture (code 813.04).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Right 4th and 5th metacarpal fracture dislocations (code 815.00).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Right unstable olecranon process fracture (code 813.04).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Right 4th and 5th metacarpal fracture dislocations (code 815.00).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Right ulnar nerve compression in the cubital tunnel (code 354.2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   PROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Right olecranon process fracture, open reduction and internal fixation (code 24685).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Right ulnar nerve decompression with anterior subcutaneous transposition (code 64718).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Right 4th metacarpal base fracture dislocation, closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (code 26608-F8).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Right 5th finger metacarpal base fracture dislocation, closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (code 26608-F9).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Pierce's surgical report also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The CMC fracture dislocations of the 4th and 5th metacarpals were reduced and pinned. One pin from the 5th metacarpal shaft into the hamate and a second pin across the 5th metacarpal through the 4th metacarpal into the 3rd metacarpal. A third pin was placed dorsally into the base of the 4th metacarpal going into the hamate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ten days after surgery, Dr. Pierce noted \"X-rays of the right hand AP, lateral and oblique show good alignment of the metacarpal fractures with K-wires in good position.\" Several medical professionals, including occupational and physical therapists,\n   were concerned with Carvell's right middle finger swelling and lack of range of motion after the May 2015 surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Another radiology report from June 2015 provides Carvell had an \"[a]nterior dislocation of the third proximal phalanx at the MCP joint, with third metacarpal head fractures.... Nondisplaced intra-articular fracture of the distal hamate, extending into the third and fourth carpometacarpal articulations.\" The report also notes a \"[s]mall anterior avulsion fragment of the third metacarpal head. Nondisplaced fracture of the anterior lateral articular third metacarpal head.\" Dr. Pierce's report provides that \"a CT scan was obtained which shows that [Carvell] has some ulnar deviation and volar ulnar subluxation of his third MCP joint. There is no frank dislocation. At the time of his injury the joint was subluxated, but it was easily reduced in surgery and was kept in a reduced form in the splint until recently.\" In June 2015, Dr. Pierce performed an additional surgery on Carvell's right hand, where he completed \"right third metacarpophalangeal joint open reduction and pinning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In April 2017, Carvell commenced an action against the Petitioners, arguing the Petitioners provided improper medical care relating to his fractured middle finger. The Petitioners answered the complaint and denied Carvell's allegations of professional negligence. The Petitioners moved to dismiss Carvell's action in September 2017, arguing Carvell failed to provide an admissible expert opinion within three months, as required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-01-46. The Petitioners attached Dr. Pierce's interrogatories to their motion, where he stated, \"Because the third finger was not fully dislocated, it was splinted in extension to reduce the metacarpophalangeal joint.\" The district court denied the Petitioners' motion to dismiss, concluding \"[t]he Court agrees that the facts, as alleged and presented to date, support Plaintiff's claim that the alleged medical negligence of Dr. Pierce to fail to address the diagnosed fractures in Plaintiff's third, middle or long finger of his right hand during surgery is an obvious occurrence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The Petitioners argue this Court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction because without it, the Petitioners are left without an adequate remedy. Carvell argues the Petitioners have an adequate remedy by going to trial in this case. This Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court's authority to issue supervisory writs under N.D. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 2 and N.D.C.C. \u00a7 27-02-04 is a discretionary authority exercised on a case-by-case basis and cannot be invoked as a matter of right. We exercise this discretionary authority rarely and cautiously to rectify errors and prevent injustice in extraordinary cases in which no adequate alternative remedy exists. We generally will decline to exercise our supervisory jurisdiction if the proper remedy is an appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Western Horizons Living Ctrs. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Haskell\n   </em>\n   , the State moved to dismiss a wrongful termination claim because the plaintiff failed to file a notice required by statute and because the State could not be sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act without its consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.

The State petitioned for a supervisory writ directing the district court to\n   vacate its order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court determined the case was extraordinary, the district court erred, the State had no adequate alternative remedy, the denial of a motion to dismiss is not appealable, and it could exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.

Additionally, as discussed below, the district court erred by denying the Petitioners' motion to dismiss, and the Petitioners have no adequate alternative remedy. As this Court has noted before, supervisory jurisdiction may be warranted where a denial of a \"motion to dismiss contradicts North Dakota's statutes and this Court's precedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimond v.

Although this issue could be raised on a later appeal, the purpose of the statute is to prevent an actual trial, and the district court's decision was contrary to N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-01-46 and this Court's precedent. Therefore, the Petitioners lack an adequate alternative remedy, and this Court will exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The Petitioners argue the district court erred by denying the motion to dismiss because Dr. Pierce's alleged professional negligence does not fall within the exception for an \"obvious occurrence.\" Carvell argues Dr. Pierce forgot to fix the injuries to his middle finger, making this an obvious occurrence not requiring an expert affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Section 28-01-46, N.D.C.C., provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Any action for injury or death alleging professional negligence by a physician, nurse, hospital, or nursing, basic, or assisted living facility licensed by this state or by any other health care organization, including an ambulatory surgery center or group of physicians operating a clinic or outpatient care facility, must be dismissed without prejudice on motion unless the plaintiff serves upon the defendant an affidavit containing an admissible expert opinion to support a prima facie case of professional negligence within three months of the commencement of the action. The court may set a later date for serving the affidavit for good cause shown by the plaintiff if the plaintiff's request for an extension of time is made before the expiration of the three-month period following commencement of the action. The expert's affidavit must identify the name and business address of the expert, indicate the expert's field of expertise, and contain a brief summary of the basis for the expert's opinion.\n   <em>\n    This section does not apply to unintentional failure to remove a foreign substance from within the body of a patient, or performance of a medical procedure upon the wrong patient, organ, limb, or other part of the patient's body, or other obvious occurrence.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Emphasis added).

In July 2002, the district court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss because the plaintiff did not supply an admissible expert opinion, and the obvious occurrence exception did not apply because the open reduction and internal fixation are beyond the understanding of a layperson and required expert\n   testimony to explain the complicated technical surgical procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. This Court affirmed the dismissal, concluding the plaintiff failed to meet the requirements of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-01-46 as a matter of law, and technical surgical procedures, like the one performed, are generally beyond the understanding of a layperson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 17] We conclude the district court should not have applied the obvious occurrence exception in this case because the alleged occurrence of professional negligence is not plainly within the knowledge of a layperson, and a layperson could not find negligence without the benefit of expert testimony. Carvell correctly argues the medical records indicated his middle finger was fractured and required repair. Carvell has over-simplified his injuries and the technical surgical procedure completed by Dr. Pierce. Although Carvell's injuries warranted a second surgery, the occurrence itself must have been obvious, not the result.\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12332424\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/893/179/\">\n    2017 ND 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12332424\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/893/179/\">\n    893 N.W.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, this Court has noted several times that occurrences of alleged professional negligence during technical surgical procedures typically fall outside the obvious occurrence exception. Like\n   <em>\n    Haugenoe\n   </em>\n   , this case involves the reduction and fixation of joints involving a technical surgical procedure beyond the understanding of a layperson. Dr. Pierce's interrogatory answer and the report following surgery indicate he splinted Carvell's injured middle finger instead of utilizing a surgical repair. As in\n   <em>\n    Winkjer\n   </em>\n   , determining the appropriate treatment for Carvell's middle finger, whether by splinting or by a surgical procedure, are matters of diagnosis and treatment not commonly susceptible of understanding by a layperson without the assistance of an expert witness. Additionally, under the rule of ejusdem generis, when the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects specifically enumerated, the occurrence alleged here is not like the failure to remove a foreign substance from the body of a patient or performance of a medical procedure upon the wrong patient, organ, or limb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b6 18] We are left with a definite and firm conviction the district court clearly erred in concluding the obvious occurrence exception contained within N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-01-46 applied. Dr. Pierce's interrogatory answer and the report following the May 2015 surgery clearly established the alleged professional negligence occurred during a technical surgical procedure outside the plain knowledge of a layperson. Because the obvious occurrence exception applies only to cases that are plainly within the knowledge of a layperson, the district court erred in its factual determination that the exception applied. In the absence of an obvious occurrence, the district court erred as a matter of law in denying the Petitioners' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b6 19] We grant the Petitioners' request for a supervisory writ and direct the district court to enter a judgment dismissing Carvell's complaint against the Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b6 20] Jon J.
