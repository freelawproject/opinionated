We DIRECT the Cass County Prosecuting Attorney to answer the application\n   for leave to appeal within 28 days after the date of this order. Specifically, the prosecutor shall address: (1) whether the rape-shield statute, MCL 750.520j, barred evidence of the complainant's sexual activity with two classmates when offered as proof of an alternative cause of the possible scarring observed by the sexual assault nurse examiner, see\n   <em>\n    People v.
