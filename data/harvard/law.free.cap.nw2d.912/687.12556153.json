J.T. was not home at the time. Rogers first entered J.T.'s house around 7:30 p.m. J.T.'s neighbor, G.B., saw Rogers kick the back door of J.T.'s house open. G.B. told her husband, D.B., what she had seen, and D.B. told G.B. to call the police and report the break-in. Several minutes later, G.B. saw Rogers leave J.T.'s house and carry a flat-screen television down the alley. Approximately five minutes later, G.B. saw Rogers walk back down the alley towards J.T.'s house accompanied by a juvenile who was wearing red shorts. Rogers entered J.T.'s house while the juvenile waited outside. Rogers came out of the house several minutes later and carried a second television away. Several minutes later, Rogers and the juvenile returned. D.B. saw Rogers enter and exit J.T.'s house one last time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly after Rogers left J.T.'s house for the third time, police arrived at the scene. Officer Tracy Boulton saw two males who matched a description that G.B. had provided walking northbound away from J.T.'s house. Boulton got out of her squad car and saw Rogers drop what she thought was a gun. She alerted her partner, Officer Bryce Turner, and she drew her Taser. The officers commanded Rogers and the juvenile to get on the ground. Rogers dropped a plastic bag filled with stolen property. The officers arrested Rogers and the juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Turner searched Rogers incident to arrest and found two television remote controls. The officers also recovered the item that Officer Boulton saw Rogers drop. It turned out to be an unloaded Daisy PowerLine Model 340 BB gun. G.B. and D.B. each identified Rogers, during separate show-up identifications, as the individual who had entered J.T.'s house. The officers transported Rogers to the Stearns County Jail. During the drive, Rogers told the officers that the gun that he dropped \"was a plastic BB gun but it didn't have any BBs in it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that night, J.T. learned of the burglary and returned home. The lock on her back door had been broken, and many of the rooms in her house were in disarray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.T. told Officer Rachel Johnson that she was missing two flat-screen televisions, as well as several other items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The on-call investigator, Officer Dwayne Bergsnev, received information that Rogers had gone to a nearby house before reentering J.T.'s house during the course of the burglary. Bergsnev obtained a warrant to search that house. A resident of the house told Bergsnev that Rogers was staying in the basement. During the search, Bergsnev found several items in the basement that J.T. had reported as stolen, including the two flat-screen televisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state charged Rogers with one count of first-degree burglary and one count of second-degree burglary. Before trial, Rogers conceded that he had committed second-degree burglary, but he maintained that he was not guilty of first-degree burglary because he did not possess either a dangerous weapon or an article fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a dangerous weapon as required under the charging statute. Rogers waived his right to a jury trial, and the case was tried to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court found Rogers guilty of first- and second-degree burglary. The district court concluded that Rogers possessed the BB gun when entering or while in J.T.'s house but that it was not a dangerous weapon. However, the district court concluded that the BB gun was an article fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a dangerous weapon because it looked like a real gun and did not have any of the identifying markers of a BB gun, such as an orange cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court entered judgments of conviction on both the first- and second-degree burglary counts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced Rogers on the first-degree burglary offense. Rogers moved for a dispositional and durational departure. The district court denied Rogers's request for a dispositional departure but granted his request for a durational departure, finding that \"there [were] substantial and compelling reasons that this [crime was] less serious than typical.\" The district court sentenced Rogers to serve 36 months in prison, instead of 50-69 months, which was the presumptive sentencing range. Rogers appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.

The phrase does not set forth those requirements. In fact, the phrase does not refer to the presence of the victim. However, subparagraphs (a) and (c) of the same subdivision expressly refer to the presence of another person within or around the burglarized building.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.582\">\n    Minn.

The absence of language referring to the presence of another person in or around the burglarized building in subparagraph (b), similar to the language in subparagraphs (a) and (c), refutes Rogers's argument that the relevant phrase plainly means that the burglary victim must be present during the burglary to observe the article fashioned as a dangerous weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seagate Tech., LLC v.

In other words, the relevant phrase does not require the burglary victim to observe the article fashioned as a dangerous weapon and to subjectively conclude that it is a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, Rogers's proposed plain-language interpretation of the relevant phrase does not find support in the words within the phrase or in the surrounding text. The phrase does not state the requirements that Rogers reads into it: that the burglary victim must be present during the burglary, observe the article fashioned as a dangerous weapon, and subjectively conclude that it is a dangerous weapon. We therefore reject Rogers's proposed plain-language interpretation of the phrase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We now turn to the state's proposed interpretation. The state contends, \"By its plain terms, the statute prohibits non-consensual entry while possessing a particular type of object; namely, an object fashioned to lead the victim to reasonably believe it is a dangerous weapon.\" The state argues that the plain meaning of \"fashioned\" is \"[t]o give shape or form to; make.\" The state argues that it is not necessary that the article be \"used\" in a manner suggesting it is a dangerous weapon \"because the statute expressly provides that the article can be 'used\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   fashioned' in such a manner.\" The state concludes that \"possession of the fashioned article during a burglary is sufficient to constitute first-degree burglary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The state's interpretation of the relevant phrase is consistent with its plain wording, the surrounding text, and the common and approved usage of the word \"reasonable.\" Once again, the express language of the phrase does not require the victim to be present, to observe the article, and to subjectively conclude that it is a dangerous weapon. It simply describes the necessary quality or appearance of the article that\n   the burglar must possess. We therefore hold that the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.582\">\n    Minn.

It is sufficient that the article's appearance supports an objective belief that it is a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A dangerous weapon is defined as \"any firearm ... or any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or great bodily harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn.

Rogers kicked open the back door to J.T.'s residence and remained in the residence for about five minutes before leaving with a flat-screen television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2. About ten minutes later, Rogers reentered the residence through the back door and again emerged after about five to ten minutes carrying a different flat-screen television. At this point, a juvenile accomplice was with Rogers and stood outside of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   3. Rogers returned to the scene and reentered the house for a third time before exiting a few minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   4. Police arrived as Rogers and his juvenile accomplice walked away from J.T.'s residence for the third time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   5. Officer Boulton saw Rogers drop what she believed to be a handgun as they were approaching Rogers and his juvenile accomplice. Officers placed both Rogers and the accomplice under arrest and determined the gun that Rogers dropped was actually a BB gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   6. On his way to jail, Rogers accurately told Officers Boulton and Turner that the gun he dropped was actually an unloaded BB gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The circumstances proved are consistent with guilt. Rogers argues that the circumstances proved are also consistent with the rational hypothesis that he did not possess the BB gun until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he left J.T.'s house for the third time. His theory is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Rogers, having already been to the house and knowing it was unoccupied, had no need for the BB gun. A lookout, however, may have wanted the BB gun lest the occupants return. When [Rogers and the juvenile accomplice] left the third time, the juvenile walked away first. He dropped something by the garage as he passed by. Rogers then followed behind him. Neither G.B. nor D.B. had an unbroken view of the two before they were arrested: both lost sight of them at some point. Rogers then dropped the BB gun as Officer Boulton got out of the squad car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rogers hypothesizes that \"[t]he juvenile had the gun while serving as lookout and then dropped it by the garage. Rogers picked it up while G.B. and D.B. lost sight of him.\" He asserts that \"[t]his theory is based on evidence in the record.\" We disagree. There is no evidence in the record that anyone other than Rogers possessed the BB gun, much less the juvenile. Although G.B. mentioned on direct examination that she noticed the juvenile drop something by the garage, she also testified that she watched Rogers stand by the back door of the victim's house and then walk \"kitty-corner right, and [then] north\" into the alley. G.B. then watched Rogers and the juvenile walk down the alley immediately before their arrest, which would have been away from the item that the juvenile dropped. G.B. did not report seeing the juvenile hand anything to Rogers or seeing Rogers bend down and pick something up. Moreover, Officer Boulton testified that Rogers talked about the BB gun \"as if it was his gun.\" And Rogers's remark that the BB gun did not contain\n   any BBs suggests that he possessed the BB gun for a longer period of time, and not merely immediately before he was apprehended by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because Rogers's hypothesis of innocence lacks evidentiary support and seems unreasonable, we reject it as being based on mere conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish that Rogers possessed the Daisy PowerLine Model 340 BB gun when entering or at any time while in J.T.'s house. The evidence was also sufficient to establish that the BB gun was fashioned in a manner to support an objective belief that it was a dangerous weapon. Because the evidence was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Rogers was guilty of first-degree burglary, we do not disturb his first-degree burglary conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Because the issue is not raised in this appeal, we do not consider whether entry of judgments of conviction on both offenses violated\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.04\">\n     Minn.
