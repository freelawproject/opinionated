D.J. pushed appellant out and locked the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   About 10:30 that morning, D.J. and appellant met on the street. D.J. told appellant not to wake him in the middle of the night and to stay away from D.J.'s house. Appellant opened his coat and showed D.J. a firearm in his waistband; D.J. observed black tape wrapped around the firearm. Appellant told D.J. that he \"would shoot anyone that stood in his way\" and that he \"meant business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   D.J. was aware that appellant was prohibited from possessing a firearm and reported appellant's possession of a firearm to a sheriff's deputy. The deputy, knowing appellant lived with his mother about two blocks from the location of his encounter with D.J., went to her house with another officer. When they knocked, appellant opened the door, but slammed it shut after he was informed that he was under arrest. The officers forced the door open and entered the house, where they saw appellant\n   lying face down in the living room and his mother sitting in a chair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A search of appellant revealed a glass pipe with burnt white residue, later determined to be methamphetamine, in his shirt pocket. Appellant's mother permitted a search of the house, which produced a loaded, sawed-off shotgun partially wrapped with black tape; a note stating, \"150 owed 1 p.m.,\" and a backpack containing a bottle with white sludge that was later determined to the basis of a mixture of a total weight of 25 grams or more containing methamphetamine, a bottle of Draino, batteries, a funnel, and a recipe listing the ingredients and giving directions for making methamphetamine. The officers evacuated the residence, suspecting it was a clandestine methamphetamine lab and therefore dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

Did the district court abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence a copy of appellant's Facebook page, offered to establish his residence in his mother's house?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. Did the district court err in imposing multiple sentences?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IV.

Therefore, to receive a new trial on the basis of erroneous jury instructions, appellant must demonstrate that there was an error, that the error was plain, and that it was reasonably likely that the instruction had a significant effect on the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant argues that this omission entitles him to a reversal of his conviction and a new trial on possession of substances with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While we agree with appellant that it was plain error for the district court to depart from CRIMJIG 20.64 by not instructing the jury that two of the items found in the backpack were on the statutory list of chemical reagents or precursors, we do not agree that his conviction should be reversed. A new trial on the basis of an erroneous jury instruction is warranted only if it is reasonably likely that the given instruction had a significant effect on the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872387\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/864/171/#p178\">\n    864 N.W.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it is not reasonably likely that the omission of the instruction had a significant effect, or indeed any effect, on the jury's verdict. The jury convicted appellant of possession of chemical reagents or precursors with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine having heard testimony that the backpack contained a recipe, ingredients, and equipment for making methamphetamine. The fact that the jury was not told specifically that two of the items in the backpack were on the statutory list of prohibited items made appellant's conviction less likely, not more likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We affirm appellant's conviction for possession of chemical reagents or precursors with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

An investigator then testified that appellant's Facebook page described appellant as \"Mr. Sandstone\" and indicated that he lived in Sandstone. The investigator offered a copy of the Facebook page and was questioned about it.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q.

The name \"Rambo\" apparently referred to a movie character ... known for being aggressively violent, including towards authority.... [A]fter jurors viewed the photograph [of the man on the copy of the Facebook page] they likely felt little doubt that appellant was guilty of doing exactly what he was accused of-possessing a short-barreled shotgun and drugs, and being involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To show prejudice that would entitle him to a new trial, appellant must prove that the copy \"significantly affected the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury had heard testimony that appellant was seen with a firearm in his waistband and that a methamphetamine pipe was found in his pocket. The copy was admitted only as evidence that appellant resided at his mother's Sandstone address, not as evidence of any of the criminal offenses with which he was charged. Even if the district court had abused its discretion in admitting the copy of appellant's Facebook page, the admission did not significantly affect the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When the facts are not in dispute, the decision whether multiple offenses are part of a single behavioral incident presents a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070809\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/808/586/#p590\">\n    808 N.W.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590 (Minn. 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellant argues that, because all five offenses were part of a single incident, his sentence to 129 months in prison for second-degree controlled-substance crime-\n   possession of a mixture of a total weight of 25 grams or more containing methamphetamine precludes his sentences for possession of chemicals or reagents with intent to manufacture methamphetamine (48 months in prison), for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime-possession of a mixture containing a controlled substance (17 months in prison, stayed, and discharge from probation), for possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime of violence (60 months in prison), and for possession of a short-barreled shotgun (60 months in prison).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Respondent agrees, as do we, that the sentence for possession of chemical reagents or precursors with intent to manufacture methamphetamine was precluded by appellant's sentence for second-degree controlled-substance crime-possession of a mixture of a total weight of 25 grams or more containing methamphetamine, because both offenses were part of the same incident. We also agree with appellant that the sentence for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime is precluded. Both that offense and the second-degree controlled-substance offense resulted from appellant's possession of methamphetamine: presumed current possession in the case of the second-degree offense and past possession in the case of the fifth-degree offense. Appellant was charged with, convicted of, and sentenced for only the possession of methamphetamine, not for its sale or manufacture. His personal possession and use of methamphetamine was a single criminal objective. \"[W]hether the segment of conduct involved was motivated by an effort to obtain a single criminal objective\" is a consideration in determining whether segments of conduct were part of the same behavioral incident.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We reverse appellant's sentences for possession of chemicals or reagents with intent to manufacture methamphetamine and for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime and remand for the district court to vacate those sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But we agree with the district court that (1) the second-degree controlled-substance crime sentence does not preclude either or both of the firearm sentences and (2) neither of those sentences precludes the other. \"[W]hether all of the acts performed were necessary to or incidental to the commission of a single crime\" is another consideration in determining whether offenses are part of the same behavioral incident.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bakken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6788486\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/883/264/#p271\">\n    883 N.W.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (Minn. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Possession of a firearm-any firearm-is not necessary to commit the crime of possessing methamphetamine and therefore is not part of the same behavioral incident.

But the officers were aware that appellant had a firearm and was fleeing them, and their concern about protecting human life justified their entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, appellant was a suspect, and the officers who knocked at the door were in \"hot pursuit\" of appellant when he retreated into the house and slammed the door. \"[T]he doctrine of hot pursuit applies whether police officers engage in a high-speed chase of the suspect ... or merely approach a suspect who immediately retreats into a house....\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We reverse appellant's sentences for possession of chemicals or reagents with intent to manufacture methamphetamine and for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime on the ground that they\n   are precluded by his sentence for second-degree controlled-substance crime and remand for the district court to vacate those sentences; we affirm his sentences for second-degree controlled-substance crime, for being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm, and for possession of a short-barreled shotgun on the ground that none of those sentences precludes either or both of the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Appellant also argues that \"there was no testimony or evidence establishing that the images on the 'Facebook' page are those of appellant ... [or] that appellant placed the images on the page ...[or] created the 'Facebook' page.\" There is no indication in the record that appellant previously raised this argument. Therefore, it is not properly before the court, and we do not address it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roby v.

He relies on the\n    <em>\n     Salyers\n    </em>\n    holding that the district court erred in sentencing the defendant for possessing a short-barreled shotgun in addition to sentencing him for both possession by an ineligible person and possession of a shotgun with an obliterated serial number because the defendant's gun \"just happens to have reflected both illegal characteristics at once.\"\n    <em>\n     Salyers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7249926\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/842/28/#p37\">\n     842 N.W.2d at 37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The two illegalities in the same gun were part of a single incident.
