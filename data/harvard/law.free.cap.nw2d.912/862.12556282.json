Because the trial court erred by concluding that Kelsey was a trespasser as a matter of law and dismissing plaintiffs' dog-bite claims on this basis, we reverse the trial court's grant of summary disposition to Lint and remand for further proceedings. In addition, because the trial court failed to determine whether Lint's attorney conducted a reasonable inquiry into the facts that formed the basis for the documents he signed under MCR 2.114(D), we vacate the trial court's denial of plaintiffs' request for sanctions and remand for specific findings on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 31, 2013, Kelsey was bitten by Lint's dog while on Lint's property. Kelsey had attended a garage sale at Lint's house on August 30, 2013. She returned to Lint's property about 5:00 p.m. on August 31, 2013, after the sale had ended, to inquire about an item that had been for sale the previous day. When Kelsey exited\n   her vehicle, Lint's dog ran at Kelsey from the back of the house and bit Kelsey's leg. Following this incident, plaintiffs filed the current lawsuit alleging (1) a statutory dog-bite claim under MCL 287.351, (2) a common-law dog-bite claim premised on the assertion that Lint knew of the dog's violent propensities and acted negligently by failing to properly control the dog, and (3) a claim for loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lint moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), asserting that plaintiffs' dog-bite claims must fail because, when Kelsey returned to the property after the yard sale ended, she was a trespasser on Lint's property. Lint contended that, as a trespasser, Kelsey was not lawfully on the property for purposes of MCL 287.351. Likewise, for purposes of Kelsey's common-law dog-bite claim, Lint maintained that her only obligation to a trespasser was to refrain from willful and wanton misconduct and that her ownership of a dog with no history of biting did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs opposed Lint's motion for summary disposition, arguing that Kelsey was a licensee because, like the general public, Kelsey had an implied license to enter Lint's property and approach the house to knock on the front door. In opposing Lint's motion for summary disposition, plaintiffs also sought sanctions under\n   MCR 2.114(E). Plaintiffs presented a recorded statement in which Lint admitted that her dog had previously bitten a mailman. On the basis of this statement, plaintiffs asserted that they were entitled to sanctions under MCR 2.114(E) because Lint or Lint's attorney signed documents that were not well grounded in fact insofar as the documents indicated that Lint had no knowledge of her dog biting anyone before Kelsey.\n   Following a hearing, the trial court granted summary disposition to Lint. The trial court reasoned that Kelsey was an invitee when she attended Lint's garage sale, but the trial court concluded as a matter of law that Kelsey was a trespasser when she returned to Lint's property after the sale. In light of the trial court's conclusion that Kelsey was a trespasser, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs' statutory and common-law dog-bite claims. The trial court also denied plaintiffs' request for sanctions under MCR 2.114(E). Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied. Plaintiffs now appeal as of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. KELSEY'S STATUS ON LINT'S PROPERTY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs first argue that the trial court erred by dismissing their statutory and common-law dog-bite claims on the basis that Kelsey was trespassing. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that everyone, including Kelsey, has an implied license to enter property and knock on the front door. According to plaintiffs, in the absence of a fence or \"no trespassing\" signs, Lint acquiesced in the general public's customary use of property. While there was a \"no soliciting\" sign on Lint's door, plaintiffs maintain that this does not render Kelsey a trespasser because she was not soliciting and, in any event, the dog attacked Kelsey before she had an opportunity to observe the sign. With regard to the garage sale, plaintiffs argue that the sale did not alter the general implied license that exists to enter property. Plaintiffs contend that, if anything, Lint's practices showed that she had acquiesced in allowing people to return to her property after a garage sale to take a second look at items. In these circumstances, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that Kelsey was a trespasser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"This Court reviews a trial court's decision on a motion for summary disposition de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

This\n   implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave.

The record also indicates that when approaching Lint's house from the street, there were no signs prohibiting entry or stating \"no trespassing.\" Instead, an individual approaching Lint's home found an open, ungated driveway devoid of signs prohibiting entry.

Posting a notice may serve to prevent the creation of an implied license. See Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 330, comment e, pp. 173-174. However, whether signs posted on property revoke the public's implied license to approach the house and knock depends on the context in which a member of the public would have encountered the signs and the message that those signs would have conveyed to an objective member of the public under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Viewing the evidence in this case in a light most favorable to Kelsey, it could be\n   concluded that the location of the \"no soliciting\" sign was such that someone would have to drive down Lint's driveway to her house and approach the door before realizing that soliciting was not allowed. Further, \"no soliciting\" is not synonymous with \"no trespassing\" or \"do not enter\" and therefore reasonable minds could conclude that a small \"no soliciting\" sign on a door to the garage would not prevent Kelsey from driving up Lint's driveway and exiting her vehicle.

In these circumstances, even if Kelsey's proposed inquiry could be considered \"soliciting,\" given Kelsey's assertion that she was bitten as soon as she exited her vehicle, before she approached Lint's door or had a chance to speak with Lint, reasonable minds could conclude that she was still within the scope of the public's implied license when she exited her vehicle and was attacked by Lint's dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The only other fact presented by the parties as bearing on Kelsey's status is the garage sale held by Lint on the weekend of Kelsey's visit. Lint argues, and the trial court concluded, that because the sale had\n   ended, Kelsey was a trespasser when she returned. However, this reasoning ignores the public's implied license to enter the property and approach the door. That is, as noted by the trial court, when inviting the general public to her property for a sale, it could be concluded that Lint welcomed those individuals as invitees and, when the sale ended, it could be concluded\n   that Kelsey lost her invitee status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the end of a garage sale-and the loss of invitee status-did not eliminate the implied license that normally exists. In other words, while heightened invitee status may have existed during the sale, the end of the sale returned things to their normal state, which typically includes an implied license for anyone to enter the property and knock on the door.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p8\">\n    569 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p8\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Frederick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20228\">\n    500 Mich. at 234-235, 238-239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20N.W.2d%20541\">\n    895 N.W.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Overall, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Kelsey, while Kelsey did not have Lint's express permission to return to the property, it could be inferred that Kelsey had an implied license to enter the property and to approach Lint's house.

Kelsey testified that on a previous occasion she had returned to Lint's property for a second look at an item after a sale. And Lint confirmed that it was not uncommon for people to return to her property in the day or two following a garage sale. She stated that she preferred for people to call first but conceded that they did not always do so. Faced with this practice, Lint made no effort-such as posting signs-to prevent people from returning. Therefore, notwithstanding her \"no soliciting\" sign and the end of the garage sale, it reasonably could be concluded that Lint had acquiesced in a practice of allowing people to return to her property following a garage sale to take a second look at items.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Having concluded that Kelsey's status is an issue for the jury,\n    <em>\n     Pippin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"233546\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/245/136/#p142\">\n     245 Mich.

In other words, in light of Lint's \"bad memory,\" a reasonable inquiry might include obtaining and listening to a statement made by Lint relatively close in time to the dog-bite incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
