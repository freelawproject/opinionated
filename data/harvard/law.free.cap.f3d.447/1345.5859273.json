The district court enhanced Defendant\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) after determining that Defendant\u2019s prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), constituted a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Defendant appeals this sentencing enhancement. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">Defendant was convicted in 1995 of possession of an unregistered rifle with a seven-inch barrel in violation of the National Firearms Act (NFA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). The-facts surrounding that conviction are set out in this court\u2019s opinion affirming Defendant\u2019s 1995 conviction. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>103 F.3d 953 (11th Cir.1997). Briefly stated, Defendant\u2019s possession was in the context of his part-time employment at a consignment shop. Defendant offered to sell an undercover ATF agent an unregistered Uzi carbine with, among other things, two barrels, one of which was seven inches.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">In 2004, Defendant was indicted for the instant offense of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Under the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) provides a base offense level of 20 for firearms possession by a convicted felon if the prior felony was for a \u201ccrime of violence;\u201d otherwise, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) provides a base offense level of 14. Concluding that Defendant\u2019s 1995 NFA conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 2K2.1(a)(4), the sentencing court set Defendant\u2019s base offense level at 20. Defendant objected to treatment of his NFA offense as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines and review the underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Hasner, </em>340 F.3d 1261, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). The commentary to section 2K2.1 defines the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) includes within the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d certain named offenses and unspecified offenses that \u201cotherwise involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">No binding precedent in this Circuit has determined that possession of an unregistered firearm is a crime of violence for purposes of applying the section 2K2.1 enhancement. <em>See United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1348 n. 4 (11th Cir.2002). But as we observed in <em>Miles, id., </em>other courts have concluded that a section 5861 conviction qualifies as a crime of violence for sentence enhancement purposes. <em>See United States v. Dwyer, </em>245 F.3d 1168, 1172 (10th Cir.2001) (prior conviction for possession of unregistered firearm in violation of NFA is crime of violence as defined by section 4B1.2); <em>United States v. Rivas-Palacios, </em>244 F.3d 396, 397-98 (5th Cir.2001) (prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm is a crime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16); <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>946 F.2d 615, 621 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Cir.1991) (possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of the NFA is crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330, 334-35 (4th Cir.2001) (prior conviction for possession of sawed-off shotgun is crime of violence for purposes of career offender enhancement); <em>United States v. Brazeau, </em>237 F.3d 842, 845 (7th Cir.2001) (prior conviction for possession of sawed-off shotgun is crime of violence under section 4B1.2); <em>United States v. Allegree, </em>175 F.3d 648, 651 (8th Cir.1999) (same); <em>United States v. Fortes, </em>141 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1998)(prior conviction for NFA offense qualified as a violent felony for purposes of career offender enhancement). Congress determined that the unregistered possession of the particular firearms regulated under the NFA should be outlawed because of \u201cthe virtual inevitability that such possession will result in violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>195 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir.1999). We agree with our sister circuits that the possession of certain kinds of weapons categorically presents the potential risk of physical injury warranting sentence enhancement for being a crime of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Defendant argues that even if an NFA offense is deemed a crime of violence, possession of an unregistered firearm can support no more than a rebuttable presumption of violence for purposes of applying the sentence enhancement. According to Defendant, the sentencing court should be allowed to consider evidence that a particular defendant\u2019s possession was not dangerous. Citing <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936 (11th Cir.1995), Defendant alternatively argues that, even if the circumstances of the predicate conviction may not be considered generally, the sentencing court should at least look to the charging documents to determine if the description of the defendant\u2019s acts charged in the indictment sets out a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">The elements of Defendant\u2019s prior conviction \u2014 the possession of an unregistered weapon with knowledge of the properties that bring the weapon within section 5845\u2019s definition of firearm \u2014 satisfy the sentencing court\u2019s enhancement inquiry. Defendant misreads <em>Spell </em>when he argues that <em>Spell </em>allows the sentencing court to look behind the fact of conviction when conducting its section 4B1.2 crime-of-violence inquiry. <em>Spell </em>provided that a \u201cdistrict court only may inquire into the conduct surrounding a conviction if ambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the fact of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. As we have said, the <em>Spell </em>exception to a categorical approach is narrow and limited: a district court may inquire into additional facts only if the judgment of conviction is ambiguous on its face. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1248 (11th Cir.2006). Defendant points to no ambiguity in his judgment of conviction; <em>Spell\u2019s </em>limited exception has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">Defendant\u2019s last argument is that the sentencing court misapprehended its authority post <em>-Booker, United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to impose a sentence below the guidelines range. A fair reading of the record shows that the sentencing court appreciated fully its authority to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>pose a sentence outside the guidelines; it exercised its discretion not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AbC\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">. The NFA includes within its definition of firearms a rifle having a barrel of less than 16 inches. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">. Since Defendant's 1995 conviction, Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 was amended to exclude from the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon unless the possession was of an unregistered firearm under the NFA. The 2004 amendment provided expressly that \"[Unlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (e.ga sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a 'crime of violence.' \u201d U.S.S.G. Appendix C, amendment 674.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">. We have concluded that possession of a concealed weapon constitutes a crime of violence as defined by section 4B 1.2(a)(2) for purposes of applying a career offender enhancement. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998). The concealment offense \u2014 like the possession of an unregistered weapon offense \u2014 includes no use of force element. The possession of a concealed weapon and the possession of an unregistered weapon each constitutes conduct beyond mere possession of a weapon and each poses \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
