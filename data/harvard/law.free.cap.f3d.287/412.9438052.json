(Brister\u2019s), thereby making North Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>can solely responsible for providing defense and coverage to Brister\u2019s in the underlying suit. The facts of this case, as set forth in the district court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which we append hereto, are undisputed, leaving us with only a question of state law, to wit, whether Louisiana\u2019s waiver doctrine precludes North American\u2019s denial of coverage to Brister\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We have thoroughly reviewed the facts and applicable law as reflected in the appellate briefs of the parties, the record on appeal, and the district court\u2019s comprehensive opinion. Our review satisfies us that the district court correctly decided this case. Rather than waste judicial resources by writing a separate opinion, which would be essentially duplicative of the work of the district court, we express our full agreement with that court\u2019s reason and disposition of the case. We therefore adopt the district court\u2019s opinion in full, incorporate it herewith, append it hereto, and affirm the judgment. Any remaining claims by Brister\u2019s against either American Dynasty Surplus Lines Insurance Company or Palomar Insurance Corporation are dismissed as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT .,</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">NORTH AMERICAN CAPACITY INS.

Co. (\u201cNorth American\u201d) filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that they are not liable to provide insurance coverage to Brister\u2019s Thunder Karts, Inc. (\u201cBrister\u2019s\u201d). On September 5, 2000, Bris-ter\u2019s filed a third-party complaint against Great American Ins. Co., doing business as American Dynasty (\u201cGreat American\u201d), and Palomar Ins. Co. (\u201cPalomar\u201d). Bris-ter\u2019s seeks to hold Great American liable to provide insurance coverage. Palomar was dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on June 8, 2001. This case came on for trial without a jury on July 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The Court, having carefully considered the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions, together with affidavits, and pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby enters the following findings of fact and conclusions of law. To the extent that any findings of fact constitute a conclusion of law, the Court hereby adopts it as such, and to the extent that any conclusions of law constitute a finding of fact, the Court hereby adopts it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">North American Capacity Insurance Company is a New Hampshire corporation with its principal place of business in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Brister\u2019s Thunder Karts, Inc. is a Louisiana corporation with its principal place in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Great American Insurance Company, doing business as American Dynasty Surplus Lines, Inc., is a foreign corporation with its principal place of business outside Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Palomar Insurance Company is an Alabama corporation doing business in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Defendant Brister\u2019s entered into an insurance contract agreement with plaintiff North American to purchase a \u201cclaims-made\u201d policy (the \u201cNorth American Policy\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The North American Policy covered Brister\u2019s from October 12, 1995 to October 12,1996. Before it expired, the policy was cancelled by Brister\u2019s effective on July 29, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">Upon cancellation, Brister\u2019s entered into a new insurance contract with Great American, to purchase a \u201cclaims-made\u201d policy (the \u201cGreat American Original Policy\u201d). The effective coverage period for the Great American Original Policy was between July 29, 1996 and July 29, 1997. Prior to the expiration of the Great American Original Policy, Great American issued a renewal policy to extend coverage from July 29, 1997 through July 29, 1998 (the \u201cGreat American Renewal Policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">Brister\u2019s sought performance of its insurance coverage after being sued in state court by Rolland and Sue LeBlanc (the \u201cLeBlanc Lawsuit\u201d) for facial injuries suffered by their daughter while she was riding in a Brister\u2019s go-cart. The alleged facial injury occurred on May 17,1996, and Brister\u2019s was served with and received notice of the LeBlanc Lawsuit complaint on August 19,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-22\">(8)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">On August 20, 1997, Brister\u2019s sent the petition to its insurance broker, Palomar. On August 21, 1997, Palomar acknowledged receipt of the claim by facsimile. Palomar also attached a copy of the loss notice that it had sent to North American on August 20,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">(9)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-25\">Upon receiving the loss notice from Palomar, North American proceeded to appoint counsel to defend Brister\u2019s in the LeBlanc Lawsuit on August 25, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>addition, Brister\u2019s paid $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees as required by the deductible of the North American Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">(10)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">North American seeks a declaratory judgment declaring that they are not liable to provide Brister\u2019s with insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Venue is appropriate for this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">North American asserts that it did not waive its right to a coverage defense by appointing counsel to defend Brister\u2019s claim asserted after the coverage period had expired. In support of its position, North American cites <em>Tate v. Charles Aguillard Ins. &amp; Real Estate, Inc., </em>508 So.2d 1371, 1374 (La.1987), for the proposition that an insurer does not waive the coverage conditions of the insurance policy by its conduct or actions. Moreover, North American explains that waiver cannot be used to extend insurance coverage to a risk not properly within the limits of the policy as written. <em>See Tate, </em>508 So.2d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">North American\u2019s reliance on <em>Tate </em>is ill founded. In <em>Tate, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthere is no fundamental difference between conditions which have been classified as going to coverage and those classed as furnishing a ground for forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Louisiana Supreme Court held \u201cthat waiver may apply to <em>any </em>provision of an insurance contract under which the insurer knowingly and voluntarily elects to relinquish his right, power or privilege to avoid liability, <em>even though the effect may bring within coverage risks originally excluded or not covered.\u201d Id. </em>at 1375 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-19\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">The Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Steptore v. Masco Construction Co., Inc., </em>643 So.2d 1213 (La.1994), reaffirmed the <em>Tate </em>principle in a suit almost factually identical to the present case. In <em>Steptore, </em>the court considered whether a liability insurer who knew of facts indicating that it had the right to deny coverage waived its coverage defense by undertaking the insured\u2019s defense without obtaining a nonwaiver agreement to reserve its rights. <em>See Steptore, </em>643 So.2d at 1213. At the time of the event giving rise to the claim, the facts of the case clearly indicated that insurer had knowledge that insured was in breach which was sufficient for insurer to deny coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 1215-1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-22\">Like the insurer in <em>Steptore, </em>North American knew that it had received notice of Brister\u2019s claim more than a year after the coverage had lapsed. In <em>Steptore, </em>the insurer did not deny coverage or enter into an agreement reserving the right to deny coverage until six months after it appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ed counsel to undertake insured\u2019s defense. <em>See id. </em>at 1215. North American did not obtain a nonwaiver agreement reserving its right to deny coverage, and unlike the <em>Steptore </em>insurer, it waited three years to deny coverage for the first time. Because North American assumed Brister\u2019s defense without reserving its rights or otherwise protecting its interests, it waived any coverage defense it may have had under its policy with Brister\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">North American assumed and continued the defense of the insured in the face of facts indicating that it had a right to deny coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 1216 (stating that an insurer is charged with knowledge of the contents of its own policy). Furthermore, North American did not obtain a nonwaiver agreement to reserve its right to deny coverage. <em>See Peavey Co. v. M/V ANPA, </em>971 F.2d 1168, 1175 (5th Cir.1992) (stating that an insurer must obtain a nonwaiver agreement to reserve its rights when a conflict of interests arises and the insurer has knowledge of facts indicating noncov-erage). As a result, the Court finds that North American waived any coverage defense it may have had under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">(8)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">North American shoulders all liability in this case because the escape clause of the Great American Policy and the pro rata clause of the North American Policy are both given effect and control. <em>See Citgo Petroleum Corp., v. Yeargin, Inc., </em>690 So.2d 154, 167 (La.App. 3 Cir.1997) (stating that conflicting \u201cescape\u201d and \u201cpro rata\u201d clauses are not mutually repugnant and thus are given effect). Great American concedes that at the time the claim was made to Brister\u2019s its policy was in force and effect. However, the Great American Policy contains an \u201cescape clause\u201d which denies coverage to an insured who is covered by the terms of another insurance policy. In this case, the \u201cother insurance policy available to the insured\u201d referenced in Great American\u2019s escape clause is the North American Policy because North American insured Brister\u2019s and waived its coverage defense. The North American Policy also contains a \u201cpro rata clause\u201d that allocates the share of the liability equally or according to the terms of the policies. Therefore, Great American escapes coverage by operation of its escape clause and pro rata clause because Bris-ter\u2019s is covered by the North American Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">On the basis of the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court finds that plaintiff North American waived its coverage defense. Consequently, North American is liable to provide insurance coverage to Brister\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">This is the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">New Orleans, Louisiana</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\">. Palomar, the insurance brokerage firm that forwarded the claim against Brister\u2019s to North American, submitted a brief urging af-firmance of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Palomar from the suit. Brister\u2019s did not appeal this issue in its opening brief and thus we need not consider it. In any case, affirmance <em>vel non </em>of the Fed.RXiv.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of Palomar vis-\u00e1-vis Bris-ter\u2019s is mooted by our conclusion that North American waived its right to deny coverage to Brister\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\">.
