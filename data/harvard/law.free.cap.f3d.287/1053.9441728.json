Phillips (\u201cPhillips\u201d) appeals his sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; bank robbery with the use of a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113; and possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). Phillips argues that the district court erred by (1) increasing his base offense level pursuant to the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, and (2) increasing his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for his role as a leader or organizer of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-21\">We review for plain error Phillips\u2019s argument based on the district court\u2019s application of the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement, which he raises for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999) (reviewing challenge to sentencing enhancement for plain error where defendant failed to object to district court\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>ings of fact and sentencing calculations); see <em>also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 730-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-77, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We will correct plain error only where (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding. <em>See United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">A district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level due to his status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error. <em>See United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Upon thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The facts relevant to Phillips\u2019s sentencing issues are straightforward. A jury convicted Phillips of conspiracy to commit robbery, bank robbery with the use of a dangerous weapon, and possession of an unregistered firearm. Prior to trial, Phillips\u2019s co-defendants, Jeanette Booth Phillips (\u201cJeanette Phillips\u201d) and Ricky Stripling (\u201cStripling\u201d), pled guilty as charged and agreed to testify at trial for the government. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) provided that Phillips and his co-defendants participated in an armed bank robbery yielding $43,503.63. On November 6, 1992, Jeanette Phillips and Stripling entered the Traders and Farmers Bank in rural Arley, Alabama<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at approximately 11:00 a.m. Both Jeanette Phillips and Stripling were wearing ski masks, camouflage clothing, and latex gloves. They ordered the bank tellers to fill two gym bags with money and directed the other bank employees to lie on the floor. Jeanette Phillips brandished a .38 caliber revolver and Stripling carried a sawed-off shotgun. They told the bank personnel that they had a police scanner, and that if they heard police coming they would kill everyone in the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">During the robbery, Phillips waited in the get-away car and monitored a police scanner. Phillips was armed with a .357 caliber pistol, a .44 caliber pistol, and a .30 caliber carbine assault rife. At trial, Stripling testified that Phillips first suggested the idea of a bank robbery. Phillips had worked in law enforcement since 1977, and was the former Chief of Police in the nearby town of Parrish, Alabama. Phillips indicated to Stripling that he was familiar with the police situation in Arley, which had, according to Phillips, only one officer who worked mostly at night. Stripling and Jeanette Phillips both stated that Phillips selected Traders and Farmers Bank in Arley because it was located in a small town with little police presence. Phillips also provided the guns for the heist. Jeanette Phillips testified that Gary Phillips agreed to \u201ctake care of all the details,\u201d purchased the ski masks and gym bags for use in the robbery, and gave her a gun and showed her how to use it. Phillips indicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>ed to Stripling that he had found the \u201cperfect\u201d bank: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bitty town and real simple. It\u2019s easy. Taking candy from a baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Phillips testified in his own defense. He admitted his planning role, which had been described by his co-defendants, and that he was responsible for purchasing and programming the police scanner, as well as buying the ski masks and gym bags. Phillips described how he had practiced the escape route by going inside of the bank to \u201ccheck it out.\u201d Phillips contended, however, that he had a last minute change of heart and did not accompany his co-defendants to the bank oh November 6, 1992. Plainly, the jury disbelieved him, entering convictions on three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Based on these facts, the PSI assessed Phillips a two-level upward adjustment pursuant to the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d guide-fine, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1. The PSI also recommended a two-level upward adjustment for Phillips\u2019s role as an organizer or leader, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), noting Phillips\u2019s higher educational level than his co-defendants, his selection of the target bank, his role in planning the robbery, and the statements from his co-defendants identifying him as the leader of the scheme. Over Phillips\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement, the district court sentenced Phillips to a 151-month term of imprisonment for the robbery conviction, a 60-month term of imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction, and a 10-year term for the possession of a firearm conviction, with all sentences to run concurrently. Notably, Phillips did not object to the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d guideline enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Phillips did not timely file a direct appeal of his conviction or sentence, but subsequently filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, seeking leave to file an out-of-time appeal based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, who did not file a direct appeal from Phillips\u2019s conviction and sentence. The district court granted Phillips leave to file an out-of-time appeal based on the fact that the court did not advise Phillips at sentencing of his right to appeal <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">On appeal in <em>Phillips I, </em>we dismissed Phillips\u2019s case as untimely and set forth a procedure for district courts to follow when granting an out-of-time appeal, noting that Phillips could file a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) motion to relieve him from the operation of that part of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 2255 order which put forward the wrong remedy for his out-of-time appeal. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.2000). Phillips then filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, which the district court granted. On March 27, 2001, the district court again adopted the PSI\u2019s findings and recommendation, and re-sentenced Phillips to the same sentence imposed in 1993 after the sentencing hearing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Phillips challenges his sentence on two grounds: (1) the application of the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d two-level enhancement, and (2) the application of the two-level enhancement based on his leadership role in the offense. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Phillips first argues that the district court erred by applying the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancer after finding that the bank tellers were vulnerable victims under \u00a7 3Al.l(b). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level increase if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b). The applicability of the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement must be determined on a case-by-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>case basis, and is appropriate where the defendant knows that the victim has \u201cunique characteristics\u201d that make the victim more vulnerable to the crime than other potential victims of the crime. <em>See United States v. Malone, </em>78 F.3d 518, 521 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">In this analysis, the focus is on the defendant\u2019s perception of the victim\u2019s vulnerability to the offense. <em>See United States v. Page, </em>69 F.3d 482, 488 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Long, </em>935 F.2d 1207, 1211 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he applicability of section 3A1.1 turns on the defendant\u2019s decision to target the victim.\u201d). \u201c[T]o determine whether defendants have targeted \u2018vulnerable victims,\u2019 we look to the facts known to defendants when they decided to target the victims.\u201d <em>Page, </em>69 F.3d at 489 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Phillips asserts that the PSI\u2019s citation to <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that bank tellers are vulnerable victims because they are likely targets of criminal conduct), requires reversal because it was overruled by <em>United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1138 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding that a bank teller is not automatically vulnerable by virtue of his or her position as a teller). We disagree. In <em>Morrill, </em>we held that bank tellers, as a <em>class, </em>are not per se vulnerable victims, within the meaning of \u00a7 3A1.1 because \u201c[blank tellers are typical victims of bank robberies.\u201d 984 F.2d at 1138. Rather, the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement applies \u201cwhen a particular teller-victim possesses unique characteristics which make him or her more vulnerable or susceptible to robbery than ordinary bank robbery victims and thus make the particular bank robber more culpable than the ordinary perpetrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Phillips\u2019s argument, however, we did not conclude in <em>Morrill </em>that bank tellers may never be vulnerable victims for purposes of the \u00a7 3A1.1 enhancement. Indeed, such \u201c[s]weeping presumptions are not favored by section 3A1.1\u201d since \u201cthe inquiry conducted by a sentencing judge to determine the applicability of section 3A1.1 is ... highly case-specific.\u201d <em>Long, </em>935 F.2d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">In <em>United States v. Segien, </em>986 F.2d 439, 440-41 (11th Cir.1993), which was decided one month after Phillips\u2019s sentencing, we held that \u201cin sentencing a bank robber, the trial court should make a fact-specific determination of what factors, if any, distinguish the teller-victim from ordinary bank tellers and how, if at all, the defendant targeted that teller based on the factors.\u201d In this case, the record contains an abundance of evidence to support application of the enhancer, including: (1) Stripling\u2019s and Jeanette Phillips\u2019s testimonies that Phillips (a former Police Chief in a nearby town) selected the Traders and Farmers Bank in rural Alabama precisely because of the size of the town and its reduced police presence; (2) Phillips\u2019s perception of the bank as \u201cperfect\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s [in] a little bitty town and real simple. It\u2019s easy. Taking candy from a baby\u201d; and (3) the probation officer found, and the district court adopted the finding, that Phillips selected \u201ca rural bank to rob at a time when he knew police would not be in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Focusing on Phillips\u2019s intent, as we must in evaluating the \u00a7 3A1.1 enhancement, we cannot find any error, let alone plain error, in the district court\u2019s application of the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement based on its conclusion that these bank tellers were \u201cvulnerable victims,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3A1.1. While \u201ca bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of the teller\u2019s position in a bank,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment, (n. 2), the tellers in this case had the additional \u201cunique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>characteristics,\u201d as perceived by Phillips, of being located in a remote location with little or no police protection. <em>Cf. Malone, </em>78 F.3d at 523 (approving imposition of vulnerable victim enhancement appropriate in car-jacking case where defendant targeted a cab driver knowing that the cab driver had the unique obligation to drive to an isolated pick-up point of the car-jacker\u2019s choice and then let him into the cab). The evidence was plainly sufficient to support the district court\u2019s sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\"> We are likewise unpersuaded by Phillips\u2019s argument that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence as an organizer or leader. If a defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the criminal activity, his offense level may be increased by two. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 620, 151 L.Ed.2d 542 (2001). In distinguishing a leadership role, the district court should consider \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">In this case, there was abundant evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Phillips was an organizer and leader of the bank robbery, including: (1) both co-defendants testified that Phillips did most of the planning and preparation for the bank robbery, including selecting the bank; (2) Stripling testified that Phillips first suggested the idea of a bank robbery, selected the bank because it was located in a small town with little police presence, and provided the guns; (3) Jeanette Phillips testified that Gary Phillips agreed to \u201ctake care of all the details,\u201d purchased the ski masks and bags for use in the robbery, and gave her a gun and showed her how to use it; (4) Phillips himself testified that he purchased the police scanner and the guns for use in the robbery and helped draw a diagram of the bank; and (5) during the robbery, Phillips waited in the get-away car and monitored the police scanner while his two co-defendants committed the robbery. On this record, we can find no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Phillips organized, led, managed or supervised one or more other participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">.
