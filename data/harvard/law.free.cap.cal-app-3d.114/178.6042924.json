Code, \u00a7 187) with use of a gun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) of her husband, Louis Schindler.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On March 5, 1978, defendant (aged 51) fatally shot her husband who, 11 years before, had shot and killed his previous wife, June.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Though defendant did not remember firing the single shot, it was undisputed that she committed the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The defense introduced extensive evidence to show that defendant was suffering from diminished capacity and acted in self-defense. Numerous witnesses, including the decedent\u2019s daughter (defendant\u2019s stepdaughter) testified that defendant was a passive, gentle, dependent, severely depressed woman who was afraid of her domineering, explosive, irrationally hostile husband. During the last two years of their seven-year marriage, she had suffered severe weight loss and depression, becoming increasingly withdrawn, nervous and frightened of him. He sometimes slept with a knife under his pillow, enjoyed frightening her, and boasted in her presence about killing June and getting away with it because of his wealth. Defendant indicated to others that she was afraid to leave him because he had killed June when June was in the process of divorcing him. She testified that on the night of March 5, she was sitting on a chair next to the bed when Louis got into bed. He was in a surly mood. He then turned towards her with \u201ca maniacal look on his face,\u201d and said in a very quiet, very low voice: \u201cWhat happened to June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>is going to happen to you. I know what I have to do.\u201d Her next memory was being in jail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">It was the opinion of Dr. Rose, a psychiatrist who testified for the defense, that at the time of the shooting, defendant was severely mentally incapacitated and was unable to form the intent to kill, premeditate, deliberate or harbor malice. She was in an extreme \u201cstate of panic,\u201d triggered by decedent\u2019s specific threat to kill her which she took very literally, was in mortal terror of her life, became totally irrational and lost control of her behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In rebuttal, the prosecution called another psychiatrist, Dr. Mark-man. It was his opinion that defendant had an active physical fear of her husband and that the act of shooting him was inconsistent with her personality, but at the time she shot him, she was not legally insane, could form the intent to kill and could harbor malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On rebuttal, the People also attempted to counter the defense of diminished capacity by introducing evidence of a jail house in-custody interview conducted by Officer Osti a few hours after the homicide wherein defendant was advised of and exercised her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Over defense objection, the court ruled that such evidence was admissible to show \u201cher state of mind.\u201d After relating his advisement of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, Osti then gave the following testimony with respect to defendant\u2019s responses and his opinion as an expert of her mental state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201cA. [by Officer Osti]: I asked her if she understood the rights I had explained to her and she said, \u2018Yes, but I don\u2019t want to make any statement until I have talked with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201cQ. [By Mr. Wells, the prosecutor]: Did you quit questioning her or asking her anything at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cQ. And in that conversation with her, did she appear to you that she did understand those rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cQ. Did she appear to you to understand you when you were talking to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cQ. Did she appear to be in a daze or a panic state or anything like that that you could describe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">\u201cA. She was a little teary-eyed, but other than that, she seemed to understand what I was saying, appeared lucid to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u201cQ. Do you have any reason to believe in the responses she gave you that she didn\u2019t understand what you were saying to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">\u201cA. No, not at all. As far as I considered, she understood well what I was saying.\u201d The officer further testified that he overheard defendant ask her friend who had come to the police station to see if she could get Mr. Geragos for her defense attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">In argument to the jury, the prosecutor stressed the invocation of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, as follows: \u201cWhat does she tell Osti? Osti gets up here on the witness stand. He advised her of her rights under <em>Miranda. </em>\u2018You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to the presence of an attorney. If you can\u2019t afford one, we will appoint one for you. Do you understand your rights?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">\u201c\u2018Yes, I understand my rights. I don\u2019t want to talk to you. I want a lawyer.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">\u201cThat is a panic state? It is a turn-off, turn-on panic state, yes. Selective amnesia, that is the word I like to use for it, because that is the only viable defense she has got. She has got a man she has shot in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>back of the head and the only defense that she could viably place in front of you is the fact that she did it when she didn\u2019t know what she was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u201cShe has enough presence of mind right after that when she is at the police station when Osti walks in there and questions her, she wants to see a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The prosecutor further stressed her selection of that particular lawyer, Mr. Geragos: \u201cWhy do you think she asked for Mr. Geragos? Because Mr. Geragos had prosecuted Lou Schindler in one of those past cases. She knows what she wants.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u201cPanic state?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u201cTen years from now, how many people are going to know who the prosecutor of this case was? Here is a woman that knew nothing about the death of June or anything else and she is in a panic state. She is asking for Paul Geragos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Defense counsel Geragos immediately moved for a mistrial. The prosecutor claimed that it was already in the record through the People\u2019s rebuttal witness, Garfield,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Geragos had been the prosecutor. Geragos pointed out that he had \u201cdenied it.\u201d The court denied the motion for mistrial, indicating that it agreed with the prosecutor that it was relevant impeachment, and suggesting that defense counsel could comment on it if he chose. In his argument, defense counsel did argue that he was not an issue in the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Then, in his final summation to the jury, the prosecutor again stressed defendant\u2019s selection of Geragos to show defendant\u2019s guilt, stating: \u201cThe reason for bringing that statement in about Mr. Geragos is twofold: One, here is a woman that said she didn\u2019t know any of the circumstances about the death of Lou Schindler\u2019s previous wife, who just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>got smatters and pieces from people as she went along and who evidently somewhere along the line picked up the idea that Paul Geragos was the prosecuting attorney against Mr. Lou Schindler. Here is a woman who is in a panic state and within this panic state, she has a miraculous ability, this selective amnesia, to turn it off, reach down to the depths of her mind and pull out one attorney and of all of the attorneys in the world she felt could best give her representation that night\u2014we are talking about the night of the killing\u2014and that is Mr. Geragos. Where do you think she pulled that name from? Out of a hat?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u201c.... And this was a few hours after the commission of the act, the act for which she was in a panic state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">After deliberating about 22 hours, the jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Defendant contends that: (1) her constitutional rights against self-incrimination were violated by use of her responses asserting her <em>Miranda </em>rights to rebut her defense of diminished capacity; (2) her right to counsel was impaired by the use of her particular choice of counsel for impeachment in argument, and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of second degree murder. The People controvert these contentions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and against self-incrimination were violated by the admission in evidence (and use in argument) of her responses asserting her <em>Miranda </em>rights for the purpose of rebutting her diminished capacity defense. Further, exploitation of her choice of counsel for impeachment and rebuttal of her defense impaired her constitutional right to counsel and constituted prosecutorial misconduct. These errors were prejudicial. Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment. However, since the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, defendant can be retried for second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\n<em>Defendant's Rights to Due Process and Against Self-Incrimination Were Violated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The use of defendant\u2019s exercise of her <em>Miranda </em>rights to prove her guilt violated her rights to due process and against self-incrimination. The People claim that Officer Osti\u2019s testimony that she responded that she did not want to make a statement until she talked with an attorney, as well as his opinion that she understood her rights, was properly admitted to rebut her diminished capacity defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 468, footnote 37 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 720, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], the United States Supreme Court noted: \u201c[I]t is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or <em>claimed his privilege </em>in the face of accusation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">More recently, in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 96 S.Ct. 2240], that court has held that the use, for impeachment purposes, of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest and after the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process. The court stated <em>(id., </em>at p. 618 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 422]): \u201c[W]hile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 171 [45 L.Ed.2d 99, 95 S.Ct. 2133]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Galloway </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 551 [160 Cal.Rptr. 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Such fundamental unfairness occurred here. The prosecution not only impermissibly introduced evidence concerning defendant\u2019s exercise of her right but also affirmatively used this evidence in argument to convey the impression that her defense of a \u201cpanic state\u201d was fabricated. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Galloway, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Moreover, the fact that the evidence was introduced to rebut a diminished capacity defense did not render it proper. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rucker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 368 [162 Cal.Rptr. 13, 605 P.2d 843], in an analogous situation, our Supreme Court held that the admission of evidence of interviews between a defendant and law enforcement officers (conducted without <em>Miranda </em>safeguards), which was offered to rebut a defense of diminished capacity, violated the privilege against self-incrimination (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) and the principles first enunciated in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436. The court stressed that \u201cthe exclusionary rules relating to <em>Miranda </em>and to the privilege apply <em>regardless of the purpose for which the response is sought to be admitted or the timing of its admission. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Disbrow, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 101 [127 Cal.Rptr. 360, 545 P.2d 272] [impeachment evidence on rebuttal]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 448 [105 Cal.Rptr. 672] [testimony of a psychiatrist, based on illegal interrogation, inadmissible on rebuttal to attack diminished capacity defense].)\u201d (26 Cal.3d at p. 391.) (Italics added.) Indeed, in the course of its opinion, the <em>Rucker </em>court specifically observed that the use of a defendant\u2019s responses invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights brought to the jury\u2019s attention \u201cpatently incriminatory and prejudicial material.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Right to Counsel Was Violated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) was violated by the use of her choice of defense attorney to impeach her and rebut her defense of diminished capacity. As our California Supreme Court pointed out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Holland </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 77, 86 [151 Cal.Rptr. 625, 588 P.2d 765]: \u201cThe constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel is \u2018among the most sacred and sensitive of our civil rights.\u2019 <em>(Magee </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 949, 954 [106 Cal.Rptr. 647, 506 P.2d 1023].) That right is \u2018broader than... the bare right to legal representation... \u2019 and <em>encompasses the right to retain counsel of one\u2019s own choosing. (People </em>v. <em>Byoune </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 345, 348 [54 Cal.Rptr. 749, 420 P.2d 221]; accord <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Fretag </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 3, 9 [99 L.Ed. 4, 9-10, 75 S.Ct. 1]; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 45, 53 [77 L.Ed. 158, 162-163, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 430, 438 [38 Cal.Rptr. 884, 392 P.2d 964].)\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], the United States Supreme Court held that prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify violated the Fifth Amendment because it was tantamount to \u201ca penalty imposed by the courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 614 [14 L.Ed.2d at pp. 109-110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The penalty analysis employed in <em>Griffin </em>is equally applicable to the constitutional right to counsel. We agree with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Macon </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(3d Cir. 1973) 476 F.2d 613, 615, which stated: \u201cFor the purpose of the \u2018penalty\u2019 analysis, ... we perceive little, if any, valid distinction between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. It can be argued, with equal vigor and logical support, as to either...situation.. .that a prosecutor\u2019s comment seeking to raise in the jurors\u2019 minds an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected conduct constitutes a \u2018penalty\u2019 on the free exercise of a constitutional right. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Macon, </em>the prosecutor in his summation to the jury commented upon the fact that the defendant called an attorney the morning after the alleged crime and argued that this action cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s claim that the shooting was an accident. The <em>Macon </em>court held this to be reversible constitutional error, interpreting <em>Griffin </em>as an absolute prohibition against the imposition of any penalty for the exercise of a constitutional right in a criminal law context. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 615-616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Several states have also generally held that a prosecutor cannot properly imply guilt from a defendant\u2019s request for counsel. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1975) 33 Ill.App.3d 857 [338 N.E.2d 414, 417-418]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyseth </em>(Iowa 1976) [240 N.W.2d 671, 674]; <em>Mays </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tenn. Crim. 1972) 495 S.W.2d 833, 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(D.C.Cir. 1977) 556 F.2d 65, 67, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pointed out that \u201c[testimony about the desire or requ\u00e9st for a lawyer is impermissible.\u201d The court noted that a prosecutor is constitutionally precluded from eliciting testimony of a defendant\u2019s action in hiring an attorney in view of the tendency of such testimony to serve as the base for an inference of guilt based on such an act. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Earlier, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liddy </em>(D.C.Cir. 1974) 509 F.2d 428, that same court indicated that the <em>Griffin </em>principle prohibits drawing ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>verse inferences from not only the fact of hiring an attorney but also the time and circumstances of retaining an attorney. The court specifically warned of the \u201cmischief of the approach\u201d that allows time and circumstances to be taken into account because it \u201craises problems that hobble the right to seek counsel,\u201d inviting \u201cprobing of the very process of selection of counsel\u2014who, why, when and where....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 444.) As the <em>Liddy </em>court observed <em>(ibid.): </em>\u201cIt would be a rare case indeed where the prosecutor could not point out that the incriminating feature of the employment of counsel... rests not in the employment as such but in the time and circumstances surrounding that event, and inferences therefrom that reflect adversely on the defendant. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gold </em>(N.D.Ill. 1979) 470 F.Supp. 1336, the federal district court held that it was improper for prosecutors by questions and comments to draw adverse and incriminatory inferences from a corporation\u2019s employment during administrative proceedings and investigation of a particular law firm which had a nationwide reputation as criminal defense lawyers. The court stated <em>(id., </em>at p. 1352): \u201cIt is not to be doubted that [the corporation] had the constitutional right to employ counsel of its choice in the administrative proceedings, and certainly to be advised with regard to the criminal investigation.... It is improper, where a right is constitutional, for a prosecutor either to question or comment on its exercise. [Citation.] To do so is to make assertion of the right costly. [Citations.] For this reason, in a criminal law context, it is basically unfair for a prosecutor to urge against a person the time and circumstances of his retention of an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Defendant had the constitutional right promptly to retain the counsel of her choice who would most effectively defend her. That right was wrongfully impaired. No prosecution testimony should have been admitted regarding her desire to hire any attorney, especially this particular defense attorney, or the defense attorney\u2019s prior role as a prosecutor of the decedent. Moreover, defendant clearly was impermissibly penalized for exercising her constitutional right to counsel by the prosecutor\u2019s flagrantly improper argument that the time and circumstances surrounding her selection of this particular defense counsel, who had prosecuted her husband, impeached her testimony and showed she was guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\n<em>The Errors Were Prejudicial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The improper exploitation of defendant\u2019s exercise of her constitutional rights to remain silent and to retain the counsel of her choice cannot be deemed harmless error under either the standard stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243], or the higher standard specified in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]. The only issue at trial was defendant\u2019s intent and mental capacity at the time of the commission of the offense. The defense evidence was substantial. The rebuttal evidence directly attacked her defense, and the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the evidence showed she was fabricating her \u201cpanic\u201d state was most prejudicial. Furthermore, the fact that the jury deliberated 22 hours before reaching a verdict underscores the closeness of the case and the crucial nature of the constitutional violations. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 391.) The judgment of conviction, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<em>The Evidence Is Sufficient to Support the Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">From our review of the entire record, we are satisfied that there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of second degree murder.  (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   The necessary element of malice for second degree murder is implied from proof that the defendant assaulted the victim with a deadly weapon in a . manner endangering life and resulting in death in the absence of justifying or mitigating circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lines </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 500, 506 [119 Cal.Rptr. 225, 531 P.2d 793].) Here, the undisputed evidence showed that defendant shot the victim once in the head. The psychiatric testimony was conflicting; the prosecution\u2019s psychiatrist (Markman) gave his expert opinion that defendant could harbor malice and was not suffering from diminished capacity. Moreover, the ultimate conclusion as to whether defendant had diminished capacity was a jury decision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 233, 249 [162 Cal.Rptr. 1, 605 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>830].) Similarly, whether self-defense was established was a question of fact for the jury to determine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Germany </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 414, 421 [116 Cal.Rptr. 841].) Accordingly, our reversal of the judgment does not preclude a retrial of defendant for second degree murder. (Cf. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1, 11 [57 L.Ed.2d 1, 9-10, 98 S.Ct. 2141]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Belton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 516, 527 [153 Cal.Rptr. 195, 591 P.2d 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Cobey, J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 5, 1981. Rattigan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> participated therein. Mosk, J., and Richardson, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The decedent, Louis, had fired the gun at June seven times; five bullets hit her, some in the back. He was twice convicted by juries (the first time for second degree murder; the second time for voluntary manslaughter), but the convictions were reversed on appeal. Then, pursuant to a plea bargain, he pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was released on probation without further incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In her interview with the defense psychiatrist, defendant recalled that after her husband\u2019s statement she had become terrified, was in a panic, and he was lying down on the bed and pulling the covers over him angrily. She assumed she must have gotten up arid got the gun. Her stepdaughter testified to being awakened by the defendant who was shaking, crying, very upset, and said, \u201cI think I have done a terrible thing.\u201d The police, the ambulance and friends were called. Defendant told a friend over the phone, \u201cI think I just shot Lou\u201d and told the police when they came, \u201cI shot him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">During Geragos\u2019 cross-examination of Garfield on an unrelated issue, Garfield volunteered the nonresponsive assertion, \u201cYou represented the People of the State of California in the three murders\u2014in the homicide trials.\u201d Geragos had immediately responded, \u201cI am sorry. I differ with you on that. Be that as it may, you are not asking the questions here. I am.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The court had also agreed that it would instruct the jury that counsel was not an issue in the case. However, there is no record in the clerk\u2019s or reporter\u2019s transcripts of such an instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Since we must reverse because of violations of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, we need not reach her other contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Defendant raised this contention in the context of a request that we modify the verdict pursuant to Penal Code section 1181, subdivision 6, to reduce it to manslaughter. The test of an appellate court\u2019s power to modify or set aside the verdict is whether there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 761 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
