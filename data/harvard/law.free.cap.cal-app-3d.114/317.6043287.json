The ordinance was enacted pursuant to Government Code section 65970 et seq. and both parties agree that it is in compliance therewith. The Pacific Legal Foundation has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiff. The City of Walnut Creek has filed an amicus brief in support of defendant with which 49 cities or school districts have joined. (Hereafter we refer jointly to plaintiff and their amicus as plaintiff subdivider and refer to defendant and their amici as defendant city.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Plaintiff subdivider contended that ordinance No. 1781 violates section 4 of article XIII A of the California Constitution and as such constitutes an illegal tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The trial court found the ordinance was enacted pursuant to state law and was a valid exercise of the police power. Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendant city. Plaintiff subdivider appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In 1976 the League of California Cities, the County Supervisors Association and the California School Board Association joined forces to develop specific legislation clearly authorizing the imposition of fees, charges, land acquisition, etc., by local government units for ultimate use by the school districts in alleviating the impact of rapid student population growth. This effort was successful with the passage of Senate Bill No. 201 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65970 et seq.) in September of 1977. Senate Bill No. 201 is set forth in its entirety in appendix A to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">On June 6, 1978, the voters of this state, added article XIII A to the California Constitution. Section 4 of this article reads as follows: \u201cSec. 4. Cities, counties and special districts, by a two-thirds vote of the qualified electors of such district, may impose special taxes on such dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>trict, except ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property within such City, County or special district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">On November 6, 1979, the defendant city enacted ordinance No. 1781<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to Government Code section 65970 et seq. The ordinance requires real property developers either to pay fees or dedicate land to local school districts to relieve conditions of overcrowding caused by such development as a precondition to issuance of a building permit. Ordinance No. 1781 is set forth in its entirety in appendix B to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Whether the school facilities fees and in lieu dedication requirements imposed pursuant to ordinance No. 1781 of the City of Oxnard are a \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The plaintiff subdivider asks this court to hold that ordinance No. 1781 is a \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4 and as such requires two-thirds voter approval for imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Government Code section 65970 et seq. were enacted by the California Legislature in 1977 as a means of alleviating overcrowding of local school facilities caused by new residential development. Ordinance No. 1781 was adopted pursuant to the provisions of that enabling legislation (appen. B, \u00a7 27-77.2 of the ordinance). It is clear that ordinance No. 1781 was enacted and operates under the authority of Government Code, section 65970 et seq. Therefore, we confine our discussion to the latter code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Government Code section 65970 reads: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares as follows: \u201c(a) Adequate school facilities should be available for <em>children residing in new residential developments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u201c(b) Public and private <em>residential developments may require the expansion of existing public schools </em>or the construction of new school facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u201c(c) In many areas of the state, the <em>funds for the construction of new classroom facilities are not available when new development occurs, </em>resulting in the overcrowding of existing schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201c(d) <em>New housing developments frequently cause conditions of overcrowding </em>in existing school facilities which cannot be alleviated under existing law within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u201c(e) That, for these reasons, <em>new and improved methods of financing for interim school facilities necessitated by new development are needed </em>in California.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">It is not disputed by either party that subdivision (e) of Government Code section 65970 spells out in clear unambiguous language that the purpose of the legislation is to provide a method of financing for interim school facilities necessitated by new development.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Plaintiff subdivider argues that the fees imposed under Government Code section 65974 constitute a \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of section 4 of article XIII A because (a) a \u201cspecial tax\u201d is one collected and earmarked for a special purpose, (b) a \u201cspecial tax\u201d includes new or increased exactions imposed by a city for revenue purposes and (c) the exaction is not a \u201cspecial assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">In <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 231 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281] the court upheld the validity of article XIII A against constitutional challenge. The court stated \u201c... article XIII A consists of four major elements, a real property <em>tax rate </em>limitation (\u00a7 1), a real property <em>assessment </em>limitation (\u00a7 2), a restriction on <em>state </em>taxes (\u00a73), and a restriction on <em>local </em>taxes (\u00a7 4). Although petitioners insist that these four features constitute separate <em>subjects, </em>we find that each of them is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>reasonably interrelated and interdependent, forming an interlocking, \u2018package\u2019 deemed necessary by the initiative\u2019s framers to assure effective real property tax relief. Since the total real property tax is a function of both rate and assessment, sections 1 and 2 unite to assure that <em>both </em>variables in the property tax equation are subject to control. Moreover, since any tax savings resulting from the operation of sections 1 and 2 could be withdrawn or depleted by additional or increased state or local levies of other than property taxes, section 3 and 4 combine to place restrictions upon the imposition of such taxes. Although sections 3 and 4 do not pertain solely to the matter of <em>property </em>taxation, both sections, in combination with sections 1 and 2, are reasonably germane, and functionally related, to the general subject of property tax relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The court in <em>Amador </em>made a very limited inquiry and concluded at page 224 that \u201c[art. XIII A] is limited to the single subject of taxation (with particular emphasis upon real property taxation).\u201d It did not define \u201cspecial taxes\u201d as used in section 4, article XIII A.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The plaintiff subdivider argues that the term \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of section 4, article XIII A has now been defined by the Court of Appeal in <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 974 at page 983 [156 Cal.Rptr. 777]: \u201cA \u2018special tax\u2019 is a tax collected and earmarked for a special purpose, rather than being deposited in a general fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A reading of <em>Malmstrom </em>leads us to conclude that the court did not define the term \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of section 4, article XIII A. It was merely illustrating one of the reasons why the special assessments in question would not be affected by article XIII A, i.e., that they were not taxes at all, special or otherwise. If the above definition of \u201cspecial taxes\u201d were valid, it could easily be avoided by depositing the exactions in the general fund. We know of no case that has defined the term \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The plaintiff subdivider asserts that the exaction in this case is not a \u201cspecial assessment,\u201d again relying on <em>Malmstrom </em>which held that special assessments pursuant to the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913 and the Improvement Act of 1911 were not within the definition of \u201cspecial taxes\u201d of that section (\u00a74, art. XIII A). Defendant city does not contend the exaction here in question is a special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The plaintiff subdivider next asserts that Government Code section 65970 et seq. are new or increased exactions for revenue purposes. He asks that we adopt the broad definition of \u201cspecial taxes\u201d opined by the Attorney General in 62 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 673 (1979): \u201c\u2018[S]pecial tax\u2019 [as used in \u00a7 4, art. XIII A] means any new or additional tax imposed for revenue purposes by one of the enumerated agencies ....\u201d In 62 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 254 (1979) the Attorney General opined that the fees imposed under Government Code section 65974 constitute \u201cspecial taxes\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A. A reading of the Attorney General\u2019s opinions lead us to conclude that the definition is overly broad. It fails to consider the regulatory nature of fees, upon whom the fee is imposed and the purpose of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In <em>City of Glendale </em>v. <em>Trondsen </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 93 [308 P.2d 1] the court held that a charge upon every occupied premise in the city for rubbish collection services whether or not such services were in fact utilized was valid <em>either </em>as a police power measure or as an excise tax on the privilege of accumulating rubbish and having available a collection service. The court also held that the charges were not \u201cspecial taxes\u201d prohibited by the city charter without a two-thirds vote since the term \u201cspecial taxes\u201d related only to property taxes. Other cases in which revenues and charges were not deemed to be taxes are: <em>Arcade County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Arcade Fire Dist. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 232 [85 Cal.Rptr. 737] (monthly fire hydrant charges); <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>E. I. Wood Lumber Co. </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 16 [292 P. 1076, 80 A.L.R. 379] (wharfage and dockage charges); <em>Tulare County </em>v. <em>City of Dinuba </em>(1922) 188 Cal. 664 [206 P. 983] (franchise payments); <em>Trumbo </em>v. <em>Crestline Lake Arrowhead Water Agency </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 320 [58 Cal.Rptr. 538] (standby water charges). None of these cases supports the Attorney General\u2019s definition of special tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>at pages 980-981, the court concluded: \u201c... a major thrust of article XIII A is aimed at controlling ad valorem property taxes.... Thus, section 1 limits the ad valorem tax rate to a maximum of 1 percent of market value; section 2 sets the 1975-1976 tax year as a \u2018base\u2019 for assessed value and limits further increases to 2 percent per year; section 3 provides that the Legislature may not impose new ad valorem taxes on real property; and section 4 provides that cities, counties and special districts may not impose new ad valorem property taxes.\u201d This conclusion is consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the <em>Amador </em>case, <em>supra, </em>which states that the purpose of article XIII A was \u201cto assure effective real property tax relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The exaction imposed under Government Code section 65970 et seq. is not an ad valorem property tax. It is not imposed upon the land in the subdivision as such but is imposed on the privilege of subdividing land which causes the overcrowding of local school facilities. Thus, as we shall explain, if the exaction is a tax, it is not a \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The police power is the inherent reserved power of the state to subject individual rights to reasonable regulations for the general welfare. (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) p. 3734.)  One of the most common subjects of local police power regulations and that involved in this case is the area of land use and development. (See Witkin, <em>supra, </em>p. 3742.) The rationale for such regulations is summarized in Longtin, California Land Use Regulations (1977) page 617, as follows: \u201cThere is probably no issue in subdivision law which has generated more controversy than that of required dedications, improvements, fees, and other exactions as a condition of subdivision approval. The concept is quite simple in theory. The subdivider, in return for the privilege of developing his land, is required to dedicate land to public use, make public improvements, or pay required fees, all needed to mitigate the adverse impact of the subdivision on the community, provide governmental services to subdivision residents, and implement the requirements of the local general plan. The position of the public entity is that this arrangement is only fair. The developer has created a new, and cumulatively overwhelming, burden on local government facilities, and therefore he should offset the additional responsibilities required of the public agency by the dedication of land, construction of improvements, or payment of fees, all needed to provide improvements and services required by the new development.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In <em>Associated Home Builders etc. Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 633 [94 Cal.Rptr. 630, 484 P.2d 606, 43 A.L.R.3d 847], the Supreme Court upheld the parkland dedication requirements of the Subdivision Map Act, section 66477 (Quimby Act). A reading of Government Code section 66477 and its comparison with Government Code section 65974 shows that the school facilities section was modeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>after parkland dedication. A comparative summary of the significant provisions of both acts is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">School Facilities (\u00a7 65974) Quimby Act (\u00a7 66477)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">City may by ordinance require dedication of land or payment of fees for classroom facilities as condition to approval of residential development, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">(a) General plan provides for location of schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">(b) Ordinance in effect 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">(c) Land or fees to be used only for interim school facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">(d) Land and fees shall bear reasonable relationship to need for schools caused by development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">(e) Finding of consistency with general plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">Only fees may be required for subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Section 65976.

This contention is negated by the case of <em>Builders Assn. of Santa Clara-Santa Cruz Counties </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 225. in that case the Supreme Court made reference to the <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Village of Menomonee Falls </em>case (1966) 28 Wis.2d 608 [137 N.W.2d 442]) which involved school dedication. Footnote 6 of <em>Builders </em>states: \u201cPlaintiffs suggest that the school district might require a property owner to dedicate land, construct improvements, or pay fees as a condition to certification. The imposition of such conditions, however, would not necessarily render the ordinance invalid, particularly if the conditions related to the need for increased facilities created by the zoning change. (See generally Feldman, <em>Constitutionality of Subdivision Exactions for Educational Purposes </em>(1972) 76 Dick.L.Rev. 651.) In <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Village of Menomonee Falls </em>(1966), 28 Wis.2d 608 [137 N.W.2d 442, 448-450], the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld an ordinance requiring dedication of land for school purposes, or payment of a fee in lieu of dedication, if the need for increased facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>was attributable to the developer\u2019s activities; we in turn relied on <em>Jordan </em>in <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 633, 644 [94 Cal.Rptr. 630, 484 P.2d 606], to uphold a statute requiring dedication of land for parks.\u201d (13 Cal.3d 225, at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The dedication of land or the payment of fees as a condition precedent to development is voluntary in nature. Even though the developer cannot legally develop without satisfying the condition precedent, he voluntarily decides whether to develop or not to develop. Development is a privilege not a right. In the <em>Walnut Creek </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at page 638 the court stated: \u201cWe held that the city was not acting in eminent domain but, rather, that a subdivider who was seeking to acquire the advantages of subdivision had the duty to comply with reasonable conditions for dedication so as to conform to the welfare of the lot owners and the general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">It is undisputed that a subdivider must pay for the streets, sewers, lights, and parks which are reasonable conditions for dedication so as to conform to the welfare of the lot owners and the general public. Surely, it cannot be argued that any of these requirements are more important to the welfare of the lot owners and the general public than the education of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We do not find it necessary in disposing of this case to define \u201cspecial taxes\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4. The exaction here in question is not an ad valorem property tax. Its imposition on the subdivider is consistent with the mandate of the voters and the <em>Amador </em>case, <em>supra, </em>\u201ceffective real property tax relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Kaus, P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 5, 1981, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 11, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>appendix a</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Senate Bill No. 201 CHAPTER 955</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">An act to add Chapter 4.7 (commencing with Section 65970) to Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, relating to land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">[Approved by Governor September 21, 1977.

Where a finding has been made by a school district that conditions of overcrowding exist, the city council or board of supervisors could not approve a proposed rezoning to, or granting of a permit for residential use, or approval of a tentative subdivision map unless such ordinance has been adopted or a finding is made of specified overriding factors.
