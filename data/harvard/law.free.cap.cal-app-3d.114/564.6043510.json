J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeI\">Landis Potter appeals a judgment dismissing his complaint for negligence against the City of Oceanside.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Potter\u2019s complaint alleges: Potter was operating a trenching machine which broke a natural gas line, causing gas to escape. Potter summoned help and employees of the city\u2019s fire department arrived. The fire captain negligently told Potter to start the trenching machine and move it from the area. When Potter started the machine, the escaping natural gas ignited and exploded, injuring Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The superior court sustained the city\u2019s demurrer to Potter\u2019s complaint on the ground the city is immune from liability under Government Code section 850.4. Potter did not amend within 30 days after the demurrer was sustained, and the court granted the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the action. Potter appeals the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Under Goverment Code section 850.4, a public entity is not liable for any injury caused in fighting fires.  To further the goal of compensating injured parties for damages caused by negligent acts, section 850.4 should be construed to bar governmental liability only where the Legislature has clearly intended immunity <em>(H &amp; M Associates </em>v. <em>City of El Centro </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 399, 406 [167 Cal.Rptr. 392]). The Legislature could have granted immunity to firemen \u201cacting in the scope of their employment\u201d or \u201cacting to prevent fires,\u201d but chose to bar liability only for injuries caused in \u201cfighting fires.\u201d  Here Potter does not allege the fire captain was fighting a fire when he told Potter to start the trenching machine; the alleged negligent act occurred before any fire started. In fact, Potter alleges the fire captain\u2019s negligence caused the escaping gas to ignite and explode. Potter\u2019s complaint as pleaded is not barred by Government Code section 850.4. The superior court erred in sustaining the city\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Staniforth, J., and Work, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 3, 1981, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 11, 1981. Newman, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
