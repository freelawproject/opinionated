J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzB\">Plaintiff Terry G. Holder appeals from the judgment dismissing his action against defendant California Paralyzed Veterans Association (hereinafter CPVA) after CPVA\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The first amended complaint (hereinafter complaint) sought damages for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress pursuant to an alleged conspiracy. Plaintiff\u2019s distress allegedly was caused by his expulsion from membership in the CPVA. According to the complaint, CPVA is an unincorporated association of which plaintiff was a member and was treasurer prior to his expulsion. The expulsion resulted from the purported trial of plaintiff \u201cbefore the general membership of the CPVA on charges of misappropriating funds from the CPVA, creating false expense reports, and defrauding the CPVA.\u201d Two specifications of the charges were set forth in the complaint as follows: \u201cSpecification 1. In that Terry G. Holder, contrary to the entrusted duties of the office of CPVA treasurer, did, on one August 1977, submit expenditures without explanation by Mr. Holder for mileage, meals and lodgings as indicated on CPVA invoice No. 758, in the total sum of. . .$412.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u201cSpecification 2. In that Mr. Terry G. Holder, contrary to budget procedures as stated in PVA[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and CPVA Administrative Guides and contrary to the entrusted duties of the office of CPVA treasurer, did, on 18 February 1977, approve without authority and without explanation, expenditures by Mr. Holder, Mr. Madsen, Mr. DeGeorge and Mr. Dwyer, expenses for entertainment as indicated on check No. 4929, in the total sum of.. .$1,219.04.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">According to the complaint, \u201cplaintiff was not afforded a fair trial\u201d on these charges because the procedure followed \u201cviolated plaintiff\u2019s basic and fundamental guarantees of procedural due process.\u201d The facts supporting these conclusions as detailed in the complaint were that pri- or to the date of the hearing, plaintiff was notified that he would be tried \u201con specification 1 only.\u201d Plaintiff employed counsel and assembled material to meet this charge, but \u201cimmediately prior to the beginning of said hearing,\u201d plaintiff was informed that defendant would proceed on specification 2. Other procedural deficiencies were detailed as follows: \u201cAt the beginning and during the aforesaid hearing defendants denied plaintiff his basic guarantees of procedural due process, which included, but is not limited to, the following: Defendants denied plaintiff the right to effective counsel after he had specifically requested that his counsel be present, and in addition, would not permit plaintiff to confer with counsel who was waiting outside the hearing chamber. Moreover, the purported \u2018trial\u2019 of plaintiff was not transcribed by a certified reporter, and more importantly, plaintiff was not given the opportunity to inspect and review documentary evidence introduced against him, but was instructed that copies would be provided \u2018later.\u2019 In addition, defendants would not permit witnesses to swear under oath that they were telling the truth and plaintiff was not permitted to conduct an effective voir dire of the members of the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The complaint further stated that \u201c[a]ll of the above malicious and unlawful acts committed by defendants were done with the knowledge that plaintiff was not guilty but... to insure a guilty finding and expel plaintiff from membership in the CPVA,\u201d and that \u201c[defendants\u2019 conduct was intentional and malicious and done for the purpose of causing plaintiff to suffer severe and extreme emotional and physical distress, humiliation and mental anguish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Defendant\u2019s demurrer attacked the sufficiency of the complaint on several grounds. The trial court, however, specifically limited its ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first ground which was that the action was premature because \u201ca tort action for damages arising out of a quasi-judicial proceeding must be preceded by a successful mandamus action overturning the decision of the quasi-judicial body.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In support of its claim that the action was premature, defendant asked the court to take judicial notice of the complaint in a prior proceeding brought by plaintiff against defendant in which plaintiff sought: (1) declaratory relief voiding (a) the \u201cPVA and CPVA administrative guides\u201d which plaintiff was charged with violating and (b) Roberts\u2019 Rules of Order as a procedure \u201cto discipline officers or members of a non-profit corporation,\u201d and (2) an injunction against continuing the investigation of plaintiff\u2019s alleged misconduct pursuant thereto. The court was furnished a copy of the complaint in the former action with its exhibits. This complaint detailed the appointment of a special investigating committee which filed lengthy reports charging violations of the procedures set forth in the administrative guides, including 19 specifications against plaintiff. Defendant also furnished the court a copy of a dismissal of the prior action which was filed after a preliminary injunction was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Also before the court was the original complaint in the within action. It was amended before a ruling upon defendant\u2019s earlier demurrer raising the same first ground. In the original complaint plaintiff alleged that: (1) \u201cdefendants, and each of them, purported to try plaintiff before the general membership of the CPVA without affording him a fair trial..(2) plaintiff \u201cevoked and exhausted all administrative remedies\u201d since \u201c[tjhere is no provision for appeal from the action of the association,\u201d and (3) \u201cdefendants, and each of them, had a legal duty to exercise due care to conduct CPVA administrative hearings in a manner that would not proximately cause any member in the CPVA or any member before the CPVA as an accused in an administrative or quasi-judicial hearing, humiliation, mental anguish and severe emotional and physical distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>During the argument on the demurrer, the court explored plaintiffs position with his counsel. This colloquy developed that though counsel was not saying that his \u201cclient didn\u2019t participate in a hearing,\u201d \u201cthis unfair hearing. .. amounts to no hearing at all.\u201d Noting that defendant was taking \u201cexception to the way the hearing was handled,\u201d the court sustained the demurrer without leave- to amend upon the ground that the action was premature under the rule stated by our Supreme Court in <em>Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410], and that plaintiff \u201cshould have brought a mandamus action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Plaintiff contends that his action is not rendered premature by <em>Westlake </em>because: (1) he has alleged ulterior motivation for the entire expulsion proceedings; (2) the procedure at defendant\u2019s expulsion \u201chearing\u201d was so lacking in fundamental due process that it fails to qualify as \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d procedure requiring review by mandamus; and (3) <em>Westlake </em>applies only to exclusions or dismissals by hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Defendant contends, to the contrary, that plaintiffs complaint is rendered premature by <em>Westlake </em>which also involved alleged intentional and malicious misuse of quasi-judicial procedures for ulterior purposes and a claim that such procedure did not comply with general principles of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The decision in <em>Westlake </em>is controlling and requires affirmance of the trial court judgment. In that case, Dr. Kaiman was plaintiff. She had suffered revocation of her staff privileges at Westlake Community Hospital and had failed to achieve staff status at another hospital (Los Robles Hospital), all allegedly pursuant to a conspiracy to intentionally and unlawfully interfere with her right to practice medicine, to restrain competition and to intentionally inflict emotional distress upon her. Like plaintiff herein, Kaiman \u201cdid not seek either reinstatement to staff privileges at Westlake or the admission to staff privileges at Los Robles.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Though both Westlake and Los Robles were named as defendants along with individual members of boards and committees, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Westlake defendants had appeared. Their motion for summary judgment was denied. The affidavits in behalf of the Westlake defendants showed that the revocation of Kaiman\u2019s staff privileges at Westlake came about as the result of the hospital\u2019s credentials committee recommending such revocation after which Dr. Kaiman was notified of the decision and of her right to request a hearing before a judicial review committee. Thereafter, a hearing took place which the court described as follows <em>(id., </em>at pp. 471-472): \u201cAt the hearing, counsel appeared and represented both the- executive committee of the hospital and Dr. Kaiman, both parties called witnesses and introduced documentary evidence, and the entire proceedings were transcribed by certified reporters; the hearing lasted approximately five hours. On March 20, 1974, the hospital informed Dr. Kaiman that the judicial review committee had determined that her staff privileges should be revoked, advising her of her right to appeal the decision to the hospital\u2019s board of directors at a meeting scheduled for that purpose on March 27, 1974. Dr. Kaiman appeared before the board of directors on March 27 and presented her objections to the decision of the judicial review committee; the board of directors affirmed the decision of the judicial review committee and so notified Dr. Kaiman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The affidavits with respect to Kaiman\u2019s application for staff membership at Los Robles were to the effect that her application had been reviewed by the Los Robles medical committee which contacted her references and received additional information from a local physician with whom she had previously practiced (raising doubts as to her professional competency). Dr. Kaiman was simply advised that her application had been denied. As the court stated <em>(id., </em>at p. 472): \u201c[T]he Los Robles affidavits do not indicate that the hospital ever informed Dr. Kaiman of the reason for her rejection or that she had any right to obtain a quasi-judicial review of the decision within the hospital hierarchy....\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Westlake\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate was denied in part and granted in part by our Supreme Court. It was denied insofar as it sought to require granting the summary judgment as to the damage claimed with respect' to the denial of staff privileges at Los Robles; it was granted so as to require a summary judgment dismissing the claim as to the damage resulting from the revocation of Kaiman\u2019s staff privileges at Westlake.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Kaiman\u2019s claim with respect to the Westlake revocation was found to be \u201cpremature\u201d because she \u201cdid not challenge the revocation through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>mandamus proceeding.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 485.) The court created this requirement by analogy to the comparable requirement in malicious prosecution actions based upon the initiation of an \u201cordinary \u2018public\u2019 administrative proceeding\u201d that such proceeding be thus favorably terminated. Though acknowledging the obvious distinctions \u201cbetween public and private administrative proceedings,\u201d the court concluded <em>(id., </em>at pp. 483-484): \u201c[T]he general policy underlying the \u2018favorable termination\u2019 requirement in malicious prosecution actions applies in the present context. As in a malicious prosecution action, plaintiff\u2019s position rests on a contention that defendants intentionally and maliciously misused a quasi-judicial procedure in order to injure her; such a claim is necessarily premised on an assertion that the hospital\u2019s decision to revoke plaintiff\u2019s privileges was itself erroneous and unjustified. Although a quasi-judicial decision reached by a tribunal of a private association may not be entitled to exactly the same measure of respect as a similar decision of a duly constituted public agency (see Summers, <em>Legal Limitations in Union Discipline </em>(1951) 64 Harv.L.Rev. 1049, 1086), we believe that so long as such a quasi-judicial decision is not set aside through appropriate review procedures the decision has the effect of establishing the propriety of the hospital\u2019s action. (Cf. <em>Hollywood Circle, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 728, 731-733 [13 Cal.Rptr. 104, 361 P.2d 712].) Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiff must first succeed in overturning the quasi-judicial action before pursuing her tort claim against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u201cIn our view, the above requirement accords a proper respect to an association\u2019s quasi-judicial procedure, precluding an aggrieved party from circumventing the established avenue of mandamus review. In addition, this result will simplify court procedures by providing a uniform practice of judicial, rather than jury, review of quasi-judicial administrative decisions. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>Boren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 634, 637 [234 P.2d 981].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The court then pointed out the appropriateness of applying the principle above stated to the acts of quasi-judicial tribunals of hospital associations who perform \u201coften without remuneration, the difficult, time-consuming and socially important task of policing medical personnel,\u201d but \u201cremain ultimately subject to suit,\u201d being granted only \u201ca conditional privilege\u201d by Civil Code section 43.7. (17 Cal.3d at p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Having set forth the holding in <em>Westlake, </em>we must further examine it in light of plaintiff\u2019s three contentions urging inapplicability of its re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>quirement of \u201c\u2018favorable termination\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 483) through \u201cthe established avenue of mandamus review\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 484).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s first such contention is that his allegations of ulterior motive (intentionally to cause \u201cplaintiff to suffer severe and extreme emotional and physical distress, humiliation and mental anguish\u201d) make <em>Westlake </em>inapplicable. There is no merit to this contention. The plaintiff in <em>Westlake </em>was making the same contention; Kaiman also claimed that the revocation of her privileges was pursuant to a conspiracy, one of the objects of which was \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 470.) Further, the court, in stating the contention of defendant which it approved, described such contention as follows <em>(id., </em>at p. 482): \u201cDefendants assert that before plaintiff may maintain a tort action against either the hospital or its board or committee members <em>on the ground that the revocation of her hospital privileges was maliciously motivated, </em>she must first successfully attack the quasi-judicial revocation decision in a mandamus proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Indeed, the court pointed out that in such a case \u201cplaintiff\u2019s position rests on a contention that defendants intentionally and maliciously misused a quasi-judicial procedure in order to injure her ....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 484.) It was on this basis that the analogy to malicious prosecution was drawn, and the \u201c\u2018favorable termination\u2019 requirement in malicious prosecution actions\u201d <em>(id., </em>at pp. 483-484) made applicable. It is thus apparent that a claim of ulterior motivation is what triggers the requirement; certainly it does not make it inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s second contention is that his allegations of procedural deficiencies constituting denial of fundamental due process make <em>Westlake\u2019s </em>\u201c\u2018favorable termination\u2019 requirement\u201d inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Westlake </em>does hold that \u201c\u2018private\u2019 administrative proceedings\u201d undertaken \u201cwithout notice or hearing of any kind\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 483, fn. 8) do not invoke the requirement for review by mandamus. The cases cited in footnote 8, <em>supra, </em>involve precisely that situation. The subjects of the action taken were given no prior notification of charges and no opportunity to participate in any kind of hearing. That is not the situation alleged by plaintiff in this case. His prior pleading shows that he was in fact served with 19 specifications of alleged violations of defendant\u2019s administrative guide preferred by a special committee and that he actually attended and participated in the purported hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Plaintiff, of course, claims that the hearing procedure was so defective as to deny him fundamental due process, but such a procedural defect is a common ground for issuance of . a writ of mandate invalidating a quasi-judicial decision. The opinion in <em>Westlake </em>contemplates such a basis for a favorable termination of a mandate proceeding, by saying <em>(id., </em>at p. 484): \u201c[Ojnce a court determines in a mandamus proceeding that an association\u2019s quasi-judicial decision cannot stand, either because of a substantive <em>or procedural defect, </em>the prevailing party is entitled to initiate a tort action ....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The existence of such an issue makes even more appropriate the \u201cuniform practice of judicial, rather than jury, review of quasi-judicial administrative decisions\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 484), the preservation of which appears to be a major basis for the <em>Westlake </em>doctrine. Compare <em>Hackethal </em>v. <em>Loma Linda Community Hosp. Corp. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 59, 62-63 [153 Cal.Rptr. 783], where \u201cprocedural shortcomings\u201d so serious that the trial court found \u201cplaintiff had in effect received no hearing at all on the merits of the charges,\u201d were held not to justify departure from normal mandamus procedures (remand for further administrative hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Plaintiffs pleading of procedural defects denying fundamental due process does not, therefore, take the case out of the operation of <em>Westlake.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Finally, plaintiff contends that <em>Westlake </em>should be construed to apply only to \u201cexclusions or dismissals undertaken by hospitals.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 483, fn. 8.) We do not so construe it. Though the opinion takes occasion to point out facts making it appropriate to apply the rule to quasi-judicial determinations of hospitals, it is apparent that the court is discussing a general principle governing attacks upon any \u201cquasi-judicial decision reached by a tribunal of a private association.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 484.) It was concerned with a uniform practice for the \u201creview of quasi-judicial administrative decisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court described the issue as follows <em>(id., </em>at pp. 482-483): \u201c[T]he narrow issue of whether an individual who has been expelled or excluded from membership in an association after being afforded a quasi-judicial proceeding may bring an immediate tort action for damages or must first succeed in setting aside the association\u2019s decision in a separate mandamus action. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>It is not the province of this intermediate appellate court to hold, as plaintiff urges, that our Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of that issue \u201cshould only apply to its facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The fact that the opinion justifies the application of the principle in the context of hospital decisions \u201cpolicing medical personnel\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 484) in light of stated policy considerations does not suggest that that is the only context in which the rule applies, only that the result of its application should not violate such policy. The policy factors referred to, moreover, have like application to unincorporated associations generally. They generally have quasi-judicial bodies acting \u201coften without remuneration\u201d who have no absolute privilege in respect of their important task of protecting the association from the acts of members or officers inimical to their objectives. We, therefore, see no reason to accord less respect to the quasi-judicial decisions of a voluntary association of veterans than to such decisions of a hospital association. Both should establish the propriety of the action taken until overturned by appropriate mandamus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Cobey, J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1981, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 25, 1981. Newman, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">PVA is CPVA\u2019s parent national organization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Defendant\u2019s memorandum in support of the demurrer states that the other grounds are \u201cfor the record and to preserve these points in any subsequent litigation,\u201d and its respondent\u2019s brief concedes that \u201cthe remaining grounds asserted in CPVA\u2019s demurrer ... are therefore not before this court.\u201d Accordingly, we will not lengthen this opinion by a description of these alternative grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
