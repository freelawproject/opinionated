The Supreme Court granted a hearing after which, June 19, 1980, it made the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201cThe above entitled cause is retransferred to the Court of Appeal, First District, Division One, for reconsideration in light of <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 257; <em>Dothard </em>v. <em>Rawlinson </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 321, 328-332; and <em>Firefighters Institute </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, Mo. </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 588 F.2d 235, 239-242, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Banta </em>v. <em>Firefighters Institute </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 904.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">We have reconsidered the cause as directed, and conclude that we had earlier correctly resolved it. We state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The superior court had adjudged, among other things, that \u201c[i]n order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination, [the City of Oakland\u2019s] appointment of fire fighters ... shall [for 5 years] be at the rate of at least two racial minorities for each Caucasian .... \u201d (And see pp. 357-358, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">As will be seen hereafter and from the foregoing editorial summary and headnotes, the appeals concern the developing concept, sometimes described by the catch phrase \u201caffirmative action,\u201d of remedying evils of the states\u2019 and nation\u2019s historical racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>There are few who disagree as to the pressing need for such affirmative action, but there is broad dispute as to the means of its implementation. (See, e.g., <em>University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 265 [57 L.Ed.2d 750, 98 S.Ct. 2733]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 257 [161 Cal.Rptr. 475, 604 P.2d 1365].) Some believe that present racial discrimination in public employment against individually faultless nonminority persons is rationally, and constitutionally, acceptable, as a sort of atonement for sins of earlier days. Others insist that there may be no public racial discrimination at all; they side with Justice William O. Douglas in his dissent in <em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 312 [40 L.Ed.2d 164, 94 S.Ct. 1704], <em>passim: </em>\u2018\u201cThe clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States.\u2019\u201d \u201cMinorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, . . . There is no constitutional right for any race to be preferred. . . . The Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation . . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We first consider the case of <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In 1974 Sacramento County was concerned with the relative paucity of minority persons in the county\u2019s employ. Through its civil service commission it conducted a series of hearings into the county\u2019s past hiring practices in an attempt to ascertain the reasons for the under-representation and to identify potential courses of action to ameliorate the situation. The hearings disclosed a number of discriminatory practices continuing to the date of the hearings, which operated to screen out a disproportionate number of minority job applicants. A rule was adopted permitting the civil service commission, after public hearing and a finding of existing racial discrimination, to \u201corder that minority personnel shall be appointed to the classification involved in accordance with an alternating ratio until a specified number of minority persons have been hired.\u201d Such an order remained subject to modification, or rescission, according to the \u201c\u2018needs of the service, changed circumstances, problems encountered in implementing the order, and information which was not previously considered ....\u2019\u201d (P. 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Thereafter a county department was found with a near complete absence of minority person employees. The civil service commission took no immediate action, relying upon the department head\u2019s assurances that he would undertake additional efforts to recruit and hire such persons. The assurances were periodically repeated but when, more than a year later, no minority persons had yet been hired the commission, after a hearing, issued a remedial order. The order specified (p. 266) that new employments of the department \u201c\u2018shall be made on the basis of an alternating ratio of 2:1 so that at least one minority person is appointed for every two nonminority persons\u2019 and that \u2018[s]aid ratio shall be applied only until the percentage of minorities\u2019\u201d was raised from 1.54 percent to 8 percent. (The county had a 19.5 percent minority population.) Instead of complying, the department head successfully sought a judicial declaration that the county\u2019s order was unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On appeal the state\u2019s Supreme Court disagreed, holding (p. 269) that the county\u2019s rule and order\u2014\u201cdirected specifically at ameliorating minority underrepresentation which is found to have resulted from the county\u2019s own discriminatory employment practices\u201d\u2014was constitutionally and statutorily valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"><em>Dothard </em>v. <em>Rawlinson </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 321 [53 L.Ed.2d 786, 97 S.Ct. 2720].</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Dianne Rawlinson was a 22-year-old college graduate who had majored in correctional psychology. Her application for employment as a correctional counselor (i.e., prison guard) in Alabama was rejected because she failed to meet the state\u2019s correctional counselor employment criteria. At issue in the high court were the minimum weight and height requirements of 120 pounds and 5 feet 2 inches, and a regulation barring employment of women in \u201ccontact\u201d positions of male maximum-security prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">A divided high court upheld the district court\u2019s determination that . the height and weight requirements operated as such a \u201cbarrier to equal employment opportunity that Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] forbids.\u201d The criteria were found to have no reasonable \u201cjob relation\u201d against the state\u2019s insistence that they insured the necessary \u201cstrength\u201d; at least two of the justices had concluded that prison guards \u201crely primarily on the moral authority of their office ....\u201d On the oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>er hand, another division of the court held the discriminatory regulation against female guards in male maximum-security prisons to be constitutionally and statutorily acceptable as a \u201c\u2018bona fide occupational qualification ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><em>Firefighters Institute </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, Mo. </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 588 F.2d 235 (cert. den. <em>sub nom. Banta </em>v. <em>Firefighters Institute </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 904 [61 L.Ed.2d 872, 99 S.Ct. 3096]).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Here, as in the case at bench, black fire fighters and others claimed racial discrimination against blacks in the hiring, and promotion, of personnel of a city\u2019s fire department. A remedial action for its correction was commenced under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court had observed long-existing discriminatory patterns by the city, against blacks, in employment and promotion as fire fighters. Such discrimination had continued even up to the time of the action\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On review the court of appeals found that the fire department\u2019s tests and examinations for initial employment, and promotion, had a substantial disparate racial effect, which the city had <em>never </em>endeavored to correct. The city\u2019s conduct through the preceding years was described as \u201cintransigence\u201d and \u201cunwillingness,\u201d a \u201cdetermination\u201d not to change conditions, \u201crecalcitrance,\u201d \u201ccontinued inaction,\u201d and a present-day \u201ccontinuation of a policy of discrimination\" against blacks. Such practices were emphasized by the city\u2019s permissive and continued maintenance of \u201cracially segregated eating arrangements\u201d in its firehouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The court concluded: \u201cWe believe that the record in this case ... provides ample justification for preferential relief ... in order to redress the rights of those who have been the victims of the City\u2019s discrimination.\u201d (Pp. 240-241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">As will be hereinafter seen, the City of Oakland had long since put an end to its historical discrimination in the hiring and promotion .practices of its fire department. It has in good faith endeavored to ameliorate and overcome the bitter effects of that discrimination. And its endeavor has been met with substantial, and ever increasing, success. (See pp. 355-357, <em>infra.) </em>We have found no evidence and observe no responsible argument to the contrary. Nor did the superior court find any intentional or purposeful present-day discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>No authority has been offered, nor has any been found by us, holding that a <em>public entity </em>such as the City of Oakland, endeavoring in good faith to overcome the effects of past racial discrimination, will be subjected to judicial imposition of minority person quotas in its hiring and promotion of employees. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 257, is inapposite for there, as has been seen, the city itself had reluctantly imposed such quotas, in its affirmative action efforts, upon its uncooperative department head. The high court had simply sanctioned the city\u2019s own efforts. And <em>Firefighters Institute </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, Mo., supra, </em>588 F.2d 235, is patently inapplicable here, for there the city\u2019s continuing bad faith left no rational judicial alternative to mandatory correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We have also considered the recent United States Supreme Court authority of <em>Fullilove </em>v. <em>Klutznick </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 448 [65 L.Ed.2d 902, 100 S.Ct. 2758]. There the high court found no constitutional fault in the federal government\u2019s effort to increase minority business enterprise participation in certain federally subsidized public works projects by requiring prime contractors, absent administrative waivers and upon certain conditions, to allocate 10 percent of their contracts\u2019 federal funds to such minority business enterprises. As in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 257, the court affirmed the government\u2019s attempt to ameliorate minority underrepresentation resulting from its own past practices or inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">At the cost of some later repetition we quote from high relevant authority:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u201cRacial discrimination by public employers was not made illegal under Title VII until March 24, 1972. A public employer who from that date forward made all its employment decisions in a wholly nondiscriminatory way would not violate Title VII even if it had formerly maintained an all-white work force by purposefully excluding Negroes.\u201d <em>(Hazelwood School District </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 299, 309 [53 L.Ed.2d 768, 778, 97 S.Ct. 2736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201c[W]e think the District Court correctly held that the affirmative efforts of the Metropolitan Police Department to recruit black officers, the changing racial composition of the recruit classes and of the force in general, and the relationship of the test to the training program negated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>any inference that the Department discriminated on the basis of race or that \u2018a police officer qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability.\u2019\u201d <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 229, 246 [48 L.Ed.2d 597, 611, 96 S.Ct. 2040].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Racial discrimination practiced before the Civil Rights Act\u2019s 1972 amendment \u201cis merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.... [T]he critical question is whether any present <em>violation </em>exists.\u201d <em>(United Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 553, 558 [52 L.Ed.2d 571, 578, 97 S.Ct. 1885].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201c[A] court must ... be mindful that remedies for the continuing effects of past discrimination have proven distressingly elusive, and that it is therefore important that entities attempting in good faith to promote integration be given reasonable leeway in experimenting with various methods to achieve this compelling societal objective.\u201d <em>(Bakke </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 34, 81 [132 Cal.Rptr. 680, 553 P.2d 1152], quoting from unchallenged portion of Justice Tobriner\u2019s dissent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In <em>Dothard </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, supra, </em>433 U.S. 321, the high court found no prison guard \u201cjob relation\u201d to a state\u2019s \u201cheight and weight\u201d requirements. In the case at bench we observe a critical fire fighter \u201cjob relation\u201d to the City of Oakland\u2019s height and weight requirement for such employment. (See pp. 373-374, <em>infra.) </em>That case also, is of no assistance to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">To what we have heretofore said, we now respectfully add our opinion and decision, as earlier filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The issue tendered us on these appeals is whether the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (tit. VII),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permit the State of California, or its courts, to discriminate against nonminority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>persons (Caucasians),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who themselves are individually without fault, on the basis of race alone, in order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination against minority persons generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201cNo one denies the regrettable fact that there has been societal discrimination in this country against various racial and ethnic groups.\u201d <em>(University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke, supra, </em>438 U.S. 265, 296, fn. 36 [57 L.Ed.2d 750, 775, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2752].) It constitutes \u201c\u2018an unfortunate, and ignominious page in this country\u2019s history.\u2019\u201d <em>(Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 405, 418 [45 L.Ed.2d 280, 297, 95 S.Ct. 2362].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Fire Department of the City of Oakland (City) has not gone untouched by such practices. Like many fire departments throughout the state and nation it has a shameful <em>historical </em>record of racial discrimination in the employment and promotion of fire fighters. The origin is obscure and subtle, and the blame may be widely spread. Some of it, such as separate dining facilities arid sleeping quarters for the races, will probably be traced to the high judicial approval of <em>Plessy </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1896) 163 U.S. 537 [41 L.Ed.2d 256, 16 S.Ct. 1138].</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">But the record before us uncontrovertibly establishes that over the last decade and well beyond, the City has in good faith engaged in a well-funded and \u201cmonumental\u201d effort to recruit minority persons as fire fighters. \u201cGoals\u201d and \u201ctargets\u201d have been set for achieving such a \u201cracial and ethnic makeup of personnel in all job categories [as] will bear a \u2018reasonable ratio balance\u2019 to the racial and ethnic composition of the population of Oakland; ...\u201d The campaign, mainly through the \u201cmass media,\u201d had produced many well-qualified minority person fire fighters. But the progress had been slow, for new appointments and promotions to higher rank will ordinarily depend upon vacancies caused by retirement and death. And as pointed out in the superior court, \u201cwhere the salary is way above that of an average high school graduate [the City\u2019s efforts generated interest among persons] who had never been interested before, and who are not capable of performing, in no way.\u201d Such persons were unfortunately, but necessarily, eliminated in the civil service competition for fire fighter jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The current good faith of the City is manifest. It was demonstrated, perhaps overdemonstrated, by the most recent oral examination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201choseman\u201d (the entering class of fire fighter) candidates; there \u201c29% of the Caucasians failed, 21% of the Blacks failed, none of the Spanishsurnamed individuals failed, 20% of the Asians failed, and 33% [1 out of 3] of the American Indians failed;...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The results of the last entrance examinations prior to the commencement of plaintiffs\u2019 action are particularly notable. In order of the candidates\u2019 passing grades, the first was a minority person. Of the first 30, 16 were minority persons. And of the next 70 passing grades, the \u201ccandidates broke down ethnically almost 50-50 .... \u201d Thus, minority persons constituted about 51 percent of the group first to be called, a ratio precisely the same as the estimated proportion of minority persons in the City\u2019s population. Each of these successful candidates had passed the fire department\u2019s prescribed written and oral examinations, physical agility tests, and height and weight criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Thereafter a group of black minority persons and the Oakland Black Fire Fighters Association commenced the instant class action in mandate against the City. They contended principally (1) that the percentage of minority persons in all job levels of the fire department bore no reasonable relationship to their percentage in the population of the City, and (2) that the required examinations, tests and standards \u201cdo not substantially relate to the performance of firefighting duties.\u201d They sought a writ of mandate calculated to \u201cdissipate the effect of [the fire department\u2019s] <em>history </em>of discriminatory hiring and promotion .... \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Caucasians who were fire fighters, or who had qualified for such jobs by civil service examinations, or who aspired to hold such jobs, joined with the City as interveners in defense of plaintiffs\u2019 action. They contended that their employment or promotion chances would be lost or jeopardized by the affirmative relief sought by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Each of the respective sides relied principally upon the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cequal protection\u201d clause and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter sometimes Civil Rights Act). (See fns. 1 and 2, <em>ante.) </em>Plaintiffs argued that those high mandates authorized, and compelled, \u201caffirmative relief\u201d in order to compensate for the fire department\u2019s historical job and promotion discrimination against minority persons generally. The City and the interveners contended that the affirmative relief sought would itself discriminate against Caucasians bearing no re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sponsibility for plaintiffs\u2019 grievances, solely on account of their race. This, they insisted, was <em>forbidden </em>by the Fourteenth Amendment and by the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The City and the Caucasian interveners, lacking knowledge of what form, if any, of affirmative relief would be granted by the superior court, did not expressly plead the Civil Rights Act as a defense to the action. But implicit, indeed explicit, in the record is their reliance, in part, upon that statute. Furthermore, the relevant facts being uncontroverted, and the issue having been fully briefed and argued, the question is one of law such as may always be considered on appeal, even if not raised below. <em>(Century Bank </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 319, 324 [93 Cal.Rptr. 569, 482 P.2d 193]; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736, 742 [336 P.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Following a trial the superior court concluded that <em>uin order to ameliorate the effect of past discriminatory practices\u201d </em>(italics added) by the fire department, \u201caffirmative relief is necessary.\u201d The affirmative relief decreed by the ensuing judgment follows: \u201cIn order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination, appointment of fire fighters . .. shall [for 5 years] be at the rate of at least two racial minorities for each Caucasian .... In order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination, promotion of fire fighters for ... five years shall be at the rate of at least one racial minority for five Caucasians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The superior court also found that each, and all, of the fire department\u2019s written examinations, physical agility tests, height and weight standards, and the \u201ctime in grade requirements and seniority weighting\u201d in respect of promotions, were invalid. Their invalidity was based upon (1) the need \u201cto ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination,\u201d (2) their \u201cracially disparate impact\u201d upon minority persons, and (3) their lack of \u201cjob relation.\u201d The judgment accordingly, and effectively, invalidated the several requirements and ordered minority persons to be accepted for employment, or promoted, in accordance with the judicially established \u201cquotas\u201d upon passing an oral examination alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">It is proper here to emphasize that the superior court made no finding\u2014and the evidence would not reasonably permit such a finding\u2014 that in its campaign to enlist minority person fire fighters, or in its examinations, tests and other employment criteria, or their administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tion, the City had acted in bad faith, or with a purpose or intent to discriminate, or otherwise than to achieve a racially balanced fire department consisting of persons properly qualified for their respective jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The City and the interveners vigorously (and correctly) point out that the Caucasians whose job or promotion opportunities are lessened or frustrated by the judgment, bear no personal blame for the past racial discrimination found by the superior court. They also, with record justification, point to the lack of evidence or findings that any of the named plaintiffs or members of the class represented by them, had personally been victimized by such past racial discrimination. Their arguments may reasonably be condensed to the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act proscribe the judgment\u2019s discrimination <em>on account of race alone, </em>against such Caucasians as were found better qualified for fire fighter jobs and promotion, by fairly administered civil service examinations, tests and standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Before entering upon our consideration of these issues, we dispose of an insistent contention of the City and the interveners that plaintiffs\u2019 action must be dismissed for their failure to exhaust certain administrative remedies provided by California\u2019s Fair Employment Practice Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7 1410 et seq.) and by the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to pass upon this issue, other than to say that persons in the position of plaintiffs would be well advised to consider such matters before entering upon litigation such as this. Here the case has already been litigated for several years. Its prompt determination is not only in the public interest, but it would also end what must be grave uncertainty in the lives and careers of the many persons, minority and Caucasian, who will be affected by its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We observe that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not an inflexible rule. <em>(Ogo Associates </em>v. <em>City of Torrance </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 830, 834 [112 Cal.Rptr. 761].) It will not be asserted where it disserves the public interest <em>(Environmental Law Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town of Corte Madera </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 105, 114 [122 Cal.Rptr. 282]), or where irreparable injury would otherwise occur <em>(Associated Cal.

It concerns the respective coverage of the racial discrimination provisions, and implications, of the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment. There is much difference of opinion. Some insist that the act, based upon powers expressly confided to Congress by the Constitution, extends the limit of its proscriptions beyond that of the Fourteenth Amendment. Others hold that the coverage of the act is coextensive with that of the Fourteenth Amendment. The controversy may be pointed up, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In <em>University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke, supra, </em>438 U.S. 265 [57 L.Ed.2d 750, 98 S.Ct. 2733], five of the justices (one of the majority and the four dissenters) held that title VI of the Civil Rights Act \u201cproscribes only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause if employed by a State or its agencies.\u201d (438 U.S., p.267 [57 L.Ed.2d, p. 758, 98 S.Ct., p. 2737].)

They say: \u201cIn <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Trucking </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 747, the United States Supreme Court made clear that trial courts should be flexible in exercising their equitable powers to \u2018make whole\u2019 the victims of past employment discrimination and to eradicate discrimination in the future. The Court also emphasized that the burden of past discriminatory hiring practices should be shared by all of the employees. The Court stated', \u2018If relief under Title VII can be denied merely because the majority group of employees, who have not suffered discrimination, will be unhappy about it, there will be little hope of correcting the wrongs to which the Act is directed.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The court\u2019s holding is misunderstood.

In such a case they were simply placed in the \u201cfavorable positions\u201d they should have held, and no Caucasian employed after the discrimination had a rational grievance when displaced from a preferred position to which he was legally unentitled. The case did not concern, nor was relief granted for, preferential treatment of blacks generally (as here contended for) who had never been employed by the trucking company. The case lends no aid to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 324 [52 L.Ed.2d 396, 97 S.Ct. 1843].</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">This case followed and elaborated upon <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Transp. Co., Inc., supra, </em>424 U.S. 747. Another transportation company and a labor union had earlier discriminated against qualified racial minority members in the more desirable jobs of \u201cline drivers.\u201d The subjects of discrimination were of three classes: (1) minority company employees who had been denied transfers to the better jobs; (2) minority persons who had unsuccessfully applied for work as line drivers; and (3) minority persons who would have applied for such jobs but did not do so on account of the \u201cknowledge [of each] that the job he wanted was unavailable to him\u201d because of the patent discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Under the Civil Rights Act the government sued the company and union for \u201cspecific \u2018make whole\u2019 relief for individual discriminatees,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In its review of the lower court\u2019s judgment the high court appeared to encounter no difficulty in concluding that the minority members of the first two categories, who had actually applied for line drivers\u2019 jobs, were entitled to the affirmative relief of being \u201cmade whole.\u201d Subsequent successful Caucasian job applicants claiming prejudice or discrimination against themselves had no reasonable complaint because as to them, the minority members were simply placed in the preferred \u201crightful position\u201d they would have held except for the past racial discrimination against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">It was the third classification, those qualified minority persons who would have applied for line drivers\u2019 jobs, but were discouraged therefrom by the company\u2019s and union\u2019s practices, to which the court devoted most of its consideration. On this issue the court said (431 U.S., pp. 363, 365-366, 367-368, 371 [52 L.Ed.2d, pp. 433, 434, 435, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>437]): \u201cThe question whether seniority relief may be awarded to [the earlier] nonapplicants was left open by our decision in <em>[Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Transp. Co., Inc.], </em>since the class at issue in that case was limited to \u2018identifiable applicants who were denied employment (P. 363 [52 L.Ed.2d, pp. 432-433].) \u201cWhen a person\u2019s desire for a job is not translated into a formal application solely because of his unwillingness to engage in a futile gesture he is as much a victim of discrimination as is he who goes through the motions of submitting an application.\u201d (Pp. 365-366 [52 L.Ed.2d, p. 434].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201cThe denial of Title VII [Civil Rights Act] relief on the ground that the claimant had not formally applied for the job could exclude from the Act\u2019s coverage the victims of the most entrenched forms of discrimination. Victims of gross and pervasive discrimination could be denied relief precisely because the unlawful practices had been so successful as totally to deter job applications from members of minority groups.... [IT] To conclude that a person\u2019s failure to submit an application for a job does not inevitably and forever foreclose his entitlement to seniority relief under Title VII is a far cry, however, from holding that nonapplicants are always entitled to such relief. <em>A nonapplicant must show that he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination. Because he is necessarily claiming that he was deterred from applying for the job by the employer\u2019s discriminatory practices, his is the not always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those </em>practices.... <em>When this burden is met, the nonapplicant is in a position analogous to that of an applicant </em>(Pp. 367-368 [52 L.Ed.2d, p. 435]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u201c <em>While it may be true that many of the nonapplicant employees desired and would have applied for line-driver jobs but for their knowledge of the company\u2019s policy of discrimination, the Government must carry its burden of proof, with respect to each specific individual, </em>...\u201d (P. 371 [52 L.Ed.2d, p. 437]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">It thus becomes clear that minority persons are entitled to affirmative relief, or to be \u201cmade whole,\u201d under the Civil Rights Act only as to those who had <em>individually </em>been the subject of earlier, or historical, job discrimination. In the case at bench, as noted, there was neither evidence, nor contention, that any of the named plaintiffs, or of the class of minority persons represented by them, was a victim of the fire department\u2019s earlier racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>426 U.S. 229.

Particularly complained of was \u201ca written personnel test which excluded a disproportionately high number of Negro applicants.\u201d (P. 233 [48 L.Ed.2d, p. 603].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The trial court had noted \u201cthat there was no claim of \u2018an intentional discrimination or purposeful discriminatory adts\u2019 but only a claim that [the written test] bore no relationship to job performance and \u2018has a highly discriminatory impact in screening out black candidates.\u2019\u201d (P. 235 [48 L.Ed.2d, P. 604].) The evidence indicated that the number of black police officers, while substantial, was not proportionate to the city\u2019s population mix, and that a higher percentage of blacks failed the test than Caucasians. \u201cSince August 1969, 44% of new police force recruits had been black; that figure also represented the proportion of blacks on the total force and was roughly equivalent to 20- to 29-year-old blacks in the 50-mile radius in which the recruiting efforts of the Police Department had been concentrated. It was undisputed that the Department had systematically and affirmatively sought to enroll black officers. .. .The District Court ultimately concluded that \u2018[t]he proof is wholly lacking that a police officer qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability\u2019 and that the Department \u2018should not be required on this showing to lower standards or to abandon efforts to achieve excellence.\u2019\u201d (Pp. 235, 236 [48 L.Ed.2d, pp. 604, 605].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">No constitutional fault was found and the plaintiffs were denied any affirmative, or other, relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">It may properly be emphasized here that in the district court no contention was made, and no evidence indicated, that the city in its police recruitment and promotion practices had the <em>intent </em>or <em>purpose </em>to discriminate against racial minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">On review the United States Supreme Court expressed itself in the following manner: \u201cThe central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.

The California high court found the \u201cquota\u201d allocation to be inimical to Fourteenth Amendment standards.

Pragmatic problems are certain to arise in identifying groups which should be preferred or in specifying their numbers, and preferences once established will be difficult to alter or abolish; human nature suggests a preferred minority will be no more willing than others to relinquish an advantage once it is bestowed.

This authority, as heretofore noted, affirmed California\u2019s <em>Bakke </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California. </em>Justice Powell found the school\u2019s \u201cquota,\u201d and the rejection of Bakke on account of his race, to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Four other justices found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue, for title VI (see fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>of the Civil Rights Act was found to bar the university\u2019s \u201cquota\u201d and the reverse racial discrimination against Bakke.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The case is thus clear authority that a minority person \u201cquota\u201d provision having the effect of discriminating against faultless Caucasians on the basis of race alone is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\"><em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, supra, </em>416 U.S. 312. This case, like <em>Bakke, </em>concerned a university\u2019s exclusion of a qualified Caucasian student, because of a \u201cquota\u201d giving preference to lesser qualified minority persons. The high court, finding mootness, declined to consider the substantive constitutional issues tendered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">But Justice Douglas, in what he termed \u201ca dissent,\u201d nevertheless addressed himself to those issues, and the rest of the court expressed no disagreement. His comments have been widely quoted, and it is noted that they were relied upon in part by Justice Powell in <em>University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke, </em>and in the majority opinion of California\u2019s <em>Bakke </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California. </em>Although lacking precedential authority, they receive our respectful consideration. We note the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u201c\u2018The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States.\u2019\u201d \u201cMinorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, . . . \u201d (416 U.S., p. 334 [40 L.Ed.2d, p. 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\"><em>\u201cThere is no constitutional right for any race to be preferred. </em>The years of slavery did more than retard the progress of Blacks. Even a greater wrong was done the whites by creating arrogance instead of humility and by encouraging the growth of the fiction of a superior race. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>There is no superior person by constitutional standards. <em>A DeFunis who is white is entitled to no advantage by reason of that fact; nor is he subject to any disability, no matter what his race or color. Whatever his race, he had a constitutional right to have his application considered on its individual merits in a racially neutral </em>manner.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 336-337 [40 L.Ed.2d, p. 180]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><em>\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized.\u201d (Id., </em>p. 342 [40 L.Ed.2d, p. 183]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We turn our consideration now to that portion of the superior court\u2019s judgment granting <em>\u201caffirmative relief\u201d </em>to the named and class plaintiffs \u201c[i]n order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination, ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As pointed out, none of them had \u201cindividually\u201d been so discriminated against by the City or its fire department. Under the clear authority of the United States Supreme Court such affirmative relief was not available to them for the reason that their races generally, at other times, had been the objects of such discrimination. (See <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. 324 [52 L.Ed.2d 396]; <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Transp. Co., Inc., supra, </em>424 U.S. 747; <em>Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, supra, </em>422 U.S. 405, 421 [45 L.Ed.2d 280, 298-299].) And such affirmative relief will not be permitted against a public employer which, as here and insofar as the named plaintiffs and their class are concerned, had entertained neither <em>intent </em>nor <em>purpose </em>to discriminate and had in good faith been endeavoring itself to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination. (See <em>Hazelwood School District </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>433 U.S. 299; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>426 U.S. 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The \u201cquota\u201d provisions of the judgment are found by us to be in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They unlawfully discriminate against Caucasian persons on account of their race alone. (See <em>Bakke </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 34; <em>University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke, supra, </em>438 U.S. 265; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., supra, </em>427 U.S. 273; <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer, supra, </em>334 U.S. 1, 22 [92 L.Ed. 1161, 1185-1186]; <em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, supra, </em>416 U.S. 312, 320 [40 L.Ed.2d 164, 171] [dis. opn. of Justice Douglas].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>There remains for our consideration the portion of the superior court\u2019s judgment nullifying the fire department\u2019s written examinations, physical agility tests, height and weight requirements, and the \u201ctime in grade requirements and seniority weighting\u201d in respect of promotions. These provisions, it will be recalled, were based upon the need \u201cto ameliorate the effect of past discriminatory practices\u201d <em>and </em>the fact of their \u201cracially disparate impact\u201d and \u201clack of job relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Insofar as such segments of the judgment are based upon the need \u201cto ameliorate the effect of past discriminatory practices,\u201d for the reasons stated in relation to the \u201cquota\u201d provisions of the judgment we find them also to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">But we give continued attention to the superior court\u2019s conclusions of racially disproportionate impact and lack of job relation. Such conclusions, although sometimes referred to as \u201cfindings of fact\u201d by the superior court, are not binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201cDetermination of what happened requires assessments of the relative credibility of witnesses whose stories . .. are frequently, if indeed not almost invariably, contradictory. That ascertainment belongs to the trier of facts before whom those witnesses actually appear, subject to whatever corrective powers a State\u2019s appellate processes afford.\u201d <em>(Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 568, 603 [6 L.Ed.2d 1037, 1058, 81 S.Ct. 1860].) But on issues such as those now before us, a reviewing court has something of a transcendent fact-finding duty. \u201c\u2018[I]ssue of fact\u2019 is a coat of many colors. It does not cover a conclusion drawn from uncontroverted happenings, when that conclusion incorporates standards of conduct or criteria for judgment which in themselves are decisive of constitutional rights. Such standards and criteria, measured against the requirements drawn from constitutional provisions, and their proper applications, are issues for this Court\u2019s adjudication.\u201d <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 49, 51 [93 L.Ed. 1801, 1804, 69 S.Ct. 1347].) Under these criteria we are required to review the superi- or court\u2019s instant \u201cconclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We consider first the conclusion that the City\u2019s fire department\u2019s examinations, tests, and other employment criteria have a \u201cracially disparate impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">It is again observed that of the first 100 persons on the City\u2019s fire department\u2019s latest civil service entrance list to be called for employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>minority persons comprised <em>51 </em>percent, i.e., the same proportion they bore to the whole of the City\u2019s population. We are unable to conclude that such a result is reasonably reconcilable with the racially disproportionate impact contended by plaintiffs, and found by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Nor, at least in the context of the case at bench, where the plaintiff minority persons are all black, may it reasonably be said that the fire department\u2019s \u201cphysical agility test,\u201d and minimum \u201cheight and weight requirement\u201d (5 ft., 6 in., and 140 lbs.), have such a racially disproportionate impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">But as we have by now repetitiously pointed out, the City\u2019s avowed, and implemented, purpose and intent for many years had been to end racial imbalance in its fire department, and itself \u201cto ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination,...\u201d Were we to assume, arguendo, the racially disproportionate impact found by the superior court, there would then be such impact <em>alone, </em>without intent or purpose to discriminate. In such a case the extreme sanctions here imposed by the superior court are without Fourteenth Amendment or Civil Rights Act, or other, lawful justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., supra, </em>401 U.S. 424, 433 [28 L.Ed.2d 158, 165], as noted, holds that: <em>\u201c[The Civil Rights Act] </em>authorizes the use of \u2018any professionally developed ability test\u2019 that is not \u2018designed, intended <em>or used </em>to discriminate because of race .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>426 U.S. 229, appears to be the controlling <em>Fourteenth Amendment </em>authority on the immediate issue. In that case, as above noted and as in the case at hand, there was no \u201c\u2018intentional discrimination or purposeful discriminatory acts,\u201d\u2019 but instead a claim that a police department employment test had \u201c\u2018a highly discriminatory impact in screening out black candidates.\u2019\u201d (P. 235 [48 L.Ed.2d, p. 604].) Giving effect, arguendo, to that claim the high court found no Fourteenth Amendment or other abridgment. We repeat, for emphasis, some of its conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u201c[G]ur cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional <em>solely </em>because it has a racially disproportionate impact.\u201d (P. 239 [48 L.Ed.2d, p. 607].) \u201c[W]e have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>not held that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another.\u201d (P. 242 [48 L.Ed.2d, p. 609].) \u201c[I]t is untenable that the Constitution prevents the Government from seeking modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees rather than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special ability to communicate orally and in writing. Respondents, as Negroes, could no more successfully claim that the test denied them equal protection than could white applicants who also failed.\u201d (Pp. 245-246 [48 L.Ed.2d, p. 611].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Under this authority the City had committed neither Civil Rights Act, nor Fourteenth Amendment, violation in respect of the claim of racially discriminatory impact of its fire fighter employment tests, examinations, and other employment criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We pass on to the remaining contention of plaintiffs, and the superior court\u2019s conclusion, of \u201clack of job relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">As we have pointed out, <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., supra, </em>401 U.S. 424, 436 [28 L.Ed.2d 158, 167], requiring such a job relation in employment tests, stated that such tests must demonstrably be \u201ca reasonable measure of job performance,\u201d in order to pass constitutional and statutory muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Here also we conclude that certain of the plaintiffs\u2019 .contentions, and the superior court\u2019s conclusions, are not reasonably supported. In part they relate to the \u201cphysical agility test.\u201d A fire fighter job applicant was required to carry a dummy on a ladder and to do \u201ctwo pullups.\u201d One of the named plaintiffs, weighing 292 pounds, failed in the latter exercise and was eliminated as a fire fighter candidate. He was ordered reinstated upon passing an oral examination. Heavy reliance was and is placed upon evidence that a fire fighter spends only a small part of his time actually handling hoses and ladders and other heavy equipment, or rescuing persons or animals, or breaking through roofs or walls or doors, or performing other arduous duties of his employment. A similarly unpersuasive argument was answered by the court of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Troyan </em>(6th Cir. 1975) 520 F.2d 492, 496 (cert. den., 426 U.S. 934 [49 L.Ed.2d 385, 96 S.Ct. 2646]), in this manner: \u201cThat an occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>function consumes a <em>de minimis </em>proportion of one\u2019s workday ... does not necessarily diminish the need for selecting one who can best perform that function. A lifeguard may well spend all but fifteen minutes of an entire summer observing swimmers and keeping the beach free of litter, but in those fifteen minutes swimming ability to rescue a drowning swimmer becomes vitally crucial.\u201d We find the physical agility test to have an appropriate \u201cjob relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We are also impelled to question the factual validity of the superior court\u2019s determination that \u201ctime in grade requirements and seniority factor\u201d have no relation to promotion to higher rank. The provision would permit promotion of persons who had never served in the grades they would be called upon to supervise. Indeed, the here questioned portion of the judgment would permit, and perhaps require, a newly recruited minority person, without fire fighter experience whatever, to be promoted to any advanced rank in the City\u2019s fire department upon passing an oral examination alone. Here also, contrary to the superior court\u2019s conclusion, we find a reasonable relation to promotion to higher rank in the rejected \u201ctime in grade requirements and seniority factor.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">But once again there is a transcendent rule. As we have pointed out, the City\u2019s criticized fire fighter employment and promotion practices violated neither Fourteenth Amendment, nor Civil Rights Act, precepts. It may well have been that as to one or more of those practices there was, at least in some degree, no reasonable job relation. But the permissible remedy was not imposition of the drastic sanctions of the judgment. In such a case, as noted in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>426 U.S. 229, 252 [48 L.Ed.2d 597, 614], \u201cThose deficiencies are to be <em>directly </em>addressed in accordance with appropriate procedures ... . \u201d (Italics added.) The superior court has the power, when reasonably required, to correct such matters in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It follows that the entire judgment must be reversed upon the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Our decision today is entered without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs or any interested and proper parties to establish, if they can, that any of the City\u2019s fire department\u2019s practices have an unreasonably or unnecessarily disproportionate racial impact, or are not job related. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>(We, ourselves, have found none.) In such an event the superior court will bear in mind that the purpose of the City\u2019s fire department is the protection of the lives and property of its people; it is not to furnish jobs for persons found to be unsuited for that task. If such deficiencies are found, and as long as the City shall act in good faith and without intent or purpose to discriminate on racial grounds, affirmative relief of the sort here applied by the judgment will be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It is found unnecessary to our disposition of the appeals to consider certain of the state\u2019s statutes relied upon by plaintiffs, forbidding employment or other discrimination on account of race. Those statutes also lend no aid to plaintiffs; they patently would invalidate the superior court\u2019s judgment purporting to permit their proscribed racial discrimination against nonminority Caucasians. Nor need we specially consider plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the state Constitution\u2019s \u201cequal protection\u201d clause found in its article I, section 7. The equal protection standards of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of the state\u2019s Constitution, are substantially the same. (See <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 16-17 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10]; <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1, 16 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351]; <em>Reece </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 675, 679 [134 Cal.Rptr. 698].) And, of course, were there a conflict, in the context of the case at hand the Fourteenth Amendment, the supreme law of the land, would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The judgment is reversed. The superior court, and the parties or any of them, may take such further proceedings as are not inconsistent with the views we have expressed.
