We relate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>certain of the proceedings, and uncontroverted evidence, as found in those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">On or about December 6, <em>1971, </em>plaintiffs Paul L. Muth and Genevieve S. Muth, his wife, deeded to defendant Educators Security Insurance Company, a Nebraska corporation, certain unimproved real property in Tehama County, California, which for reasons as will soon appear we shall refer to as parcel A. As consideration therefor, that defendant executed and delivered to plaintiffs its promissory note for $411,750, payable in installments of $50,000 on the first day of each year commencing January 1, <em>1982. </em>Interest on the unpaid balance at 7 percent was payable \u201csemi-annually on January 1st and July 1st of each calendar year commencing with January 1, <em>1972.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The promissory note also contained a provision that: \u201cIf any payment of interest or principal is not made as it comes due, the holder of this note at any time thereafter, may, at his option, elect to declare the entire balance of this note remaining unpaid, to become and be immediately due and payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Sometime in 1972, defendant Educators Security Insurance Company merged with defendant Pioneer Insurance Company (hereafter Pioneer), also a Nebraska corporation, which thereby took title to parcel A, and assumed all of Educators Security Insurance Company\u2019s obligations, including principal and interest of plaintiffs\u2019 promissory note. Such interest payments were made by one or the other of the defendants to and including January 1, 1975. They were, without express complaint or objection, sometimes tardily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On or about March 20, 1975, the Nebraska Director of Insurance found Pioneer to be in a financially \u201chazardous condition.\u201d Pursuant to statutes of Nebraska he took over the management and assets of that company. He then appointed a conservator of Pioneer to act under his direction. The conservator thereafter paid the interest due July 1, 1975, on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">On or about January 16, 1976, plaintiffs received a letter, dated January 13, 1976, from Pioneer\u2019s conservator which, as relevant, advised them in this manner (the italics are ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">\u201cEnclosed please find the check of Pioneer Insurance Company in the amount of $14,411.25 representing the payment of interest on a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>promissory note. <em>This payment, should not be deemed or construed as an acknowledgment of the validity of the obligation or as a waiver of any defense to the obligation that may be available to the Pioneer Insurance Company.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201cThis letter is to further document our telephone conversations advising you and your counsel, John Burnett, that the Director of Insurance for the State of Nebraska has appointed me as Conservator, under Nebraska law, of the Pioneer Insurance Company and that an agreement for the reinsurance of the life insurance policies of the company is currently being negotiated. <em>As a part of this reinsurance agreement, a change in the ownership of the assets currently held by the Pioneer Insurance Company will occur. </em>After this change of ownership occurs, you will be contacted by representatives of either the Department of Insurance or by representatives of the purchaser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">As stated in the letter, the interest check (16 days late) was enclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Plaintiffs, through their attorney, rejected and returned the untimely interest check by a letter, dated January 26, 1976, to the conservator which stated, as relevant: \u201cDue to the fact that the letter accompanying said check contained the statement, \u2018This payment should not be deemed or construed as an acknowledgment of the validity of the obligation or as a waiver of any defense to the obligation that may be available to the Pioneer Insurance Company;\u2019 and due to the fact that after receiving said letter and check we and our counsel have been informed by a Texas lawyer speaking from the office of the Nebraska Insurance Commissioner, who refuses to reveal the names of his clients, that your company is proposing to sell all your lands in California to some unknown company, and the further contents of said letter, we decline to accept said check and hereby give notice that we elect to demand, and do demand, immediate payment of the entire principal of said note; and we wish to further advise you that we are forthwith taking appropriate action, in the proper Courts, to enforce your obligations to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It will be noted that plaintiffs\u2019 election to accelerate payment of the promissory note was not based upon the January 1, 1976, interest payment\u2019s tardy tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On January 26, 1976, plaintiffs filed the instant action on the promissory note seeking judgment for its principal amount and accumulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>interest. The complaint recited \u201cthat they elect to declare the entire balance of this note remaining unpaid to become and be immediately due and payable,\u201d because the January 1, 1976, interest had not been timely paid \u201cas required by the terms of said promissory note,...\u201d The January 26, 1976, letter\u2019s stated reason for election to accelerate the note\u2019s payment was not alleged. And the complaint prayed only for the promissory note\u2019s principal sum \u201ctogether with compound interest\u201d; it did not expressly seek judgment for the accrued, and accruing, interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Later on the day of the action\u2019s commencement, January 26, 1976, plaintiffs caused a writ of attachment issued therein to be levied upon Pioneer\u2019s Tehama County property consisting not only of parcel A but also of a nearby parcel to which we shall hereafter refer as parcel B.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">A principal issue of the trial was whether plaintiffs were legally empowered \u201cto declare the entire balance of [the promissory] note remaining unpaid, to become and be immediately due and payable\u201d by virtue of (1) the January 16, 1976, tardy interest payment, <em>or </em>(2) the conservator\u2019s announcement that its payment \u201cshould not be deemed or construed as an acknowledgment of the validity of the obligation or as a waiver of any defense to the obligation that may be available.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">By findings of fact and conclusions of law the trial court held against plaintiffs on those issues.  We are furnished with no record of the trial\u2019s oral proceedings and testimony; we therefore presume, for the purpose of this appeal only, that such findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence and were otherwise in accordance with law. \u201cError is never presumed, but must be affirmatively shown.\u201d <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 307, 326 [74 Cal.Rptr. 761] [affd. <em>sub nom. Neblett </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1938) 305 U.S. 297 (83 L.Ed. 182, 59 S.Ct. 170]].)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Upon the above-noted judicial determinations it followed that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, when filed, stated no existing cause of action. The trial court accordingly directed that: \u201cJudgment should be entered that plaintiffs take nothing by reason of their complaint against Educators Security Insurance Company [and],. .Pioneer Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">However, <em>before entry of judgment </em>plaintiffs were permitted, over Pioneer\u2019s objection, to file a supplemental complaint praying \u201cthat in addition to the relief requested in the original Complaint, they be grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ed judgment for the installments [of interest] due on said note and unpaid after January 1, 1976, up to the date of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Thereafter, and prior to any determination on the supplemental complaint, Pioneer moved the trial court for an order discharging the earlier attachment on parcels A and B of the Tehama County land. The motion\u2019s basis, in effect, was that\u2014the court having found that at the times of the action\u2019s commencement and of the levy of attachment, plaintiffs had no subsisting cause of action\u2014the attachment was thus \u201cimproperly or irregularly issued.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 556.) On the motion the court ruled that: \u201c[T]his court has determined that plaintiffs had no claim when the order for the writ of attachment was obtained, the order granting the right to issue the writ made on January 26, 1976 should be set aside, the attachment discharged and the property levied upon should be released. Defendant\u2019s motion is therefore granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is taken from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We observe no error. The record furnished us establishes none and, as noted, we presume that had a record of the <em>trial\u2019s </em>testimony and other oral proceedings been lodged with this court, it would have supported the order discharging the attachment. The order will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">But our inquiry is not ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">It will be remembered that plaintiffs\u2019 action and attachment proceedings appeared to have been triggered by the conservator\u2019s letter of January 13, 1976, on behalf of the Nebraska Director of Insurance, announcing a probable \u201cchange of ownership\u201d of Pioneer\u2019s assets without mention of an assumption of Pioneer\u2019s obligations by the new ownership entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">During the superior court proceedings on Pioneer\u2019s motion to discharge the attachment, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, under penalty of perjury, filed his declaration with numerous attached incorporated documents. The evidentiary allegations of the declaration were apparently <em>uncontroverted </em>in the trial court, and they are unchallenged on the appeal. No specific relief was therein sought, except that it was stated, \u201cTo <em>grant the Motion prayed for by Defendants, will leave these Plaintiffs without any enforceable </em>remedy.\u201d (Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>We find it to be in the interest of justice to treat the declaration as a request for such relief as might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The following matters were established by the declaration and its attached documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On January 22, 1976, four days before plaintiffs\u2019 action and attachment, the conservator, <em>\u201cat the </em>direction\u201d (italics added) of the Nebraska Director of Insurance, had entered into a \u201creinsurance agreement\u201d with Life of Nebraska Insurance Company (Life), a Nebraska corporation. The agreement was subject to the approval and ratification of Life\u2019s board of directors, the fact or date of which does not appear. By the agreement Pioneer, among other things, agreed to and did transfer to Life assets, including parcels A and B of the Tehama County land, of the total value of $12,720,738.95. The only assets of Pioneer not so transferred were $50,000 (apparently the estimated cost of winding up Pioneer\u2019s affairs), and a \u201cfourth mortgage\u201d of unstated and questionable value. In exchange therefor, Life agreed to \u201cassume and reinsure... all of [Pioneer\u2019s] policies and contracts of insurance,\u201d the \u201creserve liability\u201d on which was estimated by Pioneer and Life at $13,808,466.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\n<em>The reinsurance agreement made no provision for the assumption or payment by Life, or anyone, of Pioneer\u2019s obligations under plaintiffs\u2019 promissory note.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The conservator, as directed by the director of insurance, recorded with the recorder of Tehama County, January 29, 1976, Pioneer\u2019s grant deeds to Life of parcels A and B of the Tehama County land.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Later in the year, October 12, 1976, the director of insurance reported, apparently pursuant to Nebraska law, that Pioneer\u2019s total assets were $27,203.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">By virtue of the foregoing, Pioneer, an insolvent Nebraska corporation, through Nebraska\u2019s Director of Insurance and a conservator appointed by him to manage and liquidate its corporate affairs, has attempted, unilaterally, to deny to the corporation\u2019s creditors residing in California, any means of participating in Pioneer\u2019s otherwise available corporate assets, or recourse to Pioneer\u2019s real property situated in California, for satisfaction of the corporation\u2019s indebtedness to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Such a practice, we opine, is contrary to the law and well-established public policy of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Upon a proceeding for <em>\u201cwinding up\" </em>a corporation in California the court shall determine whether \u201cadequate provision has been made for payment or satisfaction of all debts and liabilities ... .\u201d (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1806.) Upon a corporate <em>\u201cmerger,\" </em>\u201cAll rights of creditors. . .shall be preserved unimpaired, ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1107.) And a corporate <em>\u201cdissolution\" </em>may generally be effected, only if the payment of its debts or liabilities, \u201cwhether the whereabouts of the creditor is known or unknown, has been adequately provided for ....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Further: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the law exacta the utmost <em>good faith between the debtor and his creditors </em>in the matter of entering into a composition agreement for the payment of debts. Such agreements rest upon the express or implied understanding that <em>all the creditors are to share in the assets of the debtor . .. .\u201d (O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Greenebaum </em>(1891) 92 Cal. 104, 107 [28 P. 214], italics added; and see <em>Kullman </em>v. <em>Greenebaum </em>(1891) 92 Cal. 403 [28 P. 674], <em>passim; Boas </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 592, 597-598 [125 P.2d 620].) And: Every conveyance made with intent \u201cto hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors, is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3439.07, and see generally \u00a7\u00a7 3439-3440.1; Pen. Code, \u00a7 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The winding up, dissolution, liquidation, or reinsurance of an insolvent insurance company is of special concern to the people of this state. <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.2d 307, 329.) By statute, when California\u2019s Insurance Commissioner becomes the conservator of an insurance company in a \u201chazardous condition,\u201d he becomes a \u201ctrustee for the benefit of <em>all creditors </em>.. ..\u201d (Ins.

But since the matter has not been litigated in the superior court, and has not been presented as an <em>issue </em>of this appeal, we make neither factual nor legal determination in reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">(We note parenthetically that neither Life, nor Pioneer\u2019s conservator, nor the State of Nebraska Director of Insurance, has sought to become a party to the instant action or appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">We observe a long-existent rule that: \u201cWhen the court discovers a fact which indicates that the contract is illegal and ought not to be enforced, it will, of its own motion, instigate an inquiry in relation thereto.\u201d <em>(Morey </em>v. <em>Paladini </em>(1922) 187 Cal. 727, 734 [203 P. 760].) \u201cWhatever the state of the pleadings, when the evidence shows that the plaintiff in substance seeks to enforce an illegal contract ..., the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>has both the power and duty to ascertain the true facts in order that it may not unwittingly lend its assistance to the consummation or encouragement of what public policy forbids.... It is immaterial that the parties, whether by inadvertence or consent, even at the trial do not raise the issue. The court may do so of its own motion when the testimony produces evidence of illegality.\u201d <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 147-148 [308 P.2d 713].) And see authority in those cases collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Such an issue of illegality or abridgment of public policy may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>(Fewel &amp; Dawes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 85, 92 [109 P.2d 650]; <em>LaFortune </em>v. <em>Ebie </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 72, 75 [102 Cal.Rptr. 588]; <em>Estate of Prieto </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 79, 85-86 [52 Cal.Rptr. 80].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We believe it would be in the interest of justice, and in accord with the public policy of this state, that upon our affirmance of the \u201corder discharging an attachment,\u201d and remand to the superior court for further proceedings on the \u201cmain relief\u201d sought by plaintiffs (see 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Actions, \u00a7 424, pp. 1255-1256), i.e., judgment against Pioneer on their promissory note, that they be permitted in that, or any proper, court to pursue further and appropriate proceedings based upon the subject matter of their attorney\u2019s declaration. (See generally, 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 554-556, pp. 4495-4497.) The parties will be permitted to file related amended or supplemental pleadings, and Life, Pioneer\u2019s conservator, and the State of Nebraska\u2019s Director of Insurance may be joined, or be permitted to intervene in the action if they or any of them shall so elect. Upon such proceedings plaintiffs may seek additional relief <em>as may be proper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We have found no merit in Pioneer\u2019s contention that the \u201corder discharging an attachment\u201d is nonappealable. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (e).) Other of its contentions have become moot by virtue of our affirmance of the order from which the appeal was taken. And Pioneer\u2019s request for an attorney fee, as provided by the promissory note and Civil Code section 1717, will be denied pending outcome of the action on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The \u201corder discharging an attachment\u201d is affirmed. The superior court will take such additional proceedings as are not inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the views we have expressed. The parties will temporarily stand their respective costs of the appeal, pending final superior court determination of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
