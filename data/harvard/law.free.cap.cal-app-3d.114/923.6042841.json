The case was tried in part by a jury and in part to the court. Judgments were entered finding certain of defendants\u2019 films obscene and granting part of the relief requested by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 731,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Santa Ana City Attorney (City) brought an action against .the owners and operators of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>the Mitchell Brothers\u2019 Santa Ana Theater (defendants) to abate a public nuisance. The City\u2019s complaint listed numerous films shown by the defendants between November 28, 1975, and March 30, 1977, all of which were alleged to be obscene. It was alleged that the showing of these films constituted a public nuisance as defined by Civil Code sections 3479 and 3480.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The City sought the following relief; that the court approve a resolution passed by the Santa Ana City Council revoking all of the defendants\u2019 operating licenses and permits; that the defendants be permanently enjoined from showing the named films; that the named films be destroyed by the state; that the box office receipts from the showing of the films be forfeited; that the defendants\u2019 theater be closed for one year; that the theater\u2019s fixtures and movable property be removed by the police and sold; that the plaintiff receive compensatory and punitive damages, and that the plaintiff recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The court ruled that the issues of obscenity, public nuisance, and damages would be decided by a jury prior to the court\u2019s resolution of the equitable remedies issues. The court reasoned that since all relief sought by the City was dependent on a prior finding of obscenity and nuisance, a \u201cprior resolution of the equitable issues would require a judicial determination of the issues of \u2018obscenity\u2019 and \u2018public nuisance\u2019 and would thus deprive defendants of a full and meaningful jury trial on the issue of damages.\u201d The jury trial itself was bifurcated. The jury first decided the issues of obscenity and public nuisance and then determined the amount of damages recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">During the obscenity and public nuisance phase of the trial, the jury viewed 17 films at the defendants\u2019 theater.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury also heard exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>sive testimony from both lay and expert witnesses. After all the evidence had been presented, the jury was read over 50 separate instructions. Included in the instructions was the requirement that a film could be found obscene only if the jurors were convinced of such \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The jury found eleven films obscene, four not obscene and could not reach a verdict on the remaining two.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">After further presentation of evidence during the damages phase of the trial, the jury was instructed on the issues of nominal, compensatory and punitive damages. The jury awarded a total of $76,400 in compensatory damages and awarded no punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Thereafter, the court issued its judgment and findings of. facts and conclusions of law on the equitable issues. The court ruled in favor of the defendants on the issues of a constructive trust on the theater\u2019s box office receipts, the revocation of defendants\u2019 license, and the closing of the theater for one year. In the City\u2019s favor, the court permanently enjoined the exhibition or advertising by the defendants of the same 11 films which had been found obscene by the jury; ordered the defendants to allow the City\u2019s officers \u201cfree and total access to all parts of the theatre\u201d for a two-year period for monitoring purposes; ordered the defendants to deposit $100,000 \u201cin trust for the City ... as a security deposit against future attorney fees, costs, and expenses incurred by the City\u201d in abating future nuisances by the defendants within a two-year period; ordered the destruction of the 11 \u201cmotion picture film prints\u201d that were found obscene; and awarded the City the recovery of $5,869.31 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In total, five notices of appeal were filed. The defendants appealed and the City both appealed and cross-appealed \u201cfrom the jury verdicts\u201d on the issues of obscenity and damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the City and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>defendants appealed from those portions of the \u201cJudgment After Trial By Court\u201d that were adverse to them. The errors asserted by the parties are too numerous to summarize at this point.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They will be dealt with at the appropriate parts of our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\n<em>Obscenity as a Public Nuisance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The defendants spend considerable time arguing that the use of equitable remedies in a civil action to abate a public nuisance is not a valid method of regulating obscenity. Although the California Supreme Court has expressly ruled contrary to this position <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Busch </em>v. <em>Projection Room Theater </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 42 [130 Cal.Rptr. 328, 550 P.2d 600], cert. den. <em>sub nom., Van de Kamp </em>v. <em>Projection Room Theater </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 922 [50 L.Ed.2d 289, 97 S.Ct. 320]), the defendants criticize the ruling as \u201cimprudent\u201d and ask us nevertheless to uphold their argument. This we cannot do. Few principles of law are more basic than that courts are bound by the decisions of those other courts which exercise superior jurisdiction. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) Since <em>Busch </em>holds that a state may regulate the exhibition of obscene matter by application of public nuisance statutes (17 Cal.3d at p. 55), we must conclude that the present action was properly brought.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\"><em>Busch, </em>however, dealt only with a trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend. And, since no reported case in this state has yet reviewed a final judgment following a full trial in a <em>Busch-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>type lawsuit, many issues regarding trial procedures and remedies in such an action remain to be addressed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">\n<em>Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The defendants contend, on a variety of theories, that the trial court erred in granting any of the relief sought by the City. The City, on the other hand, cites numerous alleged errors by the trial court that led to what it contends was a wrongful denial of other requested remedies. We need not deal with each asserted error since we hold that, in this case, injunctive relief against those movies found to be obscene is the only remedy allowable under the public nuisance statutes. Thus, the trial court erred in awarding damages to the City, in allowing the City\u2019s officer \u201cfree and total access to all parts of the theatre,\u201d in ordering the maintenance of a $100,000 \u201ctrust fund\u201d for possible future City legal costs, and in ordering the destruction of the 11 films found to be obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">This action was brought under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 731, which, inter alia, empowers a city attorney to bring a civil action \u201cto abate a public nuisance.\u201d Abatement, however, is the sole relief that section 731 authorizes the city attorney to seek. This is evident when the above quoted language is compared to the first portion of the statute. That portion allows an action to be brought by \u201cany person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by a nuisance . . . . \u201d Such a person is expressly authorized to seek a judgment where \u201cthe nuisance may be enjoined or abated <em>as well as damages recovered </em>therefor.\u201d (Italics added.) It is clear that the Legislature intended that one type of litigant could seek abatement <em>and </em>damages, while the other type of litigant could obtain abatement only. A city attorney, in an action \u201cbrought in the name of the people,\u201d fits squarely and exclusively in the latter classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The City attempts to fit itself into the class of litigants who can seek damages by relying on Civil Code section 14, which provides that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>word person includes a corporation as well as a natural person.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The City reasons that since the action was brought by the city attorney at the direction of an incorporated city, this somehow converts the action into one brought by a \u201cperson whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by a nuisance.\u201d This argument borders on the frivolous. We agree with the defendants that \u201c[w]ord games are being employed by Respondent to circumvent the straightforward provisions of the code.\u201d Since abatement is the only relief that can be granted in this case, the portion of the judgment awarding damages must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We also conclude that the other remedies granted by the trial court, except for the injunction, are inconsistent with the language of section 731. The City\u2019s arguments to the contrary appear to stem from an erroneous view of what constitutes the public nuisance that may be abated. This misunderstanding can be seen from the City\u2019s extensive argument concerning the asserted error of the trial court in refusing to close the defendants\u2019 theater for a period of time. The theater should be closed, the City contends, because \u201c[t]he suppression of nuisances injurious to public health or morality is among the most important duties of government.\u201d <em>(Phalen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia </em>(1850) 49 U.S. (8 How.) 163, 168 [12 L.Ed. 1030, 1033].) It thus appears that the City believes that it is the theater that constitutes the public nuisance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is an incorrect reading of the <em>Busch </em>decision. In <em>Busch, </em>the court states that \u201cthe <em>exhibition </em>of obscene magazines and films ... may be characterized as \u2018indecent\u2019 or \u2018offensive to the senses\u2019\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 49), talks about \u201cthe state\u2019s interests in regulating the <em>exhibition </em>of obscene matter\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 51), and concludes that \u201cpublic nuisance laws may properly be employed to regulate the <em>exhibition </em>of obscene material to \u2018consenting adults.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 53, italics added.)  Thus, the public nuisance is not the theater, nor even the obscene films <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>themselves.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is the <em>exhibition </em>of those obscene films in the theater that constitutes a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Once it is recognized that the public nuisance is nothing more than the act of exhibiting obscene films, it becomes apparent why all the remedies, save the injunction, are inappropriate. The injunction against the advertisement or exhibition of the 11 obscene films is sufficient to afford the City as full relief as is possible in a section 731 action, i.e., the abatement of the public nuisance. The $100,000 trust fund, the free access to the theater by the City\u2019s agents, the destruction of the obscene films, and the money damages are unauthorized in an action to abate a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The Supreme Court stated the governing principle in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Souza </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 825, 840-841 [243 P.2d 497]: \u201c\u2018Injunctive process ought never to go beyond the necessities of the case and where a legitimate business is being conducted and in the conduct thereof a nuisance has been created and is being maintained, <em>the relief granted should be directed and confined to the elimination of the nuisance </em>....\u2019\u201d (Italics added.) (See also <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 54, 62 [19 Cal.Rptr. 173, 92 A.L.R.2d 966]; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 577, 582-585 [269 P.2d 81, 47 A.L.R.2d 478],)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Busch </em>holds that abatement in this case is to be accomplished by a \u201cproper and suitable\u201d injunction (17 Cal.3d at p. 57) and that such abatement \u201cmust be directed to particular books or films which have been adjudged obscene following a fair and full adversary hearing, rather than against the premises in which the material is sold, exhibited or displayed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>In summary, we hold that the only purpose of a section 731 action by a city attorney is \u201cto abate a public nuisance.\u201d To accomplish anything else would be beyond the scope of such an action. The public nuisance in this case is the exhibition of obscene films. If the defendants are permanently enjoined from advertising or exhibiting the films that were found obscene, the public nuisance will have been abated. The other remedies are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\n<em>Trial Procedures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In reviewing the procedures employed in the trial court to resolve the issues of obscenity and public nuisance, we are aware of the special constitutional considerations relevant to this type of case. The United States Supreme Court has recently stated that \u201cthe regulation of a communicative activity such as the exhibition of motion pictures must adhere to more narrowly drawn procedures than is necessary for the abatement of an ordinary nuisance.\u201d <em>(Vance </em>v. <em>Universal Amusement Co., Inc. </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 308, 316 [63 L.Ed.2d 413, 420, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 1160-1161].) And, as was noted in <em>Busch, </em>\u201cthe California public nuisance statutes must be enforced in such a way as to operate in a constitutional fashion.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">It is well settled that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 484, 485 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 1506, 1507, 77 S.Ct. 1304].) But, care must be taken in determining what is obscene so as not to interfere with matter that is entitled to a constitutional shield. The job of the courts is to \u201cdistinguish commerce in ideas, protected by the First Amendment, from commercial exploitation of obscene material.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 15, 36 [37 L.Ed.2d 419, 438, 93 S.Ct. 2607].) Unarguably, this distinguishing process must include a \u201cjudicial determination in an adversary proceeding.\u201d <em>(Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 51, 58 [13 L.Ed.2d 649, 654, 85 S.Ct. 734]; see also <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, supra, </em>413 U.S. 49, 55 [37 L.Ed.2d 446, 455-456]; <em>Busch, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>At the outset, we deal with the defendants\u2019 contention that a <em>Busch </em>action cannot be maintained in this case. Defendants cite the language in <em>Busch </em>that framed the issue in that case: \u201cwe consider whether or not a civil action brought by law enforcement officers to restrain the exhibition of obscene books and films states a cause of action for relief under the public nuisance laws of this state.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 47.) Since the court did not describe the action as one to restrain the exhibition of <em>allegedly </em>obscene books and films, the defendants argue that <em>Busch </em>applies only where there has been a final judicial determinaton of obscenity prior to the filing of the public nuisance action. We disagree. It is clear that <em>Busch </em>only requires a judicial determination of obscenity as a condition precedent to the granting of any permanent injunctive relief, not as a prerequisite to the bringing of the action in the first place. We also find it significant that the two <em>post-Busch </em>cases upholding the issuance of preliminary injunctions were both actions against the exhibition of \u201callegedly\u201d obscene motion pictures. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Gow </em>v. <em>Mitchell Brothers\u2019 Santa Ana Theater, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 299; <em>In re Ward, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.3d at p. 983.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The City asserts as error the court\u2019s pretrial ruling that the defendants were entitled to a jury trial on the questions of obscenity and nuisance. We need not, however, address the issue of the right to a jury trial in <em>Busch </em>actions. If the court\u2019s ruling was error,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the City was not harmed by it and thus cannot raise it on appeal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.) Despite the court\u2019s ruling, it is clear, as even the City for some reason argues, that when the court made its order concerning the injunction, it exercised a fact-finding judgment independent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>verdicts of the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since we have held that the injunction is the only proper remedy in this case, the jury was at most an advisory body. If any party is entitled to raise the jury trial issue it is the defendants. They did not, however, raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The City also contends that the trial court erred in requiring the fact of obscenity to be proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court established the high burden of proof based on the reasoning of Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>424 U.S. 669, 678 [47 L.Ed.2d 387, 395] (conc. opn. of Brennan, J.). The City relies on <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas </em>(1887) 123 U.S. 623 [31 L.Ed. 205, 8 S.Ct. 273] to support its position that the burden of proof should be by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court that the issue of obscenity <em>vel non </em>in a public nuisance abatement action must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\"><em>Mugler </em>involved the constitutionality of a Kansas law that, inter alia, required the closing as a \u201ccommon nuisance\u201d of those buildings found by a court to be \u201c\u2018places where intoxicating liquors are manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away (123 U.S. at p. 670 [31 L.Ed. at p. 213].) In rejecting the defendants\u2019 contention that the procedures under the statute violated due process of law, the court stated: \u201cThe court is not to issue an injunction simply because one is asked, or because the charge is made that a common nuisance is maintained in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>law. The statute leaves the court at liberty to give effect to the principle that an injunction will not be granted to restrain a nuisance, except upon <em>clear and satisfactory evidence </em>that one exists.\u201d (123 U.S. at p. 673 [31 L.Ed. at p. 214], italics added.) If this were a normal public nuisance abatement action, this language from <em>Mugler </em>might be persuasive. (See e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Frangadakis </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 540, 550 [7 Cal.Rptr. 776] (burden of proof in action to abate a public nuisance under Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25604 is by a preponderance of the evidence.).) This is not, however, a normal action. As we noted earlier, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cmore narrowly drawn procedures\u201d are required when the nuisance to be abated is the exhibition of obscene films. <em>(Vance </em>v. <em>Universal Amusement Co., Inc., supra, </em>445 U.S. at pp. 315-316 [63 L.Ed.2d at pp. 420-421, 100 S.Ct. at pp. 1160-1161].) We conclude that one of the required procedures is that obscenity be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>Mr. Justice Brennan wrote a concurring opinion concerning the procedural problems involved in a civil obscenity action. In a portion of that opinion, which was joined by Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stewart, Brennan dealt with the issue of the burden of proof in such actions. (424 U.S. at pp. 683-687 [47 L.Ed.2d at pp. 398-401].) It was there concluded that \u201cthe hazards to First Amendment freedoms inhering in the regulation of obscenity require that even in ... a civil proceeding, the State comply with the more exacting standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 683-684 [47 L.Ed.2d at pp. 398-399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Although we agree with the entire \u201cburden of proof\u2019 portion of the Brennan opinion, one passage is particularly persuasive: \u201cinherent in all factfinding procedures is the potential for erroneous judgments and, when First Amendment values are implicated, the selection of a standard of proof of necessity implicates the relative <em>constitutional </em>acceptability of erroneous judgments. \u2018There is always in litigation a margin of error, representing error in factfinding, which both parties must take into account. Where one party has at stake an interest of transcending value . .. this margin of error is reduced as to him by the process of placing on the other party the burden ... of persuading the factfinder at the conclusion of the trial of [the existence of the fact] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 525-526 [2 L.Ed.2d 1460, 1472, 78 S.Ct. 1332] (1958). See, e.g., <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 369-372 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 378-380, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1075-1076] (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring). ... In the civil adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>tion of obscenity <em>vel non, </em>the bookseller has at stake such an \u2018interest of transcending value\u2019\u2014protection of his right to disseminate and the public\u2019s right to receive material protected by the First Amendment. Protection of those rights demands that the factfinder be almost certain\u2014convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014that the materials are not constitutionally immune from suppression.\u201d (424 U.S. at p. 684 [47 L.Ed. at pp. 398-399], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">One month prior to the commencement of the jury trial in this action, one of the defendants (James Mitchell) was ordered to pay $5,000 in sanctions to the City\u2019s counsel for noncompliance with earlier discovery orders.  The defendants now seek a reversal of that order.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">We find it impossible to reverse the order imposing sanctions because defendants have provided an inadequate record. The $5,000 sanction was imposed as part of the court\u2019s \u201cSecond Order Compelling Answers to Questions and Production of Documents and Things, and for Reasonable Expenses and Attorney\u2019s Fees.\u201d That order required Mitchell to answer well over 100 deposition questions and produce four different types of documents. Defendants make a broad attack on this order, claiming that the questions and documents relate to the defendants\u2019 finances and that financial information is relevant only where punitive damages are proper. The defendants cannot prevail on this issue for two separate reasons. First, the record is incomplete in that it does not contain 49 of the deposition questions that Mitchell was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>quired to answer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Second, the defendants have failed to specify how the questions and documents relate to their finances.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendants have not carried their burdens of making an affirmative showing of error by an adequate record <em>(In re Kathy P. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 91, 102 [157 Cal.Rptr. 874, 599 P.2d 65]; <em>Rossiter </em>v. <em>Benoit </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 706, 711-712 [152 Cal.Rptr. 65]) or of pointing out reversible error in their briefs <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Erickson </em>(1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 741-742 [222 P.2d 452]).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We have considered, but do not discuss, the numerous other points raised by both parties.

However, the identical definition of \u201cperson\u201d appears in Code of Civil Procedure section 17, which defines words and phrases used in the Code of Civil Procedure, of which the subject section 731 is a part.

The City\u2019s argument that this language is merely dictum which does not bind this court is unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">That obscene films are not, in and of themselves, public nuisances is recognized in <em>Busch. </em>The court noted (17 Cal.3d at pp. 51-52) the difference between <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 89 S.Ct. 1243] and the cases of <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 49 [37 L.Ed.2d 446, 93 S.Ct. 2628] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Luros </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 84 [92 Cal.Rptr. 833, 480 P.2d 633], cert, den., 404 U.S. 824 [30 L.Ed.2d 52, 92 S.Ct. 51], <em>Stanley </em>held unconstitutional a prosecution for the private possession of obscene films. <em>Paris </em>and <em>Luros </em>stated, however, that the commercial distribution of obscenity, even to consenting adults, could be constitutionally regulated. Thus, obscene films do not become legally objectionable until they are publicly exhibited or distributed. For this reason in particular, the trial court\u2019s order to destroy the 11 obscene films in this case is incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The general rule set forth in <em>Anderson </em>is of particular importance in cases, such as the present one, that involve First Amendment rights:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">\u201cAn order issued in the area of First Amendment rights must be couched in the narrowest terms that will accomplish the pinpointed objective permitted by constitutional mandate and the essential needs of the public order.

(See also <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 836 [37 L.Ed.2d 993, 93 S.Ct. 2803]; <em>Penthouse Intern., Ltd. </em>v. <em>McAuliffe </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 610 F.2d 1353, 1363 cert, dism., 447 U.S 931 [65 L.Ed.2d 1131, 100 S.Ct. 3031.) This is true despite seemingly contradictory language in cases decided contemporaneously with <em>Alexander. </em>In <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, supra, </em>the court validated civil actions .to regulate obscenity as long as the state law \u201cmeets the First Amendment standards set forth in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California.\" </em>(413 U.S. at p. 69 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 464].) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 15 [37 L.Ed.2d 419, 93 S.Ct. 2607], enunciates the test to be applied in obscenity cases, which test includes the application of \u201ccontemporary community standards.\u201d (413 U.S. at p. 24 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 431].) <em>Miller </em>also instructs that \u201c[i]n resolving the inevitably sensitive questions of fact and law, <em>we must continue to rely on the jury system, </em>accompanied by the safeguards that judges, rules of evidence, presumption of innocence, and other protective features provide ....\u201d (413 U.S. at p. 26 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 432], italics added.)

Although arguing that the burden should have been a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d for the jury trial on damages, the City states that \u201cthe burden of proof on the equitable trial should have been by \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence.\u201d We are only concerned with the burden of proof for the latter, since we hold that the injunction is the only appropriate remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Despite the City\u2019s contention to the contrary, the order is properly before this court for review. The City argues that the \u201ccollateral order doctrine\u201d (see generally <em>In re Marriage of Skelley </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 365, 368 [134 Cal.Rptr. 197, 556 P.2d 297]; <em>Sjoberg v. Hastorf </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 116, 119 [199 P.2d 668]) makes the order imposing sanctions an appealable one which was subject to review here only upon a timely appeal from that order or a petition for a prerogative writ. However, while the collateral order doctrine has been applied to make appealable orders imposing sanctions for an attorney\u2019s misconduct at trial <em>(Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626, 634, fn. 3 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942]) and for a party\u2019s failure to attend a mandatory settlement conference <em>(Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Clary </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 499, 502 [120 Cal.Rptr. 176]), it has been held not to apply to orders imposing sanctions for refusal to make discovery. <em>(Lund </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 698, 709 [39 Cal.Rptr. 891, 394 P.2d 707]; <em>Freidberg </em>v. <em>Freidberg </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 754, 764 [88 Cal.Rptr. 451]; <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Singer </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 697 [48 Cal.Rptr. 167].) Thus, the order here complained of is nonappealable on its own and may be reviewed now that a final judgment in the case has been entered. (See Code Civ.
