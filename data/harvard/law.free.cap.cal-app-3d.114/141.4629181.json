J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">On appeal from a final order granting habeas corpus relief, the People claim that the former Community Release Board (now Board of Prison Terms, herein Board) could properly consider defendant\u2019s personal use of a firearm in adding two years to the term fixed for defendant\u2019s parole eligibility on his indeterminate life sentence for conviction of first degree murder. Renewing the argument successfully advanced below, defendant contends that the challenged firearm enhancement may not be validly superimposed upon a term of life imprisonment which can only terminate upon death or pardon but not upon parole. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 3056<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 232, 243-244 [133 Cal.Rptr. 520, 555 P.2d 306]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Chi Ko Wong </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 698, 726 [135 Cal.Rptr. 392, 557 P.2d 976].) Defendant\u2019s contention fails to survive critical analysis herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In 1973 defendant, convicted in Alameda County of the first degree murder of a taxicab driver whom he had robbed, was sentenced to \u201cthe term prescribed by law,\u201d i.e., life imprisonment. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 190, 1168.) On January 3, 1979, the Board determined defendant\u2019s parole release date and calculated his period of confinement at 19 years (17 years \u201cbase term\u201d plus 2 years for firearm use). Thereafter, defendant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus seeking to compel the Board to strike the additional 2 years was granted and the Board was ordered to reduce defendant\u2019s term to 17 years. Following denial of the People\u2019s request for reconsideration, this appeal ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Relying principally on the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 232, defendant argues that the trial court acted properly in striking the firearm enhancement from defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment. The argument is wide of its mark for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">First, <em>Walker </em>arose under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) in the context of a <em>sentence </em>enhancement. Under that law, the trial court was empowered only to impose sentence for the term prescribed by law (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bruce </em>(1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 854, 857 [297 P.2d 437]), and the Adult Authority fixed the actual length of the prison term. (See former \u00a7\u00a7 1168, 3020.) In addition, a sentence under the ISL was in legal effect a sentence for the maximum term. <em>(In re Mills </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 646, 653 [12 Cal.Rptr. 483, 361 P.2d 15].) Thus, once the defendant was released on parole by the Adult Authority, he nonetheless remained in \u201clegal custody of the department [of corrections]\u201d for the duration of the maximum term. (\u00a7 3056; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Prochnau </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 22, 27 [59 Cal.Rptr. 265].) The <em>Walker </em>court reasoned that since the defendant\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment would continue until his death or pardon, logically he could never serve the additional minimum five-year penalty for firearm use which former section 12022.5 provided was to commence \u201cupon expiration or other termination of the [life] sentence .. ..\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">With the advent of the 1976 determinate sentencing law, as amended, (DSL) such line of reasoning is no longer applicable. Generally, all prison sentences, including those previously imposed under the ISL, must now be for a fixed term of imprisonment and a specific parole release date set. (\u00a7 1170.2, subds. (a), (e) and (f); <em>In re Rogers </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 429 [169 Cal.Rptr. 222, 619 P.2d 415].) Upon completion of such fixed term of imprisonment, the prisoner must be released on parole for a prescribed number of years (\u00a7 3000, subds. (a), (b)) and thereafter fully discharged (\u00a7\u00a7 3000, subd. (d), 3001). Thus, the anomalous result perceived in <em>Walker </em>(impossibility of serving enhanced term) has been effectively eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Of greater significance, the additional two years was here imposed in the required process of determining the suitable period of actual confinement prior to release on parole as distinguished from an incremental term of punishment. Under ISL principles, defendant would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>ineligible </em>for parole for a minimum period of seven years (\u00a7 3046)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; his actual period of confinement and resultant minimum eligible parole release date would have been determined by the Adult Authority after consideration of a number of relevant factors, including the seriousness of the offense, his age, his prior history of criminality, his conduct in prison and his efforts toward rehabilitation. <em>(In re Rodriguez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 652 [122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384]; <em>In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 268 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97]; <em>In re Schoengarth </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 295, 300 [57 Cal.Rptr. 600, 425 P.2d 200].) While the use of a firearm could not have extended defendant\u2019s minimum period of parole ineligibility in the absence of a clear legislative intention <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 243), it could reasonably be considered in the array of parole factors influencing the actual length of confinement. (Cf. <em>In re Stanley </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 1030, 1042-1043 [126 Cal.Rptr. 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Following enactment of the comprehensive DSL and its expressly retroactive provisions (\u00a7 1170.2, subds. (a), (e) and (f); <em>Way </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 165 [141 Cal.Rptr. 383]), the predecessor Community Release Board was required to fix a term of confinement and to set a parole release date for <em>all </em>ISL prisoners including those sentenced to life imprisonment. (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.2, subds. (a), (b) and (e), 3000, subd. (b); <em>In re Rogers, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 429.) The Board is expressly enjoined to \u201cestablish criteria for the setting of parole release dates... [including]... factors in mitigation or aggravation of the crime.\u201d (\u00a7 3041, subd. (a).) That mandate was implemented through adoption of a series of administrative regulations relating to parole suitability and parole dates for life prisoners. (See Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 2280-2292.) Pursuant to those regulations, the Board selected a \u201cbase term\u201d for defendant\u2019s confinement at the upper level of 17 years by reason of aggravated circumstances consisting of the wantonness of defendant\u2019s act and his extraordinary effort to avoid detection. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 2282, subd. (b), 2283, subd. (b).) The aggregate term of 19 years, less 16 months\u2019 conduct credit (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2290), is the result of the added 2-year component based upon defendant\u2019s use of a firearm in the commission of a \u201clife crime.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2285.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such additional term nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ther extended the statutory period of parole ineligibility (\u00a7 3046) nor carried beyond defendant\u2019s ability to serve it during his lifetime (see \u00a7\u00a7 3000, subd. (b), 3001, subd. (b)) and was properly considered by the Board in calculating defendant\u2019s period of actual confinement prior to release on parole, notwithstanding the absence of an express finding at the time of sentencing. (Cf. <em>In re Dexter </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 921, 929-930 [160 Cal.Rptr. 921, 603 P.2d 35].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the writ was improvidently granted; the order or judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Newsom, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\">All section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The prosecutor originally concluded that defendant\u2019s application was meritorious, a circumstance understandably relied upon by the trial court in rendering its decision.
