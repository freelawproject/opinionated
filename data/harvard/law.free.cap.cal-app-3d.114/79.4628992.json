The writ compelled them to grant respondent a \u201clocal safety member\u201d classification, to amend the original contract between PERS and HACLA to provide classification for respondent as a \u201clocal safety member,\u201d and to grant respondent a disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed because: (1) HACLA, under contract with PERS, intended to cover all of its employees and PERS also so intended, but by mutual error one group of employees was misclassified; (2) respondent was engaged in active law enforcement which should have qualified him under Government Code section 20020 for classification under PERS as a \u201clocal safety member\u201d; and (3) Government Code sections 20180 and 20165 provide for the correction of respondent\u2019s mistaken classification in PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The facts are as follows: On or about December 15, 1964, HACLA contracted with PERS to provide retirement benefits for HACLA employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The contract specifically provided coverage for all \u201clocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>miscellaneous members\u201d of HACLA and specifically excluded from coverage \u201clocal safety members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Respondent was hired by HACLA as a patrolman on July 6, 1971, a position he held until July 25, 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Respondent, pursuant to the aforementioned contract, was, at all times, classified as a \u201cmiscellaneous member\u201d of PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Respondent was injured in the scope of his employment in a vehicular accident on June 24, 1974. Application was made for disability retirement as a \u201cmiscellaneous member\u201d but was denied because respondent had not worked the minimum five years required to receive its benefits, he being terminated some months short of the five-year employment minimum required by Government Code section 21021: \u201cAny member incapacitated for the performances of duty shall be retired for disability pursuant to this chapter if he is credited with five years of state service, regardless of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Respondent sought coverage as a \u201clocal safety member\u201d which was denied by the executive officer of PERS because he was not convinced that respondent satisfied the qualifications for \u201clocal safety member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">At a subsequent hearing, a hearing officer appointed by PERS rendered a proposed decision, in which he found that respondent\u2019s duties did qualify him as a \u201clocal safety member.\u201d The PERS Board determined that it would decide the matter itself<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and issued its decision which inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>alia found that respondent performed duties which would qualify him as a \u201clocal safety member,\u201d but that the HACLA-PERS contract excluded such classification and therefore respondent could not be a \u201clocal safety member.\u201d Respondent thus did not qualify for benefits and disability under PERS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Respondent filed a petition for writ of mandate on October 15, 1976, and the court ordered it to issue, requiring appellants to: (1) amend the HACLA-PERS contract to provide coverage for respondent as a \u201clocal safety member,\u201d (2) reclassify respondent as a \u201clocal safety member\u201d from the date he was first employed by HACLA, (3) make any adjustments necessary with PERS to effectuate the above status for respondent under Government Code section 20165, and (4) grant respondent\u2019s application for disability retirement as a \u201clocal safety member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">HACLA and PERS appeal this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We consider first whether the trial court and PERS properly classified respondent. <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 576 [108 Cal.Rptr. 293], states: \u201cThus, whether the performance of those duties [animal control officer] \u2018clearly fall within the scope of active law enforcement service\u2019 within the meaning of the statute [Gov. Code, \u00a7 20020] becomes one of statutory interpretation <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>71 Cal.2d 907, 917 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d 33]) and we are not bound by either the board\u2019s or the trial court\u2019s determination which, though expressed as findings of fact, are but legal conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\n<em>Government Code section 20020</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">At the relevant time herein, Government Code section 20019 provided: \u201c\u2018Local safety member\u2019 includes all local policemen, firemen, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>county peace officers employed by a contracting agency who have by contract been included within this system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">To be classified as a \u201clocal policeman\u201d [local safety member] under Government Code section 20020, one must be an officer or employee of a police department and engaged in active law enforcement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The PERS Board and the trial court both found that respondent\u2019s duties met the definition of \u201clocal policeman\u201d contained in Government Code section 20020, which would have qualified him as a \u201clocal safety member\u201d for retirement purposes under Government Code section 20019. Along with this the trial court made a finding of fact that respondent was performing duties of a police officer for HACLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Appellants HACLA and PERS challenge this ruling and contend that \u201cHACLA is not an agency or district authorized by statute to maintain a police department, and HACLA patrol officers are not and never have been employees of a local police department.... Moreover, its patrol officers... had no law enforcement powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Appellants assert that HACLA patrolmen are not \u201clocal policemen,\u201d because no statute authorizes the establishment of a HACLA police department. This ignores Penal Code section 830.4, which gave HACLA police officers peace officer status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While this statute does not specifically establish a police department within HACLA, we believe it recognizes the de facto existence of one to effectuate their status.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Appellants\u2019 assertion also ignores Health and Safety Code sections 34312 and 34278.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe that implicit in these statutes is the authority for HACLA to provide security or police personnel, as required, to operate the housing projects, whether there was in fact a designated police department or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">HACLA and PERS contend that HACLA\u2019s patrolmen had none of the duties and powers of \u201cpeace officers\u201d as used in Penal Code section 830 et seq., until Penal Code section 830.4, subdivision (17)\u2014then (18)\u2014was added effective January 1975. We reject this assertion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Status under Penal Code section 830.4 as \u201cpeace officers\u201d does not deny HACLA patrolmen qualification under the retirement statute of Government Code section 20019 as \u201clocal safety members,\u201d because the purpose of Penal Code section 830 et seq., is \u201cmerely to authorize the named persons to exercise the statutory powers of a peace officer.\u201d <em>(Dyas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 628, 635-636, fn. 3 [114 Cal.Rptr. 114, 522 P.2d 674].) Obviously, police departments could exist and law enforcement powers be exercised by organizations not named in the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, </em>supra, 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 576, the court dealt with the issue of whether animal control officers for the City of San Bernardino\u2019s police department qualified as \u201clocal safety members\u201d or \u201cmiscellaneous members\u201d under Government Code sections 20019 and 20020. Implicit in its consideration is that labeling the individuals as members of a police department is not as important as whether they are engaged in active law enforcement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The key issue is whether respondent\u2019s duties were within the scope of active law enforcement under Government Code section 20020. In <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 567, the court stated with regard to defining the scope of active law enforcement: \u201cThe phrase \u2018active law enforcement service\u2019 appears in various sections of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Act.... In an opinion discussing the meaning of the term \u2018active law enforcement\u2019 for the purpose of determining eligibility as a \u2018safety member\u2019 under the County Employees\u2019 Retirement Law of 1937 (\u00a7\u00a7 31469.3, 31470.3), the Attorney General observed: \u2018... It is not possible to provide any more than a broad definition of what constitutes active law enforcement within the intendment of the County Employees\u2019 Retirement Law. We would say generally that it includes positions, the principal duties of which pertain to the active investigation and suppression of crime; the arrest and detention of criminals. .. .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577, quoting from 22 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The court found in <em>Crumpler </em>that the appellants\u2019 duties \u201cinvolved the enforcement of state and local laws and ordinances pertaining to the licensing, control and maintenance of animals.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 572.) And these duties were held to be outside of the scope of active law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Applying these standards to the duties that respondent performed, we affirm the trial court\u2019s holding that his duties involved active law enforcement as this term is used in Government Code section 20020.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Respondent was uniformed, armed and designated as a peace officer. Respondent was also required to make arrests for criminal activity occurring in and around HACLA property. In May of 1975 he was sworn in as a \u201cpeace officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">According to Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Manual of Policies and Operations for HACLA Patrol Officers, the primary duties of a patrolman are \u201c. . . the preservation of peace within the housing developments, the protection of life and property therein against attacks by criminals or injury by the careless and inadvertent offender.\u201d The manual goes on to define probable cause for arrest and to cite numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to cite numerous penal statutes which the patrolmen are responsible for enforcing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The primary duty of respondent was the \u201cactive investigation and suppression of crime\u201d and \u201cthe arrest and detention of criminals.\u201d (22 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 229.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even appellant PERS refers to respondent\u2019s duties as \u201cpolice-like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Appellants contend that HACLA patrolmen merely exercised powers of law enforcement held by private individuals. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>Dyas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 628, 633, held as a matter of law that a HACLA patrolman involved in a questionable search and seizure was not acting as a private citizen, or for a private purpose. HACLA exercised \u201cpublic and essential governmental functions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 634, citing Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 34310.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue presented there was whether a HACLA patrolman was acting as a peace officer or private citizen at a May 1, 1973, search challenged as violative of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 19, of the California Constitution. <em>(Dyas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 631-632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The court\u2019s discussion at pages 633-634 sheds light on the scope of HACLA patrolmen\u2019s duties. In that case there was testimony that HACLA patrolmen \u201c\u2018are uniformed officers and the vehicles are marked.... The uniforms are the color of the marshal\u2019s uniforms... with the standard basket weave and leather belts, badge and tie, and standard police dress.\u2019 He [the HACLA patrolman] was armed with a revolver, carried handcuffs, and had a two-way radio in his patrol car. Nor did he hesitate to use these indicia of authority in the manner in which they were intended. As we have seen he radioed for a \u2018back-up unit,\u2019 ordered defendant to stand spreadeagled against a wall, conducted a pat-down search of defendant\u2019s clothing, drew his gun when defendant resisted, arrested and handcuffed defendant on finding con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>traband, and held him in custody in the patrol car until assistance arrived. Clearly these are the acts of a law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>(Dyas, supra.) </em>The court held that the HACLA patrolman had the duty \u201c... to enforce penal statutes and regulations on or about housing authority property,. ..\u201d <em>(Dyas, supra, </em>at p. 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Respondent\u2019s law enforcement activities notwithstanding, appellant HACLA asserts that Penal Code section 830.4 establishes that respondent\u2019s classification cannot be altered, because that section\u2019s legislative intent clearly states that the classification of HACLA patrolmen under the section as \u201cpeace officers\u201d should not affect their retirement status.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, HACLA argues that Penal Code section 832.4, subdivision (b), prohibits any reclassification of HACLA patrolmen for retirement purposes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As discussed herein, Government Code sections 20019 and 20020 are the controlling sections with regard to retirement classification as a \u201clocal policeman\u201d and, hence, a \u201clocal safety member\u201d\u2014not these Penal Code sections. These Penal Code sections appear to provide only that the granting of \u201cpeace officer\u201d status should not by itself entitle HACLA patrolmen to different retirement status in another system. The provisions set forth in footnotes 13 and 14 do not prevent a mistaken retirement classification that does not fit duties actually performed from being corrected under Government Code section 20180; in fact, correction is mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Respondent\u2019s duties qualified him for \u201clocal safety member\u201d classification and we consider next how his mistaken classification can be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\n<em>Government Code section 20180</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Having determined that respondent was properly classifiable as a \u201clocal safety member,\u201d Government Code section 20180<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mandates a procedure whereby the HACLA-PERS contract must be amended to effectuate the purpose of HACLA to provide retirement benefits for respondent rather than providing respondent with no coverage at all under PERS. As we have stated, it was clearly the intention of HACLA to provide retirement coverage through PERS and both HACLA and PERS believed they had accomplished that intention. Boxx was considered a member in the retirement system and payments were made by him and for him in that respect. It likewise appeared clear that the purported exclusion of safety personnel really meant, if anything, that the parties thought they were excluding a class of employees which was nonexistent in HACLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Section 20180 requires a correction of an error where a required act was not performed because of inadvertence, oversight or mistake of fact on the retirement board\u2019s part, or the employer\u2019s part; section 20162 provides that the chief administrative officer shall furnish monthly reports to PERS; and, section 20160 requires a showing of any changes in the status of a member employee. The duty to correctly classify an employee then becomes the duty of PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, </em>supra, 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 578, the court said: \u201cThe Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Act vests \u2018the management and control\u2019 of the system in the board (\u00a7 20103) and the board is empowered to \u2018determine who are employees and is the sole judge of the conditions under which persons may be admitted to and continue to receive benefits under [the] system.\u2019 (\u00a7 20124.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>By contract, PERS had agreed to provide retirement benefits for respondent. It now claims that it did not provide such benefits although, as the trial court found, through inadvertence, mistake of fact, etc., respondent had been improperly classified for the duties he performed. Under the \u201cmiscellaneous member\u201d classification which respondent was in, he failed to qualify for any benefits, thereby being effectively excluded from PERS at the time of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">While there was no obligation to enter into the contract with PERS, once HACLA did, and once it included Boxx as a member in PERS, it became part of respondent\u2019s employment contract. <em>(Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 567, 585-586.) Inherent in this contract is the duty on HACLA\u2019s part and PERS\u2019 part to properly classify respondent. As in <em>Crumpler, supra, </em>(p. 582) HACLA was es-topped from not correcting its contract with PERS, if a correction was necessary. Concomitantly with the estoppel applicable to HACLA, PERS likewise is estopped to deny coverage. As <em>Crumpler </em>states: \u201cThe relationship between the city and the board is such that estoppel of the city is binding on the board. An estoppel binds not only the immediate parties to the transaction but those in privity with them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Hence, under section 20180, the \u201caction required\u201d was to properly classify respondent so that the duties he performed would be covered under PERS to give him its maximum coverage. This accomplishes the purpose of contracting with PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Appellant PERS contends that there is no statutory authority for imposing \u201clocal safety member\u201d coverage without consent of the local agency under Government Code section 20461. This contention is without merit, as appellant\u2019s reliance on this section is misplaced. Section 20461 is not, by its terms, exclusive in its coverage, providing one method of correcting mistakes in a contract, amendment by suitable resolutions of the parties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Section 20461 appears to be merely a codification of the well established rule in contracts, that two parties may modify an agreement entered into at a later date to correct errors. <em>(Texas Co. </em>v. <em>Todd </em>(1937) 19 Cal.App.2d 174, 185 [64 P.2d 1180].) Government Code section 20180 provides another method to correct respondent\u2019s erroneous classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">In <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 567, employees classified as \u201clocal safety members\u201d years later had their classification changed to \u201cmiscellaneous members\u201d by administrative board decision. On a writ of mandate to compel reversal of this classification, the court held that the board was estopped from reclassifying the employees as of the date of their initial classification for the retirement system, but held that the board could reclassify prospectively, from the date of their decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As to the ability to correct the erroneous classification, the court stated at page 586: \u201cPetitioners have no vested right in an erroneous classification. Indeed, as we have noted, the act [Gov. Code, \u00a7 20180] expressly provides for correction of errors such as occurred in the instant case. The provisions of section 20180 being as much a part of the contract of employment as other provisions of the retirement act, exercise of the power conferred by the section involves no violation or impairment of petitioners\u2019 contractual or vested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">It was therefore the obligation and intent of HACLA to properly classify respondent, and, had it done so, he would have been covered by appropriate provisions of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System. Likewise, it is clear that PERS intended to provide coverage for all HACLA employees. It was only upon the erroneous premise that HACLA had no local safety personnel that respondent was erroneously classified. Prior to respondent\u2019s termination, however, <em>Dyas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 628, had determined that HACLA did in fact have safety personnel qualifying them as safety members within PERS.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The correction due to error should have been made then, and, had it been made, there would have been no issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">While appellants have other contentions, they are without merit. Government Code sections 20165 and 20461 provide the vehicle to correct the errors of the accounting system of HACLA and PERS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>regarding respondent. In compliance with these sections and Government Code section 20180, we hold that the HACLA-PERS contract can be corrected to accurately reflect respondent\u2019s classification as a \u201clocal safety member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Respondent is entitled to be granted disability retirement as a \u201clocal safety member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The trial court\u2019s judgment ordering the issuance of a writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Kaus, P. J.., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 26, 1981, and appellants\u2019 petitions for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied March 11, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Section 20492 of the Government Code provides in part: <em>\u201cRequired inclusion of employees: Agreement for, and disapproval of, exclusions: Compulsory membership.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u201cThe contract shall include in this system all firemen, policemen, county peace officers, and other employees of the contracting agency, except as exclusions in addition to the exclusions applicable to state employees may be agreed to by the agency and the board. Such exclusions shall be based on groups of employees such as by departments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>duties or age, and not on individual employees, and such exclusions of groups may be made by amendments to contracts, with respect to future entrants into such a group. The board may disapprove the exclusion of any group, if in its opinion the exclusion adversely affects the interests of this system. Membership in this system is compulsory for all employees included under a contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Section 20492 is a provision of part 3 of the California Government Code, and therefore is a provision of the \u201cpart\u201d spoken of in section 20180.

This argument fails, for the governing date of whether Boxx is entitled to disability retirement as a safety member is the date of injury, not separation from employment, and recognition of peace officer status is shown by Boxx being sworn in as a peace officer in May 1975, which was after his injury and during his activity as a radio operator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The court had evidence before it that a wholly separate \u201cAnimal Control and Parking Department\u201d has been established from the police department.
