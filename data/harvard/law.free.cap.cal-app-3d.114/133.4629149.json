J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8q\">Appellants include nine organizations and Kathleen Connolly, an individual. They petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate which would require respondent state officers to collect specified data from certain entities transacting the business of insurance in California. The court sustained general demurrers to the petition, without leave to amend, and entered a judgment dismissing appellants\u2019 action. They appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In light of the procedural sequence described, the only question on the appeal is whether the petition states a cause of action. <em>(Glaire </em>v. <em>La Lanne-Paris Health Spa, Inc. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 915, 918 [117 Cal.Rptr. 541, 528 P.2d 357].) In assessing its sufficiency for that purpose, we must treat the demurrers as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241]; <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Palo Alto Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1979) 91 Cal. App.3d 871, 889 [154 Cal.Rptr. 591].) The latter qualification means that the demurrers did not admit the truth of various argumentative passages in the petition relative to \u201cabuses\u201d and failures of regulation claimed or assumed to exist in the California insurance industry. (Cf. <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, 329 [253 P.2d 659]; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>City of Mountain View </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 332, 342 [136 Cal.Rptr. 8].) We nevertheless include some of these passages in our summary of the petition to provide a context.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The pleading is entitled \u201cPetition For Remedial Writ Of Mandate.\u201d The respondents named in it are the \u201cSecretary of Business and Transportation,\u201d the \u201cCommissioner of Insurance,\u201d and the \u201cCommissioner of Real Estate.\u201d Appellants allege or assert in it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201cThis mandamus government accountability action seeks to compel respondents\u201d to \u201c[a]dhere to their legislative mandate to protect the. public\u201d; to \u201c[c]ease abdication of responsibility to supervise the State insurance industry, its multi-billion real estate actions [sic], and its anti-trust and civil rights violations\u201d; and to \u201c[c]ease governmental \u2018benign neglect\u2019 of housing and insurance consumers.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">It is alleged that \u201c[individual petitioner Kathleen Conholly sues as a citizen, resident, and taxpayer of the State of California, with a substantial interest in the question of public interest presented in this case\u201d; as \u201ca female purchaser of insurance and housing\u201d; and as \u201cthe Director of petitioner Women Organized For Employment.\u201d The so-called \u201c[organizational petitioners\u201d are collectively described as \u201ca broad coalition of consumer, minority, and womens\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>organizations\u201d which are \u201cnon-profit California corporations or associations... substantially interested in the question of public interest presented.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Appellants allege that the \u201caction is also brought as a representative action on behalf of the members of said organizations,\u201d the majority of whom would \u201cbenefit from enforcement\u201d of specified statutory provisions \u201cagainst...practices of the California insurance industry\u201d which assertedly include discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and wealth in the establishment of insurance rates, underwriting, selling, employment, and mortgage lending; and \u201cconflicts of interest among insurance .. . corporations\u2019 Boards of Directors via interlocking directorates which stifle competition and increase the cost of insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The petition continues: \u201cAdditionally, the insurance industry\u2019s vast real property ownership in California supports multi-billion dollar profits [which have] not been recorded by any of respondents\u201d and which have been enhanced by an excessive \u201cestimated Proposition 13 annual tax saving to the California insurance industry.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These profits \u201cshould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>be rebated to consumers\u201d pursuant to statute. \u201cThis petition merely seeks to compel these officials [respondents] to.. <em>.gather the minimum data necessary </em>for proper future industry regulation.\u201d (Original italics.) Appellants have repeatedly requested that respondents do this, but their requests have been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">It is further alleged in the petition\u2014and argued at length\u2014that respondents have a duty to collect the desired \u201cdata\u201d by reason of specified statutory provisions discussed later in this opinion. In their prayer, appellants request a writ of mandate commanding respondents \u201cto jointly present\u201d to the superior court, within 60 days, \u201ca plan for the gathering of the.. .data in the most expeditious manner possible.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Appellants\u2019 contend that their petition states a cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.  That statute provides a remedy in mandamus \u201cto compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.....\u201d The remedy is distinctively called \u201ctraditional mandamus.\u201d (Cal. Civil Writs (Cont.Ed.Bar 1970) \u00a7 5.1, pp. 62-63.) It will lie to compel action by a person only if he has a clear, present and \u201cusually ministerial\u201d duty to take the action. <em>(Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 803, 813 [25 Cal.Rptr. 798] [citing <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 317 at p. 326]; <em>Reinbold </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 433, 438 [133 Cal.Rptr. 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Recognizing this limitation on the remedy, appellants broadly contend that the \u201cone issue to be heard on this appeal\u201d is whether each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>respondent has \u201cshirked a mandatory duty\u201d by not collecting the \u201cdata\u201d addressed in their petition. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>The specific question is whether the asserted \u201cduty\u201d is imposed on any of the respondents by law. Appellants contend that it is imposed on respondent Real Estate Commissioner by Business and Professions Code section 10055; on respondent Insurance Commissioner by sections 790.04, 790.05, 790.06, 790.10, and 1852 of the Insurance Code; and on respondent Secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency by section 13979 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">It is not feasible to quote these statutes in full because of their number and length. It is also unnecessary.  As to respondent Real Estate Commissioner, Business and Professions Code section 10055 must be read in context with sections 10050 and 10054 of the same code. Section 10050 identifies him as the \u201cchief officer\u201d of the Department of Real Estate. It also provides that his \u201cprincipal responsibility\u201d is the enforcement of the Real Estate Law regulating licensees of the department (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10000 et seq.) and of the law regulating real estate transactions <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 11000 et seq.) \u201cin a manner which achieves the maximum protection for the purchasers of real property and those persons dealing with real estate licensees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Section 10054 provides that the Real Estate Commissioner \u201cshall\u201d appoint \u201ca Real Estate Advisory Commission.\u201d Trailing in this context, section 10055 provides in pertinent part that he \u201cshall\u201d meet with the Real Estate Advisory Commission \u201con the functions and policies of the [Department [of Real Estate] and how it may best serve the people of the state and recognize the legitimate needs of the industry which it regulates and the licensees of the department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Appellants paraphrase the language of section 10055 as providing that the Real Estate Commissioner \u201cmust \u2018develop functions and policies of.. .his department\u2019 to \u2018best serve the people of the state. ...\u2019\u201d (We here quote their opening brief verbatim.) On this basis, they argue that he has a mandatory duty to collect the \u201cdata\u201d in question from the insurance industry sources addressed in this proceeding. The paraphrasing is an unwarranted departure from the plain meaning of section 10055 and its statutory context cited above. The argument is an unsupported assumption that the Real Estate Commissioner has any duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u2014mandatory or ministerial\u2014to collect the desired \u201cdata\u201d from sources engaged in a business which is not within his regulatory authority at all. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>He obviously has no such duty. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10000 et seq., 11000 et seq.) Appellants have accordingly stated no cause of action in mandamus against him. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">As to respondent Insurance Commissioner, section 790.04 provides that he \u201cshall have power to examine and investigate into the affairs of every person\u201d in the business of insurance \u201cto determine whether such person has been or is engaged\u201d in certain practices proscribed in section 790.03.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 790.05 provides that he \u201cshall\u201d charge a person, and order a hearing, when he has \u201creason to believe\u201d that the person is so engaged; and that he \u201cshall\u201d order the person to \u201ccease and desist\u201d if the \u201ccharges or any of them are found to be justified\u201d in the proceeding. Section 790.06 provides that he \u201cmay\u201d initiate a similar proceeding against a person in the insurance business if he has \u201creason to believe\u201d the person has been or is engaged in \u201cunfair\u201d practices \u201cnot defined in Section 790.03\u201d <em>and </em>that the proceeding would be \u201cin the interest of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Section 790.10 provides in pertinent part that the Insurance Commissioner \u201cshall... promulgate reasonable rules and regulations... as are necessary to administer\u201d the provisions which precede it. Section 1852 provides in effect that he \u201cshall\u201d take an insurer\u2019s \u201cexpenses\u201d into consideration in discharging his statutory duty to determine whether the rates it charges for insurance are \u201cexcessive.\u201d (See \u00a7 1850; \u00a7 1852, subds. (a), (b), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As to respondent Secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency (hereinafter Secretary), Government Code section 13979 provides in general terms that he \u201cshall\u201d advise the Governor on various \u201cprograms to accomplish comprehensive, long-range, coordinated planning and policy formulation in the matters of public interest related to the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Respondents Insurance Commissioner and Secretary are thus charged by the respectively cited statutes with the performance of \u201cduties\u201d which may be described as \u201cmandatory,\u201d particularly where it is provided that specified action \u201cshall\u201d be taken. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 16; Gov. Code, \u00a7 14; <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Felt </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 156, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>161-163 [127 Cal.Rptr. 381].) The \u201cduties\u201d are nevertheless defined in the broadest of terms, and the Legislature has not specified any procedures to be employed in their performance. The Legislature\u2019s silence as to <em>method </em>necessarily imports that each of these officers is invested with <em>discretion </em>in selecting and taking administrative action pursuant to the statutes reaching him. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Fund American Companies </em>v. <em>California Ins. Co. </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 423, 431 [117 Cal.Rptr. 623].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Appellants have not alleged in their petition that either of these two respondents has failed to perform the duties explicitly exacted of him by any of the various statutes cited: the objective of the petition is to compel each to perform them in a particular way by collecting the \u201cdata\u201d desired. The remedy of \u201ctraditional mandamus\u201d provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 will not lie to control the <em>manner </em>in which an administrative officer is to exercise discretion lawfully entrusted to him. <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 237, 247 [115 Cal.Rptr. 497, 524 P.2d 1281]; <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 317 at p. 326; Cal. Civil Writs, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 5.26, pp. 80-81; see, generally, <em>Clunie </em>v. <em>Siebe </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 593, 597-598 [44 P. 1064].) The trial court correctly determined that the petition does not state a cause of action for the relief prayed in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A passage in appellants\u2019 reply brief suggests that they are charging respondent Insurance Commissioner at least, with having <em>abused </em>his discretion by arbitrarily failing to collect the \u201cdata\u201d in question. No authority is cited for the suggestion, it is raised in the reply brief for the first time, and no cause is shown for the failure to raise it earlier. Perceiving no merit in it, we decline to consider it. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 425 [p. 4391], 442 [pp. 4405-4406].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Poch\u00e9, J., and Koford, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">These passages of the petition are footnoted with a statement that \u201c[a] 11 insurance industry practices set forth herein are based on information and belief.\u201d The passages are among those which are not deemed admitted by the demurrers in any event. <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal.

(See <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 218 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The prayer refers the reader to an exhibit which is attached to the petition.
