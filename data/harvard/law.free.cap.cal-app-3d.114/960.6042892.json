He was sentenced to state prison for the upper term on the robbery count; sentence on the assault charge was stayed under the provisions of Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The evidence discloses that appellant utilized a female companion to entice the victim to take his wallet out of his pocket to give the female money for a taxi. Once the wallet was produced, appellant grabbed it and thereafter- struck the victim several times, knocking him down. When the victim regained his footing, appellant knocked him down again and proceeded to kick him. The victim suffered short lapses of consciousness. He was taken to a hospital with a severe bruise of his head, a cut lip, and bleeding mouth. He was hospitalized for 24 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A primary thrust of appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is that Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a) is unconstitutional in that it is so vague in its definition of the constituent elements of \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d that it does not provide adequate guidance for the fact finder. The statute here provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Every person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three or four years, or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The essential language as it pertains to this case has been the law in California since 1874. Its constitutional sufficiency has been unsuccessfully challenged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spreckels </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 507 [270 P.2d 513]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Covino </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 660, 668 [161 Cal.Rptr. 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The language in Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a) \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d and contained in Penal Code section 12310 relating to the use of explosives is given a close scrutiny in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Poulin </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 54 [103 Cal.Rptr. 623]. We quote liberally from pages 59-60 of that opinion since all that is said therein applies to our case. \u201cLack of precision itself, in a criminal statute, is not offensive to the requirements of due process. \u2018\u201c[T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\u201d; all that is required is that the language \u201cconveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices....\u201d [Citation.]... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>\u201c... That there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine the side of the line on which a particular fact situation falls is no sufficient reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a criminal offense....\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 491-492....)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\u201c\u2018A statute is not necessarily invalid even though in its definition some matter of degree may be involved; it will not generally be held invalid if the language is sufficient to enable the attorney to explain to his client and advise what questions may be left to the determination of the jury, so that he will be able to govern himself accordingly; neither is it necessary that the words have a universally recognized meaning; that the charging words will ordinarily be held sufficient if their meaning can be fairly ascertained by references to similar statutes or other judicial determinations, or by reference to the common law, or to the dictionary, or if the words themselves had a common and generally accepted meaning; that the long continued use of words in a statute without question as to their sufficiency creates a presumption that they have come to be well understood by those to whom they apply.... That the courts will consider the underlying purpose of the law and although it might desire a little more certainty, as a general rule the court will uphold the validity of the statute and interpret it to the best of its ability, particularly when any attempt to make it more specific and certain, would tend to nullify its fundamental purpose.... that where the statute involves some matters of degree as to which individuals and even jurors might reasonably disagree in their judgment, the statute will not for that reason alone be invalidated,...\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniel </em>(1959) 168 Cal.App.2d Supp. 788, 797-798. ...)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cWith the foregoing principles in mind, the term \u2018great bodily injury\u2019 is sufficiently certain and definite to meet the constitutional requirements.\u201d We hold that Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a) is not impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Appellant further attacks his conviction upon the ground that the jury should have been instructed <em>sua sponte </em>as to the meaning of the words, \u201cgreat bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that without such an instruction, the jury was left with insufficient guidelines to determine the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>It is axiomatic that a jury must be properly instructed, <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary, as to the essential elements of the crime charged. We believe that the trial court in this case did so instruct the jury in the giving of CALJIC Nos. 9.00, 9.02, and 9.05.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">It is necessary to distinguish the line of cases which deal with the types of assaults in which there is a likelihood that great bodily injury will result and those cases which, for example, impose enhancements for the actual injury inflicted. The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274] provides a clearly defined watershed. Contrary to appellant\u2019s arguments, the <em>Caudillo </em>case does not reach the issue before us. In that case, the court was concerned only with the injuries actually inflicted, holding essentially that the physical injuries there inflicted did not demonstratively assume the proportion of great bodily injuries and that the infliction of mental suffering, however grave, could not support a finding of great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Here, the test both in the nature of the charging allegations and in the instructions given was whether there was a likelihood that the assault would result in great bodily injury. It is the likelihood, not the actual production of injury, which is the focus of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a). In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Covino, supra, </em>100 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>App.3d 660, where the injury was produced by a choking attempt which left little physical evidence of injury, the court commented at page 667: \u201cWhile it is true that \u2018when the evidence shows that a blow has been struck or a physical injury actually inflicted, the nature and extent of the injury is a relevant and often controlling factor in determining whether the force used was of a felonious character\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 348, 358...; <em>People </em>v. <em>Muir </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 598, 604.. .; see 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 272 p. 255), an injury is not an element of the crime, and the extent of any injury is not determinative. \u2018The crime.. .like other assaults, may be committed without infliction of any physical injury, and even though no blow is actually struck. [Citation.] The issue, therefore, is not whether serious injury was caused, but whether the force used was such as would be likely to cause it.\u2019 <em>(Id.; People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169, 176.. .; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dewson </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 119, 132....)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In our case, the kicking on the head and torso of a largely defenseless man on the ground appears to us to be unmistakably an assault which a jury could reasonably find was likely to produce great bodily harm. And here, of course, the injuries inflicted bear out that fact. In addition to the cuts and bruises and the unconsciousness produced, the victim received a blow to the forehead which produced a large welt. If this blow had struck the nearby eye, it might well have produced blindness in that eye, surely a great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We do not believe that any instructional amplification on the words \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d would have significantly enlightened the jury. In the last analysis, it is the jury\u2019s province to determine what the ultimate product of the assault might have been. It was clearly within the jury\u2019s province to determine that appellant intended to kick his victim with whatever force was required to permit appellant to accomplish his purpose, the robbery of his victim. No amount of \u201chair splitting\u201d would or should have deterred the jury from its task of deciding whether the assault as the jury heard it described was likely to have resulted in \u201cgreat bodily injury.\u201d The jury was not required to determine if the injuries actually inflicted could be described as great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Words can obfuscate as well as clarify. Additional instructions may have confused rather than enlightened. We seriously doubt that the mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>lions of words which have been written upon the subject of the Ten Commandments have added significantly to our understanding of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Zenovich, Acting P. J., and Hanson (P.
