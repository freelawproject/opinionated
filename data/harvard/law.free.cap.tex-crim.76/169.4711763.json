In this respect the indictment copied in the record reads as follows: \"did then and there unlawfully with malice aforethought make an assault in and upon Lela Stinson with the intent then and there to murder the said Lela Stinson against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d The motion to quash is based upon the statement in the motion that the word \"intent\u201d as copied in the transcript was written as follows, \"inten,\u201d omitting the \"t\u201d from the end of the word. There is a bill of exceptions which recites that the word \"intent\u201d was written as claimed by appellant in the motion to quash. It is further recited that the court permitted the district attorney to add the letter \u201ct\u201d to the word in the indictment. Of course the district judge was not authorized to do this, and if the matter was fatal to the indictment the mere fact that the court permitted the district attorney to place the letter \u201ct\u201d at the end of the word \"intent\u201d, would not be cured by such addition. The writer, however, does not believe that the mere fact that the letter \"t\u201d was added by authority of the district judge invalidates the indictment or makes it any stronger or better than if such action had not been taken. The indictment will be treated as if the unauthorized letter \"t\u201d had not been' added to the word intent. We are of opinion, however, from this standpoint, under our authorities this ought not to require a reversal of the judgment. We think this indictment is sufficient, and sufficiently charges assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>with intent to murder, whether the <em>\u201ct\u201d </em>was added or left out. So believing we believe there is no merit in the contention. A statement of facts does not accompany the record. In the condition it is presented to us we are of the opinion there is no reversible error, therefore the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b199-6\">[Rehearing denied March 3, 1915.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
