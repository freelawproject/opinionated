Under the statute and many decisions of this court, the money as described was amply sufficient. Arts. 458 and 468, C. C. P.; Ferrell v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 487, 152 S. W. Rep., 901; Sims v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 435; McAdams v. State, 172 S. W. Rep., 792, and cases cited in these.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The evidence was ample to show and justified the jury to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that said Van Bur\u00e9n, the alleged robbed party, lived alone and had for several years in a one-room hut at the outer edge of the town of Brackett about a half mile from the town, or hotel of appellant\u2019s mother in said town; that in some way in the course of a number of years he had accumulated several hundred dollars in money, which he carried in two purses on his person,\u2014in one was gold, in the other currency. Van Bur\u00e9n and appellant had both lived in Brackett for some twelve or fifteen years. Van Bur\u00e9n was a white man about seventy years old, having in his younger days been a soldier. Appellant was a negro man who worked for his mother in the hotel she ran. Van Bur\u00e9n had known appellant for all these years and ever since he was a boy. On the evening of June 14, 1913, before the alleged robbery that night, Van Bur\u00e9n and appellant were in the saloon of Mr. Bivers in Brackett. Van Bur\u00e9n had, shortly prior thereto, ordered a pair of pants and they had been sent to Bivers, the saloon-keeper, for him. While in the saloon on this occasion Bivers told him that his pants had come, and to look at them, which Van Bur\u00e9n did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was pleased with them and proposed to pay for them. Bivers informed him that the pants cost $4.50. Van Bur\u00e9n told him he didn\u2019t have the change but gave him a government check from the paymaster for $45, out of which Bivers took the $4.50 and delivered to Van Bur\u00e9n at tire time $40 in gold in change,\u2014four $10 gold pieces, which he placed in the purse where he carried his gold. As \u25a0 stated, appellant was in the room at the time and doubtless saw and heard all this. Van Bur\u00e9n, after returning to his shack, removed his clout in the pockets of which he kept his said money, threw it under his bunk and proceeded to prepare and eat his supper. After eating, just before night, while sitting in his yard at his door, he swore, appellant came up to him, accompanied by another negro man, whom he did not recognize at the time; that he did recognize appellant; that appellant asked him for a match and he handed him a match. Appellant at the time had a \u201cbig stick, a big long stick, looks like a paling.\u201d That after the robbery Van Bur\u00e9n found this stick in his house and he identified it and it was introduced in evidence on the trial; that as soon as he got the match he and his companion left, going in the direction of another house; that appellant, in some minutes thereafter, returned to Van Buren\u2019s and asked him where a certain Mexican lived. Van Bur\u00e9n pointed out the Mexican\u2019s house to him and gave him directions as to how to get there; appellant then again left him. It seems he returned a second time and told him that the Mexican for whom he inquired was not at home, and Van Bur\u00e9n told him that he-thought the Mexican was in town at a show or circus; that appellant again left him; that after waiting around some time and attending to a call of nature, he prepared to go to bed; that as he was at his door in the act or intending to go in, he was grabbed by someone who was within his shack, jerked into his shack, knocked down, the door closed, when some large man got on top of hinp jerked a blanket off of his bed and threw it over his head and face and held him down; that there was no light in the room and with the door closed it was. quite dark; that at the time he was dragged in and knocked down, while he knew there were two persons, he did not know who either was; that while being held down by one of them, the other struck a match and attempted to light his lantern; that by the light of the match he saw and recognized the party with the match and lantern as Sam Jefferson, and that while the match was lighted he managed to get the blanket from over his eyes so that he could see and did see that the man who was on him holding him down was the appellant. That Jefferson then procured the clout, took both purses of his money and that the two then fled; that the blow which felled him stunned him; that as soon as they turned him loose and he could he got up, attempted to get his gun and find the parties; that he couldn\u2019t find his gun; that it turned out that they had also taken the gun, he finding the stock thereof in his yard the next morning and the barrels in the chaparral near the house; that the parties went out the door on one side and in attempting to pursue them, he ran out the other and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>while he could hear them running and getting away, he could not apprehend him; that as soon as he got up he got his clout where they had thrown it on the floor and saw that they had robbed him of all his money which, as stated, was about $70 in gold and the other in currency. The exact time of this alleged robbery was not fixed, though Van Bur\u00e9n' testified, as we understand, that it was about or after 9 o\u2019clock at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">In the trial appellant insisted that the court should give a charge on circumstantial evidence and asked such special charge in writing,\u2014 his No. 3. It starts out with this statement: \u201cYou are instructed that in this case the State relies for a conviction on circumstantial evidence alone,\u201d and then proceeds with such charge as is usually given when circumstantial evidence alone is relied upon. Instead of giving such charge as appellant, requested and urged should be given, the court, in paragraph 10, charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201c10. If you believe from the evidence that the witness William Van Bur\u00e9n did not see defendant, Will Terrell, on the inside of his (Van Buren\u2019s) house at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, as testified to by said Van Bur\u00e9n, or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, then you are charged that the State would rely and depend wholly upon circumstantial evidence to convict the defendant, and in this connection you are charged.\u201d He then followed this with paragraph 11, which would have been a correct charge if circumstantial evidence alone had been introduced and the State had relied on that alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In addition to excepting to the court\u2019s refusal to give his charge on circumstantial evidence, appellant excepted to that which the court did give, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u201cDefendant objects to that portion of paragraphs 10 and 11 of said charge wherein the court instructs the jury that the case of the State would depend upon .circumstantial evidence alone only in the event that the jury believe from the evidence that William Van Bur\u00e9n did not see defendant, Will Terrell, on the inside of his, Van Buren\u2019s, housat the time of the commission of the alleged offense, whereas the court should charge upon circumstantial evidence as is requested in defendant\u2019s special charge No. 3, and because said charge as framed is upon the weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Under the statute as it now is, this court, as well as the appellant, is bound by the objections made in the lower court at the time of the trial. Any additional objections that may be made in this or the lower court after the trial, can not be considered. So that we consider and pass upon the said objections made at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">There is and can be no doubt but that Van Bur\u00e9n, the State\u2019s witness, in his direct examination, swore positively and unequivocally that he saw, knew and identified appellant as the person who was in his house at the time he was robbed and was on him and held him down while appellant\u2019s companion proceeded to actually get his money. He\" not only swore that, as stated, in his direct examination, but ift his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cross-examination of Mm, appellant had him to state again and again specifically, as m one instance, \u201cit is true that I testified on direct examination that Bill Terrell (appellant) was the man that held me down. Q. And that you saw him by the match? Yes, I found out that he was the man that held me down, yes, sir.\u201d And at another time, in his cross-examination, he had him state: \u201cI made the statement that there was a heavy portly man sitting on top of me; I didn\u2019t know who he was till the light showed him up. . . . Certainly, yes, I reeogMzed him then.\u201d The appellant put said witness through a very lengthy, searching and severe cross-examination, seeking by that, as contended by appellant, to break down and discredit what he had so positively testified on direct examination; and to convince the jury and trial judge of the said witness\u2019 \u201cwillingness to swear to his beliefs and theories, vagaries and imaginations as positive facts,\u2014not perhaps from a design to falsely testify, but because of the tendency of such minds to conceive as true that which is a mere impression or pure imagination.\u201d As a part of said cross-examination he would ask him over and over again if he did not testify on the examining trial, just a few days after the alleged robbery, to certain things which would tend to show that the witness did not identify the appellant at the time as one of the robbers, and in impeachment of him, introduced the said several statements by appellant in his testimony on the examining trial. All this had more or less tendency to impair the said positive unequivocal testimony of Van Bur\u00e9n in his direct examination positively identifying appellant as the person who helped to rob him and who, he said, held him down while the other man got his money. Yet, there can be no sort of doubt but that, taking all of the testimony, both direct arid cross, the State\u2019s case did not depend solely upon circumstantial evidence and in our opinion no charge on circumstantial evidence should have been given. The trial judge ought to have refused outright appellant\u2019s charge on that subject and should have given none himself. But should have submitted the case on this question on the theory of positive and not circumstantial evidence. It is evident to us from the court\u2019s charge, and from this whole record, that the trial judge endeavored his utmost to be fair to the appellant and to give him the advantage of everything in his favor that he possibly could. Hence, he gave said charge on circumstantial evidence preceded by said paragraph 10. We think there can be no question but that a charge on circumstantial evidence was in appellant\u2019s favor and not against him. We also think that the said paragraph 10 was also in his favor and not against him. What the court said in said paragraph 10, we think can not be construed as on the weight of the evidence, but if so, it was on the weight in favor of appellant and not against him. As stated, there can be no shadow of doubt from this record but that said Van Bur\u00e9n, on his direct examination, did testify positively and unequivocally that appellant was on the inside of his house at the time he was robbed and the whole drift of said cross-examination of him was to break him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>down on that point. So that the court in said paragraph 10 tells the jury \u201cif you believe\u201d (but did not tell them \u201cif you believe beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) from the evidence that said Van Bur\u00e9n did not see appellant on the inside of bis house at the time of the alleged robbery, \u201cor if you have a reasonable doubt of it, then you are charged that the State would rely and depend wholly upon circumstantial evidence.\u201d In every way by this charge, charging in appellant\u2019s favor, the court left the whole question to the jury and did not charge on the weight of the evidence against appellant, but if at all, in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">Such being the case, then what is the law applicable thereto? We think the law is settled against appellant as shown by Judge White in section 807 of his Ann. C. C. P., which we quote as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u201cThough there are decisions of this court holding that an erroneous charge which inures to the benefit of the accused, if excepted to, constitutes reversible error, a proper construction of articles 715, 716 and 723 (now articles 735, 736 and 743 by the Act of April 5, 1913, page 278) does not warrant such conclusion where the error excepted to is harmless or beneficial to the defendant. (The contrary doctrine in Surrell v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 321; White v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 71; Jenkins v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 86, and Habel v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 71, disapproved.) Green v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 298. A judgment of conviction will not be reversed for improper instructions given in favor of defendant. Wright v. State, 41 Texas, 246. On a trial for murder, where the evidence establishes murder in the first degree, defendant can not be heard to complain that the court gave him a charge upon murder in the second degree. Briscoe v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 464. A defendant who has been convicted of manslaughter can not claim any possible injury from a charge on mutual combat, even if such charge be not required by the evidence, and a charge upon imperfect self-defense, though it may not have been called for the evidence, can do no possible harm where there is no self-defense in the case. Gonzales v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 33. A specific portion of the charge of the court may be erroneous, but when it is more favorable to the accused than he was entitled to upon the particular questions indicated the accused has no grounds to complain.

State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 566, 161 S. W. Rep., 101; Coker v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 504, 3 60 S. W. Rep., 366. It is needless to cite the many other cases to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Appellant had some other objections to the court\u2019s charge. We have examined them all. It is needless to state them. We think none of his objections are tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The only other matter necessary to notice is shown by appellant\u2019s tenth bill of exceptions. It is somewhat lengthy. We state the substance of it. It shows that his mother, Martha Terrell, upon direct examination, testified that on the night she afterwards learned the robbery charged in the indictment occurred, between 8 and 10 o\u2019clock appellant was at her hotel in company with her on the gallery, and that while there a soldier applied to her for lodging; that she sent the appellant with him to show him a room across the street kept by her for her patrons; that upon cross-examination the district attorney asked her if she had made any effort to procure the attendance of this soldier as a witness for her son. She answered that she had not, that she did not know the name of the soldier. Thereupon, appellant offered in evidence an application made through his counsel for process to said county for one Corporal Stormer, describing him as a corporal and a member of gun platoon, Fourteenth Cavalry, United States Army, and his location at Fort Clark; and also the subpoena issued for said witness on November 5, 1913, together with the return thereon showing the witness not to have been served. (This trial occurred in November, 1914.) Upon the objections of the district attorney to said application and subpoena on the ground that there was nothing to identify the man from whom the process was issued as the soldier testified about by Martha Terrell, the court excluded them. That in the argument before the jury, the district attorney called attention to the fact as a circumstance that said soldier was not produced as a witness to corroborate the witness Terrell, appellant\u2019s mother, and that so far as the record showed no effort was made to procure the attendance of that soldier as a witness. Whereupon, appellant at the time again proposed to introduce in evidence said application and subpoena for said Corporal Stormer, which the court refused, to which appellant excepted. The court, in allowing this bill, did so with this qualification and explanation: \u201cThat I informed the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time that I would permit the introduction of said testimony if testimony should be offered that the said Stormer was, or was supposed to be the soldier who lodged at the Terrell Hotel on the night in question.\u201d Having accepted the bill with this qualification it shows no error. Surely, if Stormer was not said soldier or supposed to be, the fact that more than a year before this trial a subpoena had been issued for him and not served, would not have been admissible for any purpose, and the court correctly excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We have carefully considered the record in this case in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>with appellant\u2019s able attorneys\u2019 oral argument and strong brief in this case, but we have reached the conclusion that there is no reversible error shown and, therefore, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">April 7, 1910.</p>\n<author id=\"b464-8\">PRENDERGAST, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">Appellant presents but one question in his motion for rehearing. That is, he contends that paragraph 10 of the court\u2019s charge, quoted in the original opinion, is on the weight of the evidence, which entitles him to.a reversal. He presents the question from his viewpoint in an unusually clear and forcible way.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Among other cases he cites Stephens v. State, 10 Texas Crim. App., 120; Owens v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 391, claiming the first is peculiarly parallel to this case. Besides these, he cites other cases on the general proposition that where a charge is upon the weight of the evidence, it is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">We have carefully considered these cases and the question again and are still of the opinion that while said charge Ho. 10 should not have been given, giving it does not present reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">At the time,\u2014in 1881\u2014when the Stephens case was decided, our statute (art. 735, C.

P.) prescribed: . . . \u201cThe judge shall deliver to the jury a written charge in which he shall distinctly set forth the law applicable to the case; but he shall not express any opinion as to the weight of the evidence. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Article 736 was: \u201cIt is beyond the province of a judge, ... to discuss the facts or use any argument in a charge calculated to rouse the sympathy or excite the passion of a jury. It is his duty to state plainly the law of the case.\u201d Both of these articles, in the respects quoted, are.precisely the same now as they were then.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Article 743 then was as follows:. \u201cWhenever it' appears . . . that any of the requirements in the eight preceding articles have been disregarded, the judgment <em>shall be reversed; </em>provided, the error is excepted to at the time of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">The language and substance of that article as it now is, is the reverse practically of what it then was, for it now is, that whenever either or both of said articles 735 and 736, \u201chave been disregarded, the judgment <em>shall not be reversed, </em>unless the error appearing from the record was calculated to injure the rights of the defendant, or unless it appears from the record that the defendant had not had a fair and impartial trial,\u201d and objection must also now be made at the time of the trial like the original article required.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">So that as the statute stood when the Stephens case was decided, it said \u201cthe judgment <em>shall be reversed.\u201d </em>It now says, it <em>\u201cshall not be reversed, </em>unless,\u201d etc. At first, when the said article 743, as it was before 1897, this court in several cases (Surrell v. State, 29 Texas Crim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>App., 321; White v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 71; Jenkins v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 86, and Habel v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 71, and others) held that where said articles 735-736 or either had been disregarded if timely excepted to this court had to reverse, notwithstanding the disregarding of said articles by the judge\u2019s charge was harmless to appellant or in his favor. Soon after the amendment of said article 743, by the Act of March 12, 1897, was made, this court disapproved the doctrine held in said cases and specifically held in Green v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 298, that where said articles 735-736, or either, had been disregarded, but the error by the court was harmless, or inured to the benefit of the accused, although excepted to, no reversible error was -presented. Since then this court has uniformly so held in many decisions unnecessary to collate. We cited and quoted Judge White on this subject in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The inhibition of article 735 is, the \u201cjudge shall not express any opinion as to the weight of the evidence.\u201d And by article 736 he is inhibited \u201cto discuss the facts or use any argument in his charge calculated to rouse the sympathy or excite the passion of the jury.\u201d Appellant does not contend that the judge by giving charge Ho. 10, violated article 736, and he does not claim that the judge by that charge discussed the facts or used any argument in his charge calculated to rouse the sympathy or excite the passion of the jury. But he does claim that he violated article 735 in that he claims said charge \u201cas framed, is upon the weight of the evidence.\u201d He did not \u201cdistinctly specify,\u201d as the statute requires, how or wherein it was \u201cupon the weight of the evidence.\u201d How then, what did he tell the jury by this charge? He told them: \u201cT.f <em>you </em>believe (not that he believed or disbelieved) from the evidence that the witness William Van Bur\u00e9n did not see defendant on the inside of his, Van Buren\u2019s, house at the time of the commission of the alleged offense as testified to by said Van Bur\u00e9n, or if <em>you </em>have a reasonable doubt thereof, etc.\u201d By this charge he neither expressly nor by implication told the jury that he believed said Van Buren\u2019s testimony on this point. He left that exclusively for the jury. We think by no reasonable implication could the jury conclude that the judge believed Van Bur\u00e9n when he so testified. On the contrary, by implication the mere submission of the question to the jury would imply to them that he, the judge, <em>did not believe </em>Van Bur\u00e9n when he so testified. If the jury understood the judge to imply anything, it was that he, the judge, doubted the truthfulness of Van Buren\u2019s testimony on this point; otherwise he would not, in any contingency, have given them a charge on circumstantial evidence. Suppose he had said to the jury in express language: <em>\u201cI </em>believe Van Bur\u00e9n is mistaken or testified falsely when he said appellant was in his house at the time he was robbed, but leave the question for <em>you </em>to decide.\u201d Clearly that would have been expressing his opinion of the testimony, but in <em>appellant\u2019s favor </em>and <em>not against Mm. </em>In effect that is what he did tell the jury. This would give \u25a0 the State cause to complain, but not appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>But let us consider the Stephens case, supra, which appellant claims is so directly in point in his iavor. In that case the purported confessions were testified to by a witness whose character and reputation for truth and veracity were assailed by two witnesses and other facts; the judge charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThe confessions of the defendant are in evidence before you, and if in your best judgment you shall give no credit to the witness who professed to detail them, you will then look to the other testimony in the case and apply it to the rules relating to circumstantial testimony.\u201d If the judge in his charge had stopped there, Judge White doubtless would have held that no error was committed, but he did not stop there. He went further and said as a continuation of the question just above: \u201cIf you give credence to the witness who professed to detail the confessions, <em>you need not apply to the evidence those rules as to circumstantial testimony.\u201d </em>It is this latter part which in that case resulted in reversal, Judge White stating specifically the reasons, as follows: \u201cIt was in effect, if not in fact, tantamount to telling the jury \u2018if you believe the testimony of the witness who has testified to defendant\u2019s' confession, then you will <em>not loolc to or consider the other evidence in the </em>case/ <em>This was, in the contingency mentioned, depriving the defendant of the benefit of any testimony offered by him, by requiring the jury not to looh to or consider it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In this case the court did not charge this latter part or anything like it, but instead: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the witness Van Bur\u00e9n did not see defendant, Will Terrell, on the inside of his (Van Buren\u2019s) house at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, as testified to by said Van Bur\u00e9n, or if you have a reasonable doubt of it, then you are charged that the State would rely and depend wholly upon circumstantial evidence to convict the defendant, and in this connection you are charged,\u201d then proceeded to give them a correct charge on circumstantial testimony. The judge in this case did not, as the judge in the Stephens case did, tell the jury that if they believed Van Bur\u00e9n they need not apply to the evidence the rules as to circumstantial testimony, which makes quite a different thing. If the judge in this case had told the jury as Judge White said was done in the Stephens case, \u201cIf you believe the testimony of Van Bur\u00e9n, when he testified he saw Will Terrell in his house, when he was robbed, then you will not look to nor consider the other evidence in the case,\u201d then this case would have been parallel to the Stephens case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">A careful analysis of the Owens case, supra, will show that there is an equally as marked difference between that and this case than we have shown exists between this and the Stephens case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Besides, it is elementary that the whole charge is to be considered when any particular paragraph of it is attacked. (Christian v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 566, 161 S. W. Rep., 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">How the judge in this case correctly told the jury the law of robbery, and required the jury \u201cto believe from the evidence (which means all the evidence) beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d every essential fact necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to show that appellant was guilty of the offense charged in this case before they were authorized to convict and only when they so believed this from all the evidence, could they convict him. In addition, he charged alibi in appellant\u2019s favor. Further, that the burden of proof was upon the State; that the defendant was presumed to be innocent until his guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt, and in case &lt;ryou have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, you will acquit him,\u201d and further told them they were the exclusive judges of the facts proved, of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be given to their testimony. So that we still think charge Ho. 10 was not upon the weight of the evidence, but if so, that it was upon it in appellant\u2019s favor and not against him; and, further, that in no event does it present reversible error taken in connection with the whole charge of ihe court. The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
