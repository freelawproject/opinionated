He introduced the judgment of the County Court on the habeas corpus proceeding and the capias issued thereon, and also introduced evidence that relator was under sixteen years of age at the time of said trial and conviction. The relator also introduced his plea to the jurisdiction of the County Court on account of non-age, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-16\">The facts and the opinion of the court thereon, passing upon the questions involved therein, are fully set out in said former opinion.

He appealed the case to'this court and it was affirmed. (McCallan v. State, 76 Texas Crim. Rep., 353, 174 S. W. Rep., 611.) Every question raised on this application for habeas corpus was passed on in the opinion by this court on the former appeal, and we do not deem it necessary to do so again, but merely refer to that opinion. We can not understand why the County Court entertained jurisdiction of the writ when the questions raised, and all the questions raised, were passed on in the former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
