Rep., 924; Ex parte Ben Micher, recently decided, and cases cited in opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-15\"><em>G.

There was no information filed, appellant was tried only on the complaint. Motion in arrest of judgment was based on the failure of the county attorney to file a complaint [information]. This was overruled by the court, it seems, on the theory that appellant had gone to trial without raising the objection that the information had not been filed. This is not a valid reason. Nor did it constitute waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">The Constitution, article 5, section 17, among other things, provides that \"prosecutions may be commenced in said court by information filed by the county attorney, or by affidavit, as may be provided by law.\u201d The Legislature has provided in article 35, Code of Criminal Procedure: \"If the offense be a misdemeanor, the attorney shall forthwith prepare an information, and file the same, together with the complaint, in the court having jurisdiction of the offense.\u201d The same authority has further provided in article 448, Code of Criminal Procedure: \"All misdemeanors hot be presented by either information or indictment.\u201d And article 449 provides: \"All offenses, known to the penal law of this State, must be prosecuted, either by indictment or information. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>provision does not include fines and penalties for contempt of court, nor special cases in which inferior courts exercise jurisdiction.\u201d Article 478 sets out the required allegations in an information. Article 479 provides that the information shall not be presented by the district or county attorney until oath has been made by some credible person, charging the defendant with an offense. The oath shall be in writing and filed with the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The Legislature is vested with authority, doubtless, to prescribe that \u25a0the case may be tried, in misdemeanors, in the County Court- without filing an information under the language -of articles 5, 6 and 17 of the Constitution or it may require that the information be filed. This has not only not been done but the opposite is required. The Legislature has provided that the information shall be filed based upon a complaint or affidavit. This would settle the question beyond dispute. Construing the Constitution and the statutes the courts have invariably held that the County Court can not acquire jurisdiction or try a misdemeanor where it originated in the County Court, until an information has been filed. See Garza v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 410; Kinley v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 532; Leal v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 425; Baker v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 52. This court will reverse a conviction from the County Court where an information was not filed in that court, provided the case originated in the County Court, whether there was a motion made in the trial court or not. It is a jurisdictional question. An information is as prerequisite under such circumstances in the County Court as is the indictment in a felony prosecution in the District Court. To hold that a party could waive an information in the County Court would be equivalent to hold substantially that the party could waive an indictment in a felony prosecution. The invalidity of a prosecution originating in the County Court without an information has been decided so often and has become so thoroughly the settled law it is deemed unnecessary to discuss the matter or cite further authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b70-8\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">I concur in reversing. An information can not be waived. (See Deon v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 435; Garza v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 410, and Leal v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 425.) Our Constitution provides (sec. 17, art. 5): \u201cProsecutions may be commenced - (in misdemeanor cases) by information filed by the county attorney, or by affidavit, as may be provided by law.\u201d The law has provided under this Constitution (art. 229, C. C. P.) : \u201cFor all misdemeanors an indictment or information may be presented within two years from the commission of an offense, and not afterward.\u201d Article 448: \u201cAll misdemeanors may be presented by indictment or information.\u201d Article 449: \u201cAll offenses known to the penal law of this State must be presented either by indictment or information.\u201d The only instance in which, under our law, a prosecution may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>be had without an indictment or information, is in those instances in which the Justice Courts' or other inferior courts are given jurisdiction, and the eases are filed in those courts. In every instance where the case is filed in the County Court the law requires an information to be filed, and it can no more be waived than an indictment can be waived in the District Court. Article 477 defines an information as a written statement filed and presented in behalf of the State by the district or county attorney accusing the defendant therein named of an offense which is by law subject to be prosecuted in that manner. Article 478 gives the requisites of an information, while article 479 provides that an information shall not be presented by the district or county attorney until oath has been made by some credible person charging the defendant with an offense. Howhere in the Code is a prosecution authorized in the County Court upon the mere filing of an oath, but instead article 35 provides that upon filing the oath or complaint the county attorney shall forthwith prepare and file an information. While under the Constitution the Legislature might have provided for a prosecution without an information, but they did not do so, but provided that in each and every instance an information must be filed in each case in the County Court. A plea of guilty can not be accepted until information is filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b71-3\">PRENDERGAST, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">(dissenting).\u2014Judge Davidson\u2019s statement of case is incorrect. The solemn judgment of the court in overruling appellant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment states clearly: \u201cThe said motion is refused and overruled for the reason that this case having gone to trial with the defendant, by his attorney, Henry Faulk, both present in court, <em>waiving the filing of the information, </em>and all other formalities, and announced ready to try case <em>on complaint </em>just filed, which defendant and attorney were present in court.\u201d And this is in no way disputed. It was not \u201con the theory that appellant had gone to trial without raising the objection that the information had not been filed,\u201d as stated by Judge Davidson. He and his attorney both <em>expressly waived the filing of an </em>information, and agreed to try the case <em>on the complaint. </em>This is a companion case of No. 3365, James Ethridge, this day decided, and the two cases are precisely the same, only different defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">For my views on the question raised and decided I refer to my opinion in said James Ethridge case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
