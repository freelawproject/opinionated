And in the absence of a statement of facts there is but one question we can pass on, and that is the motion to quash the information. The information follows the language of the statute, and the court properly overruled the motion to quash it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
