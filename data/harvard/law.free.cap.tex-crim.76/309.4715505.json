He said he would let me know. I went from there to Williams\u2019 store and then left there and went across the public square towards Brown\u2019s blacksmith shop. I met defendant, he got out of the hack he was delivering beef in; as I walked up to the hack Earnest Davidson and also the defendant told me I woiild find it where I got the other (meaning a tub nailed up against the fence or house). I went there and got a pint of whisky out of the tub and took it straight to the sheriff and gave it to him. I had gotten a pint from him the evening before. I have had a great deal of trouble with these people and was afraid they would injure me.\u201d The sheriff testified that he gave Zack Alvis two dollars to buy whisky; that he was trying to catch the defendant, as he thought he was selling whisky unlawfully; that he saw defendant and another man drive up in front of Brown\u2019s blacksmith shop and stop, and the defendant got out at this time;.that he saw Zack Alvis going in the direction of the blacksmith shop; that someone saw him, the sheriff, and he did not see anything more of either of the parties; that in a short time Zack Alvis came to him, the sheriff, with a bottle of whisky and said he had bought it from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">The defendant denied selling any whisky, and sought by other witnesses to contradict Alvis\u2019 testimony as to his movements, etc., at the time.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-7\">No brief on file for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-8\"><em>G.

No special charges were requested, and there is no complaint of the charge of the court as given. So the only thing we can consider is, will the testimony sustain the verdict? If the jury believed the testimony of Zack Alvis, and it appears they did, it clearly showed a sale of whisky by appellant to Alvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
