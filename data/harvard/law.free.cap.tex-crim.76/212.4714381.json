But it will be noticed that the offense denounced is the procuring of a female person to <em>become or remain </em>in a <em>house </em>of ill-fame, or <em>enter </em>any <em>place </em>in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed. There is no allegation that defendant caused Mrs. Houseman to become or remain an inmate of a house of ill-fame, or enter a place where prostitution is encouraged or allowed. Ho matter how reprehensible the acts of a defendant may be, in this State it is provided by the Penal Code (art. 3) that in order that the system of penal law in force in this State may be complete within itself, and that no system of foreign laws may be appealed to, it is declared that no person shall be punished for any act or omission unless the same is made a penal offense by the written law of this State. The allegations contained in the above indictment do not charge a violation of any law of the State, and appellant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained, the judgment set aside, and the cause dismissed because the indictment charged no offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Should it be desired to prosecute appellant further, it will be necessary to return a new indictment, and as the evidence for the State would show that appellant procured men to go to his home and have sexual intercourse with his wife, making a charge therefor, the indictment should allege that appellant by fraud and artifice and by duress of the person of Mrs. Andrew Houseman, and by the abuse of his position of confidence and authority as husband of Mrs. Andrew Houseman, he, the said defendant, did procure the said Mrs. Andrew Houseman, a female person, to become and remain an inmate of a house of ill-fame, and he, the said defendant, did procure, by the means aforesaid, Mrs. Andrew Houseman, a female person, to enter a place in which prostitution was encouraged and allowed in this State. This is not laid down as a form of indictment, but merely as suggestive of the necessary allegations to be made in this character of case, for it is made evident by the State\u2019s testimony that appellant\u2019s house had become a house of ill-fame and a place where prostitution was encouraged and allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
