Barnes argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred at Step Five of his disability determination by failing to make specific written findings regarding transferability of skills as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 82-41. We last addressed the scope of SSR 82-41 in\n   <em>\n    Bray v. Commissioner of Social Security Administration\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683112\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1219/#p1223\">\n    554 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1223-26 (9th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We now revisit the subject to consider a question that did not arise in\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   : whether SSR 82-41 obligates the ALJ to make transferability of skills findings where, unlike\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   , no Grid rule states that a person with the claimant's age, education, and work experience is disabled absent transferable skills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that it does and reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2012, Barnes filed an application for DIB and SSI, alleging disability from multiple impairments, including chronic pain and swelling in his left leg and respiratory disease that required the use of supplemental oxygen. He has a high school education and worked previously as a machinist, a skilled position, and an off-bearer, an unskilled position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Social Security Administration (\"the Administration\") denied Barnes's application, and, on December 31, 2013, he had a hearing before an ALJ. At the time of the hearing, Barnes was 47 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The ALJ issued a written decision on January 15, 2014. Applying the familiar five-step process,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ALJ determined that (1) Barnes had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date; (2) his morbid obesity, respiratory\n   diseases, disorders affecting his leg, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and mental disorders were severe impairments; but (3) those impairments did not meet or medically equal the criteria of a listing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before reaching Step Four, the ALJ found Barnes had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform sedentary work with several restrictions. For example, he needed to \"sit or stand for 2 to 3 minutes at a time at 30 to 45 minute intervals, during which period he may remain on task,\" could never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and had to avoid even moderate exposure to potential respiratory irritants. Applying that RFC, the ALJ concluded at Step Four that Barnes was unable to perform his past relevant work as a machinist and an off-bearer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At Step Five, the ALJ stated that Grid rules 201.21 and 201.28 would direct a finding of \"not disabled\" based on Barnes's age, education, and work experience. However, he acknowledged that the Grids could be used only as framework because \"additional limitations\" made Barnes unable to perform the full range of sedentary work. The ALJ therefore called upon a vocational expert (\"VE\"), who testified that someone with Barnes's age, education, work experience, and RFC could perform two representative jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy: \"semi-conductor assembler\" and \"production clerk.\" Both are semi-skilled positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neither the ALJ nor the VE stated what skills, if any, Barnes had acquired from his past work and whether those skills were transferable to the semi-skilled jobs identified. The ALJ simply stated, \"Transferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability because using the Medical-Vocational Rules as a framework supports a finding that the claimant is 'not disabled,' whether or not the claimant has transferable job skills.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the VE's testimony, the ALJ concluded Barnes was able to perform other work and therefore was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied Barnes's request for review, making the ALJ's decision final. The district court affirmed, concluding: \"Because the Grids direct a finding of 'not disabled' regardless of whether Plaintiff has transferable skills, the ALJ was not required to decide whether Plaintiff's job skills were transferable.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

The issue of skills and their transferability therefore needed to be decided before the ALJ could find Barnes not disabled based on his ability to perform semi-skilled work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Barnes's past relevant work included a skilled job, the ALJ made no finding regarding what skills, if any, Barnes had acquired from that work and whether his skills were transferable to semi-skilled work as a \"semi-conductor assembler\" or \"production clerk.\" The ALJ therefore erred by failing to make the written findings required by SSR 82-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commissioner argues transferability of skills was not material because the Grids \"directed a finding of 'not disabled' whether or not Barnes had transferable skills.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to the two Grid rules cited by the ALJ, she relies on Grid rules 201.22 and 201.29. Together, these four rules provide that a \"younger individual age 45-49\" or a \"younger individual age 18-44\" with the ability to perform the full range of sedentary work, a high school education, and skilled or semi-skilled past relevant work is not disabled whether he has transferable skills or no transferable skills.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App'x 2, rules 201.21-.22 (\"younger individual age 45-49\") and 201.28-.29 (\"younger individual age 18-44\"). The argument is without merit. To explain why, we consider how the Grids apply in the case of an individual who, like Barnes, is unable to perform the full range of sedentary work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Grids were designed to relieve the Commissioner of the need to rely on a vocational expert in every case to establish the number of jobs available to a person with the claimant's physical ability, age, education, and work experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckler v.

Reasoning that individuals with similar characteristics could perform similar work, the Administration took notice of specific jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy and could be performed by claimants who fit a standard pattern.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298743\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/458/#p461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298743\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/458/#p461\">\n    at 465-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298743\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/458/#p461\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Grids are organized into three tables corresponding to sedentary, light, and medium work. Each table has five columns. The first column contains a rule\n   number, and the second through the fourth delineate the claimant's age, education, and work experience (for example, unskilled, none, skilled, semi-skilled, and \"skills transferable\" or \"skills not transferable\"). The fifth column renders a conclusion of either \"disabled\" or \"not disabled.\" In Table No. 1, for sedentary work, a rule's conclusion of \"not disabled\" means that a claimant with those characteristics can perform the approximately 200 sedentary, unskilled jobs that the Administration has determined exist in significant numbers in the national economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 96-9P,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374185\">\n    1996 WL 374185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ; 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App'x 2 \u00a7 201.00(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Of course, not all claimants fit neatly into the categories established by the Grids. In particular, each of the three Grid tables encompasses specific strength requirements, or \"exertional limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lounsburry v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8456052\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/1111/#p1115\">\n    468 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (9th Cir. 2006). However, significant \"non-exertional limitations\" such as \"pain, postural limitations, or environmental limitations\" that do not result in strength limitations may \"limit the claimant's functional capacity in ways not contemplated by the guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 1102. Reliance on the Grids alone will then be inappropriate. Instead, the ALJ must determine, in consultation with a VE, which jobs a claimant can still perform \"considering his or her age, education, and work experience, including any transferable skills or education providing for direct entry into skilled work.\" 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App'x 2 \u00a7 201.00(h)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The unskilled jobs contemplated by the Grids provide a \"framework,\" or starting point, for that inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 96-9P,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374185\">\n    1996 WL 374185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-5. In that sense, the Grids may assist the ALJ by establishing a universe of unskilled positions for consideration. If the claimant does have transferable skills from past work or relevant education, skilled and semi-skilled jobs also may be considered. But the Grids can never direct a conclusion of not disabled for a claimant with significant additional limitations not contemplated by the Grids.\n   <em>\n    Lounsburry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8456052\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/1111/#p1115\">\n    468 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 1102 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, as the ALJ acknowledged, Barnes had additional limitations not contemplated by the Grids. For example, his need to alternate sitting and standing at frequent intervals is a \"significant non-exertional limitation not contemplated by the grids.\"\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 1103-04. Given these additional limitations, the ALJ could not rely on the Grids to direct a finding of not disabled. And because the Grids did not direct a conclusion regarding disability, they did not permit the ALJ to conclude that transferability of skills was immaterial under SSR 82-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nothing we said in\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   supports a contrary view.\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   shares two important features with this case.

Second, the ALJ found, both here and in\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683112\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1219/#p1223\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683112\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1219/#p1223\">\n    at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the claimant was not disabled because he or she could perform semi-skilled work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   had a third feature that this case lacks. A Grid rule stated that a person with Bray's age, education, and work experience was disabled without transferable skills.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683112\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1219/#p1223\">\n    554 F.3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Grid rule 202.06 states that a person of \"advanced age\" who has a high school education and skilled or semi-skilled work\n   experience but no transferable skills is disabled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, rule 202.07 states that a person of the same age, education, and work experience who\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   transferable skills is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disabled. If the ALJ had found no transferable skills, rule 202.06 would have directed a finding of disability. For that reason, we stated that transferability of skills was \"dispositive\" under SSR 82-41, and the ALJ therefore erred by failing to make the requisite findings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683112\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1219/#p1223\">\n    554 F.3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, by contrast, no Grid rule directed that a person with Barnes's age, education, and work experience was disabled absent transferable skills. Barnes was 47 at the time of his ALJ hearing, had a high school education, and had past relevant work that was skilled and unskilled. His RFC limited him to less than the full range of sedentary work. Grid rule 201.21 states that a \"younger individual age 45-49\" with a high school education, skilled or semi-skilled work experience, and no transferable skills is not disabled. Rule 201.22 states that a person of the same age who has the same education and work experience but also has transferable skills is likewise not disabled. Under either rule, the result is no different. Thus, for Barnes, unlike Bray, a lack of transferable skills could not trigger a Grid rule that directed a conclusion of disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   did not purport to identify the only situation in which transferability of skills will be dispositive. In light of the applicable Grid rules there, we did not need to decide whether a finding that the claimant could perform semi-skilled work was itself sufficient to require written findings under SSR 82-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the Commissioner ignores an important consequence of using the Grids as a framework. \"[A] finding of\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   [under the Grids] ... must be accepted by the [Commissioner] ....\"\n   <em>\n    Lounsburry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8456052\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/1111/#p1115\">\n    468 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

That is, if a person who lacks the claimant's additional, non-exertional limitations is disabled, then the claimant is certainly disabled and \"there is no need to examine the effect of the non-exertional limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538260\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/880/1152/#p1157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the opposite is not true: the Grids as a framework \"may not be used to direct a conclusion of\n   <em>\n    nondisability\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538260\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/880/1152/#p1157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, in the case of a claimant with additional limitations not contemplated by the Grids, a rule stating that the claimant is\n   <em>\n    disabled\n   </em>\n   will be dispositive, while one stating that the claimant is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disabled will not. In\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   , the former type of rule would have bound the ALJ if Bray lacked transferable skills. Here, the latter type applied, and the ALJ went on to find Barnes not disabled based on his ability to perform semi-skilled work.

Assuming the VE took transferable skills into account is precisely what SSR 82-41 prohibits, for the explicit reason that it makes the ALJ's Step Five determination unreviewable.
