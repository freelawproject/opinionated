BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Yahoo!, Alibaba, and the ICA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Back in 1995, Yahoo! helped pioneer what the Supreme Court calls \"the Cyber Age.\"\n   <em>\n    Packingham v. North Carolina\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1736\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1736,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1736\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Using (for its time) cutting-edge technology, Yahoo! enabled people to visit websites previously inaccessible except to the most internet savvy. Its promise as an internet search company was so bright, in fact, that the 2000 movie\n   <em>\n    Frequency\n   </em>\n   featured Yahoo! as the stock for the next millennium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Of course, Hollywood doesn't always get it right. Although Yahoo! has fared better than dot-com busts like eToys and Pets.com, Yahoo!'s search engine technology turned out to be closer in value to the Ark of the Covenant at the end of\n   <em>\n    Raiders of the Lost Ark\n   </em>\n   than the Apple stock that Lieutenant Dan purchased in\n   <em>\n    Forrest Gump\n   </em>\n   . Today we \"Google\" things-we do not \"Yahoo!\" them (or \"Alta Vista,\" \"Excite,\" or \"Dogpile\" them for that matter). But during its marketplace decline this century, Yahoo! made a savvy $1 billion investment in Alibaba.com, a Chinese retail website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Alibaba burgeoned into a behemoth. Alibaba was so successful that by 2012 Yahoo! was able to sell just over half of its Alibaba stock for $7.1 billion. And when Alibaba conducted its initial public offering in 2014, $9.4 billion more flowed into Yahoo!'s coffers essentially overnight. By 2016, Yahoo!'s remaining stake in Alibaba was worth some $27 billion. That figure dwarfed the value of Yahoo!'s internet business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Investments in Alibaba and other ventures (such as Yahoo! Japan) would normally subject Yahoo! to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"ICA\"). The ICA permits the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\" or \"the Commission\") to regulate more rigorously the activities of enterprises that qualify as investment companies under section 3(a) of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northstar Fin. Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Invs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n    615 F.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109-12 (9th Cir. 2010) (detailing the ICA and describing it as \"provid[ing] comprehensive regulation of investment companies and the mutual fund industry\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-3(a). Such enterprises must register with the SEC. If they do not, section 7(a) forbids them from, among other things, \"engag[ing] in any business in interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 80a-7(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Any would-be investment company can try to avoid the ICA's registration requirements, however. Section 3(b)(2) empowers the SEC, \"upon application,\" to exempt such a company from the ICA's requirements, if the SEC \"finds and by order declares\" the company \"to be primarily engaged in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 80a-3(b)(2). But what the SEC giveth, the SEC taketh away. Section 3(b)(2) further provides that, \"[w]henever the Commission, upon its own motion or upon application,\n   finds that the circumstances which gave rise to the issuance of an order granting an application [for an ICA exemption] no longer exist, the Commission shall by order revoke\" the exemption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After entering into a joint venture to create Yahoo! Japan, Yahoo! applied for an ICA exemption from the SEC. The SEC granted Yahoo! a \"temporary exemption\" in April 2000 and then issued a \"permanent order\" exempting Yahoo! from the ICA a few months later. Yahoo!'s ICA exemption came with strings attached. Yahoo! could only make investments \"for bona fide business purposes\" and had to \"refrain from investing or trading in [securities] for short-term speculative purposes.\" Despite those conditions, Yahoo!'s investment in Alibaba, and filings detailing Yahoo!'s Alibaba holdings, the SEC has not revoked Yahoo!'s ICA exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   UFCW sued in January 2016, alleging that Yahoo! had violated the conditions of its ICA exemption by investing in Alibaba and, as a result, that Yahoo! had \"been operating as an unregistered investment company\" in violation of the ICA since at least 2013. Based on that allegation, UFCW brought derivative claims against an array of Yahoo! higher-ups, and one direct claim against Yahoo! itself. UFCW sought to (1) rescind the higher-ups' employment contracts, (2) enjoin Yahoo! from further performing contracts signed in violation of the ICA and from selling any material assets, and (3) recover damages for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite acknowledging that exempted companies must comply with the conditions of their ICA exemptions, the district court concluded that the ICA provides \"no role for the courts to find, in the first instance, that a company should be stripped of its exemption and therefore deemed an unregistered investment company.\" For that reason, the district court held that UFCW's claims \"all fail as a matter of law\" and dismissed UFCW's suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   UFCW conceded below and acknowledges on appeal that its claims all rely on the allegation that Yahoo! violated the conditions of its ICA exemption by investing in Alibaba. But because no provision of the ICA establishes a private right of action for challenging the continued validity of an ICA exemption, UFCW's claims fizzle faster than Flooz.com.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

So for a start, that language does not expressly establish a private right of action, as \"nothing in the text of the section makes any mention of [one].\"\n   <em>\n    In re Digimarc\n   </em>\n   , 549 F.3d at 1230 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b) (expressly establishing private right of action not applicable here by providing that \"[a]n action may be brought\"). Instead, section 47(b) on its face merely establishes what it says: that contracts formed in violation of the ICA are usually unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   , 677 F.3d at 186-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   UFCW would nevertheless have us read section 47(b) as implying a private right of action for any party to any contract allegedly formed in violation of any ICA provision, rule, regulation, or order to sue for rescission of that contract. That we cannot do. In\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   we held that the structure of the ICA forecloses reading the statute as implying a private of action \"to enforce the individual provisions of the Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n    615 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff v.

And although we did not specifically address section 47(b) in\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   , our reading of the ICA there demands that we reject UFCW's reading of the ICA here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ICA empowers \"the SEC to enforce all of the provisions of the [statute] by granting the [SEC] broad authority to investigate suspected violations; initiate actions in federal court for injunctive relief or civil penalties; and create exemptions from compliance with any ICA provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n    615 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-6(c), 80a-41. Congress, for that matter, has demonstrated in this very statute that it \"knew how to create a private right of action to enforce a particular section of the [ICA] when it wished to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n    615 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ICA expressly authorizes \"private suits for damages against insiders of closed-end investment companies who make short-swing profits\" and derivative suits against \"an investment company's advisor and its affiliates for breach of certain fiduciary duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-29(h), 80a-35(b). This detailed statutory scheme, we explained, indicated that Congress never intended further private enforcement of the ICA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711039\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1106/#p1109\">\n    615 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our reasoning made good sense in\n   <em>\n    Northstar\n   </em>\n   , and it makes even better sense here. Consider the circumstances of this case. UFCW sued while Yahoo! was negotiating a multi-billion-dollar sale of its internet business, and UFCW sought (among other things) an injunction preventing any such sale. UFCW thus asserts the ability to halt a deal the SEC has not blocked for alleged violations of an ICA exemption the SEC has not addressed, even though the SEC has been made fully aware of the facts underlying those alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   And that is not even the most awesome power UFCW purports to possess. So far as we can tell, nothing in UFCW's reading of section 47(b) would stop UFCW from seeking to rescind not just a handful of employment contracts, but also every other contract Yahoo! has entered into for the better part of a decade. If Congress really intended to expose companies receiving an ICA exemption to lawsuits of this unparalleled magnitude, it would have expressed that intention clearly, not covertly. Congress, after all, tends not to \"hide elephants in mouseholes.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitman v. Am.

For example, if a court concluded in the first instance that a company had violated its ICA exemption, and if circumstances had not changed since the court's decision, could the SEC re-exempt the company as it saw fit? Or would the SEC, the body the ICA expressly charges with considering changed circumstances in the first instance, be bound by the court's decision until circumstances changed again? Either the court's diligent efforts get wasted, or the SEC's express prerogatives get thwarted. Pick your poison. Or better yet, barring a clear congressional command to the contrary, decline the \"invitation to have one last drink.\"\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    532 U.S. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
