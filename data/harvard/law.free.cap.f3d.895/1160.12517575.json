Both appeals turn on the effect of President\n   Obama's commutation of Buenrostro's sentence in 2016 from life in prison without release to 360 months in prison.

On December 12, 2007, Buenrostro moved in the district court to reopen his \u00a7 2255 proceedings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) in order to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court denied the motion as an impermissible second-or-successive motion under \u00a7 2255, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argued that the commutation nullified the mandatory minimum sentence he received, such that he was, in effect, newly sentenced \"based on a sentencing range.\" He further argued that his sentencing range had been lowered by the federal Sentencing Commission pursuant to Amendment 782, which modified the offense levels in the Guidelines' drug quantity table. The district court denied the motion, concluding that regardless of President\n   Obama's commutation, Buenrostro was not sentenced \"based on a sentencing range,\" as required by Section 3582(c)(2). Buenrostro timely appealed in case number 16-10499.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Separately, Buenrostro brought a motion under \u00a7 2255, contending that he could raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion to vacate the \"new judgment\" created by the commutation, citing\n   <em>\n    Magwood v.
