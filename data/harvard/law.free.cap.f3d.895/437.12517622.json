Slusser challenges his designation as an armed career criminal. We granted a certificate of appealability (\"COA\") to consider one issue: whether Slusser's 1999 Tennessee conviction for Class C aggravated assault no longer qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"). Slusser, however, waived his right to challenge his designation as an armed career criminal through a \u00a7 2255 motion as part of his negotiated plea agreement. Therefore, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Slusser pleaded guilty in 2011 to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

The district court determined that he had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses and sentenced him to a mandatory sentence of 180 months under the ACCA. The district court pointed to three prior convictions as qualifying ACCA predicates: a 1994 burglary; 2011 delivery of cocaine; and 1999 aggravated assault and burglary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Slusser did not appeal his conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, Slusser filed an initial \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct.

Slusser makes no argument that undermines whether his plea agreement was knowing and voluntary but instead argues that he did not waive his right to challenge a sentence that is in excess of the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is well-settled that a knowing and voluntary waiver of a collateral attack is enforceable.\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

Slusser contends that an exception to the enforcement of such waivers exists when the challenge is to a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum. Slusser cites to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Caruthers\n   </em>\n   , where this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   that \"an appellate waiver does not preclude an appeal asserting that the statutory-maximum sentence has been exceeded.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386012\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/459/#p472\">\n    458 F.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (6th Cir. 2006),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cradler v.

Yet, Slusser fails to distinguish the posture of his challenge with our previous holdings that a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   -based collateral attack on an illegal sentence does not undermine the knowing and voluntary waiver of \"any right, even a constitutional right, by means of a plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12402390\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/695/851/#p853\">\n    695 F.
