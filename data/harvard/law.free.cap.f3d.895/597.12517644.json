As the lawsuits piled up, the car manufacturer hammered out a ten-billion-dollar settlement with a class of consumers, agreeing to fix or buy back the affected vehicles and providing some additional money as well. Following a thorough review, the district court blessed the agreement. Of the half million class members, a handful take issue with the settlement. We consider those appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Litigation and settlement talks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2015, Volkswagen (or VW) admitted that it had installed \"defeat devices\" in certain of its 2009-2015 model year 2.0-liter diesel cars. These devices-bits of software in the cars-were at the center of a massive scheme by VW to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The clever software could detect that a car was undergoing government-mandated testing and activate emissions-control mechanisms. Those mechanisms ensured that the car emitted permissible levels of atmospheric pollutants when the test was in progress. During normal road use, however, the emission-control system was dialed down considerably. As a result, the affected cars usually emitted on the road between 10 and 40 times the permissible level of nitrogen oxide, a gas that reacts with other gases to create ozone and smog. This was no small-time con: over 475,000 vehicles in the United States alone contained a defeat device.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The scheme became public when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent a \"Notice of Violation\" to Volkswagen alleging that installation of the defeat devices violated the Clean Air Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207522\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The notice mentioned the possibility of a civil enforcement action by the Department of Justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Vehicle owners were not far behind. Within three months, hundreds of lawsuits against VW, most of them class actions, had been filed in or removed to over sixty federal district courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen \"Clean Diesel\" Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Prods.

Dec. 8, 2015). The complaints alleged a bevy of claims under state and federal law, including-to name just a few-breach of warranty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of consumer protection, securities, and racketeering laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all VW defeat device-related cases to Judge Charles Breyer in the Northern District of California (\"district court\" or \"MDL court\") for \"coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271974\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/148/1367/#p1368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271974\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/148/1367/#p1368\">\n    at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short order the district court appointed Elizabeth Cabraser lead counsel for the putative consumer class actions and chair of the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee (PSC) charged with coordinating pretrial work on behalf\n   of the class. Around the same time, the United States' newly filed enforcement action was transferred into the MDL court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Settlement talks began early and went quickly. With the aid of a court-appointed settlement master, Robert Mueller, the parties-including the United States and the FTC-had reached agreements in principle by April 2016. Two months later-and just seven months after the cases were consolidated in the MDL court-a trio of proposed settlement agreements were filed by the private plaintiffs' class counsel, the United States, and the FTC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The settlement agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The proposed class settlement set aside ten billion dollars to fund a suite of remedies for class members. A particular class member's choices depended on whether she owned, leased, or had previously owned, but sold, a vehicle with a defeat device:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Owners\n   </em>\n   . Owners had the option to (1) sell the car back to VW at its pre-defeat device value (the \"buyback\" option) or (2) have the car fixed, provided Volkswagen could develop an EPA-approved emissions modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, owners would receive \"owner restitution.\" For owners who bought their cars before September 18, 2015 (\"eligible owners\"), that was a cash payment of at least $5,100, but possibly more, depending on the value of the vehicle. Owners who acquired their vehicles after that date (\"eligible new owners\") would receive half the eligible owner restitution described above-a cash payment of at least $2,550.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Lessees\n   </em>\n   . Lessees had the option to (1) terminate their leases without penalty or (2) have the car fixed subject to development of an approved modification. In addition, lessees would receive \"lessee restitution,\" a cash payment of $1,529 plus 10% of the vehicle's value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Sellers.\n   </em>\n   \"Eligible sellers\"-those who sold their cars after the defeat device scheme became public but before the filing of the settlement with the court in June 2016-would receive \"seller restitution\" equal to one-half of full owner restitution (a cash payment of at least $2,550, but possibly more, depending on the value of the vehicle).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To receive benefits, a class member submits a claim and supporting documentation; a claims processor verifies the class member's eligibility; and the class member elects a remedy, executes a release, and then obtains the benefit. The last step varies somewhat according to remedy. The deadline for submitting a claim is September 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The settlement figure of $10.033 billion was calculated to cover the most expensive option-the buyback-for all eligible owners, as well as the remedies selected by all non-owner class members. Any money left over in the funding pool will revert to Volkswagen after the claims period runs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Settlement approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   One month after the proposed settlement was filed with it, the district court granted preliminary approval and ordered extensive notice to the class. The following schedule was set:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-35\">August 10, 2016 Additional information regarding class counsel's prospective request for attorneys' fees due. September 16, 2016 Class members' objections to the settlement and requests for exclusion from it (<em>i.e.,</em> opt out) due. October 18, 2016 Final fairness hearing on the settlement.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Eighteen class members appeared at the fairness hearing to voice concerns about, or objections to, the settlement. By that point-just four months after the first proposed settlement was filed and three months after preliminary approval was granted-over 63% of class members had registered for benefits under the settlement. Of the 490,000 class members, some 3,300 had opted out (although the district court noted a trend of those opt outs reversing course and later claiming benefits), and 462 had timely objected to the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   One week after the fairness hearing, the district court, in a 48-page order, granted final approval of the settlement. The approval order first found that (1) the class met the threshold requirements to be certified under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3), and (2) notice to the class was adequate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). Next, it determined that the settlement was \"fair, reasonable, and adequate,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), devoting over thirty pages to an analysis of eleven separate factors going to the fairness of the settlement and to the objections of class members. The district court noted that the overwhelming early participation in the settlement and the very low numbers of opt outs and objections signaled the strength of the settlement. Assessing factors derived from\n   <em>\n    In re Bluetooth Headset Products Liability Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p946\">\n    654 F.3d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946-47 (9th Cir. 2011), the district court found that none of\n   the settlement terms evinced collusion or militated against a finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In her motion for final approval of the settlement, class counsel stated that she would seek no more than $333 million in attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's order granting final approval directed her to submit a motion for fees by November 8, 2016, and set a deadline for objections to that motion for six weeks after that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Fourteen appeals from the order approving settlement were consolidated with one related appeal. Of those, this opinion addresses six.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Especially in the context of a case in which the parties reach a settlement agreement prior to class certification, courts must peruse the proposed compromise to ratify both the propriety of the certification and the fairness of the settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Staton v.

The settlement here was reached before class certification, so\n   <em>\n    Staton\n   </em>\n   's dual direction applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The objectors bring a hodgepodge of challenges. One contests the district court's decision to approve certification of the class. Several others dispute the fairness of the settlement itself or the adequacy of the district court's process in approving it. And one appeals the district court's denial of her motion to opt out of the class after the deadline had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court's decision to certify a class action and its conclusion that a class action settlement is \"fair, reasonable, and adequate\" are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9141514\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/938/#p952\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9141514\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/938/#p952\">\n    at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Certification of the class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We begin by considering whether the class was appropriately certified. Before certifying a class, a court must ensure that it satisfies the prerequisites of Rule 23, including that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed.

As evidence of the conflict, he mainly points to the fact that eligible sellers receive only half the restitution payment accorded to eligible owners: In effect, eligible sellers \"split\"-figuratively-the amount provided eligible owners with the eligible new owners, who presumably purchased the sellers' cars with full knowledge of the vehicle's defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Johnson, this equivalent distribution to eligible new owners and sellers is so unfair to sellers that it demonstrates the sellers were not adequately represented by the named class representatives, only one of whom was a seller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"The adequacy [of representation] inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.\"\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    521 U.S. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The eligible owners-who comprise the vast majority of the class-were the ones with leverage enough to obtain benefits for the class. First, they had individually valuable and near-ironclad claims for rescission or restitution against VW. Second, the DOJ consent decree required VW to fix or buy back a large percentage-85%-of the affected vehicles. Failure to do so would result in immense fines. That Volkswagen thus needed to reach a deal with vehicle owners-a group including both eligible owners and eligible\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   owners-gave the class as a whole enormous collective power in bargaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   By contrast, the eligible sellers' claims, viewed in isolation, were fairly weak. The eligible sellers no longer had the cars whose purchase allegedly caused them injury; their theory would have been that they sold their defective cars at a loss attributable to VW's installation of the defeat device (and the subsequent public revelation). But it would be difficult to prove why any eligible seller chose to sell his car or the degree to which, if any, the sale price reflected a discount for the defeat device. As one class member conceded at the fairness hearing, \"[n]o one forced eligible sellers to sell their vehicles.\" Given the speed with which the putative classes were consolidated and settlement talks began, it is likely that many eligible sellers knew of the lawsuit, and some of the looming settlement, when they sold. The cars, moreover, were still functional and safe to drive, and the federal government made it clear from the beginning that it would not punish those driving cars with defeat devices-all of which puts a question mark over how much value the vehicles lost as a result of the scandal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   So eligible sellers would face challenging, if not insurmountable, questions of causation and damages if they litigated their cases against VW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead of getting nothing, eligible sellers received several thousand dollars in compensation. They quite possibly obtained it\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they were in the same class as vehicle owners who had leverage against Volkswagen, not in spite of that inclusion. The patent upside of the settlement to eligible sellers defeats Johnson's central argument that the settlement was so unfair to sellers that it could only have been the result of inadequate representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In that respect, this case bears no resemblance to ones in which the settlement terms are so skewed that it may be confidently inferred that some class members were not adequately represented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    521 U.S. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Molski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341162\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/937/#p955\">\n    318 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   956 ;\n   <em>\n    In re GMC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414801\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/768/#p801\">\n    55 F.3d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, even if the eligible sellers' claims were viable, the seller restitution, if evaluated as covering the economic losses incurred, was in an amount that generally fairly compensated for such losses. Class counsel explained at the fairness hearing that the restitution figure \"in most instances\" accounted for the loss realized by eligible sellers when they sold their vehicles. That Johnson and some others were not made whole by it does not render the benefit amount unreasonable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   much less demonstrate that it was necessarily the product of inadequate representation of the sellers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341162\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/937/#p955\">\n    318 F.3d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (representation held inadequate because \"the consent decree released almost all of the absent class members' claims with little or no compensation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the restitution payments overall more closely resemble compensatory damages awards or penalty payments, as they are for most class members an amount of money over and above the economic value of any fix or buyback. It was therefore sensible that Volkswagen should be required to pay that \"bonus\" amount only once per car. The fact that eligible sellers \"split\" the restitution payment with eligible new owners is thus fully explicable, and does not alter our analysis, demonstrate unfairness to eligible sellers, or otherwise reveal an intra-class conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, the eligible sellers benefitted from being in the class alongside vehicle owners.

Our decision here reflects the interplay of these standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This settlement is highly unusual. Most class members' compensation-buybacks, fixes, or lease terminations\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   some cash-is as much as, perhaps more than, they could expect to receive in a successful suit litigated to judgment. And not just some of them: the $10.033 billion set aside would fund the most expensive remedy option for every single class member. Class members did not loiter in claiming these benefits. By the time these appeals were briefed, Volkswagen had paid out or committed to pay over $7 billion. And according to the last report from the court-appointed independent claims supervisor, by May 2018 Volkswagen had fixed or removed from the road 85.8% of all affected vehicles; paid out $7.4 billion to over 350,000 class members; and paid out or committed $8.1 billion to almost 450,000 class members. Terming the settlement a \"compromise\" of claims, although true of most class action settlements, is largely inapt here. The district court so noted, stating that the class members generally \"are made whole\" by the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Not surprisingly given the scope of the remedies afforded, most of the objections to the settlement are in some sense procedural: the district court did not sufficiently examine the settlement for signs of collusion between the defendants and class counsel; or misinterpreted what signs of collusion there were; or failed to respond specifically to an objection; or did not give class members a real shot to respond to class counsel's fee motion. In considering these objections, we keep in mind that the fundamental issue before the district court was whether the proposed settlement is \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed. R. Civ.

The inquiry is not a casual one; the uncommon risks posed by class action settlements demand serious review by the district court.

Second, from a class member's perspective, the benefits available are quite substantial, worth at least thousands of dollars, and in some cases more, to each class member.

That is all the more true here because the objector's complaint appears to be purely technical-it draws no link between the district court's supposed oversight and any substantive deficiency in the settlement. By so noting, we are not suggesting a harmless error standard for class action settlement review or otherwise disparaging the importance of procedural rigor in the review of such settlements. We merely emphasize that a reviewing court is concerned with the overall adequacy of the district court's fairness determination, not with parliamentary points of order about its process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In any event, Weese's objections\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   frivolous, and so did not demand a response from the district court. In three sentences, she argues that additional claims-processing steps for class members with liens create individualized questions of law or fact that defeat predominance under Rule 23. But that objection is faulty on its face. The settlement does not \"den[y] recovery\" to, or exclude from class membership, vehicle owners with liens or loans. It just provides that, because of technical issues raised by the loan or lien as to the vehicle's title, those individuals-who still have the same legal claims, based on the same questions of law and fact, as other class members-must take additional steps to claim their benefits under the settlement. The district court properly concluded that class members-including those with liens-asserted the same injury and invoked the same basic legal theories against Volkswagen, thereby satisfying Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Again contrary to Weese's objection, the long-form notice to class members makes eminently clear how outstanding loans impact a class member's compensation. As the notice explains, the settlement provides\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   compensation to class members with outstanding loans, over and above buyback value, to help them clean up title and deliver their vehicles to Volkswagen. The challenge to the notice was thus frivolous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because Weese's arguments entirely lacked merit, the district court was not obligated to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623010\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/858/#p864\">\n    697 F.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    D.

Rather, the rule demands that class members be able to \"object to\n   <em>\n    the motion\n   </em>\n   \"-that is, the motion that class counsel must file to make a claim for fees under Rule 23. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h)(1)-(2) (emphasis added). An entirely separate provision of Rule 23 provides for class members' objections to the terms of a proposed settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(5).

Because the fee motion was only posted on the settlement website, the argument goes, rather than individually mailed or emailed to class members, the notice was unreasonable and inadequate under Rule 23(h).

No matter how construed, it is a challenge to the fee award, not to the district court's order approving the settlement. Unlike the Rule 23(h) argument regarding the scheduling of class counsel's fee motion, the objectors draw no link between the notice of class counsel's fee motion-which occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the settlement was approved-and whether the\n   <em>\n    settlement\n   </em>\n   is \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). If meritorious, objectors' notice argument goes to whether the district court's order awarding fees to class counsel may stand. For all we know, this court will later address this objection in the fee award appeals. But as briefed here, the objection does not point to any possible defect in the settlement order. We therefore do not pass upon the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    E. Remaining objections\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The last objector, Ronald Clark Fleshman, Jr., asks that we overturn the district court's approval of the settlement because it unfairly exposes some class members to future liability under the Clean Air Act, and because it assertedly permits the ongoing unlawful use of unmodified Volkswagens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We discussed these same arguments at length in our opinion affirming the district court's denial of Fleshman's attempted intervention in the United States' enforcement action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re VW \"Clean Diesel\" Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Prods. Liab.

July 3, 2018). In a nutshell, Fleshman contended there, and maintains here, that under a proper reading of the Clean Air Act and its state-level implementations, it is unlawful to drive or resell an unmodified Volkswagen with a defeat device. Because the settlement allows class members to wait for an approved emissions modification-and drive their vehicles in the meantime-and because class members can decline to participate in the settlement and continue to drive their unmodified vehicles as long as they wish, the settlement permits ongoing illegal conduct. That conduct could, Fleshman maintains, expose hundreds of thousands of class members to criminal or civil liability, as well as to the possibility that their vehicles will be confiscated. At that point, Fleshman represents, the class members' claims against Volkswagen will have been released by the settlement agreement. That concatenation of risks, and the settlement notice's failure to advise class members of them, says Fleshman, renders the settlement unfair and unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   That argument did not persuade us in Fleshman's last appeal, and it does not persuade us here. Leaving to one side whether his interpretation of the Clean Air Act is correct, his central premise-that class members may be subjected to a civil or criminal sanction for driving unmodified Volkswagens-is wholly speculative. As the district court noted, the EPA and the vast majority of states have stated unequivocally that they will permit unmodified vehicles to stay on the road, and none has specifically declared them illegal to drive. Because the risks and dangers\n   Fleshman warns about were completely improbable at the time of settlement (and remain so), the settlement notice need not have advertised them to class members, nor need the settlement have protected against them. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the settlement fair and reasonable over Fleshman's objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Again, the district court's task in reviewing a settlement is to make sure it is \"not the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between, the negotiating parties, and that the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair, reasonable and adequate to all concerned.\"\n   <em>\n    Officers for Justice\n   </em>\n   , 688 F.2d at 625. Our thorough consideration of the objections before us does not betoken any doubts on our part that the district court considered the proper factors, asked the correct questions, and did not abuse its discretion in approving this settlement. Except as noted-with respect to the reversion provision-these appeals did not directly challenge the substantive fairness of the settlement, and we therefore had no reason to comment upon it directly other than as to that provision. We do note that the settlement delivered tangible, substantial benefits to class members, seemingly the equivalent of-or superior to-those obtainable after successful litigation, and was arrived at after a momentous effort by the parties, the settlement master, and the district court. The district court more than discharged its duty in ensuring that the settlement was fair and adequate to the class. We affirm its order approving the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
