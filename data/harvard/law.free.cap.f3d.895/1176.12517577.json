Shorter also presented the jail's daily logs during her pretrial detention, which show that Shorter\n   was deprived of meals, showers, and recreation due, in part, to overcrowding and understaffing at CRDF. Shorter challenges the instructions given to the jury, which directed it to defer to the jail officials who enacted and carried out these policies and practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we vacate the partial grant of summary judgment, reverse the denial of a new trial, and remand for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shorter was a pretrial detainee at the County's CRDF, an all-women's jail in Lynwood, California, from November 15, 2011, to December 17, 2011. On the day she arrived at the jail, a social worker diagnosed Shorter with an unspecified mood disorder and placed Shorter in Module 2300, the jail's high-observation housing (HOH) unit for women who are mentally ill. HOH inmates wear yellow shirts and blue pants, and are subject to more restrictive conditions than inmates in other parts of CRDF. HOH inmates, for example, live in single-person cells and are monitored by jail staff every fifteen minutes to prevent suicide and other harmful behavior. HOH inmates are handcuffed whenever they leave their cells, with the exception of taking showers. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) commenced an investigation into the County jails' treatment of mentally ill inmates, and determined that the excessive use of shackles on the female inmates in HOH units was counterproductive to women's physical and mental health, and led to violations of the detainees' constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After her release from CRDF, Shorter filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action, pro se and in forma pauperis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She challenges several conditions of her confinement in HOH and the procedures that the County used to classify her as mentally ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shorter contends that the County's policy unreasonably allowed social workers to rely on a fifteen-question screening test, a cursory review of the inmate's record, and a brief interview, to make a practically unreviewable determination about how inmates are housed at CRDF. Shorter tried to appeal her mental health classification when she arrived at HOH, but jail officials did not provide her with the grievance forms that she could use to appeal her classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shorter also claims that she was routinely denied recreation, meals, and showers as a pretrial detainee because of understaffing and overcrowding at CRDF. For recreation, deputies move the women to an indoor day room, where they leave the women with one arm restrained by a handcuff extended from a chain secured to the floor. The women sit individually at indoor steel tables and benches. Some watch television and others participate in group activities. Jail policy requires the women to remain handcuffed to the chain next to the table at all times, and HOH detainees do not have access to a gym or an outdoor recreation area. Shorter participated in two and half hours of this type of recreation during her thirty-two days in the jail. The jail's daily logs also show that on seven days of her confinement Shorter received less than three meals per day. And the same logs show that Shorter showered\n   only three times, going six, seven, or eight days during her confinement without a shower, and instead relying on feminine pads for personal sanitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shorter also challenges the jail's visual body cavity search policy, which all inmates are subjected to upon return from trips to court, and the jail's pervasive practice of leaving noncompliant detainees shackled to their cell doors. The search process begins with the detainee inside her cell, with both hands in handcuffs. The detainee then places her hands outside the chute of her cell, where the deputy, on the other side of the door, unlocks one of the handcuffs. Then, with one hand still handcuffed and attached to a chain outside of the door, the detainee removes her pants, socks, and shoes, as well as her shirt and bra, which remain attached to the chain extending from her handcuff. The detainee must then lift her breasts, lower her underwear, bend over, open her vagina and rectum, and cough. The County's official policy mandates that inmates shall not be required to \"remain in any search position for more time than is reasonable and necessary to complete the search.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In practice, however, where the detainee failed to comply with the search procedures, it was common for deputies to leave the detainee chained to her cell door for hours at a time. Deputies Avalos and Ortiz testified that they were trained to leave noncompliant detainees who did not follow search procedures chained to their cell doors. Shorter testified that, on three occasions, deputies Avalos and Ortiz left her chained to her cell door for three to six hours, without access to food, water, or clothing. On one occasion, the deputies did not leave enough slack on Shorter's chain to allow her to reach the bathroom in her cell. Shorter testified that there was only enough slack on the chain to allow her to sit on the floor and hold her hand up in the air. Each time the deputies chained Shorter to her cell door, Shorter freed herself by manipulating her hand out of the restraints or by convincing another deputy to release the restraints. Shorter said that these incidents made her feel like \"an animal on display.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lastly, Shorter maintains that the County provided her with inadequate medical care. Shorter has a blood condition that requires her to monitor her blood's thickness daily, and to take Coumadin, a prescription drug that prevents the blood from thickening too much. Left untreated, the condition may cause blood clots, heart attack, stroke, or death. Jail officials tested Shorter's blood once during her thirty-two day stay. At the time of the test, officials determined that Shorter's blood was \"dangerously thin,\" and they discontinued Shorter's Coumadin prescription. Shorter was not tested again until after she left CRDF; at the time, doctors deemed her blood \"dangerously thick.\" Because jail officials did not routinely monitor her blood, Shorter worried that she was vulnerable to health risks throughout her pretrial detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The County Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Shorter's claims. They argued that Shorter could not establish policies, customs, or practices sufficient to establish a claim against the County or Sheriff Baca, in his official capacity, under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). They further maintained that Shorter's evidence did not raise a genuine dispute of fact that the County Defendants had violated Shorter's constitutional rights. Specifically, they argued that Shorter's conditions of confinement claims failed because there was no evidence that Shorter was deprived of recreation, food, or sanitation; that her inadequate medical care claim failed because Shorter could not show deliberate indifference to her medical needs; and that Shorter's excessive search claim failed because Shorter could not show that County officials used more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   force. County Defendants also argued that Shorter had no constitutional right regarding her classification as \"mentally ill\" or any right to file a jailhouse grievance. Deputies Avalos and Ortiz moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the County on Shorter's inadequate medical care claim, but it denied summary judgment on the remainder of the claims. The district court, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Shorter, concluded that the deputies were not entitled to qualified immunity because their search practices violated law that was clearly established as of 2011-a decision that the deputies do not challenge here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The case then proceeded to a jury trial before a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge, relying on Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instructions, instructed the jury to \"give deference to jail officials\" in deciding Shorter's conditions of confinement and excessive search claims. The jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants. Shorter then moved for a new trial, but the magistrate judge denied her motion. Shorter timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The principal dispute on appeal is whether the magistrate judge erred by instructing the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In determining whether the defendant(s) violated the plaintiff's rights as alleged, you should give deference to jail officials in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve discipline and to maintain internal security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We have come to refer to this instruction as the\n   <em>\n    Norwood\n   </em>\n   instruction, after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Norwood v. Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n    591 F.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2010). The instruction is part of the Ninth Circuit model instructions for \"Convicted Prisoner's Claim of Excessive Force,\" Ninth Cir. Model Civ. Jury Instr. \u00a7 9.26 (2017 ed.), and for \"Convicted Prisoner's Claim re Conditions of Confinement/Medical Care,\" Ninth Cir. Model Civ. Jury Instr. \u00a7 9.27 (2017 ed.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Shorter challenges the resulting jury instruction as an incorrect statement of law, our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clem v.

R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2). But the record shows that Shorter objected to the deference instruction at trial, albeit on a different ground, and in a motion for new trial. An \"objection need not be formal,\" and Shorter's objection was \"sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.\"\n   <em>\n    Inv. Serv. Co. v.

As the magistrate judge recounted in his denial of Shorter's motion for a new trial, all parties were aware that the appropriateness of the jury instruction turned on whether the jail's recreation and extended search policies were necessary to preserve discipline and maintain internal security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shorter's constitutional claims \"arise[ ] from the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and not from the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

We first must decide whether the magistrate judge erred in giving the deference instruction for Shorter's conditions of confinement claims, where the only justification that jail officials offered for curtailing Shorter's meals, showers, and recreation was a concern about overcrowding and understaffing in the facility. We conclude that the deference instruction should ordinarily not be given in such circumstances. Rather, we reiterate that the instruction may be given only when there is evidence that the treatment to which the plaintiff objects was provided pursuant to a security-based policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274220\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/961/#p970\">\n    790 F.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That was not the case here, and the magistrate judge should not have given the deference instruction as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We next decide whether the magistrate judge erred in giving the deference instruction for Shorter's excessive search claim, where jail officials concede that there was no legitimate penological purpose for shackling mentally ill, virtually unclothed, female pretrial detainees to their cell doors for hours at a time. We conclude that substantial record evidence supports Shorter's argument that this search practice was an unnecessary, unjustified, and exaggerated response to jail officials' need for prison security. We conclude that the magistrate judge erred in instructing the jury to give deference to the jail officials on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Shorter presented substantial evidence at trial showing that the jail's practice of chaining female inmates to a table in the middle of an indoor recreation room and depriving inmates of food and sanitation was an unnecessary and unjustified response to the problem of jail security. Among Shorter's most compelling evidence was a letter from both the Chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, Andr\u00e9 Birotte, Jr.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Los Angeles County Counsel, dated June 4, 2014. This letter expressed the DOJ's conclusion that the County's mental health care practices for the county jails violated pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment rights. The letter condemned the County's practice of chaining detainees for recreation and concluded that \"[t]his approach to prisoner management may be a reflection of the low level of security staffing throughout the women's housing units rather than a necessary safety-structural requirement for delivering appropriate assessment and treatment services.\" The DOJ encouraged the jail officials to make determinations about the appropriate level of restraint on \"an individualized basis in accordance with the prisoners' specific mental health and safety needs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The County admitted in testimony at trial that its policy denies HOH inmates access to physical exercise or any outdoor recreation, but it argues, on appeal, that its restrictive recreation policy is necessary because HOH inmates are \"unpredictable,\" \"violent,\" and \"impulsive.\" The County did not offer any other reason or immediate need to so restrict the inmates' movement. The County also suggested that Shorter did not participate in recreation because she did not want to, but the County never explained why it needed to chain detainees at all times outside their cells, and particularly, during recreation. The only explanation offered came from deputy Ortiz, who testified that she, personally, would not permit detainees out of their cells if the facility was understaffed because she worried that recreation time or showers might escalate into violence, suggesting that the reason for the policy is not a legitimate penological one, but one based on overcrowding and understaffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A deference instruction was not warranted on these facts. Jail officials have a duty to ensure that detainees are provided adequate shelter, food, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

And, we have confirmed, time and time again, that the Constitution requires jail officials to provide outdoor recreation opportunities, or otherwise meaningful recreation, to prison inmates. In\n   <em>\n    Pierce v. County of Orange\n   </em>\n   , for example, we concluded that inmates in administrative segregation, placed in segregation because of \"violent tendencies that have been deemed a threat to the jail's staff or to other inmates,\" are nonetheless constitutionally entitled to at least two hours per week of exercise.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577267\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1190/#p1208\">\n    526 F.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (9th Cir. 2008).

At the time that Shorter was detained, officials routinely left noncompliant female inmates shackled to their cell doors for hours, virtually unclothed, and without access to meals, water, or a toilet.

The watch commander also testified that keeping an inmate chained to the cell door \"shouldn't happen.\" And a jail expert testified that there was no \"penological practical reason for handcuffing an inmate to their cell door,\" given that the handcuffs were used to protect the officers from the inmate and the cell door already served this purpose, and that the practice was \"too ripe for potential abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That Los Angeles County jails no longer use the search procedure supports our conclusion that the search procedure was an exaggerated and unwarranted response to prison security. The County has changed its policy regarding the procedure of chaining detainees to their cell doors, now limiting the maximum time that detainees may be chained to the door absent approval from a watch commander. The County now also uses body scanners, which enable it to avoid the visual cavity searches that were common when Shorter was a pretrial detainee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even at the time, the jail had an alternative, less abusive means of obtaining contraband from inmates. If a guard believed that an inmate had contraband, jail policy instructed the guard to isolate the inmate from other inmates, provide access to a\n   toilet, turn off the water to the toilet, and line the toilet with plastic to trap any contraband as evidence. The deputies also could have sought out a mental health professional to talk to the detainee, or they could have reported the incident to the watch commander and documented it in the jail's recording system.
