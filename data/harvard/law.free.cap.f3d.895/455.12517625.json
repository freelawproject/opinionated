(\"ATC\"), is a Michigan company that subcontracts some of its manufacturing work to a vendor in China. Between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2015, it was insured by the defendant, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (\"Travelers\"). During this time period, ATC received a series of emails, purportedly from its Chinese vendor, claiming that the vendor had changed its bank accounts and ATC should wire transfer its payments to these new accounts. After ATC had transferred approximately $834,000, it learned that the emails were fraudulent and had been sent by a wrongdoer impersonating its Chinese vendor. ATC therefore sought coverage for its loss under its \"Wrap+\" business insurance policy (\"the Policy\"), which it had purchased from Travelers. Travelers denied the claim. ATC sued for breach of contract, both parties moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment to Travelers. For the following reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's grant of summary judgment to Travelers, grant summary judgment to ATC, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ATC is a tool and die manufacturer in Michigan that produces stamping dies for the automotive industry. R. 21-3 (Gizinski Dep. at 8) (Page ID #286). The company outsources some of its manufacturing orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (Page ID #289). Shanghai YiFeng Automotive Die Manufacture Co., Ltd. (\"YiFeng\"), a Chinese company, is one of ATC's vendors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ATC pays its vendors in four separate payments, based on the manufacturing progress of the order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-42 (Page ID #293-95). In order to be paid for the work it has done, YiFeng emails ATC invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45 (Page ID #296). After receiving an invoice\n   from YiFeng, ATC goes through a multi-step process before it will wire the money to YiFeng.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, ATC employees verify that YiFeng has completed the necessary steps required by the payment schedule for the next payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48 (Page ID #296). Each week, ATC's Vice President and Treasurer, Gary Gizinski, reviews a physical spreadsheet of the outstanding accounts payable and determines which bills need to be paid that week. R. 21-3 (Gizinski Dep. at 59-61) (Page ID #299-300). ATC pays YiFeng and its other international vendors via wire transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62 (Page ID #300). To initiate a wire transfer, Gizinski signs into a banking portal using software on his computer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70 (Page ID #302). He manually enters the payee's name, banking information, and the amount to be wired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69, 140 (Page ID #302, 319). After Gizinski submits the wire transfer request, ATC's Assistant Comptroller must log into the banking portal using his computer to approve it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72 (Page ID #302).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is the procedure for paying invoices that ATC employees followed in the spring of 2015. On March 18, 2015, Gizinski emailed YiFeng employee Jessie Chen requesting that Chen provide ATC all outstanding invoices. R. 21-4 (Proof of Loss at 23) (Page ID #351). An unidentified third party, through means unknown, intercepted this email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (Page ID #352). This third party, impersonating Chen, then began a correspondence with Gizinski about the outstanding invoices.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40 (Page ID #367-68). On March 27, 2015, the impersonator emailed Gizinski and claimed that, due to an audit, ATC should wire its payments to a different account from usual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45 (Page ID #373). YiFeng had previously (and legitimately) informed ATC it had changed its banking details, and ATC had no process for verifying the changed information. R. 21-3 (Gizinski Dep. at 114, 117) (Page ID #313-14). Consequently, Gizinski wired the money to the new account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142 (Page ID #320).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 3, the impersonator emailed Gizinski and informed him that \"due to some new bank rules in the province,\" the previous wire transfer was not credited to its account and therefore it would return the payment. R. 21-4 (Proof of Loss at 63) (Page ID #391). The impersonator requested that Gizinski instead wire the money to a different bank account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gizinski wired the money to this new account on April 8, 2015. R. 23-10 (Apr. 8, 2015 Wire Transfer) (Page ID #736). The impersonator ran this scam two more times and Gizinski wired additional payments of $1575 and $482,640.41 on April 9, 2015 and May 8, 2015. R. 21-4 (Proof of Loss at 3) (Page ID #331). When the real YiFeng demanded payment, ATC realized it had wired the money to an imposter. R. 21-3 (Gizinski Dep. at 166) (Page ID #326). ATC paid YiFeng approximately 50% of the outstanding debt, and agreed that the remaining 50% would be contingent on ATC's insurance claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27 (Page ID #316).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ATC sought recovery for its loss from Travelers, arguing that it fell within the \"Computer Fraud\" provision of the Policy, but Travelers denied the claim. R. 21-5 (July 8, 2015 Denial Ltr.) (Page ID #459-61); R. 21-6 (Sept. 16, 2015 Appeal Ltr.) (Page ID #463-67); R. 21-7 (Oct. 23, 2015 Affirming Denial Ltr.) (Page ID #469-71). ATC subsequently sued Travelers for breach of contract. R. 1 (Compl.) (Page ID #1-16). After discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. R. 21 (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J.) (Page ID #170-98); R. 22 (Def. Mot. for Summ. J.) (Page ID #591-623). The district court granted Travelers summary judgment, holding that\n   ATC's loss was not covered under the Policy. R. 33 (Dist. Ct. Op. at 7-8) (Page ID #969-70). ATC timely appealed. R. 35 (Notice of Appeal) (Page ID #972-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Computer Fraud\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Company will pay the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   for the\n   <strong>\n    Insured's\n   </strong>\n   direct loss of, or direct loss from damage to,\n   <strong>\n    Money\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    Securities\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    Other Property\n   </strong>\n   directly caused by\n   <strong>\n    Computer Fraud\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   R. 21-2 (Policy at 27) (Page ID #227) (emphasis in original denoting terms explicitly defined by the Policy). Travelers argues that there is no coverage because: (1) ATC did not suffer a \"direct loss\"; (2) this is not a case of \"Computer Fraud\"; (3) the loss was not \"directly caused by Computer Fraud.\" Each of these arguments fails: ATC's loss is covered by the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ATC Suffered a \"Direct Loss\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ATC and Travelers disagree about whether the three wire transfers of money to the impersonator constitute a \"direct loss\" of ATC's money. Appellant Br. at 13-14; Appellee Br. at 15-17. ATC argues that it suffered a direct loss the moment it paid $834,107.76 to the impersonator, because it no longer had that money in its bank account. Appellant Br. at 13. In contrast, Travelers argues that the loss did not arise when ATC paid the impersonator-because ATC had already contracted with YiFeng to pay that amount of money for the product it had received-but instead the loss arose later, after the fraud was discovered, when ATC agreed to pay YiFeng at least half of the money still owed.

We need not resolve here whether\n   <em>\n    Tooling\n   </em>\n   is limited to the context of employee-fidelity bonds or is more broadly applicable because ATC suffered a \"direct loss\" under either definition-direct as immediate only or direct as immediate or proximate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ATC immediately lost its money when it transferred the approximately $834,000 to the impersonator; there was no intervening event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Despite Travelers' argument to the contrary, Appellee\n   Br. at 15, the fact that ATC contractually owed that money to YiFeng and the two parties later agreed to spread the loss between them has no bearing on whether this loss was directly suffered by ATC. A simplified analogy demonstrates the weakness of Travelers' logic. Imagine Alex owes Blair five dollars. Alex reaches into her purse and pulls out a five-dollar bill. As she is about to hand Blair the money, Casey runs by and snatches the bill from Alex's fingers. Travelers' theory would have us say that Casey caused no direct loss to Alex because Alex owed that money to Blair and was preparing to hand him the five-dollar bill.

May 10, 2018), the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether, under Georgia law, the insured's loss \"resulted directly\" from computer fraud. In that case, there was a multi-step, multi-actor process that caused the loss. First, the bad actors manipulated the insured's computer system essentially allowing for a double redemption of pre-paid, reloadable debit cards-this was the computer fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n    2018 WL 2149769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. Second, this fraud induced the insured to transfer the money to its account held by an innocent third-party intermediary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the bad actors made a purchase using the debit cards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n    2018 WL 2149769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5. Fourth, the third party deducted the amount of the purchase from the insured's account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even though the insured transferred the money at step two, it retained control over the money until after the fourth step. Indeed, \"[o]n one particular occasion, after identifying fraud associated with $1.9 million\n   in duplicate redemptions by some debit card holders,\" the insured unilaterally froze those cards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the computer fraud occurred at step one; but \"the point of no return\" after which the money had left the control of the insured occurred not at step two-when it transferred the money to the third-party intermediary-but after step four.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit concluded that \"[t]he lack of [temporal] immediacy-and the presence of intermediate steps, acts, and actors-\" meant \"that the loss did not 'result[ ] directly' \" from the computer fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (third alteration in original). In reaching this decision, the Eleventh Circuit applied a \"direct means immediate\" definition, as opposed to the \"direct means immediate or proximate\" definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the narrower definition, the Eleventh Circuit suggested that if the \"point of no return\" was at step two-when the insured transferred the money-this would have been a direct result of the computer fraud at step one.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202149769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This is what occurred in this case, when framed at the same level of generality as the Eleventh Circuit used. ATC received the fraudulent email at step one. ATC employees then conducted a series of internal actions, all induced by the fraudulent email, which led to the transfer of the money to the impersonator at step two. This was \"the point of no return,\" because the loss occurred once ATC transferred the money in response to the fraudulent emails. Thus, the computer fraud \"directly caused\" ATC's \"direct loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Exclusion R\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Travelers first argues that Exclusion R applies. Appellee Br. at 33-34. This provision states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   This\n   <strong>\n    Crime Policy\n   </strong>\n   will not apply to loss resulting directly or indirectly from the giving or surrendering of\n   <strong>\n    Money\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    Securities\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    Other Property\n   </strong>\n   in any exchange or purchase, whether or not fraudulent, with any other party not in collusion with an\n   <strong>\n    Employee\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   R. 21-2 (Policy at 39) (Page ID #239) (emphasis in original denoting terms explicitly defined by the Policy). Travelers contends that Exclusion R applies because ATC transferred the money to the impersonator, believing it to be YiFeng, in exchange for the goods it had received from the vendor. Appellee Br. at 34. ATC correctly points out that it did not transfer the money to the impersonator in exchange for anything from the impersonator, and therefore the fraudulent transfer does not fall within this exclusion provision. Appellant Reply Br. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We have previously analyzed a similar exclusion provision, under Tennessee law, which included the language \"giving or surrendering of Money or Securities in any exchange or purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrah's Entm't, Inc. v.
