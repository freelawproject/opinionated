Republican Nat'l Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232532\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/759/682/#p686\">\n    759 A.2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686 (D.C. 2000). A jury ruled in Croley's favor in 1998, awarding him a $1.2 million judgment against the RNC. In 2002, the RNC paid $1.37 million-that judgment plus interest-into the District of Columbia court system's coffers. Croley's lawyers promptly took their fee from that pot pursuant to an attorney's charging lien against the sum. Croley himself, however, did not then receive the remaining $1.25 million. Croley did not get his money until 2015, thirteen years after the RNC had paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Croley here sues the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration, the administrative arm of the D.C. court system, seeking compensatory and punitive damages for what he alleges was the Joint Committee's role in the events causing that thirteen-year delay in receiving his payment. After the RNC paid and counsel took their cut, Croley-suffering permanent and disabling injuries from the assault-was left unable to navigate the process of obtaining his money from the registry at the Superior Court. The money the RNC paid to satisfy the judgment was in the court's possession as of 2002 but, Croley alleges, court administrators failed to release it to him; they rebuffed his requests for assistance and for reasonable accommodations for his disabilities, and they misled him as to the funds' status. If the Joint Committee had requisite disability accommodation policies in place, Croley alleges, he would have had prompt possession of his damages award. Instead, Croley was deprived for more than a decade of funds meant to compensate him for, among other things, his lost earnings. And he spent significant time, expense, and energy over those many years in repeated, unsuccessful efforts to dislodge his judgment from the Superior Court-efforts that would have been entirely unnecessary, he contends, if the Joint Committee had fulfilled its legal obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Croley, acting\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sued the Joint Committee in federal court for damages. He claimed that the Joint Committee violated his property rights and failed to comply with its affirmative obligations under federal law to accommodate disabled litigants. The district court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissed Croley's complaint for want of federal jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. To the extent Croley's complaint calls for appeal of a District of Columbia court order issued in Croley's suit against the RNC, any such claim is barred by\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   is no bar to those portions of Croley's federal complaint against the Joint Committee that do not seek to appeal orders in his Superior Court suit against the RNC: Neither Croley's claim that Superior Court administrative personnel violated his property rights by misleading him and mishandling his award, nor his claim that court administrators neglected their legal duty to make the courts accessible to persons with disabilities like his, necessarily calls for the federal courts to review any state court judgment. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his 1985 personal injury suit, Croley established that an RNC-employed security\n   guard attacked him, inflicting post-traumatic stress disorder, chest trauma, and brain injuries that left him permanently disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Croley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232532\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/759/682/#p686\">\n    759 A.2d at 686-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Croley alleges that, as early as January 2001, he tried to file a complaint against his counsel for failing to help him find and gain possession of the money the RNC had paid. Compl. \u00b6 34(c)(ii). He sought and was denied assistance to do so from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coordinator at the D.C. Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232532\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/759/682/#p686\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Croley's counsel in March 2001 filed an attorney's lien to secure his own fee from the judgment proceeds and moved to withdraw his appearance on Croley's behalf. The court recognized the lien and granted the motion to withdraw. Croley received the court's permission to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The RNC in January of 2002 paid $1,367,012.37-Croley's jury award plus post-judgment interest to that date. The docket records a motion \"for authority to deposit judgment proceeds into registry of court,\" which the court granted with the specifications that the RNC's payment satisfied the judgment and that defendants \"are in no way responsible for the resolution of the fee dispute between [Croley] and [his] counsel.\" Appendix (App.) 87. Croley's counsel then moved to collect his fees, and the Superior Court distributed $115,579.39 to him in full satisfaction of the attorney's lien. Croley's damages apparently remained in possession of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The docket reflects no further activity in Croley's Superior Court case for more than three years, at which point an entry states: \"Converted Court Ordered Escrow\n   as of May 19, 2005.\" App. 88. That entry records the \"amount paid\" as $1,251,432.98, App. 88, a sum equal to the RNC's payment minus the attorney's lien, without interest from the time the court took possession of the payment in 2002. Only a few months later, the docket states: \"Unclaimed escrow funds transferred to the US Treasury on 9/27/05,\" with no further explanation or any suggestion that a court order directed such transfer. App. 88. The same docket entry then includes the notation \"VOIDED UNDELIVERABLE.\" App. 88. Croley alleges that, in fact, \"defendant Superior Court never conveyed plaintiff Croley's property to US Treasury,\" but instead \"constantly possessed plaintiff Croley's property for itself, notwithstanding the misleading accounting reports and false statements of D.C. courts.\" Compl. \u00b6 19(d) n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Approximately two and a half years later, the docket shows that Croley, still acting\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sought possession of his money. On February 6, 2008, the Superior Court denied Croley's \"Motion to Return Money Paid to Court Register.\" App. 88. Apparently recognizing that Croley's $1.2 million was unaccounted for, the court's order said in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court cannot discern on the motion presented that the moving party is entitled to the funds. In addition the movant represents that the Court is no longer in possession of any funds. On this motion, the Court cannot find it has jurisdiction to order any return of funds that may now be in possession of the United States Treasury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Order Den. Pl.'s Mot. to Return Money Paid to Ct. Register, 1985-CA-2075 (Feb. 5, 2008). Croley did not appeal that order. According to the docket, activity in the case then ceased for five more years, until March 2013, when an attorney entered an appearance on Croley's behalf, only to withdraw just over a year later, with Croley still empty-handed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Croley alleges that, all the while, he personally contacted the court repeatedly to collect his money, but administrative personnel misled him about its status and location. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19(d), 20. Court administrative staff, for example, \"falsely advised\" Croley to collect from the \"Office of Unclaimed Funds,\" although his funds remained in the court registry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. In his attempts to gain possession of his money, Croley also alleges that he-like other disabled litigants in the D.C. court system-was repeatedly denied disability accommodations such as extra time and easy-to-navigate procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. In one such instance, Croley alleges, he asked the court's ADA coordinator to help him respond to his new attorney's 2014 withdrawal motion, but the coordinator did not \"direct Plaintiff Croley to published grievance procedures\" or otherwise assist him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34(c)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Croley finally succeeded in bringing the matter to a head late in 2014. On September 17, Croley moved to \"Restore Affirmed Judgment.\" App. 89. On November 24, 2014, Croley, again\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed the federal suit at issue in this appeal. That same day-a dozen years after the RNC paid the judgment into the court registry and Croley first sought to collect it-the D.C. Superior Court scheduled a status hearing on the funds and issued a Notice of Intent to Release Funds, that is, to pay Croley his money. The United States and the District of Columbia responded to the D.C. Superior Court's Notice by affirmatively disclaiming any right or interest to the funds. On December 18, 2014, the court formally ordered disbursement. On January 14, 2015, nearly twenty years after he filed his personal injury suit in D.C. Superior Court and thirteen years after the D.C. Court of Appeals sustained the verdict\n   in his favor, Croley finally received the $1,251,432.98 the court had withheld: the total of the RNC's payment minus Croley's attorney's lien, without any interest for the time the D.C. Superior Court had possession of the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When the Superior Court ordered the disbursement, it described Croley's case against the RNC as \"closed,\" and the court's own authority as limited to issuing the order calling for release from the court registry. The Superior Court judge added at the hearing: \"[I]f [Croley] had an issue with what the Superior Court did, then [he was] free to file a lawsuit on that. But filing it as part of this closed case was not appropriate. Because the District of Columbia Superior Court would have to be a party to that action and that party needs notice.\" App. 111-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This case seeks to hold the Joint Committee responsible for the court administration's role in the long delay Croley faced between winning his award and receiving it. The Joint Committee on Judicial Administration, composed of judges, manages general personnel policies, accounts and auditing, and procurement and disbursement for the D.C. court system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011-1701\">\n    D.C.

As the Joint Committee itself explains, it bears the \"general administrative responsibilities for the local District of Columbia Courts.\" Appellee's Br. at 2. Although the complaint interchangeably charges \"DC Courts,\" the Superior Court, and the Court of Appeals with wrongdoing, it is fairly understood to refer to the courts insofar as they were inadequately administered by the Joint Committee, the entity the complaint names as \"responsible for\" the court system's \"policies.\" Compl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011-1701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011-1701\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Croley's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   federal complaint raises two sets of claims.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-21, 35-44.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 19(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Croley's property claims arise out of allegations of false and misleading conduct by the Clerk's Office or other administrative staff: \"DC Courts persistently [misled] plaintiff Croley and various attorneys as to the location and status of plaintiff Croley's property,\" including when \"DC Courts falsely advised [they] had conveyed plaintiff Croley's property to the 'US Treasury' without further specification.\" Compl. \u00b6 19(d);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.

As described above, each time Croley attempted to collect the money, the registry retained it and, each time, the disbursement process failed him. It is the actions of administrators, outside and independent of D.C. judicial proceedings, that Croley alleges frustrated collection of that judgment. Those actions do not implicate\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   's bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Joint Committee's assertion that Croley seeks reversal of the Superior Court's 2008 order denying his request for disbursement is unconvincing. The 2008 order, which stated that the $1.2 million was lost to court records, could indeed be appealed only to the D.C. Court of Appeals or ultimately to the Supreme Court. Croley's complaint, though, invokes that order only by way of background.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 18. The complaint does not seek to appeal the order itself-in fact, the Superior Court's 2015 disbursement order has already superseded the 2008 order denying payment, and Croley by no means asks to collect his judgment anew from the RNC. To the contrary, Croley here raises independent claims about administrators' conduct; those claims are not barred even to the extent that he seeks in the process to \"den[y] a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    544 U.S. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After all, Croley won in state court. That court entered final judgment in his favor. Croley's property claims against the Joint Committee allege different harms from the assault-based claims at issue in his suit against the RNC. They seek to enforce his legal rights against a different defendant, and seek a different remedy. Accordingly, lower federal court review of Croley's property claims is not an effort to appeal the D.C. court's judgment and is not barred by\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Croley's second set of claims alleges that, in his effort to gain possession of money paid to the court registry to satisfy his state court judgment, he was harmed by the D.C. court system's lack of the requisite policies and procedures for disability accommodation.

Croley's complaint provides several \"specific examples,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, of administrative failures to meet those obligations, including court administrators' refusal to help him understand and access procedures for filing grievances against counsel and make various other complaints,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34(c)(i)-(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Joint Committee artificially construes Croley's disability claims as limited to those specific examples and mischaracterizes Croley's claims as appeals of adverse rulings in an attempt to cast this case in\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   's mold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. 27-30; Oral Arg.

The Committee invokes two rulings in particular: The Superior Court, as a sanction for Croley's failure to timely submit to a physical examination, prohibited Croley from introducing evidence of his brain injury,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232532\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/759/682/#p686\">\n    759 A.2d at 686-88, 696-702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the court refused to grant him an extension of time to respond to his counsel's withdrawal motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   App. 88. If Croley's complaint were a challenge to those orders,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   could conceivably bar federal review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As discussed above, however, Croley's complaint expressly makes a broader, general challenge to the District of Columbia courts' policies, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 30, 34(b), based on distinct harms it caused him: making it unduly hard for him, with his disabilities, to participate effectively in the litigation, and causing his property to be long withheld from him without clear means reasonably accessible to him for gaining possession of it. The Joint Committee recognized at argument that Croley's complaint \"clearly\" levies \"general policy-like\" challenges, independent of challenges to specific D.C. court orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 54:4-11;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:10-54:11, 47:18-48:2. The different party he sues and the distinct damages he seeks confirm that federal review of his challenge to the court's disability policies would not disturb the state court's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455625,3727339\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/1113/\">\n    275 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Croley seeks damages from the Joint Committee for the physical and emotional costs he alleges he incurred navigating a court system bereft of appropriate accommodations; the complaint can be read to allege such harms both during the litigation against the RNC and in the period after its conclusion when Croley sought to gain access to his money. Another measure of his damages might be the time value of the $1.2 million since 2002-after the RNC paid, while the court system withheld it-which he could not have received in his suit in D.C. court, but which he claims he would have accrued on his own account had requisite procedures been in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Whether those damages are available, and in what measure, turns largely on what the ADA guarantees to litigants in Croley's position. That question, however, speaks to the merits of Croley's claim\n   rather than to whether lower federal courts have jurisdiction to assess it. To be clear, to the extent Croley's complaint seeks damages based on counterfactual court victories Croley might have won against the RNC had the court not denied him enlarged time or limited his proof of brain injury,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   is a bar. But Croley has pleaded a distinct federal claim challenging the Joint Committee's failure to afford ADA-compliant accommodation to disabled litigants. The ADA \"authorizes private citizens to bring suits for money damages,\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877309\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/509/#p533\">\n    541 U.S. at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877309\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/509/#p533\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012133\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and Croley's complaint that the Committee lacked procedures to reasonably accommodate cognitively or emotionally disabled litigants would, if meritorious, be remediable. The question of whether such claims would succeed on the merits presents no jurisdictional\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Joint Committee maintains that, even were we to reverse the district court's\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   ruling, we should affirm its dismissal of Croley's complaint on non-jurisdictional grounds, such as judicial immunity, preclusion, or failure to state a legally cognizable claim including, for example, whether Croley would have a private right of action under the ADA's implementing regulations. We decline to reach those issues. We therefore reverse the district court's threshold jurisdictional dismissal and remand for the district court to consider the complaint anew.
