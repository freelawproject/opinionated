She timely seeks review of a decision issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed an immigration judge's decision pretermitting her application for cancellation of removal and ordering her removed from the United States. She argues that the statutory phrase \"crime involving moral turpitude,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), is unconstitutionally vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner entered the United States some time before 1999. A few years later, she provided cash payments to an employee at the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles to influence and reward the employee for issuing identification documents to non-citizens illegally present in the United States. As a result, in 2010, Petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of bribery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), for which the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Petitioner received a Notice to Appear, charging her with inadmissibility under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i). Through counsel, Petitioner conceded inadmissibility but sought cancellation of removal. An immigration judge ruled that Petitioner's bribery conviction constituted a crime of moral turpitude, rendering her ineligible for cancellation of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed, and this petition for review followed. We review de novo the constitutional question presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because we do not read\n   <em>\n    Boutilier\n   </em>\n   quite as broadly as the government does, we do not think that it is \"clearly irreconcilable\" with\n   <em>\n    Tseung Chu\n   </em>\n   in this regard.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.
