In 2013, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted the Alabama Power Company a 30-year license to continue power generation on a portion of the Coosa River. A review of the licensed project's impact on the environment and endangered species documented that the project would cause a 100% take of multiple endangered mussels, a large loss of indigenous fish, and perilously low dissolved oxygen levels for substantial periods of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nevertheless, the Commission concluded that licensing the generation project would have no substantial impact on either the River's ecological condition or endangered species. In doing so, the Commission declined to factor in the decades of environmental damage already wrought by exploitation of the waterway for power generation and that damage's continuing ecological effects. Because the Commission's environmental review and a biological opinion it relied on were unreasoned and unsupported by substantial evidence, the Commission's issuance of the license was arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, we dismiss the first petition for review, grant the second petition for review, vacate the licensing decision, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case implicates three intersecting statutory schemes, all of which are designed to force federal agencies to carefully assess and address the environmental impacts of large-scale development projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   The Federal Power Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20791\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , charges the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with licensing the development, improvement, and operation of hydroelectric projects along navigable waterways.

The Coosa River is a highly regulated waterway with nine hydropower and storage developments controlling its flow. Each of those developments is operated by either the Alabama Power Company or the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Alabama Power operates seven hydroelectric generator and storage developments along waterways located primarily in Alabama. The Company's developments on the Coosa River (\"the Coosa Project\") are at the center of this dispute. From upstream to downstream, the developments are: (1) Weiss; (2) H. Neely Henry; (3) Logan Martin; (4) Lay; (5) Mitchell; (6) Jordan; and (7) Bouldin. The Army Corps of Engineers operates an additional five\n   developments along the same waterways and extending into neighboring States, none of which are directly at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Coosa Project traces its roots back to the 1920s, when the Mitchell and Jordan hydropower plants were licensed and constructed. The Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the projects with the goal of developing the Alabama-Coosa River system to support navigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Some three decades later, Congress suspended federal hydropower development of the Coosa River in favor of private development under licenses issued by the federal government. Alabama Power received its first Coosa River license in 1957 and proceeded to construct and operate five additional developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Licenses for the original Coosa Project, as well as for Mitchell and Jordan hydropower plants, were all scheduled to expire on July 31, 2007. Two years before that deadline, Alabama Power tendered its application for relicensing of all of its developments, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20808\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). In its application, Alabama Power sought to consolidate all of the projects into a single license. The Commission published a notice of the license application in the Federal Register in June 2008, indicating that \"the application was ready for environmental analysis\" and soliciting protests, comments, and recommendations.\n   <em>\n    Licensing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 5. A number of public and private conservation and natural resource stakeholders timely intervened, including Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, Atlanta Regional Commission, American Whitewater, Coosa River Paddling, and World Wildlife Fund (collectively, the \"Conservation Groups\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Eighteen months after the Federal Register notice, the Commission issued its final Environmental Assessment on the license application. That Assessment concluded that the relicensing decision did not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the environment, and so the Commission issued a \"Finding of No Significant Impact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.13\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two and a half years later, in June 2012, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued its Biological Opinion analyzing the impact of renewing the license on endangered and threatened species in the project area, with particular focus on the Coosa River's nine listed species and twelve critical habitats.\n   <em>\n    See generally Biological Opinion for the Relicensing of Alabama Power Company's Coosa River Hydroelectric Project\n   </em>\n   (2012) (\"Biological Opinion\"). The Biological Opinion concluded that relicensing the project was not likely to \"jeopardize\" any threatened or listed species, nor destroy or deleteriously affect any critical habitats. Biological Opinion at 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 20, 2013, the Commission granted Alabama Power a new 30-year license to continue operating the now-combined Coosa Project. Both the Commission's final Environmental Assessment and the Service's Biological Opinion were incorporated, without change, into the license.\n   <em>\n    See Licensing Order\n   </em>\n   at PP 200-214, Appendix B. The license imposed several terms and conditions on Alabama Power's operations, including as most relevant here, the duty to (i) implement \"aeration\" measures to achieve a constant minimum dissolved oxygen level of 4.0 milligrams per liter (\"mg/L\") at each development \"at all times,\" (ii) enhance dissolved oxygen levels at Logan Martin during periods of non-generation to protect certain listed aquatic species, (iii) incorporate water-quality monitoring measures prescribed by\n   the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, and (iv) conduct surveys of aquatic species to ensure no further decline of threatened and endangered mussels and snails.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PP 72-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Several parties, including the Conservation Groups and Alabama Power, timely sought rehearing of the Licensing Order. The Commission denied the Conservation Groups' rehearing request in full. But it granted Alabama Power's request, materially slackening Alabama Power's duty to maintain the required levels of dissolved oxygen. In particular, the Commission provided that the prescribed water quality standards, including the maintenance of dissolved oxygen levels, would apply only when the hydroelectric developments were actually generating power.\n   <em>\n    Order on Rehearing and Clarification and Dismissing Request for Stay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C080\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   \").

Alabama Power contends that the Conservation Groups' members will be able to continue to use the Coosa River as they have always used it because the new license will benefit the Coosa River, not harm it. However, that argument goes to the merits not standing. The Environmental Assessment and Biological Opinion recognize the possibility of \"[f]luctuating flow releases,\" \"intermittent periods of low [dissolved oxygen],\" and other potential \"poor water quality conditions\" that could \"adversely affect some aquatic species\" and \"aquatic resources.\" Environmental Assessment at 222, 250; Biological Opinion at 90-93. The Conservation Groups' members expressed interests in observing and enjoying the diversity of the Coosa River. The increased risks to water quality and endangered and threatened species in the Coosa River satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. Alabama Power contends that this license imposes more stringent requirements or may improve some environmental conditions. The Conservation Groups have adequately alleged that even these allegedly improved conditions will continue to harm their use and enjoyment of the Coosa River. Whether the evidence of harm ultimately supports the allegation is a question for a later day.

Although Alabama Power may be correct in the generality of its statement, on the specifics of the case before us, the Conservation Groups seek to prevent future deterioration to the biodiversity of the Coosa River so that the future use and enjoyment of their members are not impaired. This injury is redressable. Requiring the Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement might cause the Commission to gather more information that could improve the conditions in the license and the conditions of the Coosa River.

The Fish and Wildlife Service argues that to the extent there are issues with fish passage or seasonal flows, those are part of the environmental baseline (the historically degraded condition) and remain unaffected by this action. But, as previously explained, the Service failed to incorporate the environmental baseline into its jeopardy analysis. In fact, the Opinion hardly addressed fish passage and seasonal flows in its discussion of the environmental baseline.

Under these circumstances, the Opinion's jeopardy analysis is arbitrary because it fails to account for effects of degraded conditions on threatened species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Department of Interior defends the Opinion's jeopardy analysis by arguing that \"the populations found inside the action area have been living under degraded baseline conditions since at least 1964, and this licensing action proposes to\n   <em>\n    improve\n   </em>\n   those conditions by, among other things, imposing a minimum-flow regime for the Weiss bypass for the first time.\" DOI Br. at 21. But attributing ongoing project impacts to the \"baseline\" and excluding those impacts from the jeopardy analysis does not provide an adequate jeopardy analysis. The Opinion's jeopardy analysis is arbitrary in failing to account for the impact of continued operations of the existing dams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Also, the Service's Opinion failed to show a rational connection between the facts found and its conclusion that the Coosa River Project will not jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. The Opinion's Incidental Take Statement estimates that ninety or one hundred percent of several species in particular sections will be taken. Biological Opinion at 90-93. For example, the Opinion predicted that the southern clubshell, finelined pocketbook, southern pigtoe, and Georgia pigtoe could be taken up to one\n   hundred percent as a result of poor water quality conditions in a new flow regime near the Weiss Bypass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91. Likewise, the Opinion predicted that one hundred percent of the tulotoma snail, painted rocksnail, and southern clubshell could be taken in the Logan Martin Dam section of the Coosa River based on the continued operation of that dam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91. Despite these predictions, the Opinion concluded that \"this level of expected take is not likely to result in jeopardy to any of the listed species or destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. At the least, the Opinion should explain how a one hundred percent incidental take for multiple species is not likely to result in jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its briefing before this Court, the Department of Interior argues that the one hundred percent take only refers to individual members of the species in a specific location. Given its absence from the Opinion, this argument appears to be a post-hoc litigation position. The Opinion never suggests as a basis for its finding of no jeopardy that the local populations are insignificant to the larger populations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Biological Opinion at 90-93. Accordingly, the Opinion's jeopardy analysis is not legally sufficient without further explanation from the Fish and Wildlife Service, especially because population distribution is one of the factors the Service had to consider when evaluating the overall health of the species.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.02\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"jeopardize\" as to \"reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or\n   <em>\n    distribution\n   </em>\n   of that species\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, the Opinion's Incidental Take Statement is also legally insufficient. It failed to include an adequate trigger for re-consultation. Whenever an Opinion determines that \"take is reasonably certain to occur,\" the Opinion must provide an \"Incidental Take Statement,\" which authorizes harm to an endangered species and includes a trigger for re-consultation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(7), (i)(1)(i), (i)(4). The Conservation Groups object that the Incidental Take Statement failed to provide a numerical trigger or identify a surrogate that provides a reasonable estimate for when to trigger reinitiation of formal consultation. The Department of Interior acknowledges that the Opinion did not provide a numerical trigger for certain species, but argues that it provided clear surrogate triggers for reinitiation of consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Incidental Take Statement's reinitiation notice merely provides that reinitiation should occur if \"the amount or extent of incidental take is exceeded.\" Biological Opinion at 99. But this statement does not provide enough guidance to explain how to determine whether \"the amount or extent of incidental take is exceeded,\" particularly because incidental take is one hundred percent for multiple species. At oral argument, the Department argued that for those areas where it identified one hundred percent take, there would be no reason to reinitiate consultation because the take cannot exceed one hundred percent. Oral Argument at 1:16:55-1:17:02. The Department argued that if there ended up being a higher percentage of harm than predicted, however, reinitiation of consultation would be required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1:17:40-1:17:48.

The Commission, however, just shrugged off that death rate, deeming it insignificant because the entrained fish likely would be non-protected species or juveniles with high natural mortality rates.

No updated information was collected; no field studies were conducted. Nor was any independent verification of Alabama Power's estimates undertaken. Assuming Alabama Power's good faith, its estimates were entirely unmoored from any empirical, scientific, or otherwise verifiable study or source. The Commission also failed to take even the preliminary step of attempting to acquire recent or site-specific data against which Alabama Power's estimates\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been compared.

By way of excuse, the Commission's Assessment noted, almost in passing, that the entrained fish are of the sort that normally \"experience high natural mortality in fish populations unaffected by hydro operations.\" Environmental Assessment at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Commission seems to assume that this is a substantive answer, as though the Venn diagram of fish killed through entrainment and natural attrition is a perfect circle. Not so. The Project would compound the death rate. Those fish that manage to run the gauntlet of youth and natural mortality factors will now emerge only to face a high rate of death in hydropower turbines and other lethal aspects of the Project. The Commission's NEPA analysis has to grapple with that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Third, the Commission's cheery assurance that \"excellent\" human-operated sport and commercial fisheries remain downstream is just whistling past the graveyard. Environmental Assessment at 97, 99. The Commission, for its part, made no effort to explain how downstream, human-operated sport and commercial fisheries are relevant bellwethers for environmental impacts in the upstream Coosa River. After all, the nearby presence of a nice zoo has never been a relevant answer under NEPA to high species mortality in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In short, with respect to the admitted killing of large numbers of fish in the Coosa River, the Commission's NEPA analysis was woefully light on reliable data and reasoned analysis and heavy on unsubstantiated inferences and\n   <em>\n    non sequiturs\n   </em>\n   . The record simply does not provide a rational connection between the licensing decision, the record evidence, and the finding of no significant environmental impact. Much more work is required of the Commission. Courts, after all, cannot evaluate the reasonableness of the unexplained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Failure to Maintain Dissolved Oxygen Levels\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Dissolved oxygen in the water is indispensable for aquatic animal life. Many of the aquatic species in the Coosa River Project area, including those listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, require well-oxygenated, flowing water to survive. As a general rule, dissolved oxygen levels can threaten \"acute mortality\" for many aquatic species if they fall below 4.0mg/L for any sustained period of time.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 38. The Project's operations can lead to low dissolved oxygen levels, especially in the warmer summer and early fall months, because streamflows decline, and large portions of tributary flows are captured and held in the reservoirs to maintain desired elevations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918307,4280527\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1304/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PP 19-22. Also during the summer, water in the Project's reservoirs tends to separate into two layers: (1) a warm surface layer that is relatively rich in dissolved oxygen due to its proximity to the surface, which facilitates oxygen exchange with the ambient air, and (2) a colder bottom layer where decomposing organic material in the reservoir bed devours the dissolved oxygen, drastically reducing the level remaining to support life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Dissolved oxygen levels in the tailraces-the waters downstream of the dams-are primarily influenced by the depth at which water is drawn from the reservoir during generation.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 19 n.19. The Project's intakes primarily draw water from the\n   deeper portions of their respective impoundments. The release of these waters with low levels of dissolved oxygen through the Project powerhouses can suppress dissolved oxygen levels in the Project's tailraces to well below the 4.0mg/L standard up to twenty percent of the time during warmer months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Federal law prohibits the Commission from licensing a hydroelectric project unless the state water quality agency certifies the project's compliance with state water standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (d). The Alabama Department of Environmental Management conditioned its approval of the Coosa River Project on Alabama Power's compliance with several state-law requirements, and those conditions were incorporated into the license the Commission issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As relevant here, the first condition initially required Alabama Power to ensure that the dissolved oxygen level at each of its seven developments remained above 4.0 milligrams per liter. That requirement gave effect to the plain text of Alabama law. Ala. Admin. Code rr. 335-6-10-.09(2)(e)(4)(i), (3)(c)(4)(i), (5)(e)(4)(i) (\"\n   <em>\n    In no event\n   </em>\n   shall the dissolved oxygen level be less than 4 mg/l due to discharges from existing hydroelectric generation impoundments.\") (emphasis added). Given that \"clear\" state-law command, the Commission's Licensing Order was explicit that \"Alabama Power must maintain no less than 4.0 mg/L of [dissolved oxygen]\n   <em>\n    at all times\n   </em>\n   , including during periods of non-generation.\"\n   <em>\n    Licensing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 73 n.47 (emphasis in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   But on rehearing, the Commission muddied the waters by \"clarify[ing],\"\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 56, that the duty to maintain dissolved oxygen levels \"at all times\" actually meant only sometimes-that is, only during actual generation and certain minimum flow releases,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at P 27 (Alabama Power only needs \"to meet a 4.0 mg/L [dissolved oxygen] standard when the Project is discharging, i.e., during periods of generation and in its minimum flow releases from the Weiss and Jordan developments.\"). In reaching that conclusion, the Commission noted that the Alabama Department of Environmental Management interpreted the state code to mandate 4.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen levels only during periods of actual generation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PP 26-27. The Commission also accepted Alabama Power's submissions that it would be infeasible to maintain 4.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen minimums at all times even if various mitigation measures identified by Commission staff were implemented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PP 44-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Commission's authorization for Alabama Power to operate for substantial periods of time without maintaining the lowest level of dissolved oxygen identified in the text of Alabama's statute and necessary to avoid \"acute mortality,\"\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 38, constituted a significant adverse environmental consequence without reasoned justification. As the Commission acknowledged at oral argument, non-generation periods constitute the \"overwhelming majority\" of time for the project. Oral Argument at 1:10:24-1:10:56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   What is more, the record documented an extensive and troubling pattern during which dissolved oxygen levels in the Project area frequently plummeted below the lowest tolerable level, threatening \"acute mortality\" for many aquatic species.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 38. A comprehensive analysis of the Project's dissolved oxygen levels for much of 1999-2014 revealed that hourly dissolved oxygen levels during generation periods fell below the minimum 4.0mg/L standard more than 25% of the time across all Coosa developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For example, in 2014, records revealed that, at numerous Alabama Power sites, dissolved oxygen levels routinely dropped below 4.0 mg/L in the warmer months, at the following frequency: 13.6% of generation time at H. Neely Henry, 10.2% at Weiss, 5.8% at Logan Martin, and 1.2% at Mitchell.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Mean daily levels of dissolved oxygen during non-generation periods-exactly what the Commission greenlighted-were far worse. The percentage of non-generation time when dissolved oxygen dropped below 4.0 mg/L was: 57.8% at Logan Martin, 50.4% at Lay, 37.1% at H. Neely Henry, 11.5% at Mitchell, and less than 1% at Weiss.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To put a finer point on it, the Commission's own licensing record establishes that the Coosa River Project regularly and predictably violates the water quality license conditions during generation periods and blows right past the water-quality standard codified in Alabama law during times of non-generation, threatening lethal consequences for water species. Indeed, in 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service expressed its \"very serious concerns\" to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management about \"repeated non-compliance with state water quality standards (pursuant to section 40l of the Clean Water Act) by [Alabama Power]'s facilities subject to this relicensing as well as inconsistent data reporting[.]\" J.A. 635. Yet the Commission took no account of the environmental impact of these deadly low levels of dissolved oxygen in its NEPA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Instead, the Commission hangs its hat on the license's requirement that Alabama Power install oxygen diffuser aeration systems. These aeration systems are generally designed to pump additional oxygen into the water during generation periods. That sounds like a promising approach. At least, if the aspiration were matched with substance. But it is not on this administrative record. The licensing record is devoid of information about what aeration system will be implemented, or when, or how it will perform. Alabama Power never provided any details or specifications about its proposed aeration system before the Commission reflexively embraced it as a sufficient mitigation measure. On top of that, the Commission allowed Alabama Power an additional six months after the license issued before even\n   <em>\n    disclosing\n   </em>\n   its anticipated aeration measures to the Commission and another year to put them in place. The Commission also gave Alabama Power another six months from license issuance to file its proposals for water quality monitoring enhancements, so that they too could-hopefully-be implemented within eighteen months of licensing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Also curiously absent from the Commission's analysis is what would happen to the water if the proposed aeration system or other mitigation measures fell short and were disapproved by the Commission. That was a distinct possibility given that the Commission had already found that two of Alabama Power's existing aeration systems failed to meet the 4.0 mg/L bare minimum at the time of relicensing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at PP 29-35. And the Commission ignored altogether the impact\n   on the Coosa River habitat and aquatic life of at least eighteen months of dangerously depleted dissolved oxygen levels across almost the entire Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Because Alabama Power gave the Commission nothing in this record to support its judgment, the Commission pointed in its First Rehearing Order to an aeration system apparently being used at the Yadkin-Pee-Dee Project in North Carolina to maintain appropriate dissolved oxygen levels. That hurts rather than helps. Remember, by the time the Commission issued its First Rehearing Order, three years had elapsed from the licensing decision. If Alabama Power had been timely implementing the aeration systems as promised in the Licensing Order, the Commission would have had no need to look to an unrelated project in North Carolina to prop up its decision. Plus, if the Commission was aware of a successful aeration system available for Alabama Power to use, then it should have required that Alabama Power use that system or its equivalent rather than give the Company an 18-month (or perhaps now three-year) blank check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   What is more, the administrative record does nothing to back-up the Commission's reliance on Yadkin-Pee-Dee. The record is devoid of evidence or data indicating that whatever aeration system used there would have the same results in the Coosa River given the configuration of its hydroelectric systems and already-fragile and degraded conditions. Also missing is any analysis of how long the dissolved oxygen levels persist before dissipation, the conditions under which the aeration system performed in North Carolina, or even evidence that the proffered levels of dissolved oxygen actually ever materialized at Yadkin-Pee-Dee. The Commission just blithely assumed that (i) a buffer level of 6.0 mg/L of dissolved oxygen would be consistently attained, and (ii) it would be enduring enough to perpetuate at least the minimum 4.0 mg/L throughout the entire non-generating period.\n   <em>\n    First Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   at P 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To sum up, the Commission relicensed the Coosa Project despite known violations of minimum dissolved oxygen levels based on its sight-unseen acceptance of Alabama Power's anticipated-but-unidentified mitigation measures, the specifics of which did not even have to be submitted for examination until six months after the license issued, or installed for eighteen months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment at 222-223. Given the exceptional importance of maintaining minimum dissolved oxygen levels to the aquatic ecosystem, it was irrational for the Commission to cast those significant environmental impacts aside in reliance on some sort of mitigation measures, which the Commission was content to leave as \"TBD.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Consideration of Cumulative Impacts\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   NEPA requires that the agency's Environmental Assessment wrestle with the cumulative environmental impact of a proposed action.

As a result, the Service's failure to factor the damage already wrought by the construction of dams into the cumulative impacts analysis fatally infected this aspect of the Commission's NEPA decision as well. The Commission gave scant attention to those past actions that had led to and were perpetuating the Coosa River's heavily damaged and fragile ecosystem. Nor did it offer any substantive analysis of how the present impacts of those past actions would combine and interact with the added impacts of the 30-year licensing decision. The Commission's cumulative impact analysis left out critical parts of the equation and, as a result, fell far short of the NEPA mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Finally, we note that in this case, the question of whether the Commission complied with its statutory obligations under the Federal Power Act's licensing provisions is subsumed by questions concerning its compliance with countervailing statutory restrictions imposed by NEPA and ESA.
