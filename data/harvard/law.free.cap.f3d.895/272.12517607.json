But in 2017, following an amendment to its Constitution, the New Jersey Criminal Justice Reform Act took effect. It replaced New Jersey's former monetary bail system with a new framework that prioritizes the use of non-monetary conditions of release over monetary bail to secure a criminal defendant's pretrial liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brittan Holland and Lexington National Insurance Corporation challenge this feature of the Reform Act as a violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Kelly Rosen, the Team Leader for Pretrial Services in the Criminal Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mary E. Colalillo, the Camden County Prosecutor, and Christopher S. Porrino, the Attorney General of New Jersey, and their agents (for convenience we refer to the named officials and their agents collectively as the \"State\"), \"from taking any actions to enforce statutory provisions [of the Reform Act] ... that allow imposition of severe restrictions on the pre-trial liberty of presumptively innocent criminal defendants without offering the option of monetary bail.\" Proposed Order of Plaintiffs Granting Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction at 2,\n   <em>\n    Holland v.

On the merits, the question key to Holland's contentions is whether there is a federal constitutional right to deposit money or obtain a corporate surety bond to ensure a criminal defendant's\n   future appearance in court as an equal alternative to non-monetary conditions of pretrial release. Our answer is no. Thus we affirm the District Court's comprehensive and well-reasoned ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

New Jersey Pretrial Release and Detention Prior to the Criminal Justice Reform Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the Reform Act, New Jersey's system of pretrial release relied heavily on the use of monetary bail, requiring defendants to post either cash or arrange with a third party a bond for their release.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435280\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/229/44/\">\n    160 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   5 ; N.J.

Some defendants were released on personal recognizance (that is, undertaking a personal obligation to appear) or unsecured appearance bond (making a personal promise to pay, and sometimes obtaining a co-signor's promise to pay, a sum of money in the event of flight).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For most, however, release on bail required the security of cash deposited with the court equal to the full amount of bail set, ten-percent cash bail, corporate surety bond, or property bond. JCCJ Report at 21-22. There was a presumption in favor of full cash bail for certain bail-restricted offenses. For most other offenses defendants were presumed to have a ten-percent cash bail option,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, which allowed them to deposit ten percent of the sum with the court and undertake a personal recognizance for the remainder.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Alternatively, defendants could post a corporate surety bond from an insurance company, which, after collecting a non-refundable fee from them and sometimes requiring collateral, executed a contract with the court and became responsible for the full amount of bail if the defendants failed to appear in court. JCCJ Report at 22. A final option was to post a property bond, for which defendants or their surety pledged real property, such as a deed to a house.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20A.2d%20886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court in setting bail was only authorized to consider the risk of flight of defendants and was not authorized to consider any danger they may have presented.

Marie VanNostrand, New Jersey Jail Population Analysis 11, 13 (2013) (\"VanNostrand Report\"). One in eight inmates-12% of the total population-was in custody because he or she could not pay $2,500 or less.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.

Governor Christie called in 2012 for a constitutional amendment to allow for pretrial detention in serious cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of the Courts, Criminal Justice Reform: Annual Report to the Governor &amp; Legislature 1 (2016).

The report, supported by extensive research, found significant consequences to pretrial custody: defendants detained in jail while awaiting trial pled guilty more often, were convicted more often, were sentenced to prison more often, and received harsher prison sentences, than those released before trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Committee sought to promote defendants' liberty interests by shifting from a \"resource-based\" to a \"risk-based\" system of bail that relies heavily on release (with non-monetary conditions to address defendants' particular risks) rather than pretrial detention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The Committee did not recommend the abolition of monetary bail, though it did expect that relying on particular, and often nuanced, conditions would result in monetary bail being set with far less frequency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Legislature ultimately adopted a proposal to amend the State Constitution as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All persons shall, before conviction, be eligible for pretrial release. Pretrial release may be denied to a person if the court finds that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of pretrial release, or combination of monetary bail and non-monetary conditions would reasonably assure the person's appearance in court when required, or protect the safety of any other person or the community, or prevent the person from obstructing or attempting to obstruct the criminal justice process. It shall be lawful for the Legislature to establish by law procedures, terms, and conditions applicable to pretrial release and the denial thereof authorized under this provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   N.J. Const. art. I, \u00b6 11 (2017). The Legislature also drafted the Criminal Justice Reform Act to implement changes to the State's bail system and provide for more timely trials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act, described in greater detail below, stemmed from the passage of the proposed constitutional amendment, which voters approved by a margin of 61.8% to 38.2% in November 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Div. of Elections, Dep't of State, Official List: Public Question Results for 11/04/2014 General Election Public Question No. 1, at 1 (Dec. 2, 2014). Both the amendment and the Act took effect on January 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Reform Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Reform Act's three goals are \"primarily [to] rely[ ] upon pretrial release by non-monetary means to reasonably assure an eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, [and] that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-15 (2017). Importantly, the Act applies only to \"eligible defendants\"-those issued \"a complaint-warrant ... for\n   an initial charge involving an indictable offense or a disorderly persons offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A defendant charged by a complaint-summons will be released from custody and is not subject to the Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-16(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Reform Act establishes a multi-step process the court must follow when deciding to release or detain an eligible defendant. First, he or she is temporarily detained to allow the Pretrial Services Program (\"Pretrial Services\") to prepare a Public Safety Assessment and recommendation for release conditions and for the court to issue a pretrial release decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-16(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Public Safety Assessment model, developed by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, considers nine factors to measure the risk an eligible defendant will fail to appear in court and the risk he or she will engage in new criminal activity while on release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , New Jersey Pretrial Justice Manual 7, 8 (2016) (\"ACLU Pretrial Justice Manual\"). The Assessment for each eligible defendant is based on relevant information gathered from his or her electronic court records. AG Dir. 2016-6, at 27. The eligible defendant's risks for failure to appear and for new criminal activity are graded on a scale of one to six, with six being the greatest risk. He or she may also be flagged for new violent criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These scores map onto a Decision-Making Framework that recommends a pretrial monitoring level based on the intersection of failure to appear and new criminal activity scores, the new violent criminal activity flag (should there be one), and other factors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pretrial Release Recommendation Decision Making Framework (DMF) (March 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Level 1 recommends eligible defendants report once a month by phone. Level 2 recommends monthly telephonic reporting, monthly in-person reporting, and some monitored conditions (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a curfew). Level 3 recommends weekly telephonic or in-person monitoring and monitored conditions. Level 3+ recommends all the same conditions as level 3 plus electronic monitoring and/or home detention. If release is not recommended, the matrix suggests the eligible defendant be detained pretrial or, if released, ordered to comply with level 3+ conditions. ACLU Pretrial Justice Manual at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The eligible defendant's first appearance must occur no later than 48 hours after his or her commitment to jail, subject to certain exceptions. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(1). At the first appearance the court must make a pretrial release decision unless the prosecutor files a motion for detention, in which case it will hold a separate pretrial detention hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-17, 2A:162-18(a)(1). In general, that hearing must occur no later than the eligible defendant's first appearance, or three working days from the date the motion for detention was filed, unless the eligible defendant or prosecutor seeks a continuance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-19(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Not all eligible defendants may be detained pretrial. Rather, a prosecutor may only move to detain an eligible defendant charged with certain crimes, and the court must find clear and convincing evidence that no condition, or combination of monetary and non-monetary conditions, of release can reasonably assure the Act's goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-15, 2A:162-18(a)(1), 2A:162-19(a), (e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the pretrial detention hearing, the eligible defendant has the right to counsel and to have counsel appointed if he or she is financially unable to obtain representation. He or she is also afforded the opportunity to testify, present witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, and present information\n   by proffer or otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-19(e)(1). The eligible defendant may also subpoena and call the State's witnesses. ACLU Pretrial Justice Manual at 42. Rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to this hearing. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-19(e)(1). Further, the eligible defendant is entitled to significant discovery for the detention hearing, including that the prosecutor's office shall provide \"any available preliminary law enforcement incident report concerning the offense and the affidavit of probable cause,\" along with all statements or reports relating to the affidavit, evidence the State relies on to establish probable cause at the hearing, and the risk factors that the State advances at the hearing. N.J. Ct. R. 3:4-2(c)(1) (2017). The prosecutor's office must also provide all exculpatory evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If there is no indictment, the prosecutor must establish probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-19(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court may take into account numerous factors to determine whether to detain the eligible defendant. They include, for example, the nature of the offense charged, the history and characteristics of the eligible defendant, the nature and seriousness of his or her risk of danger, and the release recommendation of Pretrial Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-20. If the court orders detention, it must include written findings of fact (along with a statement of the reasons for detention) and direct that the eligible defendant be afforded a reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-21(a). An eligible defendant ordered detained is entitled to appeal that decision in an expedited manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-18(c). Additionally, the hearing may be reopened at any time before trial if the court finds information that was not known to the prosecutor or the eligible defendant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the Act's goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-19(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If the court does not order detention, it must determine what release conditions, if any, should be imposed on the eligible defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-18(d). It needs to consider all the circumstances, the Public Safety Assessment and recommendation for release conditions, plus any information provided by a prosecutor or the eligible defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2), 2A:162-17(a). Based on this information, the court shall order him or her to be released on personal recognizance or on execution of an unsecured appearance bond if either option would reasonably assure the Act's goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2)(a), 2A:162-17(a). If not, the court may order him or her released on a non-monetary condition or combination of conditions, \"with the condition or conditions being the least restrictive ... that the court determines will reasonably assure\" the Act's goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2)(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-17(b). If none of the above will reasonably assure those goals, the court may order the eligible defendant released on monetary bail, other than unsecured appearance bond, to assure his or her appearance in court (but not to assure a person or the community's safety), or a combination of monetary bail and non-monetary conditions to assure the goals that apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2)(c), 2A:162-17(c)(1), (d)(1), 2A:162-18(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The release conditions imposed may require, at the minimum, that the eligible defendant refrain from committing any offense during release, avoid all communication with an alleged victim of the crime, avoid communication with specified witnesses who may testify concerning the charged offense, and comply with \"any one or more non-monetary conditions\" in the\n   statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2A:162-17(b)(1).

Additionally, the State Superior Court may later review conditions of release on its own motion, or a motion by the prosecutor or the eligible defendant, alleging there has been a \"material change in circumstance that justifies a change in conditions.\" N.J. Ct. R. 3:26-2(c)(2). Any review of conditions under this rule must be decided within 30 days of the date the motion was filed and the judge may set new conditions of release on a finding that there has been a material change in circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State has released statistics on pretrial release and detention for the year following the Reform Act's implementation. In 2017 142,663 defendants were charged by either a complaint-warrant or a complaint-summons. Of those, 44,319 defendants were issued a complaint-warrant. Prosecutors filed 19,366 motions for pretrial detention, and courts ordered 8,043 eligible defendants detained. The pretrial detention rate for all eligible defendants was 18.1%, and the overall pretrial detention rate (considering complaint-warrants and complaint-summonses) was 5.6%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of the Courts, Criminal Justice Reform: Annual Report to the Governor &amp; Legislature 4 (2017) (\"CJR Report 2017\").

Additionally, judges ordered only 44 eligible defendants to post monetary bail in 2017. Overall, the State's pretrial jail population was reduced by 20%.

The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Holland was arrested in April 2017 for his alleged involvement in a bar fight, and\n   he was charged with second-degree aggravated assault. The Affidavit of Probable Cause in support of the criminal complaint noted Holland struck the victim in the face in the parking lot outside a bar, then continued to strike the victim in the head and face after he fell to the ground, causing serious bodily harm. Holland then fled the scene and was apprehended at his home with his clothing covered in fresh blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Camden County Prosecutor's Office filed a motion for pretrial detention due to the severity of Holland's alleged offense and his prior conviction for simple assault. The Decision-Making Framework recommended pretrial detention in part because the Public Safety Assessment flagged Holland for a risk of new violent criminal activity. Represented by a Public Defender, Holland negotiated for level 3+ non-monetary pretrial release conditions in exchange for the prosecutor's withdrawal of the motion. He appeared in court and accepted the negotiated agreement, which included home detention and electronic monitoring, and he declined to proceed with a pretrial detention hearing. Holland is currently on pretrial release with conditions including home detention (except for employment) and electronic monitoring. He has not sought a judicial determination of his conditions of release or any modification of the agreed conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Lexington is a Florida corporation based in Maryland.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Holland and Lexington filed a class action Complaint and a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on June 14, 2017. The State then filed an opposition to the injunction motion, to which Holland and Lexington replied. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion for leave to appear as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   on behalf of itself and the ACLU of New Jersey, Drug Policy Alliance, Latino Action Network, and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People-New Jersey Conference. The District Court granted the request of the national ACLU, which then submitted a brief and participated in oral argument in support of the State. The Court convened a preliminary injunction hearing; after hearing oral argument, it denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the Court considered Holland and Lexington's standing to raise their claims. It held Holland has standing on his own (called first-party standing) because his alleged injury would be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. However, it held that Lexington lacks first-party and third-party standing, the latter allowing a litigant to assert in certain circumstances claims of other parties. The Court reached its conclusion about third-party standing after finding Lexington had sufficiently alleged injury, but even assuming it has a close relationship with criminal defendants, it did not sufficiently allege criminal defendants face obstacles to pursuing their own claims that only Lexington can address adequately. The Court did not opine on whether Lexington's alleged injury fell outside the \"zone-of-interests\" of the Eighth, Fourteenth, and Fourth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, in response to the State's argument that the Court must abstain from interfering with Holland's ongoing state criminal prosecution per\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), it applied\n   <em>\n    Gerstein v.

It examined the history of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Bail Clause and held the argument for the right to monetary bail was unlikely to succeed on the merits. The Court then reviewed the procedures provided by the Reform Act and concluded the statute did not violate procedural due process and, in any event, Holland waived the process available to him by agreeing to level 3+ conditions. It also held the statute's subordination of monetary bail did not violate substantive due process because Holland did not present any grounds for finding an option to obtain monetary bail is a fundamental right or is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Finally, it held the conditions imposed on Holland were not an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment because the prosecutor had to show there was probable cause for his charged offense, and Holland waived the opportunity to have a full pretrial detention hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court turned to the likelihood Holland will suffer irreparable harm. It held there was scant likelihood of that occurring if an injunction were denied because Holland's suggested harm was the deprivation of his constitutional right to the option, alongside non-monetary bail, of monetary bail, which would have required the Court to hold there was such a right. Moreover, it noted Holland still has the ability to seek a modification of his conditions of release in the New Jersey court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The balance of harms weighed against granting the requested injunction. The Court noted that such an injunction mandating consideration of monetary bail risked reinstalling the system of financial requirements that previously relegated to pretrial detention those unable to meet modest monetary bail requirements. It found the harm to Holland of denying the injunction was minimal because, even if monetary bail were set for him, he would likely have to pay a non-refundable bail bond premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the Court determined the public interest disfavors an injunction. It found the reforms implemented by the State support the public interest, particularly in light of the well-documented shortcomings of the prior monetary bail system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Before we reach the constitutional questions raised in this appeal, we address the parties' standing. The State argues the District Court erred in holding Holland has first-party standing because he did not suffer an injury-in-fact and because his alleged injury is not redressable by a court. Lexington asserts the Court also erred in holding it lacks third-party standing because it has a common interest with criminal defendants and they face obstacles to appealing their pretrial release decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For Holland to have standing, he must \"have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1547,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The parties do not contest that Holland's alleged injury is traceable to the State's conduct. Rather, the State raises three arguments contesting Holland's standing. It argues before us that Holland did not allege in his Complaint that the \"unconstitutional process\" injured him, but rather it was the imposition of non-monetary conditions of pretrial release without considering monetary bail as a non-subordinated option. Additionally, it contends that, even if monetary bail were considered alongside non-monetary release conditions, Holland would still be subject to restrictive conditions to address his risk to the community or other persons. Finally, it asserts Holland failed to carry the burden of demonstrating he has an injury-in-fact (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one that is real and particular to him, called in constitutional argot \"concrete and particularized\") in\n   part because he opted out of the pretrial detention hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Each of the State's arguments fails. First, the State reads Holland's Complaint too narrowly. His prayer for relief-a preliminary injunction against imposing \"severe restrictions on ... pre-trial liberty ... without offering the option of non-excessive monetary bail\"-could fairly be read to mean the State court must offer (or have the option to offer) monetary bail when setting release conditions. Second, even assuming the Act's process is unconstitutional, the District Court correctly determined that if monetary bail were required to be considered on equal footing with non-monetary release conditions, Holland's injury-the \"unconstitutional process\"-would be redressed regardless what release conditions would be imposed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stehney v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639815\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/925/#p931\">\n    101 F.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 931 (3d Cir. 1996) (holding plaintiff's injury would be redressed by a new employment review). Third, if the Act's process deprived Holland of a constitutional right, his injury would be both concrete and particularized even though he opted out of the hearing. Holland contends he did not have access to a constitutionally compliant process. If so, this affected him personally and in a real way by disallowing him the opportunity to have monetary bail set even if he had agreed to participate in the process provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lexington does not challenge the District Court's holding that it lacks first-party standing, and instead argues on appeal that the Court erred in holding it lacks third-party standing. We have recognized the prudential doctrine of third-party standing, which, to repeat, allows in limited circumstances litigants to assert claims based on the rights of third parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa. Psychiatric Soc'y v. Green Spring Health Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393236\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/278/#p287\">\n    280 F.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287-88 (3d Cir. 2002). It may be appropriate \"if a course of conduct prevents a third-party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically a contractual relationship), to which relationship the third party has a legal entitlement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393236\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/278/#p287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393236\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/278/#p287\">\n    at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff asserting a third-party claim needs to meet three conditions: \"[ ( ]1) the plaintiff must suffer injury; [ ( ]2) the plaintiff and the third party must have a 'close relationship'; and [ ( ]3) the third party must face some obstacles that prevent it from pursuing its own claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393236\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/278/#p287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393236\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/278/#p287\">\n    at 288-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lexington, as the plaintiff, asserts it satisfies each of these conditions: it suffered an injury because the Reform Act \"all but eliminated\" the use of monetary bail and bail bonds; it has a common interest with criminal defendants like Holland in courts considering monetary bail alongside restrictive release conditions; and criminal defendants subject to home detention and electronic monitoring face obstacles to pursuing litigation themselves because of the nature and cost of challenges to pretrial-release decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The State does not challenge that Lexington has sufficiently alleged injury due to its loss of business by the Act's shift away from monetary bail. Even assuming this factor is met, Lexington fails to satisfy the second and third conditions required for third-party standing-it has no relationship, let alone a close relationship, with potential criminal defendant-customers. In\n   <em>\n    Kowalski v. Tesmer\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether a \"future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants who will request, but be denied, the appointment of appellate counsel\" based on the operation of a state statute met the \"close relationship\" factor.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3441929\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/125/#p130\">\n    543 U.S. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3441929\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/125/#p130\">\n    125 S.Ct. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3441929\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/125/#p130\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted).

Rev. 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the context of the early personal surety bail system, the Eighth Amendment prohibited the demand that a surety pledge an excessive sum of money to secure the defendant's release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Burr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6579966\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/25/55/#p62\">\n    25 F. Cas. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (Va. Cir. Ct. 1807). Thus personal surety bail may be characterized as a form of monetary bail, in that the surety agreed to pay a sum of money if the defendant failed to appear. But Holland does not argue the Amendment provides a right to personal surety bail; rather, he asserts the Amendment provides a right to pretrial release secured by cash bail or corporate surety bond. He has not shown, however, that \"bail\" at the time of the Constitution's ratification contemplated either of these two forms of monetary bail, and we find no evidence that they were in practice at that time. Hence, even if the Eighth Amendment provides a \"right to bail,\" we do not construe its original meaning to include a right to make a cash deposit or to obtain a corporate surety bond to secure pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Contemporary definitions of \"bail\" reflect its early form and a broader meaning that has taken hold over time. \"Bail,\" in the criminal justice context, is defined variously as: (1) \"the custody of a prisoner or one under arrest by one who procures the release of the prisoner or arrested individual by giving surety for his due appearance;\" (2) \"the security or obligation given for the due appearance of a prisoner in order to obtain his release from imprisonment;\" (3) \"the temporary delivery or release of a prisoner upon security for his due appearance;\" (4) \"one that agrees to assume legal liability for a money forfeit or damages if a prisoner released on bail fails to make his due appearance in court;\" and (5) \"the process by which a person is released from custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Bail\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 163 (1971). The last iteration is how we often think of bail colloquially: a means of achieving pretrial release from custody conditioned on adequate assurances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Supreme Court's use of \"bail\" since the middle of the Twentieth Century points to this broader definition. In\n   <em>\n    Stack v. Boyle\n   </em>\n   , the Court described a statutory \"right to bail\" as the \"traditional right to freedom before conviction,\" and \"[t]he right to release before trial ... conditioned upon the accused's giving adequate assurance that he will stand trial and submit to sentence if found guilty.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641182\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/1/#p4\">\n    342 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641182\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/1/#p4\">\n    72 S.Ct. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%203\">\n    96 L.Ed. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1951). The early practice of bail was the \"securing [of] oaths of responsible persons to stand as sureties for the accused,\" whereas the practice in the 1950s was \"requiring a bail bond or a deposit of a sum of money subject to forfeiture [to] serve[ ] as additional assurance of the presence of an accused.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%203\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641182\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/1/#p4\">\n    72 S.Ct. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under an original meaning, even assuming there is a \"right to bail,\" we have already noted it did not contemplate monetary bail as Holland describes it,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , cash bail or corporate surety bond. Neither does a contemporary definition of bail mean exclusively monetary bail; non-monetary conditions of release are also \"bail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Holland further argues that, under a broad definition of \"bail,\" the Reform Act would violate the Eighth Amendment by subjecting defendants to home detention and electronic monitoring \"when monetary bail would suffice.\" Appellants' Br. at 39 n.1. In effect, he asserts the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive bail is violated when there is a less restrictive alternative to the conditions of release ordered by a court. But that is not the test articulated by\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   ; for those conditions, however restrictive, to violate the Eighth Amendment, they must be \"excessive in light of the perceived evil.\"\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p752\">\n    481 U.S. at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p752\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cal. 2007). Holland's release conditions are hardly excessive in light of the State's legitimate interest in addressing his risk of flight and risk of danger to others; the existence of a purportedly less restrictive means does not bear on whether the conditions are excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Holland also claims the Reform Act violates the Excessive Bail Clause because it imposes severe restrictions on \"all defendants[']\" pretrial liberty except those who can be released on their own recognizance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants' Br. at 36. This statement and Holland's claim that the Reform Act \"authoriz[es] severe liberty restrictions of\n   <em>\n    non-dangerous\n   </em>\n   defendants\" misconstrue the Act's statutory requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (emphasis in original). The conditions of release imposed on Holland may only be applied if they are the \"least restrictive ... conditions that the court determines will reasonably assure [his] appearance in court when required [and] the protection of the safety of any other person or the community ....\" N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2)(b). In practice this has resulted in pretrial monitoring level\n   3+ home detention and electronic monitoring being ordered for 8.3% of eligible defendants, far from \"all defendants.\" And if a court sought to impose home detention and electronic monitoring on a non-dangerous defendant who presents little risk of flight, it would have to contend with the Act's command that only the least restrictive conditions reasonably assuring the Act's goals may be imposed. If those conditions were excessive in light of the State's legitimate interests, it would also come up against the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail. This hypothetical scenario, we point out, does not concern Holland, who has not challenged his classification as a potentially dangerous defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, though he waived his statutory right to a pretrial detention hearing, Holland still has an opportunity to argue for a change in his release conditions and potentially request that monetary bail be set. This requires a material change in circumstances justifying a modification. N.J. Ct. R. 3:26-2(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In this context, Holland has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his argument that the Excessive Bail Clause guarantees a right to monetary bail. Regardless whether the Clause incorporates a right to bail, the latter is not limited to cash bail or corporate surety bonds; it is, to repeat, \"release before trial ... conditioned upon the accused's giving adequate assurance[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Stack\n   </em>\n   , 342 U.S. at 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641182\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/1/#p4\">\n    72 S.Ct. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Clause does not dictate whether those assurances must be based on monetary or non-monetary conditions.

Reliance on non-monetary conditions of release instead of monetary bail thus allows the State to release low-risk defendants, who may be unable to afford to post cash or pay a bondsman, while addressing riskier defendants' potential to flee, endanger the community or another person, or interfere with the judicial process that decrees their guilt or innocence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Due to the prosecutor's pretrial detention motion, Holland had access to a pretrial detention hearing to determine whether he would be detained pretrial and, if not, what conditions of release would be imposed on him. The questions Holland poses are, first, whether the procedural protections supplied to him in this hearing were adequate given the Reform Act's restrictions on a State court's ability to set monetary bail, and, second, whether procedural due process requires the court to consider monetary bail in line with non-monetary conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We briefly restate the Reform Act's existing procedures that applied to Holland\n   had he taken advantage of them. Before the prosecutor brought a pretrial detention motion, Pretrial Services prepared a Public Safety Assessment and recommendation for release conditions that flagged him as a risk to commit new violent criminal activity. It recommended that he be detained pretrial. Following Pretrial Services' recommendation, the prosecutor moved for pretrial detention; hence Holland was entitled under the Reform Act to a pretrial detention hearing. At the hearing he had the right to counsel or to have counsel appointed, the opportunity to testify, present witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, and present information. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-19(e)(1). He was also able to subpoena and call the State's witnesses. ACLU Pretrial Justice Manual at 42. Further, rules concerning the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials did not apply to this hearing, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-19(e)(1), and Holland was entitled to receive significant discovery, including all exculpatory evidence, a copy of the charging documents, all statements and reports that relate to the affidavit of probable cause, plus any additional evidence the prosecutor relied on at the detention hearing to establish probable cause and to support any Public Safety Assessment. N.J. Ct.

These factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense charged; the weight of the evidence against Holland and the admissibility of any evidence sought to be excluded; his history and characteristics; the nature and seriousness of his dangerousness on pretrial release; and Pretrial Services' recommendation of release or detention. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:162-20. If the court then decided against pretrial detention, it could have imposed only the least restrictive non-monetary condition or combination of conditions that would reasonably assure Holland's presence at trial and the safety of the community and other persons, provided release on personal recognizance or an unsecured appearance bond would not reasonably assure those goals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435280\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/229/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2A:162-16(b)(2), 2A:162-17(a)-(b).

All of the procedures the Court held were \"extensive safeguards\" under the federal Act are included in the New Jersey Act's pretrial detention hearing. And the New Jersey Act adds the additional protection of extensive discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beyond these extensive safeguards, the Reform Act allows only the least restrictive non-monetary condition, or combination of conditions, reasonably assuring the Act's goals. Considering all the protections available to Holland under the Reform Act, the risk of erroneous deprivation of his pretrial liberty-ostensibly through the imposition of home detention and electronic monitoring-is low even if the court were unable to consider monetary bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The probable value of requiring the court to consider monetary bail in line with home detention and electronic monitoring is also low. Holland contends that monetary bail preserves liberty, whereas home detention and electronic monitoring encumber it. Thus, the argument goes, giving the court the option to release criminal defendants on monetary bail in lieu of home detention and electronic monitoring would necessarily reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation. His counsel also suggested during oral argument that the court should set monetary bail to account for any flight risk but still have the option to set restrictive non-monetary conditions to account for potential danger. Or. Arg. Tr. at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The first argument is refuted by the actual effect of the Reform Act; the second is hypothetical. New Jersey decided to shift from its prior monetary bail system because it resulted in more criminal defendants being detained in jail pretrial, and \"civil detention ... results in the deprivation of the most fundamental of all personal liberties.\"\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569628\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/100/#p111\">\n    788 F.2d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, in the year since the Act took effect New Jersey's pretrial jail population was reduced significantly while home detention and/or electronic monitoring was ordered for few eligible defendants. CJR Report 2017, at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Initial Release Decisions 2017. Monetary bail, as it existed in New Jersey prior to the Reform Act, resulted in more restrictions of criminal defendants' pretrial liberty, not fewer. Additionally, the notion the court should set monetary bail to account for Holland's flight risk, while also having the ability to set restrictive non-monetary conditions to account for his danger to others, would result in more than the non-monetary bail conditions Holland accepted. Perhaps what he proposes is that using monetary bail to mitigate flight would reduce the restrictiveness of the non-monetary conditions the court sets, thus reducing the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty. If so, he provides no support for this hypothetical outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The final\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the State's interest, also indicates the Reform Act's procedures, which subordinate monetary bail to non-monetary conditions of release, do not violate procedural due process. This factor includes the public interest, \"the administrative burden and other societal costs that would be associated with [the additional] requir[ement]\" along with financial costs to the State.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Reform Act's goals include not only the reasonable assurance of eligible defendants' appearance at trial, but also the safety of the community and other persons, and the integrity of the criminal justice process. Holland does not contest that monetary bail fails to address his risk of danger. Thus the State's strong and legitimate interest is not served by placing consideration of monetary bail in line with conditions designed\n   to mitigate danger to other persons and the community. Moreover, the public interest also includes, broadly, pretrial liberty. As explained above, studies have revealed reliance on monetary bail results in greater encumbrance of pretrial liberty, as many pretrial detainees are kept in custody because of their inability to post even modest monetary bail. And the Reform Act has thus far been effective in reducing the pretrial detention population. Even if home detention and electronic monitoring may be considered restrictions on pretrial liberty, they may only be imposed if they are the least restrictive conditions that reasonably assure the Reform Act's goals. Also of marginal note is the administrative burden of imposing an additional procedural requirement. The State posits that the burden of requiring the court to consider monetary bail in line with non-monetary conditions would include retraining court personnel, prosecutors, public defenders, and private defense attorneys, and promulgating one or more new court rules, which would be financially and human-resource intensive. In any event, the State's interest weighs against finding a violation of procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Though we reach no holding on whether home detention and electronic monitoring impinge Holland's pretrial liberty, we assume they do. Even so, we hold the lower priority of monetary bail to non-monetary bail conditions does not make constitutionally inadequate the extensive safeguards available to Holland under the Reform Act. Those procedures-together with the low probable value of requiring the court to consider monetary bail alongside home detention and electronic monitoring, and the State's interest-indicate the subordination of monetary bail does not violate procedural due process, especially when Holland retains the option of seeking a modification of his bail conditions should circumstances change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In sum, we hold the Reform Act's subordination of monetary bail to non-monetary bail conditions does not violate either component of the Due Process Clause. Substantive due process does not provide a right to monetary bail. It is neither historically rooted to the time of our Bill of Rights nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and the Reform Act's subordination of it to non-monetary release conditions is rationally related to the State's legitimate interests in assuring defendants appear at trial, the safety of the community and other persons, and the integrity of the criminal justice process. As for procedural due process, the extensive safeguards provided by the Reform Act are not made inadequate by its subordination of monetary bail. Moreover, Holland still may move the State court to modify his bail based on a change of circumstances, wherein he may be able to argue he no longer presents a danger and thus the conditions of release imposed on him should be less restrictive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.

We too assume without deciding they are at least somewhat intrusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   That intrusiveness, however, is lessened by Holland's reduced expectation of privacy. \"Once an individual has been arrested on probable cause for a dangerous offense that may require detention before trial, ... his or her expectations of privacy and freedom from police scrutiny\n   are reduced.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p446\">\n    569 U.S. at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p446\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Holland does not challenge that he was arrested on probable cause for a dangerous offense, and thus we consider his expectation of privacy to be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Against Holland's reduced privacy interest we balance the State's interest. The Supreme Court has held \"the Government has a substantial interest in ensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for trials\" and a \"legitimate and compelling\" interest in preventing crime by arrestees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p446\">\n    at 452-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p446\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). These mirror the goals espoused by the State in the Reform Act, and Holland does not challenge the legitimacy of them.

The existence of a less intrusive means does not itself render a search or seizure unreasonable.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Holland has standing to bring his claims that the Reform Act violates the Eighth, Fourteenth, and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution, but Lexington does not. He has not, however, made a threshold showing of the first two factors required to prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction. He has not demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of his argument that the Reform Act violates a constitutional right to cash bail or corporate surety bonds. We find no right to these forms of monetary bail in the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail nor in the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive and procedural due process components. We also reject Holland's \"less intrusive means\" theory of a Fourth Amendment violation, and so we hold he has not made a sufficient showing of a violation of that constitutional amendment. Without a constitutional right violated, and with reconsideration of current release conditions an option if circumstances suggest and a request made, irreparable harm does not exist. Thus we affirm the District Court's denial of Holland's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    This statistic represents those defendants for whom bail was set at $250,000 or less, with the assumption they had a ten-percent cash bail option.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    VanNostrand Report at 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The speedy trial reforms are not implicated by this appeal.
