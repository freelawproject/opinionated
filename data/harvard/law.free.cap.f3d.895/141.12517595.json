The district court held that the member's statutory right to \"inspect\" the agreements did not encompass a right to take notes while doing so. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The material facts may be stated briefly. Dimie Poweigha is a member of Local 26. The union has negotiated more than 40 CBAs, including one with Poweigha's employer. Poweigha was dissatisfied with the administration of Local 26, and asked the union to permit her to review 37 CBAs Local 26 had negotiated with employers other than her own. Eventually, once the Secretary of Labor got involved, the union offered Poweigha opportunities for this purpose, but said that it would not allow her to take notes on the CBAs during her inspections. When the Secretary learned of the union's position, he filed this suit, contending that the limitation on note-taking violated \u00a7 104 of the LMRDA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20414\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in particular, the union's obligation under \u00a7 104 to make such CBAs \"available for inspection by any member or by any employee whose rights are affected by such agreement[s].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties filed dueling motions for judgment on the pleadings, and the district court granted judgment for Local 26 on the issue before us.

And the legislative history confirms the application of this common-sense principle here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 86-1147, at 34 (1959) (stating that the words \"and copy\" were eliminated to \"deny candidates the right to copy membership lists\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">\n    469 U.S. 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">\n    105 S.Ct. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">\n    83 L.Ed.2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (\"In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which represent the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, under \u00a7 401(c) of the LMRDA, Congress plainly did not intend the right to \"inspect\" to include the\n   right to copy. Not surprisingly, the Secretary has issued a regulation reaching this same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20452.71\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the right to inspect a membership list under \u00a7 401(c) \"does not include the right to copy the [membership] list\"). And no distinction can be drawn from the difference between \"copying\" then and \"note-taking\" now, because in 1959, the year of enactment, a right to \"copy\" would, as a practical matter, have been exercised by handwritten note-taking. \"Office copying as we know it didn't arrive until 1960.\" David Owen,\n   <em>\n    Copies in Seconds\n   </em>\n   10 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If the right to \"inspect\" in \u00a7 401(c) of the LMRDA does not provide a right to take notes, it would be at odds with another well-established canon of statutory interpretation to read \"inspect\" in \u00a7 104 of the same Act to confer that same right. That canon teaches that \"identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Powerex Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reliant Energy Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573144\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/224/#p232\">\n    551 U.S. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573144\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/224/#p232\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573144\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/224/#p232\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). After all, it would assume a certain whimsy on the part of Congress to conclude that it used the term \"inspect\" in two different senses within the same statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the rule, like most, admits of exceptions, there is no apparent reason to question its applicability here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second feature of the statute that persuades us of our reading is that when Congress wished to provide individuals with a right to a \"copy\" of a CBA, it said so expressly. In particular, \u00a7 104 entitles \"any employee ... whose rights as such employee are directly affected by [a CBA]\" to a copy of that CBA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20414\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Congress had intended to entitle union members to copies of every CBA a union negotiates, it needed only to say so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675876\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/181/#p188\">\n    552 U.S. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675876\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/181/#p188\">\n    128 S.Ct. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675876\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/181/#p188\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"If Congress had intended the Court of Appeals' reading, it easily could have replaced 'would' in the statute with 'could,' and presumably would have. The fact that it did not adopt this readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports rejecting the Court of Appeals' reading.\"). But Congress did not say so. To be sure, what Poweigha claims is not a right to obtain a copy but, in effect, a right to make one herself. We doubt, however, that the distinction matters. It would be passing strange, if not downright mean, for Congress to have intended to withhold a right to receive a copy, while simultaneously conferring a right on members to create handwritten copies themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Secretary's remaining counterarguments need not detain us long. First, the Secretary asserts that the inspection right would \"be nullified without the ability to take notes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Brief for Appellant 5. But as the Secretary himself acknowledges, \"the purpose behind section 104\" is to \"give[ ] union members ... 'ideas' \" that they may \"put forward to the union's negotiators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. One need not be permitted to take notes in real time to come away\n   with ideas from the review of a CBA; a working memory will do. Second, the Secretary suggests that his interpretation is the better one because it is more supportive of the LMRDA's purposes of protecting union members and promoting democratic self-government within unions. But Congress was undoubtedly balancing competing interests in enacting the LMRDA, and, in any case, \"no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131066\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/522/#p525\">\n    480 U.S. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525-26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131066\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/522/#p525\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131066\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/522/#p525\">\n    94 L.Ed.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (per curiam);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calhoon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/134/#p140\">\n    379 U.S. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729331\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/134/#p140\">\n    85 S.Ct. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729331\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/134/#p140\">\n    13 L.Ed.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964) (noting, in construing the LMRDA, \"the general congressional policy to allow unions great latitude in resolving their own internal controversies\"). Third, the Secretary points to another provision of the LMRDA, permitting members \"for just cause to examine any books, records, and accounts necessary to verify\" the union's annual financial reports,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20431\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which some courts have interpreted to permit note-taking,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Conley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of Am., Local Union No. 1014\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984360\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/549/1122/#p1123\">\n    549 F.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123-24 (7th Cir. 1977). Whether that interpretation is correct or not, the meaning of the word \"examine\" in a separate provision of the LMRDA has little, if any, bearing on the meaning of the word \"inspection\" in \u00a7 104 of the Act. That is particularly apparent in light of the \"just cause\" requirement that \"protect[s] ... unions from harassment\" when it comes to the exercise of the examination right, a protection that unions do not enjoy when a member wishes to inspect a union's CBAs with other employers.\n   <em>\n    Conley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984360\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/549/1122/#p1123\">\n    549 F.2d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that, in conferring a right on union members to \"inspect[ ]\" CBAs under \u00a7 104 of the LMRDA, Congress did not also invest the members with a right to take notes.

The district court rejected that argument, holding that the statutory phrase \"whose rights are affected by such agreement\" modifies \"any employee,\" not \"any member.\" The rule of the last antecedent, \"according to which a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,\" supports the district court's construction.\n    <em>\n     Barnhart\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896762\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/20/#p26\">\n     540 U.S. 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 26,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896762\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/20/#p26\">\n     124 S.Ct. 376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896762\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/20/#p26\">\n     157 L.Ed.2d 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2003).
