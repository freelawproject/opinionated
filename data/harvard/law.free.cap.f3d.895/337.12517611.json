Allen and Nautilus obtained the rights to create the footage and photograph through a permit issued by North Carolina to the ship's salvors, and Allen subsequently registered his work with the U.S. Copyright Office. Allen and Nautilus also seek to declare unconstitutional a 2015 state law-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121-25\">\n    N.C.

North Carolina's claim of sovereign immunity prompted Allen and Nautilus to argue (1) that in a 2013 Settlement Agreement, North Carolina waived sovereign immunity; (2) that in any event the federal Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of\n   1990 had abrogated the State's sovereign immunity; and (3) that as to their claims for injunctive relief,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   provided an exception to sovereign immunity for ongoing violations of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court rejected North Carolina's claims of immunity, and North Carolina filed this interlocutory appeal. Allen and Nautilus filed a cross-appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   the claims against the state officials in their individual capacities and to dismiss\n   <em>\n    without prejudice\n   </em>\n   the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1717, the pirate Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, captured a French merchant vessel and renamed her\n   <em>\n    Queen Anne's Revenge\n   </em>\n   . Teach armed the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   with 40 cannons and made her his flagship. But the following year, the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   ran aground about a mile off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina, and Teach abandoned her. Under state law, the ship and its artifacts later became the property of North Carolina and subject to its \"exclusive dominion and control.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121-22\">\n    N.C.

Under the agreement, Intersal and Maritime Research acknowledged North Carolina's ownership of the shipwreck and the ship's artifacts, and North Carolina acknowledged Intersal's and Maritime Research's salvage rights, agreeing that Intersal and Maritime Research could retain a designated portion of the financial proceeds arising from the sale of media relating to the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   and replicas of its artifacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As relevant to this case, the agreement provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Except as provided in paragraph 20 and this paragraph, Intersal shall have the exclusive right to make and market all commercial narrative (written, film, CD Rom, and/or video) accounts of project related activities undertaken by the Parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The agreement, however, made an exception for the creation of a \"non commercial educational video and/or film documentary\" and provided that the parties would cooperate in making such an educational documentary. And Paragraph 20 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Department shall have the right to authorize access to, and publish accounts and other research documents relating to, the artifacts, site area, and project operations for non commercial educational or historical purposes. Nothing in this document shall infringe to any extent the public's right to access public records in accordance with Chapters 121 and 132 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The agreement also provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Maritime Research], Intersal and the Department agree to make available for duplication by each other, or, when appropriate, to provide the Department with, relevant field maps, notes, drawings, photographic records and other such technical, scientific and historical documentation created or collected by [Maritime Research], Intersal or the Department pursuant to the study of the site and the recovery of materials therefrom. These materials shall become public records curated by the Department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following execution of this salvage agreement, Intersal retained Nautilus, Allen's production company, to document the salvage of the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   , and under that arrangement, Allen accumulated, as he alleged in the complaint, \"a substantial archive of video and still images showing the underwater shipwreck and the efforts of teams of divers and archaeologists to recover various artifacts from [it].\" Allen registered 13 copyrights in these materials with the U.S. Copyright Office, each copyright covering a year's worth of footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2013, Allen and Nautilus took the position that the Department's publication of Allen's work on the Internet without his consent infringed Allen's copyrights, and this prompted a dispute leading ultimately to a settlement agreement dated October 15, 2013, to which the Department, Intersal, Nautilus, and Allen were parties. In that agreement, none of the parties admitted to any wrongdoing but agreed to the clarification of preexisting arrangements so that the salvage operation could continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The 2013 Settlement Agreement divided Allen and Nautilus's video and photographic documentation, treating some of the footage as \"commercial documentaries\" and some as \"non-commercial media,\" for purposes of clarifying the parties' respective rights. With respect to \"commercial documentaries,\" the 2013 Settlement Agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Intersal, through Nautilus, has documented approximately fifteen (15) years of underwater and other activities related to the QAR [\n   <em>\n    Queen Anne's Revenge\n   </em>\n   ] project. For purposes of this Commercial Documentaries section, Intersal represents to [the Department] that Nautilus Productions shall remain Intersal's designee. Intersal shall have the exclusive right to produce a documentary film about the [\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   ] project for licensing and sale. Intersal may partner with [the Department] if it chooses to do so.... If [the Department] and Intersal do not partner to make a documentary, the Intersal documentary script shall be reviewed by [the Department] for historical accuracy prior to final release by Intersal or its agents. Intersal agrees to allow [the Department] to use its completed documentary, free of charge, in its museums and exhibits for educational purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to \"non-commercial media,\" the Agreement provided in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   All non-commercial digital media, regardless of producing entity, shall bear a time code stamp, and watermark (or bug) of Nautilus and/or [the Department], as well as a link to [the Department], Intersal, and Nautilus websites, to be clearly and visibly displayed at the bottom of any web page on which the digital media is being displayed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [The Department] agrees to display non-commercial digital media only on [the Department's] website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to Nautilus's archival footage, the Agreement provided that archival footage and photographs that did not \"bear a time code stamp and a Nautilus Productions watermark (or bug)\" would be returned to Nautilus. But it also provided that the Department could \"retain, for research purposes, archival footage, still photographs, and other media that contain a time code stamp and watermark [or bug], and as to such media [the Department] [would] provide Nautilus with a current, accurate list.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the 2013 Settlement Agreement addressed the video footage and still photographs as public records, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent [the Department] from making records available to the public pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes Chapters 121\n   and 132, or any other applicable State or federal law or rule related to the inspection of public records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   During the recovery phase of the [\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   ] project, [the Department] and Intersal agree to make available to each other records created or collected in relation to the [\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   ] project. The entity requesting copies bears the cost of reproduction. Within one (1) year after the completion of the recovery phase, Intersal shall allow [the Department] to accession duplicate or original records that were created or collected by Intersal during the project and that are related to the site, or the recovery or conservation of the [\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   ] materials. Such records shall include relevant field maps, notes, drawings, photographic records, and other technical, scientific and historical documentation created or collected by [the Department] or Intersal pursuant to the study of the site and the recovery of materials therefrom. These materials shall become public records curated by [the Department]. All digital media provided by Intersal under the terms of this paragraph shall include a time code stamp and watermarks (or bugs).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following execution of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, as Allen and Nautilus alleged in their complaint, the Department \"resumed infringing [Allen's] copyrights\" by \"publish[ing] ... and/or display[ing]\" various \"works\" on the Internet. The complaint identified six \"infringing works\" along with their Internet addresses. Five of those works were videos about the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   shipwreck that were posted on the Department's YouTube channel, and the remaining \"infringing work\" was a newsletter about North Carolina's maritime museums, which contained an article about the\n   <em>\n    Revenge\n   </em>\n   with one of Allen's still photographs. Accordingly, Allen and Nautilus sent North Carolina a \"Takedown Notice,\" and North Carolina maintained that it complied before the hearing on its motion to dismiss filed in the district court. It provided the district court with documentary evidence confirming that fact, and at oral argument on this appeal, counsel for Allen and Nautilus also confirmed that the six alleged infringements had ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Allen and Nautilus commenced this action in December 2015, naming as defendants the State of North Carolina, the Department, the Governor, and six officials in the Department, among others. Except for the Governor, who was sued only in his official capacity, each of the individual defendants was sued in both his or her official and individual capacities. The complaint, as amended, contained five counts. In Count I, Allen and Nautilus alleged that in 2015, the defendants enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121-25\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 121-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (making shipwreck videos and photographs in North Carolina's custody public records) in bad faith to \"create a defense\" to the copyright infringement claim asserted in Count II. They sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 121-25(b) was unenforceable because it was preempted by federal copyright law and was otherwise unconstitutional under the Takings Clause and Due Process Clause of the Constitution. In Count II, Allen and Nautilus claimed copyright infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b). In Count III, they alleged that the defendants \"acted under color of state law to enact \u00a7 121-25(b) and to threaten plaintiffs ... with enforcement thereof,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, in Counts IV and V, they alleged state law claims for unfair trade practices and civil conspiracy. For relief, Allen and Nautilus sought, in addition to the declaratory judgment sought in Count I, an order enjoining copyright infringement and enforcement of \u00a7 121-25(b), as well as compensatory, statutory, treble, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   North Carolina filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), maintaining that the institutional defendants and individual defendants in their official capacities were shielded from suit in federal court by sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment and that the officials sued in their individual capacities were entitled to qualified and legislative immunity. Allen and Nautilus responded to the claim of sovereign immunity, arguing (1) that North Carolina waived sovereign immunity in the 2013 Settlement Agreement; (2) that North Carolina's sovereign immunity was also abrogated by the federal Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) and that, in any event, injunctive relief was available under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908). They also argued that the individual officials could not invoke qualified immunity because reasonable officials under the circumstances alleged would have known that they were violating Allen's rights under federal copyright law, and that they could not invoke legislative immunity because none of the officials had performed any legislative functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Following a hearing, the district court, by order dated March 23, 2017, denied North Carolina's motion to dismiss as to Counts I and II, concluding that its Eleventh Amendment immunity for those counts was validly abrogated by the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act; that the state officials sued in their individual capacities were not entitled to qualified immunity; and that a determination of those officials' legislative immunity would be \"premature\" at that time. It granted the motion as to the remaining counts on the basis of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   From the district court's interlocutory order, North Carolina filed this appeal, challenging the district court's denial of immunity in all forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.R.

We address these arguments in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The 2013 Settlement Agreement, on which Allen and Nautilus rely to argue that North Carolina waived its sovereign immunity, provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In the event [North Carolina], Intersal, or [Allen and] Nautilus breaches this Agreement, [North Carolina], Intersal, or [Allen and] Nautilus may avail themselves of all remedies provided by law or equity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Allen and Nautilus maintain that by agreeing to the availability of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   remedies, North Carolina agreed that the remedies being sought in this action may be obtained from it, thereby effecting a waiver of sovereign immunity from suit in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We cannot, however, read this provision as a waiver of North Carolina's Eleventh Amendment immunity. First, Eleventh Amendment immunity protects the States, their agencies, and officials from suit\n   <em>\n    in federal court\n   </em>\n   . Yet, the subject provision in the 2013 Settlement Agreement makes no reference to federal court, state court or, for that matter, any court. Moreover, the provision states only that each party may pursue available remedies\n   <em>\n    as provided by\n   </em>\n   law or equity. Consequently, legal or equitable limitations on those remedies must also apply. And one of those limitations is that a State, its agencies, and its officials acting in their official capacities cannot be sued\n   <em>\n    in federal court\n   </em>\n   without their consent. We readily conclude that the provision falls far short of the clear statement that is required to effect a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. As the Supreme Court has made clear, a State must\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   consent to suit\n   <em>\n    in federal court\n   </em>\n   to waive its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Port Auth.

North Carolina, however, maintains that shortly before the November 2016 hearing on its motion to dismiss, it removed those allegedly infringing materials from the Internet and provided exhibits to the district court to confirm that it had done so. While Allen and Nautilus acknowledged at oral argument that the six alleged violations had ceased, they argue that the complaint nonetheless alleged generally instances of ongoing Internet infringement beside those six violations, referring to a paragraph that alleged, in a conclusory fashion, that displays of copyrighted materials were continuing \"at least at th[ose] locations.\" But such a general and threadbare catchall, suggesting\n   <em>\n    the possibility\n   </em>\n   of other infringing displays, does not plausibly allege the existence of an ongoing violation of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Even assuming that North Carolina has failed to provide reasonable assurances that it will avoid infringing Allen's copyrights in the future, as would foreclose the voluntary-cessation exception to mootness, it remains Allen's burden in the context of sovereign immunity to establish an\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   violation of federal law to qualify for relief under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

This is especially so in view of the Department's role in the salvage project to preserve for the public the site and artifacts and to document their salvage in furtherance of research and the education of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Of course, we need not resolve whether North Carolina's display of the video footage and the still photograph violated the Copyright Act to resolve the issue of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    555 U.S. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What we do conclude is that reasonable officials in the position of the North Carolina officials would not have understood\n   <em>\n    beyond debate\n   </em>\n   that their publication of the material violated Allen's rights under the Copyright Act. The issue is indeed debatable. Accordingly, we conclude that Allen and Nautilus's copyright claims against the North Carolina officials in their individual capacities are precluded by qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We also conclude that legislative immunity shields the North Carolina officials in their individual capacities for their alleged involvement in the enactment of \u00a7 121-25(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The district court did not expressly resolve whether the individual officers were entitled to legislative immunity, concluding instead that such a ruling would be \"premature.\" But its\n   <em>\n    deferral\n   </em>\n   in ruling amounted to a\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of the immunity because the immunity protects officials \"not only from the consequences of litigation's results, but also from\n   <em>\n    the burden of defending\n   </em>\n   themselves\" in court.\n   <em>\n    Supreme Court of Va. v.

But the only actual conduct alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy-that the officers \"wrote, caused to be introduced, lobbied for passage of, and obtained passage\" of \u00a7 121-25(b) -is quintessentially legislative in nature and falls squarely within the scope of legislative immunity. Allen and Nautilus's only argument to the contrary is that the complaint alleges that the officers sought enactment of \u00a7 121-25(b) with\n   <em>\n    impure motives\n   </em>\n   , seeking to benefit an affiliated nonprofit entity and to remove the threat of legal liability.
