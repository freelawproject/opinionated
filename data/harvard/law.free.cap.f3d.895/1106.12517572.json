SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After a seven-day trial and two days of deliberation, a jury found that Pharrell Williams, Robin Thicke, and Clifford Harris, Jr.'s song \"Blurred Lines,\" the world's best-selling single in 2013, infringed Frankie Christian Gaye, Nona Marvisa Gaye, and Marvin Gaye III's copyright in Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit song \"Got To Give It Up.\" Three consolidated appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellants and Cross-Appellees Williams, Thicke, Harris, and More Water from Nazareth Publishing, Inc. (collectively, Thicke Parties) appeal from the district court's judgment. They urge us to reverse the district court's denial of their motion for summary judgment and direct the district court to enter judgment in their favor. In the alternative, they ask us to vacate the judgment and remand the case for a new trial, on grounds of instructional error, improper admission of expert testimony, and lack of evidence supporting the verdict. If a new trial is not ordered, they request that we reverse or vacate the jury's awards of actual damages and infringer's profits, and the district court's imposition of a running royalty. Finally, they seek reversal of the judgment against Harris, challenging the district court's decision to overturn the jury's general verdict finding in Harris's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants and Cross-Appellees Interscope Records, UMG Recordings, Inc., Universal Music Distribution, and Star Trak, LLC (collectively, Interscope Parties) appeal from the district court's judgment. They urge us to reverse the judgment against them, challenging the district\n   court's decision to overturn the jury's general verdict finding in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellees and Cross-Appellants Frankie Christian Gaye, Nona Marvisa Gaye, and Marvin Gaye III (collectively, Gayes) appeal from the district court's order on attorney's fees and costs. They request that we vacate and remand for reconsideration the district court's denial of attorney's fees, and award them their costs in full. The Gayes also protectively cross-appeal the district court's ruling limiting the scope of the Gayes' compositional copyright to the four corners of the sheet music deposited with the United States Copyright Office. In the event a new trial is ordered, the Gayes urge us to hold that Marvin Gaye's studio recording of \"Got To Give It Up,\" rather than the deposit copy, establishes the scope of the Gayes' copyright under the Copyright Act of 1909.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our law requires that we review this case, which proceeded to a full trial on the merits in the district court, under deferential standards of review. We accordingly decide this case on narrow grounds, and affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Got To Give It Up\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1976, Marvin Gaye recorded the song \"Got To Give It Up\" in his studio. \"Got To Give It Up\" reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart in 1977, and remains popular today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 1977, Jobete Music Company, Inc. registered \"Got To Give It Up\" with the United States Copyright Office and deposited six pages of handwritten sheet music attributing the song's words and music to Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye did not write or fluently read sheet music, and did not prepare the deposit copy. Instead, an unidentified transcriber notated the sheet music after Marvin Gaye recorded \"Got To Give It Up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Gayes inherited the copyrights in Marvin Gaye's musical compositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Blurred Lines\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2012, Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke wrote and recorded \"Blurred Lines.\" Clifford Harris, Jr., known popularly as T.I., separately wrote and recorded a rap verse for \"Blurred Lines\" that was added to the track seven months later. \"Blurred Lines\" was the best-selling single in the world in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thicke, Williams, and Harris co-own the musical composition copyright in \"Blurred Lines.\" Star Trak and Interscope Records co-own the sound recording of \"Blurred Lines.\" Universal Music Distribution manufactured and distributed \"Blurred Lines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Gayes made an infringement demand on Williams and Thicke after hearing \"Blurred Lines.\" Negotiations failed, prompting Williams, Thicke, and Harris to file suit for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement on August 15, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Gayes counterclaimed against the Thicke Parties, alleging that \"Blurred Lines\" infringed their copyright in \"Got To Give It Up,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and added the Interscope Parties as third-party defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The District Court's Denial of Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The district court denied Williams and Thicke's motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The District Court's Interpretation of the Copyright Act of 1909\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court ruled that the Gayes' compositional copyright, which is governed by the Copyright Act of 1909, did not extend to the commercial sound recording of \"Got To Give It Up,\" and protected only the sheet music deposited with the Copyright Office. The district court accordingly limited its review of the evidence to the deposit copy, and concluded there were genuine issues of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Thicke Parties relied upon the opinion of musicologist Sandy Wilbur. The Gayes relied upon the opinions of Dr. Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music at Harvard University, and musicologist Judith Finell. The experts disagreed sharply in their opinions, which they articulated in lengthy reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finell opined that there is a \"constellation\" of eight similarities between \"Got To Give It Up\" and \"Blurred Lines,\" consisting of the signature phrase, hooks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   hooks with backup vocals, \"Theme X,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   backup hooks, bass melodies, keyboard parts, and unusual percussion choices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Wilbur opined that there are no substantial similarities between the melodies, rhythms, harmonies, structures, and lyrics of \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Got To Give It Up,\" and disputed each area of similarity Finell identified. The district court compared Finell's testimony with Wilbur's and, pursuant to the extrinsic test under copyright law, meticulously filtered out elements Wilbur opined were not in the deposit copy, such as the backup vocals, \"Theme X,\" descending bass line, keyboard rhythms, and percussion parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The district court also filtered out several unprotectable similarities Dr. Monson identified, including the use of a cowbell, hand percussion, drum set parts, background vocals, and keyboard parts. After filtering out those elements, the district court considered Dr. Monson's analysis of harmonic and melodic similarities between the songs, and noted differences between Wilbur's and Dr. Monson's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After performing its analytical dissection, as part of the extrinsic test, the district court summarized the remaining areas of dispute in the case. The district court identified disputes regarding the similarity of the songs' signature phrases, hooks, bass lines, keyboard chords, harmonic structures, and vocal melodies. Concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed, the district court denied Williams and Thicke's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The case proceeded to a seven-day trial. The district court ruled before trial that the Gayes could present sound recordings of \"Got To Give It Up\" edited to capture only elements reflected in the deposit copy. Consequently, the commercial sound recording of \"Got To Give It Up\" was not played at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Williams and Thicke testified, each acknowledging inspiration from Marvin Gaye and access to \"Got To Give It Up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finell testified that \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Got To Give It Up\" share many similarities,\n   including the bass lines, keyboard parts, signature phrases, hooks, \"Theme X,\" bass melodies, word painting, and the placement of the rap and \"parlando\" sections in the two songs. She opined that nearly every bar of \"Blurred Lines\" contains an element similar to \"Got To Give It Up.\" Although the district court had filtered out \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and the keyboard rhythms as unprotectable at summary judgment, Finell testified that those elements were in the deposit copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Monson played three audio-engineered \"mash-ups\" she created to show the melodic and harmonic compatibility between \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Got To Give It Up.\" She testified that the two songs shared structural similarities on a sectional and phrasing level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wilbur opined that the two songs are not substantially similar and disputed Finell and Dr. Monson's opinions. Wilbur prepared and played a sound recording containing her rendition of the deposit copy of \"Got To Give It Up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Neither the Thicke Parties nor the Gayes made a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) before the case was submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On March 10, 2015, after two days of deliberation, the jury returned mixed general verdicts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury found that Williams, More Water from Nazareth Publishing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Thicke infringed the Gayes' copyright in \"Got To Give It Up.\" In contrast, the jury found that Harris and the Interscope Parties were not liable for infringement. The jury awarded the Gayes $4 million in actual damages, $1,610,455.31 in infringer's profits from Williams and More Water from Nazareth Publishing, and $1,768,191.88 in infringer's profits from Thicke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The District Court's Order on Post-Trial Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court ruled on the parties' various post-trial motions in an omnibus order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Thicke Parties filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, or remittitur. The district court denied the Thicke Parties' motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial, but remitted the award of actual damages and the award of Williams' profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Gayes filed three motions, seeking (1) a declaration that Harris and the Interscope Parties were liable for infringement; (2) injunctive relief or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties; and (3) prejudgment interest. The district court construed the Gayes' motion for declaratory relief as a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, and granted the motion, overturning the jury's general verdicts in favor of Harris and the Interscope Parties. The district court denied the Gayes' request for injunctive relief, but awarded them a running royalty of 50% of future songwriter and publishing revenues from \"Blurred Lines.\" The district court granted in part the Gayes' motion for prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Judgment and Order on Attorney's Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The district court entered judgment on December 2, 2015. The court awarded the Gayes $3,188,527.50 in actual damages, profits of $1,768,191.88 against Thicke and $357,630.96 against Williams and More\n   Water from Nazareth Publishing, and a running royalty of 50% of future songwriter and publishing revenues received by Williams, Thicke, and Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On April 12, 2016, the district court denied the Gayes' motion for attorney's fees and apportioned costs between the parties. The parties timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

It is sufficient if you find that the Thicke Parties subconsciously copied either or both of the Gaye Parties' songs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Because direct evidence is rare, copying is usually circumstantially proved by a combination of access and substantial similarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    376 F.3d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Thicke Parties take an unduly narrow view of Instruction 42 in isolation. The instructions as a whole make plain that a circumstantial case of copying requires not just access, but also substantial similarity. Instructions 28 and 41 provide that copying may be proven by demonstrating access plus substantial similarity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instruction 43 further underscores\n   that the Gayes \"must show that there is both substantial 'extrinsic similarity' and substantial 'intrinsic similarity' as to that pair of works.\" Looking to the jury instructions as a whole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934596\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/800/#p805\">\n    422 F.3d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is clear that the district court properly instructed the jury to find both access and substantial similarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not err in giving Jury Instruction 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Jury Instruction 43\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Thicke Parties argue that Instruction 43 erroneously instructed the jury to consider unprotectable elements. Specifically, they contend that the district court instructed the jury that it \"must consider\" elements that they contend are not present in the deposit copy: \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and keyboard parts. Instruction 43 states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Extrinsic similarity is shown when two works have a similarity of ideas and expression as measured by external, objective criteria. To make this determination, you must consider the elements of each of the works and decide if they are substantially similar. This is not the same as \"identical.\" There has been testimony and evidence presented by both sides on this issue, including by expert witnesses, as to such matters as: (a) for \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"Blurred Lines,\" the so-called \"Signature Phrase,\" hook, \"Theme X,\" bass melodies, keyboard parts, word painting, lyrics, [and] rap v. parlando .... The Gaye Parties do not have to show that each of these individual elements is substantially similar, but rather that there is enough similarity between a work of the Gaye Parties and an allegedly infringing work of the Thicke Parties to comprise a substantial amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, the Thicke Parties take the word \"must\" out of context. Instruction 43's use of the word \"must\" serves to underline the extrinsic test's requirement that the jury compare the objective elements of the works for substantial similarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, Finell testified that \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and the keyboard parts are reflected in the deposit copy, while Wilbur testified to the contrary. The experts' quarrel over what was in the deposit copy was a factual dispute for the jury to decide. Even if Instruction 43's inclusion of contested elements could have led the jury to believe that the elements were in the deposit copy, and to consider them as protectable elements for purposes of the substantial similarity analysis, we cannot view Instruction 43 in isolation. In light of the jury instructions as a whole, we do not conclude that the district court's listing of elements in Instruction 43 prevented the jury from making a factual determination of what was in the deposit copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The instructions on whole make clear that the jury could consider only elements in the deposit copy. Instruction 28 states that the Gayes bear \"the burden of proving that the Thicke Parties copied original elements from the Gaye[s'] copyrighted work.\" Instruction 35, in turn, defines the Gayes' copyrighted work. Instruction 35 informed jurors that at the time the copyright in \"Got To Give It Up\" was registered, \"only written music could be filed by a copyright owner with the Copyright Office as the deposit copy of the copyrighted work.\" In contrast, \"[r]ecordings of musical compositions could not be filed with the Copyright Office at that time.\" The district court cautioned the jurors to distinguish\n   between the commercial sound recording of \"Got To Give It Up\" and the deposit copy, noting that \"although [a] sound recording[ ] of 'Got to Give It Up' ... w[as] made and released commercially, th[e] particular recording[ ] [is] not at issue in this case, w[as] not produced into evidence, and w[as] not played for you during the trial.\" What was at issue was \"testimony from one or more witnesses from each side about what each thinks is shown on the deposit copy for each composition,\" as well as \"recorded versions of each work that each side has prepared based on what each side contends is shown in the deposit copy that was filed with the Copyright Office.\" In short, the district court instructed the jurors that the deposit copy, not the commercial sound recording, was the copyrighted work in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Harper House, Inc. v.

The jury never heard the commercial sound recording. Elements indisputably present only in the sound recording, such as the use of cowbell and party noises, were never played at trial. Had that been the case, the district court would have had to instruct the jury to distinguish between elements in the commercial recording and elements in the deposit copy. Instead, the jury heard sound clips edited to capture elements that the experts testified were in the deposit copy.

Finell's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Thicke Parties object only to three portions of Finell's testimony: her testimony regarding \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and the keyboard parts. Finell testified that \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and the keyboard rhythms were in the deposit copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finell was cross-examined for four hours. During cross-examination, Finell conceded that the notes of \"Theme X\" were not written on the sheet music, and she was questioned about her testimony that the notes of \"Theme X\" were implied in the deposit copy. She also acknowledged that the bass melody she presented at trial differed from that notated in the deposit copy. She was impeached with her deposition testimony, in which she admitted that the rhythm of the keyboard parts in the sound recording of \"Got To Give It Up\" is not notated in the deposit copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Wilbur disputed her testimony, opining that \"Theme X,\" the descending bass line, and the keyboard rhythms are not contained in the deposit copy. The dispute\n   boiled down to a question of whose testimony to believe. Both experts referenced the sound recording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both experts agreed that sheet music requires interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question of whose interpretation of the deposit copy to credit was a question properly left for the jury to resolve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Three Boys Music\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p481\">\n    212 F.3d at 485-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We refuse to interfere with the jury's credibility determination[.]\"). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Finell's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dr. Monson's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Thicke Parties argue that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Dr. Monson to play audio \"mash-ups\" superimposing Marvin Gaye's vocals from \"Got To Give It Up\" onto the accompaniment in \"Blurred Lines,\" and vice versa. They argue that the \"mash-ups\" contained unprotectable elements, such as the keyboard parts, bass melodies, and Marvin Gaye's vocals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This argument faces the same hurdle as the Thicke Parties' objection to Finell's testimony. Dr. Monson testified that there were structural similarities between the two songs at a sectional level and at a phrasing level, and used the \"mash-ups\" to demonstrate the songs' shared harmonic and melodic compatibility. We have permitted similar expert testimony in the past.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    376 F.3d at 845-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that district court erred in discounting expert's testimony regarding structural similarities between two choruses).

Even though the dissent's musicological exegesis has no bearing on our analysis at this procedural stage of the case, it clearly shows that the facts in this case are hotly disputed and that the case does not just involve pure issues of law.

Critically, there is no reference to the deferential standard of review applicable to the district court's denial of the Thicke Parties' motion for a new trial. Indeed, there is no discussion of the district court's denial of the motion for a new trial at all. It bears repeating, then, that we are bound by the \" 'limited nature of our appellate function' in reviewing the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Lam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266919\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1077/#p1084\">\n    869 F.3d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kode\n   </em>\n   , 596 F.3d at 612 ). As is the case here, \"where the basis of a Rule 59 ruling is that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence, the district court's denial of a Rule 59 motion is virtually unassailable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kode\n   </em>\n   , 596 F.3d at 612 ).

In faulting us for \"tellingly refus[ing] to explain\" the evidence supporting the verdict, the dissent ignores the weighty restrictions on our review at this procedural stage of the case. The dissent jettisons the constraints on our review, instead opting for the radical route of playing both expert and juror. The dissent weighs the experts' credibility, resolves factual conflicts, and sets forth its own findings on the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decline the dissent's invitation to invade the province of the jury: Applying the proper standard of review, one simply cannot say truthfully that there was an absolute absence of evidence supporting the jury's verdict in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   To buttress this point, in\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   , we reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment of non-infringement, finding the district court erred, in large part, by conducting an analysis similar to the one the dissent has undertaken here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    376 F.3d at 846-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Two of our conclusions\n   in\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   are particularly relevant here. First, we held that the district court erred in discounting the expert's musical methodology on technical grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    at 846-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the district court rejected the expert's \"selective\" choice to \"discount[ ] notes that he characterize[d] as 'ornamental,' \" and discredited the expert's opinion that, \"even though measure three of both choruses were not identical in numerical pitch sequence or note selection,\" they emphasized the same scale degree and resolved similarly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We observed that \"[t]here is nothing inherently unsound about [the expert's] musicological methodology,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we similarly decline to conclude otherwise in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Second, we held in\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   that the district court \"erred by basing its comparison of the two choruses almost entirely on a measure-by-measure comparison of melodic note sequences from the full transcriptions of the choruses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, we reiterated our case law. We stressed that \"substantial similarity can be found in a combination of elements, even if those elements are individually unprotected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 848 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Three Boys Music\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p481\">\n    212 F.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is well settled that a jury may find a combination of unprotectible elements to be protectible under the extrinsic test because ' \"the over-all impact and effect indicate substantial appropriation.\" ' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Krofft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"885827\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/562/1157/#p1169\">\n    562 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1169 ) ). In fact, \"[e]ven if a copied portion be relatively small in proportion to the entire work, if qualitatively important, the finder of fact may properly find substantial similarity.\"\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    376 F.3d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Baxter v.

Thus, even \"an arrangement of a limited number of notes can garner copyright protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 851. If taken to its logical conclusion, the dissent's musicological analysis and approach would sound the death knell for these governing legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Consider the principle that, at summary judgment, so long as the Gayes \"presented '\n   <em>\n    indicia\n   </em>\n   of a sufficient disagreement concerning the substantial similarity of [the] two works,' then the case\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be submitted to a trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 844 (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown Bag Software v.

To require that a case be submitted to a trier of fact if there is any \"indicia\" of a disagreement regarding substantial similarity, only to impose on the district court the task of independently scrutinizing the expert testimony presented at trial, would turn our law on its head. Worse still, to require a district court to do so in the absence of a Rule 50 motion defies law and logic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Moreover, the expert review conducted by the dissent does not provide a workable standard for district courts to follow. It is unrealistic to expect district courts to possess even a baseline fluency in musicology, much less to conduct an independent musicological analysis at a level as exacting as the one used by the dissent. After all, we require parties to present expert testimony in musical infringement cases for a reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 845.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The dissent has failed to take into account another wrinkle that would ensue from vacating the judgment and remanding the case for a new trial. The Gayes have cross-appealed protectively, challenging the district court's interpretation of the 1909 Act, in the event a new trial is ordered. Even though a vacatur and remand would trigger the Gayes' protective cross-appeal, the dissent does not wrestle with the merits of this issue. While the dissent is adamant that the scope of the Gayes' copyright is limited to the four corners of the deposit copy, it provides no statutory interpretation or legal analysis supporting its assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Lastly, the dissent prophesies that our decision will shake the foundations of copyright law, imperil the music industry, and stifle creativity. It even suggests that the Gayes' victory will come back to haunt them, as the Gayes' musical compositions may now be found to infringe any number of famous songs preceding them. Respectfully, these conjectures are unfounded hyperbole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our decision does not grant license to copyright a musical style or \"groove.\" Nor does it upset the balance Congress struck between the freedom of artistic expression, on the one hand, and copyright protection of the fruits of that expression, on the other hand. Rather, our decision hinges on settled procedural principles and the limited nature of our appellate review, dictated by the particular posture of this case and controlling copyright law. Far from heralding the end of musical creativity as we know it, our decision, even construed broadly, reads more accurately as a cautionary tale for future trial counsel wishing to maximize their odds of success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   We have decided this case on narrow grounds. Our conclusions turn on the procedural posture of the case, which requires us to review the relevant issues under deferential standards of review.

To the contrary, there were no material factual disputes at trial. Finell testified about certain similarities between the deposit copy of the \"Got to Give It Up\" lead sheet and \"Blurred Lines.\" Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke don't contest the existence of these similarities.

Most of these \"short ... pattern[s]\" weren't themselves protectable by copyright, and Finell ignored both the other elements with which they appeared and their overall placement in each of the songs. Her analysis is the equivalent of finding substantial similarity between two pointillist paintings because both have a few flecks of similarly colored paint.

The Signature Phrases as a Whole Are Not Substantially Similar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Even when each element is not individually protectable, \"[t]he particular sequence in which an author strings a significant number of unprotectable elements can itself be a protectable element,\"\n   <em>\n    Metcalf v.

Here, as Finell concedes, the Signature Phrase has \"very few notes,\" lasting less than four seconds. Therefore, even assuming that the Signature Phrase as a whole is protectable, its protection is thin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   There is very little similarity between the two songs' Signature Phrases. Both melodies rise and fall. But they begin and end on different pitches. The highest, longest, most stressed pitch in each phrase is different-in \"Blurred Lines,\" this pitch is consonant with the underlying harmony; in \"Got to Give It Up,\" it is dissonant. One phrase has 10 notes; the other, 12. The five identical pitches in each of the phrases have different rhythmic placement within the measure and therefore receive different stress. And only two of these identical pitches have similar underlying harmonies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The harmony changes halfway through the Signature Phrase in \"Blurred Lines\" but remains the same in \"Got to Give It Up.\" The lyrics in each phrase are different. The Signature Phrase occurs in different places within each piece. In \"Got to Give It Up,\" the Signature Phrase is the very first phrase sung. In \"Blurred Lines,\" the Signature Phrase is not sung until 28 seconds later-after several lines of verse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The various unprotected elements identified by Finell don't even coincide with one another in that short, four-second snippet. And her narrow focus on these elements ignored the different harmonies in each phrase. \"To pull these elements out of a song individually, without also looking at them in combination, is to perform an\n   incomplete and distorted musicological analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p844\">\n    376 F.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Given the lack of similarities between the Signature Phrases, there is no basis to conclude that they are substantially similar. \"The most that can be said is that the two segments bear some relation to one another within a finite world of melodies. Given the limited musical vocabulary available to composers, this is far from enough to support an inference of [infringement].\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8952257\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/12/#p22\">\n    409 F.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1st Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The \"Hook\" Phrase\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Finell describes the Hook Phrase as the four melodic pitches in \"Got to Give It Up\" sung to the lyrics \"keep on dancin'.\" She opined that \"Blurred Lines\" has similar Hook Phrases in two different places: one is the four pitches in the Signature Phrase sung to the lyrics \"take a good girl\"; the other is the five pitches sung to the lyrics \"I hate these blurred lines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   There are basic conceptual problems with Finell's analysis. She describes the same four pitches in \"Blurred Lines\" as being similar to two unrelated phrases in \"Got to Give It Up\"-the Signature Phrase and the Hook Phrase. It is difficult to see how anything original in each of these two different phrases could be distilled into the same four-note phrase in \"Blurred Lines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   In any event, the Hook Phrase in the deposit copy lacks sufficient originality to be protected. Its sequence of four pitches, lasting 2.5 seconds, is common. For example, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose memorably sang it to the lyrics, \"We're your dreamgirls.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Henry Krieger &amp; Tom Eyen,\n   <em>\n    Dreamgirls\n   </em>\n   measures 25-26 (Universal-Geffin Music 1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Even if the Hook Phrase pitches were protectable, there is no substantial similarity between its expression in the two songs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnstein v. Edward B.

Moreover, the phrases are sung at different places in each song. In \"Got to Give It Up,\" the Hook Phrase is sung at the end of part 1 in a fade out. In \"Blurred Lines,\" it is sung as the chorus in the middle of the song.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Theme \"X\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Theme X refers to another four-note melodic sequence. In the deposit copy, Theme X is sung to the lyrics \"Fancy lady.\" In \"Blurred Lines,\" it is first sung to the lyrics \"If you can't hear.\" Like the Hook Phrase, Theme X is both unprotectable and objectively dissimilar in the two songs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The pitches and rhythm of Theme X in the deposit copy are identical to those sung to \"Happy Birthday\" and numerous other songs. None of the Theme X pitches in the deposit copy are the same as in \"Blurred Lines.\" To see any correspondence between the two four-note sequences, one would have to shift and invert the pitches, a feat of musical gymnastics well beyond the skill of most listeners. Where short and distinct musical phrases require such contortions just to show that they are musically related, there is no basis to find them substantially similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8952257\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/12/#p22\">\n    409 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   22 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"935071\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/82/275/#p277\">\n    82 F.2d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The harmonies accompanying Theme X also differ between \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"Blurred Lines.\" Structurally, Theme X appears in completely different places in the two songs. In the deposit copy, it repeats several times in succession near the end of the piece. In \"Blurred Lines,\" it is the very first line of verse near the beginning of the song and repeats periodically throughout the song.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Other Alleged Similarities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Keyboard Parts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Finell testified that the keyboard parts in \"Got to Give It Up\" (meaning the chords and their rhythms played over the bass line) had \"many important similarities\" to those in \"Blurred Lines.\" However, there are no keyboard parts in the deposit copy. Finell explained that a lead sheet is essentially \"musical shorthand for musicians,\" who \"would understand how [the keyboard parts are] to be played.\" But because \"[a] sound is protected by copyright law only when it is 'fixed in a tangible medium,' \"\n   <em>\n    Newton II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152731\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1189/#p1190\">\n    388 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ), the deposit copy's unwritten\n   keyboard parts are not protected expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   To the extent the chord indications sufficiently express the keyboard parts, there is no substantial similarity between the two works. \"Blurred Lines\" contains only two chords throughout the entire piece-an A chord and an E chord-that alternate every four measures. The deposit copy contains neither of these chords. The chords it does contain-A7, D7, E7, B7, Dm7, and Am7-change in a much more irregular pattern. For example, the first 16 measures have a sustained A7 harmony, and the next 8 measures change harmonies every measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Bass Line\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Finell opined that the bass melodies in \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"Blurred Lines\" are similar. However, when comparing them, she showed the jury the version of the \"Got to Give It Up\" bass line that she had transcribed from the sound recording. Because several notes were different in the deposit copy, her testimony on this issue was of questionable value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newton II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152731\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1189/#p1190\">\n    388 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It's also doubtful that the unexpressed portions of the baseline beyond the first eight measures of the deposit copy are sufficiently fixed in a tangible medium to warrant protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Even assuming the implied bass line in the deposit copy is sufficiently fixed, it's the type of expression that is so standard in the genre that it merges with the idea and is therefore unprotectable in and of itself.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v.

However, in \"Got to Give It Up\" the note is syncopated so that it sounds before the downbeat in the second, third, and fourth measures, whereas in \"Blurred Lines\" the note is played on the downbeat. Moreover, the note A is the root of the chord in each song (A7 in \"Got to Give It Up,\" A in \"Blurred Lines\"). As the expert for Williams and Thicke testified without contradiction, it is commonplace for the root of a chord to appear in a bass line because it establishes the chord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
