Ark. R. Crim. P. 8.1. New Mexico takes a different approach, clarifying elsewhere that the\n   <em>\n    arresting officer\n   </em>\n   is obligated to bring the defendant to court \"without unnecessary delay.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-1-4\">\n    N.M.

In light of this difference between the Arkansas and New Mexico rules, we see nothing in\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   to tell us what the sheriff or wardens could have done to provide timely arraignments for Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   is also inconsistent with our own precedent. The\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   court attributed responsibility to the jailers based solely on federal law, not state law. By contrast, our precedent directs us to focus on\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law when determining the scope of the defendants' responsibility to ensure prompt hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Accordingly, once the arresting officers brought Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry to the jail and the court was notified of the arrests, New Mexico law required the court (not the sheriff or wardens) to schedule timely arraignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Under New Mexico law,\n   <em>\n    Jauch\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   provide little guidance to us in addressing the issue framed by Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry. They allege that the state trial court failed to schedule timely arraignments and that the sheriff and wardens told the court about the arrests early enough for timely arraignments. But Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry did not sue the court; they sued the sheriff and wardens, officials that could not have caused the arraignment delays because of their inability to schedule the arraignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Dissent's Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The dissent argues that we have analyzed the wrong right. According to the dissent, the right to an arraignment within fifteen days is \" 'an expectation of receiving process,' \" which cannot alone be a protected liberty interest. Dissent at 1241-42, 1243, 1246 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Olim v. Wakinekona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298408\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/238/\">\n    461 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298408\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/238/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298408\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/238/\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ). Thus, the dissent reasons that the right at issue must be the right to freedom from pretrial detention rather than the right to a timely arraignment. Based on this reasoning, the dissent concludes that our misplaced focus on the arraignments has caused us to improperly focus on the state district court's role and overlook actions that the defendants could have taken, such as releasing Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We have focused on the plaintiffs' right to timely arraignment because that's what the plaintiffs have alleged. As the dissent admits, Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry are imprecise about their asserted right, conflating the right to an arraignment within fifteen days of arrest and the right to pretrial release (or bail). This conflation is understandable because the rights are coextensive under their theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry recognize freedom from detention as an applicable liberty interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Joint App'x at 7 (stating in the complaint that the New Mexico Constitution creates a right to pretrial liberty);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83 (asserting in district court briefing that Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry \"have a liberty interest in not being unnecessarily detained without the opportunity to post bail\"); Appellants' Opening Br. at 16 (\"The principal protected liberty interest that may be created by state law is the freedom from detention.\"). But Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry also allege a right to an arraignment within fifteen days of arrest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Joint App'x at 14 (alleging in the complaint that \"[b]ecause detainees charged in New Mexico district courts ... are guaranteed the right under state law to have their conditions of release set at the least restrictive level to assure their appearance and the safety of ... the community within fifteen days of their indictment or arrest, they have a federally protected liberty interest in this right\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69 (asserting in district court that \"Plaintiffs had a liberty interest in having bail set within fifteen days of their arrest\"); Appellants' Opening Br. at 36 (\"In summary, under settled procedural due process principles, Defendants deprived Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry of their liberty interest in a prompt pretrial arraignment....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under the theory articulated by Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry, the defendants violated the right to freedom from detention by failing to ensure timely arraignments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Appellants' Opening Br. at 41 (\"The Complaint alleged that the failure to implement any policies ensuring that detainees appear before a district court within fifteen days of indictment or arrest caused Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry to be injured.\"). The rights are coextensive to Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry because to them, a violation of the right to a timely arraignment resulted in violation of their right to freedom from prolonged detention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Yet the dissent disregards the claim of delay in the arraignment because this claim would founder based on the absence of a due-process violation. The dissent may be right about the absence of a due-process violation from a delay in an arraignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in our view, we should interpret the claim and appeal based on what the plaintiffs have actually said rather than which possible interpretation could succeed. In district court, the plaintiffs based their claim on the delays in arraignments. And on appeal, the plaintiffs have consistently framed their argument based on the arraignment delays. The dissent's theory is not the theory presented by the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As discussed above, the defendants were powerless to cause timely arraignments because arraignments are scheduled by the court rather than jail officials. The dissent agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But the dissent theorizes that jail officials could have simply released Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry. This theory is not only new but also contrary to what Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry have told us, for they expressly disavowed this theory: \"Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry never argued that Defendants should have unconditionally released them from jail....\" Appellants' Opening Br. at 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   p. 1235, above. Thus, Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry have waived reliance on that theory as a basis for reversal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Modoc Lassen Indian Hous. Auth. v.

Jul. 25, 2017) (stating that a theory never raised was waived as a basis for reversal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even if it were otherwise appropriate to raise the issue sua sponte, the dissent's theory would create a Catch-22 for jailers. Under New Mexico law, jailers commit a misdemeanor and must be removed from office if they deliberately release a prisoner absent a court order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033-3-12\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 33-3-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a jailer would be forced to choose between committing a crime and facing civil liability under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   According to the dissent, jailers can eventually defend themselves based on the Supremacy Clause. But Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry do not challenge the constitutionality of the state law preventing release in the absence of a court order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Brooks ex rel.

Municipal Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry also assert \u00a7 1983 claims against the county, alleging that it failed to adopt a policy to ensure arraignments within fifteen days. These claims are based on the alleged inaction by the sheriff and wardens. But, as discussed above, the sheriff and wardens did not cause the arraignment delays. Thus, the county could not incur liability under \u00a7 1983 on the basis of the alleged inaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider v.

Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry argue that the district court erred by refusing to allow amendment of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Generally, leave to amend should be freely granted when justice requires, but amendment may be denied when it would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Full Life Hospice, LLC v.

As a result, Mr. Moya sat in jail for more than two months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When finally brought before a judge-sixty-three days after he was first detained-the judge set bond at $5,000 and directed the state to release Mr. Moya from custody immediately. The same thing happened to Lonnie Petry, except that his jail stay was only about half as long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Believing their prolonged detentions to be systemic of a policy and practice affecting dozens, if not hundreds, of similarly situated arrestees, Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry brought this \u00a7 1983 action against the Board of Commissioners of Santa Fe County (\"the County\") and three County officials who were responsible for implementing policy at the jail. The majority affirms the dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims for failure to allege plausibly that any of these defendants violated their constitutional rights. Respectfully, I disagree. I would reverse the district court's order dismissing Plaintiffs' claims against the County. But because the Defendants did not violate clearly established law, I would hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity and, on that basis alone, partially affirm the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

CAUSATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Properly understood, Plaintiffs' alleged injury is the unconstitutional deprivation of their liberty through overdetention. As to causation, Plaintiffs' argument is straightforward: they allege the sheriff and wardens jointly held the keys to their jail cells.

As portrayed by the majority, Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry \"blame the sheriff and wardens for the delays in the arraignments.\" Maj. Op. at 1233. Because the sheriff and wardens had no power to schedule the arraignments, the majority's thinking goes, the sheriff and wardens had no power to prevent or cure the alleged constitutional violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/#p840\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"the sheriff and wardens did not cause the arraignment delays\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1243 (\"[T]he sheriff and wardens did not\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   the overdetention.

On my reading of the complaint, Plaintiffs are not seeking to hold the sheriff and wardens accountable for the court's scheduling decisions; instead, they are seeking to hold them accountable for the lengthy detentions that no court authorized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, a timely bail hearing is a means to securing Plaintiffs' protected liberty interests, not an end unto itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority explains that it focused on the right to a timely bail hearing \"because that's what the plaintiffs have alleged,\" Maj. Op. at 1237, all the while conceding that Plaintiffs have\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   alleged a violation of their \"right to freedom from detention,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1237. Under the majority's framing, these rights \"are coextensive to Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry because to them, a violation of the right to a timely arraignment resulted in violation of their right to freedom\n   from prolonged detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the majority's own description demonstrates that these rights are not one and the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state-law procedural right to a timely arraignment is protective of, not coextensive with, the right to liberty. The majority assumes without deciding that Plaintiffs alleged a violation of the state-law procedural right to a timely arraignment and then concludes that their constitutional claims fail because the warden and sheriffs did not cause the violation of state procedural law. That analysis works fine as far as it goes, but it is incomplete. The majority never considers whether the complaint adequately alleges a violation of the more fundamental right. Nor does it consider whether the individual defendants' alleged conduct deprived Plaintiffs of that right. In my view, this more fundamental question is fairly alleged in the complaint and presented in Plaintiffs' briefing. Therefore, I think this court is obliged to consider it, not least because it is an \"interpretation [that] could succeed.\" Maj. Op. at 1238.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   By focusing on the arraignment rather than the detention, the majority naturally finds that the causal force lies with the state court's conduct, rather than with the jailers' conduct. And by focusing on the state court's conduct, rather than the jailers' conduct, the majority reaches a result heretofore unseen in an overdetention case.

In reaching that conclusion, as the majority rightly notes, we \"consider[ed] New Mexico state law insofar as it bears on the scope of [a defendant's] responsibility to ensure a prompt probable cause determination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566532\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/847/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566532\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/847/\">\n    at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, here, we ought to consider New Mexico law insofar as it bears on the scope of Defendants' responsibility to ensure that detainees are not deprived of their right to freedom pending trial. The majority puts it somewhat differently. My colleagues look to New Mexico law only insofar as it bears on the scope of the Defendants' responsibility to ensure a prompt bail hearing. Finding no such requirement in state law, the majority concludes the Defendants did nothing unconstitutional. But ensuring a prompt bail hearing is just one possible means of ensuring that Plaintiffs' constitutional rights are not violated. Other means will also suffice. Most obviously, the Defendants could have simply released Mr. Moya and Mr. Petry from custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent doing so would have been inconsistent with Defendants' duties under state law, it is no matter, because federal constitutional law trumps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   is not in tension with\n   <em>\n    Jauch\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   . The New Mexico sheriff and warden in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   could no more force the state court to make a probable cause determination than the sheriffs in Mississippi (\n   <em>\n    Jauch\n   </em>\n   ) or Arkansas (\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ) could force their state courts to make a bail determination. Any reference in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   to a duty to \"ensure\" a state court proceeding must simply mean that state officials have a duty to seek the state court's cooperation. And should the state court fail to cooperate, it will be left to the sheriff and warden to desist from holding detainees when they lack continued constitutional authority to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566532\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/847/\">\n    715 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   853 n.6 (noting that it is settled law that defendants \"who effected the plaintiffs' arrests and detentions[ ] could be held liable\n   <em>\n    for the plaintiffs' prolonged detentions\n   </em>\n   without probable cause\" (emphasis added) ). Again, in my view it is the \"prolonged detentions,\" not the absence of a bail hearing or probable-cause hearing, that is the fundamental due process concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The majority's chosen approach, moreover, comes with troubling implications. By (a) looking to state law to determine the scope of state officials' responsibility to ensure prompt bail hearings, and (b) conceptualizing Plaintiffs' liberty interest as an interest in a state court proceeding, rather than in liberty itself, the majority sanctions a system by which states could regularly violate detainees' constitutional\n   rights by holding them indefinitely on account of untimely state courts, without any fear of their collaborating municipalities or state officials ever incurring monetary penalties under \u00a7 1983. Such an outcome is not farfetched. We know from\n   <em>\n    Jauch\n   </em>\n   that, in at least one part of Mississippi, the only court empowered to set bail would sometimes go months between sessions. And, accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true, as we must, we can infer that courts in Santa Fe County-New Mexico's third-most populous-routinely fail to schedule arraignments with any earnest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The majority's causation analysis also lacks a logical endpoint. What if the state court had scheduled Mr. Moya's arraignment a month later than it did? What about a year later? As I read the majority opinion, even then Mr. Moya would have no actionable \u00a7 1983 claim.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , n.9. To be sure, I agree with the majority that New Mexico sheriffs and wardens are powerless to force New Mexico courts to schedule bail hearings in a timely fashion. Only New Mexico courts can do that. But the solution is not to grant jailers refuge behind judges cloaked with absolute immunity, enabling the jailers to violate the Constitution with impunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The better solution is to hold state officials and municipalities responsible for the constitutional violations they themselves commit. True, the effect could be that New Mexico sheriffs and wardens respond by releasing pre-trial detainees, some of whom may have been arrested for alleged violent acts or pose a risk of flight, without the deterrence of bail. But it is our role to assure that New Mexico runs its criminal-justice system with the timeliness that the Fourteenth Amendment commands. If it does not, there should be consequences: either pre-trial detainees go free pending trial, or they will be entitled to civil damages against the state's officials and municipalities so that they may be compensated for the violations of their civil rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
