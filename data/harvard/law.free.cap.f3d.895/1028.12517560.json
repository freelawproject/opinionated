The parties agree these documents are proper\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents that we may consider. In reviewing the documents, it is clear that Lomax's conviction was for \"Domestic Abuse Assault with the Intent to Inflict Serious Injury,\"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"Domestic Abuse Assault with a Dangerous Weapon.\" The complaint lists the two separately (as do the Iowa Criminal Jury Instructions), and the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents explicitly identify Lomax as pleading guilty to Domestic Abuse Assault with the Intent to Inflict Serious Injury. We therefore ignore the dangerous-weapon provision of section 708.2A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next question then is whether the \"assault\" necessary for Lomax's conviction under section 708.2A has an element of physical force. Section 708.1, again, lists three types of assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. Any act which is intended to cause pain or injury to, or which is intended to result in physical contact which will be\n   insulting or offensive to another, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Any act which is intended to place another in fear of immediate physical contact which will be painful, injurious, insulting, or offensive, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Intentionally points any firearm toward another, or displays in a threatening manner any dangerous weapon toward another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government concedes that some of these subsections do not have an element of physical force but asserts that subsection (1) does include a physical-force element. The Government also argues that, based on the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents, subsection (1) was an element of Lomax's conviction, not subsections (2) or (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Looking again to the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents, Lomax's guilty plea established a factual basis for his plea, upon which the district court properly relied. Specifically, Lomax admitted to \"hit[ting the victim] around the head and neck.\" Lomax assented to this factual finding when pleading guilty and signing the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p16\">\n    544 U.S. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p16\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Comparing this factual finding with Iowa's assault statute, it is clear that Lomax-by hitting the victim around the head and neck-committed an assault under subsection (1). And because actual contact occurred, his act was not merely \"intended to place another in fear of immediate physical contact.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20708.1\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 708.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Nor could this factual finding support a conclusion that he committed the \"assault\" by pointing or displaying a dangerous weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20708.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 708.1(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   By applying the modified categorical approach, we believe that Lomax pleaded guilty to committing an \"act which [was] intended to cause pain or injury to, or which was intended to result in physical contact which w[ould] be insulting or offensive to another, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20708.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 708.1(1), and he did so \"with the intent to inflict a serious injury upon another,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20708.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 708.2A(2)(c). As noted above, this offense qualifies as a crime of violence if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). \"Physical force,\" the Supreme Court has declared, \"means\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   force-that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

By pleading guilty, Lomax affirmed that he committed an assault under section 708.1(1) and did so with the intent to inflict a serious injury.

Contrary to Lomax's contention, we can think of no non-fanciful, non-theoretical manner in which to commit such crime without physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

Nor has Lomax proffered one. Therefore, Lomax's prior conviction under section 708.2A qualifies as a crime of violence, and the district court properly applied the career-offender enhancement to increase Lomax's offense level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a)-(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Gaines also appeals, claiming that the sentencing court procedurally erred and imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.

But this argument is meritless. The sentencing court in fact\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   calculate the Guidelines range and apply applicable enhancements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675664\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/38/#p51\">\n    552 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675664\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/38/#p51\">\n    128 S.Ct. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In imposing this sentence, the sentencing court agreed with Gaines that a career-offender enhancement to his offense level overstated the seriousness of his behavior. The court therefore varied downward from Gaines's Guideline range of 151-188 months and imposed a sentence of 120 months. The court affirmed that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court also specifically discussed the seriousness of Gaines's offense, Gaines's criminal history, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. For these reasons, Gaines's sentence was not substantively unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670730\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/455/#p461\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670730\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/455/#p461\">\n    at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the above reasons, the judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The Honorable John A.
