In 2009 and 2010, Segalman's wheelchair was repeatedly damaged while in the possession of Southwest Airlines Co. (\"Southwest\"). On one occasion, Southwest returned Segalman's wheelchair to him without a seatbelt, which had been attached when Segalman left the wheelchair in Southwest's care at the airport departure gate. Before Segalman could get an appointment to replace the seatbelt, he fell out of his wheelchair and broke his shin in two places, resulting in a four-day hospital stay. On another occasion, Southwest returned the wheelchair to Segalman with a broken armrest. On a third occasion, Southwest returned the wheelchair with damage to the joystick that rendered the wheelchair inoperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2011, Segalman brought this action against Southwest and ten unidentified Southwest employees for damages and injunctive relief. He alleged negligence under California state law and a violation of the ACAA, which prohibits air carriers from \"discriminat[ing] against an otherwise qualified individual\" on the ground that the individual \"has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041705\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Segalman subsequently\n   amended his complaint twice, withdrawing his ACAA claim and adding claims alleging California statutory violations.

Southwest moved to dismiss Segalman's Third Amended Complaint except as to his negligence claim, and the district court granted the motion. With respect to the ACAA claim, the district court concluded that no implied private cause of action existed, and that even if it did, Segalman failed to allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies. In December 2016, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the district court dismissed Segalman's remaining negligence claim with prejudice.
