(\"PRA\"), and its attorneys, Gamache &amp; Myers, P.C. (\"Gamache\"), under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FDCPA\"). The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), and the district court granted the motion. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Haney incurred credit-card debts using a Wal-Mart credit card issued by GE Money Bank, F.S.B. (the \"Wal-Mart account\"), and an HSBC credit card issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A./Orchard Bank (the \"HSBC account\"). The card issuers charged off the debts and later sold and assigned the charged-off debts to PRA. PRA hired Gamache to aid in collection of the HSBC account. Gamache sent Haney three collection letters and filed a state-court collection action. PRA employed other counsel to aid in collection of the Wal-Mart account and filed a state-court collection action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Haney alleges FDCPA violations based upon statements, omissions, and demands in the underlying letters and collection actions. The primary issues raised in this appeal include: (1) whether the original creditors' acts of charging off the debts preclude the assignee debt collector from demanding post-charge-off statutory prejudgment interest in letters and collection suits; and (2) whether the demands sought prejudgment interest upon interest (compound interest) in violation of Missouri law and the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With these arguments in mind, we turn to the detailed allegations. The balance of the Wal-Mart account was $1,224.88 at the time of the July 20, 2010 charge-off. Of that total amount, $416.93 was labeled \"FINANCE CHARGES\" and consisted, at least in part, of accrued contractual interest. The HSBC account, purportedly charged off on June 30, 2010, had a balance of $740.16. A June 2010 statement shows the outstanding HSBC balance included at least some fee and interest charges. PRA received the Wal-Mart account by assignment on April 19, 2011. Haney does not allege the date of assignment for the HSBC account, and the pleadings and appended materials do not identify an assignment date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gamache sent Haney a first letter regarding the HSBC account dated April 11, 2013. The letter stated, \"RE: PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES, LLC DANIEL G HANEY,\" identified the debt as \"OUR FILE NO.: 13504068,\" and stated the amount due was \"$925.59 ... plus interest that may accrue after the date of this letter.\" The letter stated Gamache would provide the name and address of the original creditor if Haney requested the creditor's identity within thirty days of receiving the letter. The letter also stated Gamache would assume the debt to be valid unless Haney responded within thirty days but would obtain verification of the debt if Haney provided notice in writing to dispute any portion of the debt. The file number listed in the letter bore no relationship to Haney's HSBC account number. The letter made no reference to HSBC or the $740.16 HSBC account balance at the time of charge-off and provided no explanation as to how the demanded amount of $925.59 was determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In fact, Haney argues the amount demanded approximated the $740.16 charge-off balance plus nine percent statutory prejudgment interest from the June 20, 2010 charge-off to the date of the letter. The amount demanded was significantly\n   below an amount that would have resulted from the continued accrual of contractual interest. The letter's demand for interest covered a period of time before and after PRA acquired the debt and sought statutory prejudgment interest on the entire charge-off balance, an amount that included original principal, fees, and contractual interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the second letter, dated May 16, 2013, Gamache identified the debt with the same account number, this time stating, \"there appears to be an unpaid balance of $931.98,\" but Gamache's client would settle for \"745.58, provided this amount is paid within 10 days from the date of this letter.\" The third letter, dated May 31, 2013, listed the same account number and stated, \"CLAIM AMOUNT AS OF THE DATE OF THIS LETTER IS: $934.72 PLUS INTEREST THAT MAY ACCRUE AFTER THE DATE OF THIS LETTER.\" Unlike the first two letters, which made no references to remedies or legal actions, the third letter concluded, \"If we do not hear from you in five days, we will feel free to proceed with all available remedies without further notice to you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Haney took no action in response to the letters and sought no clarification regarding the identity of the original creditor. Gamache filed a Missouri state-court complaint on November 7, 2013, naming PRA as the plaintiff, identifying Gamache as counsel for PRA, and identifying HSBC as the original creditor. The complaint's prayer for relief, styled as a concluding \"whereas\" paragraph, sought \"a sum of $740.16 [the original charged-off amount] plus post judgment interest at the statutory rate and for all costs expended herein and for any other and further relief this Court deems just and proper.\" The state-court complaint on the HSBC account included no request for pre-judgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Regarding the Wal-Mart account, PRA sent no letters. Rather, PRA filed a Missouri state-court complaint on April 22, 2013. The complaint's prayer for relief, styled as a concluding \"whereas\" paragraph, sought \"a sum of $1,224.88 [the charged-off amount], together with prejudgment interest, as allowed by law, at the statutory rate from and after July 20, 2010, plus interest on any judgment rendered by this court at the rate of 9% per annum, all costs expended herein and for such further and other relief as this court deems just and proper.\" This demand for statutory prejudgment interest covered post-charge-off periods of time before and after PRA's acquisition of the debt and also sought statutory prejudgment interest on the accrued contractual interest reflected in the $1,224.88 charge-off balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Haney then filed the current complaint alleging FDCPA violations in four counts. Count I alleged PRA violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e in several respects by \"misrepresent[ing] the character or amount of the debt\" being sought. First, Count I alleged PRA's suit on the Wal-Mart account misrepresented as principal a sum that also included interest. Count I also alleged PRA misrepresented the amount it sought by demanding prejudgment interest on a sum that already included contractual interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the HSBC account, Count I alleged PRA misrepresented the amount it sought by mischaracterizing as principal an amount that included interest. Finally, Count I alleged PRA violated \u00a7 1692e by \"alleging, without providing proof of, a valid assignment from HSBC of the HSBC card debt[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Count II alleged Gamache violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e in two respects by \"misrepresent[ing] the character or amount of the debt\" it sought. First, Count II alleged Gamache's letters failed to identify which debts were being pursued, \"making it impossible to ascertain which debt Gamache was attempting to collect, and making it impossible to ascertain the validity of ... the ... debts[.]\" Second, Count II alleged Gamache's letters \"unlawfully attempt[ed] to collect interest-on-interest or ... interest inconsistent with the amount of the original charged-off debt regardless of whether the letters were attempting to collect the HSBC ... or the [Wal-Mart account] ... debt[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Count III alleged PRA violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1) in two respects by \"us[ing] unfair or unconscionable means to attempt to collect the [HSBC] debt[.]\" First, Count III alleged PRA sought \"interest, fees, and other amounts not permitted at law or expressly permitted by the written instrument creating the debt.\" Second, Count III alleged PRA sought interest on interest \"when such compound interest was not expressly permitted by the written instrument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants moved jointly for dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Haney resisted, and the district court granted the motion. The court first determined that the prayers for relief in the concluding paragraphs of a civil complaint were not communications to the debtor or actionable collection efforts pursuant to the FDCPA. Rather, the court characterized them as mere requests to the court. In the alternative, the court held the original creditor's act of charging off the card balance did not preclude a subsequent assignee from seeking statutory interest dating from the time of charge-off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court then determined PRA had referenced only the \"balance due\" or the \"outstanding sum\" and had not made any actionable or potentially misleading statements regarding the relative breakdown of principal and interest in the amounts demanded. And, regarding the filing of the HSBC suit without proof of a valid assignment, the district court determined there existed no requirement for the presentation of such proof at the time a collection action is filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court determined Gamache had not violated \u00a7 1692e by failing to adequately identify the debt and Gamache and PRA had not impermissibly demanded prejudgment interest-on-interest or compound interest, in violation of state law.

Post-Charge-Off Statutory Prejudgment Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Haney asserts a theory of implicit waiver to argue that the original creditor's choice to charge-off a debt and cease collection of contractual interest serves as a binding waiver of any future ability to collect\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   interest. To support this theory, Haney details the purported accounting consequences of a charge-off and cites the legal effect of a charge-off on a creditor's ongoing obligation to provide periodic statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20226.5\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(i) (\"Regulation Z\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Haney appears to argue that, because the act of charging off a debt is not merely a unilateral act but an act that alters the parties' relationship and requires the original creditor to make representations to taxing authorities, we should view a charge-off as a complete waiver of any right to all forms of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants argue the act of charging off a debt does not preclude the collection of statutory prejudgment interest because the act of charging off a debt does not eliminate either the original creditor's statutory rights or the debtor's ongoing obligation to pay the charge-off balance-a liquidated sum-to the creditor. The defendants acknowledge the unilateral act carries with it several legal consequences as provided pursuant to federal tax law\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Regulation Z. They argue, however, that the unilateral act does not vest in the debtor a right to have the original creditor and its assignees otherwise forbear from exercising statutory rights to prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, there is no suggestion the original creditors expressly waived any right to statutory prejudgment interest. Similarly, there is no suggestion they asserted an entitlement to statutory prejudgment interest.

The tax benefit of a debt charge-off-current realization of expense deduction or capital loss-is a matter of concern as between the creditor and the relevant taxing authority. Haney appears to assert that any attempt to collect statutory interest is inconsistent with the accounting treatment of a debt at charge-off. Even if Haney is correct that seeking statutory interest would be contrary to prior tax treatment, the consequences of such an act are a matter of concern as between the creditor and the taxing authority rather than between the creditor and the debtor. A creditor's potential liability for penalties or additional taxes does nothing to change the liquidated sum the debtor owes the creditor at the time of charge-off, and it is highly unlikely a debtor would know of any communications between a creditor and a taxing authority or any ongoing changes or adjustments to a creditor's treatment of a reported item.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    AmBase Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705613\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/109/#p121\">\n    731 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121-22 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding taxpayer was allowed to retroactively increase a claimed bad-debt deduction in amount necessary to account for a charge-off). As such, it is difficult to appreciate how arguable inconsistencies between collection efforts and tax treatment might aid Haney's waiver argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Haney also emphasizes that the act of charging off a debt and sending a charge-off statement relieves the creditor of the obligation to send periodic statements complying with the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\") and Regulation Z. TILA and its regulations, however, are concerned with adequately communicating contractual terms addressing interest and finance charges on consumer loans; they are not designed for the general communication of state law to consumers or to govern the state-law treatment of general claims for liquidated sums.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-0488-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204854658\">\n    2014 WL 4854658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.

Nothing inherent in the process of charging off a debt precludes a claim for statutory interest, and Missouri's prejudgment interest statute does not expressly preclude statutory prejudgment interest following a waiver of contractual interest. PRA and Gamache's demands for such interest, therefore, were not actionable misrepresentations or unfair or unconscionable collection methods under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e or \u00a7 1692f, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although we hold statutory prejudgment interest remains available as a general matter, Haney raises separate, additional challenges. First, he notes that Gamache's letters on the HSBC account and PRA's complaint on the Wal-Mart account sought prejudgment interest for periods of time prior to PRA's purported acquisitions of the debts. He appears to argue that, even if statutory interest might otherwise be available to PRA, it is not available for the period of time following charge-off and\n   preceding assignment. Second, he argues Missouri Revised Statutes \u00a7 408.020 requires a demand to trigger the accrual of statutory prejudgment interest. According to Haney, Gamache and PRA made no demand for prejudgment interest on the HSBC account prior to Gamache's April 11, 2013 letter, and PRA made no demand on the Wal-Mart account prior to filing the state court complaint. Thus, Haney argues, the attempt to collect prejudgment interest for periods of time prior to these communications supports his FDCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendants argue these issues were not raised below and cannot be raised on appeal. We need not rely on defendant's waiver argument, because we find Haney's position as to the timing issue or a demand requirement is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the timing of assignments, PRA obtained the same rights as held by the original creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renaissance Leasing, LLC v.

Applying these holdings to the present case, Haney has articulated viable \u00a7 1692e and \u00a7 1692f(1) claims by alleging false statements and collection attempts regarding the availability of compound interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   D. PRA's Prayers for Relief in Litigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Haney also appeals the district court's dismissal of claims against PRA arising from PRA's assertion in prayers for relief in litigation of a right to recover statutory prejudgment interest on accrued contractual interest. In its petition filed against Haney in Missouri circuit court, PRA included two prayers for relief asking the court to enter judgment in a sum certain, \"together with prejudgment interest, as allowed by law, at the statutory rate from and after July 20, 2010, plus interest on any judgment ... at the rate of 9% per annum.\" The district court thought it \"doubtful\" that a request for relief in the \"wherefore\" clauses of PRA's petition could violate the FDCPA, but ultimately concluded that PRA was entitled to the interest claimed. Haney argues that because collection of interest on interest was not permitted by Missouri law, PRA's petition included a false representation and constituted an unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although we have concluded that PRA cannot collect the disputed interest on interest under Missouri law, the claim for that amount in the petition was a statement directed to the court, and it was a good faith legal position on a point of unsettled Missouri law. Indeed, the district court agreed with PRA's legal position. We reject Haney's contention that the \"wherefore\" clauses were false representations or an unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt within the meaning of the FDCPA. As several courts have recognized, the statute does not forbid a party from stating its good faith legal position to a court in a prayer for relief.\n   <em>\n    Riermersma v.

Lack of Clarity in Gamache's Collection Letters\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Haney argues that Gamache's failure to identify HSBC, cite the $740.16 account balance, or explain the various sums demanded in the three letters resulted in a failure to comply with \u00a7 1692g(a)(1) and were, in collective effect, misleading to an unsophisticated consumer in violation of \u00a7 1692e. Haney did not assert a claim based on \u00a7 1692g(a) below. We nevertheless find \u00a7 1692g(a) material to our analysis because it sets forth what a debt collector must disclose in an initial communication (or in a timely follow-up notice).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n. 5. Here, Gamache provided the required information and, aside from including an impermissible claim for interest-on-interest in the amount demanded, Gamache did not relay any inaccurate information. Gamache complied with the requirements to truthfully identify itself and the party it represented, to whom the debt was owed. Gamache also complied with the requirement to notify Haney of the option to challenge the validity of the debt and to offer to identify the original creditor. While Gamache could have disclosed more information in its initial communication, it was not required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, \u00a7 1692g(a)(5) specifically anticipates that an initial communication may omit the identity of the original debtor. As such, Gamache's failure to reference HSBC in the April 11, 2013 letter cannot serve as a basis for this claim. Examining Haney's claim, all he has alleged is that the amount demanded was confusing or misleading when coupled with the failure to identify HSBC. As such, and given our conclusion that Haney may proceed with his interest-on-interest claim against Gamache, there is no separate ground on which to reverse the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing Haney's claims against Gamache in Count II and Count IV based on the attempted collection of statutory prejudgment interest on accrued contractual interest.

I would hold the demand for interest upon interest in PRA's complaint served as a false representation and constituted an unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f(1).

PRA also argues placement of its demand in the prayer for relief makes the demand an aspirational request to the court rather than a potential misrepresentation to the debtor. As support for these conclusions, PRA cites several district court cases arguably consistent with its position. In reality, these arguments are specific examples of broader arguments our court has wrestled with in the past regarding the applicability of the FDCPA to various litigation-related activities and communications.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen v.

But the circuit courts have struggled to define the extent to which a debt collection lawyer's representations to the consumer's attorney or in court filings during the course of debt collection litigation can violate \u00a7\u00a7 1692d-f.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   , we rejected any sort of categorical approach that might deem \"false statements not made directly to the consumer debtor\" immune from FDCPA scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 818. Rather, we adopted \"a case-by-case approach,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 819, noting representations to attorneys or in pleadings arise \"in a wide variety of situations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 818, that \"routinely come to the consumer's attention and may affect his or her defense of a collection claim,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   We ultimately held in\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   that the representations at issue, made in a summary judgment memorandum and affidavit, did not violate the FDCPA because they were made long after litigation commenced and were not representations likely to deter the debtor from mounting a \"vigorous defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 819. We also noted the FDCPA was not intended to\n   destroy creditors' access to judicial remedies, and as such, creditors should be allowed to advance their arguments and attempt to present evidence without fearing FDCPA liability merely because a state court ultimately rejects a statement as unsupported in a summary judgment proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As per\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   , we must assess how the hypothetical unsophisticated consumer will perceive the representations in a letter or complaint. I conclude the placement and wording at issue in the present case are not shielded from further scrutiny pursuant to the FDCPA. When receiving a demand letter, a debtor faces many choices: take no action, seek clarification, pay the amount demanded (or some other amount), seek relief or renegotiation, or hire counsel. Similarly, when receiving a civil complaint in a collection action, the debtor may take no action and accept a default judgment, mount defenses with varying degrees of vigor, proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , or proceed with counsel. The demands and allegations in the letters and complaints do not exist in a vacuum. They may well arrive in the hands of a debtor and affect a debtor's choice of action-deterring the debtor from mounting a defense or employing counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049018\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/814/\">\n    674 F.3d at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Though rarely made 'directly' to the consumer debtor, such representations routinely come to the consumer's attention and may affect his or her defense of a collection claim.\"). Further, such representations made to a consumer prior to the consumer's retention of counsel on the matter clearly are subject to the unsophisticated-consumer standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888908\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/567/#p573\">\n    776 F.3d at 573-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Viewed in this light, understood as a statement to the consumer as well as to the court, and reasonably interpreted in favor of the plaintiff, PRA's use of the phrase \"as allowed by law,\" within the context of the larger phrase \"as allowed by law, at the statutory rate from and after July 20, 2010,\" should not be limited to the narrow and defendant-friendly construction meaning \"if allowed by law.\" At the motion to dismiss stage, I am reluctant to presume the phrasing represents a good faith assertion of a legal theory only to the court. An unsophisticated consumer, without adopting an idiosyncratic or bizarre interpretation, easily could view the phrase \"as allowed by law\" as an affirmative representation that the relief or amount sought is, in fact, allowed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218671\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/871/#p874\">\n    215 F.3d at 874-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding representations about the availability of remedies under state law can be actionable pursuant to the FDCPA). Simply put, PRA did not make an open-ended demand (language seeking \"such additional relief as the court may allow\") or clearly articulate hedging language (language such as \"if allowed by law\" or \"to the extent a court may find it to be allowed by law\") sufficient to pass muster under the unsophisticated-consumer standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265982\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/443/#p445\">\n    770 F.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the argument that a demand in a complaint was merely a good faith argument to the court and concluding, \"Saying [the debtor] owed $2630.95 plus whatever interest the court chooses to award is simply not the same as saying that [the debtor] owed $2630.95 plus 8% interest from the date [the original creditor] charged off her account.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Similarly, the placement of a demand in a civil complaint's prayer for relief, styled as a concluding \"whereas\" clause, does not necessarily take the demand outside the scope of the FDCPA's protections. In so holding, I would reject the conclusion of the majority and the several courts cited above indicating that such a clause is a non-actionable request to the court rather than an actionable debt-collection activity. Rather, as per the instruction of\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   : we may not presume a statement\n   categorically non-actionable pursuant to the FDCPA merely because it is a statement to a third party.\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049018\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/814/\">\n    674 F.3d at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here the prayed-for relief stated \"as allowed by law\" in connection with a statutory rate of interest from a certain date. The prayer for relief was served upon the debtor and was not a vague demand for whatever the court might deem appropriate and consistent with applicable law. We therefore should not cut off Haney's claim at this early stage.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
