Michael Patrick Carr was convicted of possession of methamphetamine, in violation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). He appeals the substantive reasonableness of his prison sentence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 7, 2016, United States Postal Inspector Kevin Marshall identified a suspicious package while conducting a routine examination of parcels at the United States Postal Service's facility in south Des Moines, Iowa. After a drug-sniffing dog alerted to the presence of a controlled substance, Marshall obtained a search warrant to open the package.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He found that the parcel contained approximately one kilogram of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Law enforcement conducted a controlled delivery of the package to its intended address. Shortly after the package was delivered, Carr arrived in a vehicle registered to Homedew. Carr retrieved the package and drove off. The authorities arrested Carr shortly thereafter. He chose to cooperate with police. Carr disclosed that he had a business relationship with \"Jon.\" Carr stated that he anticipated receiving another approximately 27 pounds of methamphetamine from Jon that had already been shipped. Carr also told police that Jon was flying into town the next evening. Using text messages Carr showed them, Jon's cell phone number, and a social media search, law enforcement concluded that Jon was Jonathan Homedew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 8, about ten law enforcement officers positioned themselves around the Des Moines airport in anticipation\n   of Homedew's arrival. They spotted him leaving the airport with a backpack. Police arrested Homedew and took possession of his backpack. The backpack was not immediately searched. Officers escorted Homedew to a police vehicle, and when asked, Homedew disclosed that he had checked one bag. Officer Ben Carter asked Homedew for permission to look in the backpack to retrieve the baggage claim receipt. Homedew told him to \"go ahead,\" and said the receipt would be in the top pouch.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jonathan Leroy Homedew\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:16-cr-0145-JAJ-HCA-1, slip op. at 3 (S.D. Iowa Dec. 22, 2016), ECF No. 130. While looking for the baggage receipt, Carter noticed three postal receipts commingled with other papers in the pouch. Given what he knew about the case to that point, he surmised that the postal receipts could contain incriminating information and seized them as well. Carter then began opening another zipper, prompting Homedew to withdraw his consent to look in the bag. Carter stopped the search. Upon Homedew's and the officers' arrival at the police station, Carter made copies of the receipts and went online to track their progress. He also provided copies to Marshall, the postal inspector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After being transported to the police station, Homedew consented in writing to a police interview. He was\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   and told that he was not obligated to participate in or continue the interview. Homedew expressed his belief that the search of his backpack at the airport had exceeded the scope of his consent. Nonetheless, he eventually consented to the search of his backpack and checked bag. Notes found in his checked luggage corroborated information Carr gave police about the drug operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Using the postal receipts, Marshall retrieved eight more packages containing methamphetamine-seven at the Des Moines postal station, and one at the post office in Winterset, Iowa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the government indicted Homedew and Carr, as well as Sonya Rae Tucker and Amber Marie Shipp, with conspiracy to distribute over 50 grams of actual methamphetamine and 500 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 846. Carr, Tucker, and Shipp were also charged with a single count of possession with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 7, 2016, Homedew's appointed counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained from the search of his backpack and seizure of the postal receipts, including the fruits of the search of his checked baggage and other items, arguing that the search and seizure violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court consolidated the defendants' trial schedules and set trial for all four defendants for November 28, 2016. On November 1, Shipp's counsel moved to continue the trial for three months, alleging that Shipp needed time to work out her plea deal and that her codefendants had no objection. The court granted the motion following a hearing and reset trial for February 13, 2017. The court, citing the ends of justice, excluded the time between the filing of the motion and the new trial date from consideration under the Speedy Trial Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(7)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 16, upon discovering the continuance, Homedew filed a pro se motion claiming that his attorney had ignored his clear request to file an objection to any continuance of his trial. Homedew asserted a violation of his right to a speedy trial. He also requested that the court appoint him new counsel. He subsequently filed a pro se motion to sever and a pro se motion to\n   dismiss. The gravamen of both motions was that delays in the case violated his right to a speedy trial under both the Speedy Trial Act and the Sixth Amendment. The court appointed substitute counsel, who also filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for violations of Homedew's right to a speedy trial. The pro se and counsel-filed motions to dismiss alleged that Homedew's previous counsel had failed him by consenting to a continuance against his wishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court denied Homedew's motion to suppress. First, it found that Homedew had voluntarily consented to the search of his backpack. Second, the court found that the search was properly undertaken incident to Homedew's arrest. Third, the court found that the plain view doctrine justified the seizure of the postal receipts. Finally, the court denied the motion under the inevitable discovery doctrine. It explained that even if the search was improper, the information possessed by the police at that point would have, in concert with their investigative techniques, resulted in the discovery of the remaining methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court also denied the speedy trial motions, determining that fewer than 40 excludable days had elapsed since Homedew's arraignment. It also noted that Homedew had not provided any authority in support of his proposition that an objection to the continuance should have prevented an otherwise justifiable resetting of the trial date. A jury subsequently found Homedew guilty of the charged crime. He was sentenced to 360 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whereas Homedew was held in custody pending resolution of his case, Carr was granted pretrial release. Carr violated the conditions of that release by absconding for over two months. After being arrested in Florida and returned to Iowa, Carr pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to the possession count; the conspiracy count against him was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Carr's presentence investigation report (PSR) charged him with responsibility for 17.55 kilograms of actual methamphetamine. Due to Carr's abscondment, the PSR called for an obstruction-of-justice enhancement and denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (obstruction of justice); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (acceptance of responsibility). The PSR set a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of II. By normal calculation, Carr's Guidelines range would have been 324 to 405 months. Here, however, his Guidelines range was capped by the statutory maximum of 240 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) ; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Carr requested a downward variance to 120 months. He argued that his extensive criminal history overstated his actual criminality. He attributed most of his criminal behavior to an addiction to drugs. Furthermore, he asserted that his role in the offense was relatively minor and was similar to that of codefendants Shipp and Tucker, who respectively received sentences of 84 and 90 months. Additionally, he stated that his assistance to law enforcement was valuable to the government. Finally, he claimed he left the jurisdiction primarily to see his father for the first time in 30 years, not to avoid prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government conceded that Carr had been helpful at the outset of the case but intimated that it likely would have been able to make its case even without his help. It also emphasized the depth of Carr's involvement in the crime, noting that Carr played a major role in moving a large quantity of illegal drugs across the country. The government also underscored the seriousness of Carr's two-month flight from the jurisdiction. It nonetheless requested that Carr receive the full three-level\n   reduction for acceptance of responsibility and advocated for a sentence on the low end of the Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court granted Carr the full acceptance of responsibility reduction, resulting in a Guidelines range of 235 to 240 months. In pronouncing sentence, the court set forth a number of factors affecting its decision. It mentioned the \"staggering amount of very pure methamphetamine\"; the \"extent to which [Carr's role was] addiction-driven and the extent to which it exceeds addiction-driven behavior\"; the need for just punishment; and Carr's criminal history, including a previous felony drug conviction.

The court also noted the \"extent to which the obstruction of justice enhancement perhaps overstates the culpability or the seriousness of that behavior in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Homedew\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:16-cr-145-JAJ-HCA-1 (S.D. Iowa Nov. 22, 2016), ECF No. 252. Further, an exchange during the custodial interview suggests that Homedew acknowledged having consented to the search that resulted in the seizure of the receipts. The district court stated: \"The interviewing officer reminded the defendant that he had consented to the retrieval of his baggage claim receipt, 'You told us we could look in there to get the ...' at which point the defendant cut off the officer stating 'You had the receipt ... you still kept looking.' \" Slip Op. at 4 (ellipses in original). The government's representation that Homedew gave the officer\n   permission to search his bag without a warrant is \"coherent and facially plausible\" and \"not contradicted by extrinsic evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's decision to accept that version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Homedew insists that if he did give consent, it was not voluntary and more limited than the search actually conducted. He points out that when asked for permission, he was \"surrounded by police officers, was the focus of a particular investigation, was hand cuffed and physically controlled by the officers, his back pack was in possession of police, weapons were displayed and there was no uncertainty that compliance was necessary.\" Homedew's Br. at 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We determine whether consent is voluntary by examining the totality of the circumstances, including\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) the individual's age and mental ability; (2) whether the individual was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; (3) whether the individual was informed of [his]\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights; and (4) whether the individual was aware, through prior experience, of the protections that the legal system provides for suspected criminals. It is also important to consider the environment in which an individual's consent is obtained, including (1) the length of the detention; (2) whether the police used threats, physical intimidation, or punishment to extract consent; (3) whether the police made promises or misrepresentations; (4) whether the individual was in custody or under arrest when consent was given; (5) whether the consent was given in public or in a secluded location; and (6) whether the individual stood by silently or objected to the search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, Homedew was under arrest and handcuffed. But there is no evidence of any threat, physical intimidation, or punishment. The area was a public airport and not secluded. When an officer asked if he could search Homedew's backpack for the baggage claim receipt, Homedew gave an affirmative response. The record gives us no indication that at the time of his arrest, Homedew was anything other than a sober, middle-aged man with no mental defects. And though he was not read his rights before consenting, he has an extensive criminal record and prior experience with the legal system. Further, the record does not indicate that the length of his detention before he gave his consent was of inordinate length. The district court found that Homedew \"was under arrest for only a few moments when he gave his consent.\" Slip Op. at 6-7. Homedew objected to the search once he thought the officers obtained not only the baggage claim receipt but also the postal receipts. He withdrew his consent, and the search ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court's finding of voluntary consent was not clearly erroneous. \"Because we find the warrantless search valid on the basis of consent, we need not address the alternative theories advanced by the Government to justify the search.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He makes a passing reference to a belief that the district court improperly determined that the time during which a detention motion pended was excludable. Homedew's Br. at 29-30 (\"It is Homedew's position that the orders in regard to the revocation of the pretrial status of Amber Shipp are also not the kinds of motions or order that affect the trial matters, but merely concern where she would be held pending trial.\").
