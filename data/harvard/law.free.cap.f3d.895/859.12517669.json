This case stems from an undercover investigation on Facebook. The subject of the investigation, Defendant-Appellant Malik Farrad, was a felon prohibited by federal law from possessing a firearm. In June 2015, after a two-day trial, a jury found Farrad guilty of breaking that prohibition. No physical evidence was presented, no witness claimed to have seen Farrad with a gun, and Farrad himself never made any statements suggesting that he owned a gun; instead, the Government relied primarily on photographs obtained from what was evidently Farrad's Facebook account. To help prove its case, however, the Government called two police officers: Officer Garrison, who testified that criminals are particularly likely to upload photos of criminal deeds soon after committing those deeds, and Officer Hinkle, who testified at length about the similarities between the photos and a real gun, as well as the dissimilarities between the photos and the closest fake gun of which he was aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Farrad now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the admission of the photos into evidence, and the testimony that Officers Garrison and Hinkle were allowed to offer, as well as the district court's denial of his motion for a new trial, his sentencing as an armed career criminal, and the district court's failure to suppress the photos on Fourth Amendment grounds. For the reasons that follow, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Investigation, Indictment, and Pre-Trial Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After serving time in prison for a previous felony, Farrad was released from federal custody in January 2013.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 5-1 (Warrant Application at 3) (Page ID #9). Farrad came to the attention of local law enforcement sometime after June 10 of that same year, when \"[v]arious confidential informants and concerned citizens\" evidently \"reported observing Farrad to be in possession of one or more firearms while in Johnson City, Tennessee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Page ID #10). Some time later, a Johnson City police officer named Thomas Garrison, using an undercover account, sent Farrad \"a friend request on Facebook.\" R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 81, 90-91) (Page ID #679, 688-89). After Farrad \"accept[ed]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   the friend request,\" Garrison was able to see more of Farrad's photos.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 81 (Page ID #679). \"One [photo] in particular\" \"caught [his] interest\": a photo that showed what appeared to be three handguns \"sitting on a closed toilet lid in a bathroom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82 (Page ID #679-80);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appellant's App'x at 6. The photo had been uploaded on October 7, 2013. R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 83) (Page ID #681); Appellant's App'x at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Garrison brought the photo to the attention of Johnson City police officer and FBI task force officer Matthew Gryder, who applied on October 25, 2013, for a warrant to search Facebook's records for \"information associated with the Facebook user ID MALIK.FARRAD.5.\" R. 5-1 (Warrant Application at 4, 10-11) (Page ID #10, 16-17). A federal magistrate judge granted the warrant application. R. 5-4 (Search and Seizure Warrant at 1) (Page ID #25). The warrant mandated execution \"on or before November 6, 2013,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and the return executed by federal law enforcement indicates that the warrant was \"served electronically\" on Facebook on November 1, 2013,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Page ID #26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The resulting data yielded a series of additional photos that are central to this case: some show a person who looks like Farrad holding what appears to be a gun,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Appellant's App'x at 11-14, while others show a closer-up version of a hand holding what appears to be a gun,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While none of the photos shows a calendar, date, or one-of-a-kind distinguishing feature, the person in the photos has relatively distinctive tattoos, and some of the photos show, as backdrop, the d\u00e9cor of the room in which they were taken.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 11-12, 19-20, 22-23, 25-26. Facebook records revealed that the photos had been uploaded on October 11, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2014, a federal grand jury charged Farrad with having, \"on or about October 11, 2013, ... knowingly possess[ed] ... a firearm, namely, a Springfield, Model XD, .45 caliber, semiautomatic pistol.\" R. 3 (Indictment) (Page ID #3). On March 26, 2015, Farrad filed a pro se motion seeking an evidentiary hearing, dismissal of the indictment against him, and suppression of the Facebook photos on Fourth Amendment grounds. R. 22 (Pro Se Mot.) (Page ID #85-91). The magistrate judge assigned to Farrad's case denied that motion on April 9, 2015, on the grounds that Farrad already had appointed counsel and the local rules prohibited a represented party from \"act[ing] in his or her own behalf\" without \"an order of substitution.\" R. 24 (Order at 1) (Page ID #93) (quoting E.D. Tenn. Local Rule 83.4(c) ). Farrad's trial counsel did not renew Farrad's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties did, however, litigate the admission of the photos on evidentiary grounds. The Government argued that the Facebook photos qualified as business records under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) and that they were, as such, self-authenticating under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(11). R. 26 (Gov't's Mot. in Limine at 1) (Page ID #100). In support of its assertion, the Government introduced a certification by a Facebook-authorized records custodian, who attested that the records provided by Facebook-including \"search results for basic subscriber information, IP logs, messages, photos, [and] other content and records for malik.farrad.5\"-\"were made and kept by the automated systems of Facebook in the course\n   of regularly conducted activity as a regular practice of Facebook\" and \"made at or near the time the information was transmitted by the Facebook user.\" R. 26-1 (Facebook Certification) (Page ID #105). In addition to disputing admissibility under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, and 406, R. 30 (Def.'s Response to Gov't's Tr. Br. at 3) (Page ID #119), Farrad's trial counsel argued that the photos, despite the custodian's affidavit having been \"done correctly under the federal rules,\" were \"hearsay within hearsay\" and did not \"authenticate who took the pictures, when the pictures were taken, by whom, at what time,\" R. 60 (Pretrial Conf. Tr. at 11) (Page ID #456). All that the custodian could attest to, trial counsel emphasized, was \"that at some point these pictures were uploaded to what [was] allegedly [Farrad's] Facebook account\"; the custodian could not \"testify as to ... who took [the photos], when they were taken, where they were taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (Page ID #457). On June 15, 2015, the district court concluded that it had \"found no indication of a lack of trustworthiness\" and that the photos qualified as business records under Rules 803(6) and 902(11).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 73 (Pretrial Hr'g Tr. at 33) (Page ID #872). It also determined that the photos were relevant.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-37 (Page ID #874-76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial began the next day. At trial, the jury first heard from Garrison, who not only detailed his discovery of the precipitating toilet-seat photo, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 83) (Page ID #681), but also, in his capacity as an experienced user of social media in the service of police investigations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 80 (Page ID #678), discussed broader trends in how people who have committed crimes behave on social-media platforms. After Garrison conceded that users \"can upload ... pictures to Facebook that were taken at different times,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 84 (Page ID #682), the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   GOVERNMENT: Okay. Now, in your training and experience and drawing upon the hundreds of cases you said you've been involved in using social media, when you come across people involved in criminal conduct who have uploaded photographs to their social media account, how quickly do they do that, relative to when that photograph is actually taken?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Object as speculation, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Your response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   GOVERNMENT: Your Honor, Mr. Garrison has testified about his training in social media investigations, hundreds of cases he said. He can certainly testify as to what his experience has been when people upload photographs in the past, other investigations he's been involved in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: With those parameters in mind, the Court will overrule the objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   GARRISON: Generally, in my experience, it's been more of a-you know, like I say, it can be instantaneous. But it is more of a present-type of thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651538\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/324/#p330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Garrison admitted that he could not \"think of a specific instance\" in which he had \"talked to a target about specific things on Facebook\" or recall \"specific instances of training\" on the subject,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 85 (Page ID #683), the Government asked him to explain why \"people choose to post criminal conduct that they're involved in, to social media,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86 (Page ID 684). This exchange followed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   GARRISON: I would say that it mirrors the same reason that-that people in general post things on Facebook. But\n   criminals specifically, they like to brag about their-their activities, they're proud of it, and just like anyone, they want to let their friends know what they're doing, let their friends know, you know, where they're at, what's going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   GOVERNMENT: In terms of your training and experience, is it more likely or less likely in terms of all of the cases you've seen before, that someone uploads those photographs immediately as opposed to sitting and waiting to upload them weeks or months or years later?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   GARRISON: In my experience, I would consider that more likely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   GOVERNMENT: Now, in the context of social media applications that someone uses on their cell phone, say, does the use of those applications on someone's cell phone make it more or less likely in your training and experience that those photographs are going to be uploaded at the time they're actually created?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651538\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/324/#p330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defense counsel again objected on speculation and relevancy grounds, and the district court again allowed the questioning to continue \"within the limited circumstances of [Garrison's] experience.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87 (Page ID #684-85). Garrison answered that \"the apps makes it easier and more likely for someone to immediately upload a photograph taken with their cell phone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This line of questioning then concluded with the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   GOVERNMENT: In contrast, then, how many times relative to instances in which people have uploaded immediately, contrasted that [sic] to the number of times you've seen photographs depicting criminal conduct that have been held back for extended periods of time, weeks, months or years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   GARRISON: I would-I would consider that more rare. I can't-I can't think of a specific number or a-or an instance just off the top of my head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87-88 (Page ID #685-86). Garrison also explained via direct examination that while digital photographs generally contain \"metadata\" that preserves, for example, \"the time and date that the photograph was taken,\" \"Facebook actually strips that metadata as the photograph is uploaded to Facebook,\" rendering the date of creation unknown.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89 (Page ID #687).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury also heard about and saw the photos obtained from Farrad's Facebook account, chiefly through testimony by Gryder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-109 (Page ID #692-707). Gryder identified Farrad and, while introducing the photos, noted that each photo had come from a Facebook account identified as \"Malik.Farrad.5,\" registered to a \"Malik Farrad\" with the email address \"AllaFarrad@gmail.com,\" and associated with Knoxville, Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-98 (Page ID #694-96). As Gryder explained, aside from the toilet-seat photo, all of the Facebook photos had been uploaded on October 11, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-104 (Page ID #697-702). Gryder further explained that he had visited Farrad's residence as part of his investigation and that he had learned that Farrad had occupied two different units in the same complex, first residing in Apartment 15 and then moving to Apartment 9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105 (Page ID #703). Gryder then identified Apartment 15 as the backdrop of several of the photos, noting an apparent match with the \"mirror in the bathroom, ... the color of the door, and the color of the walls,\" as well as with a distinctive paint job on \"the edge of [a] door frame.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107 (Page ID #705). The jury later learned from the property\n   manager of the apartment complex that Farrad had lived in Apartment 15 from February 6, 2013, until October 15, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20 (Page ID #717-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The jury also heard from Morristown police officer Kenneth Hinkle, who served as his department's armorer, had been a gunsmith \"for over 30 years,\" \"started apprenticing\" when he was thirteen years old, and had \"handled or worked on\" \"[t]housands\" of firearms over the years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124-25 (Page ID #722-23). With reference to the Facebook photos, a real Springfield XD .45 caliber handgun, and photos of a real Springfield XD .45 caliber handgun, Hinkle pointed out various commonalities that led him to conclude that the item in the Facebook photos was a real Springfield XD .45 caliber handgun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-46 (Page ID #724-44). These commonalities included, for example, distinctive symbols and markings on the gun's slide,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32 (Page ID #729-30), a common lever above the trigger guard and ridges across that lever,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 137 (Page ID #735), cocking serrations along the rear left side of the slide,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 139-40 (Page ID #737-38), and the shape and position of the firing pin on the rear of the slide,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-44 (Page ID #741-42).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appellant's App'x at 16-17, 26,\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 36, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hinkle then discussed the possibility of \"any replicas, toys, fakes, airsoft[ ]\" versions of the Springfield XD .45 caliber handgun. R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 146) (Page ID #744). Hinkle testified that he had \"not been able to locate, during any of [his] research, a toy, airsoft, BB firearm of the XD, XD series pistol in any caliber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government then asked if he knew whether Springfield had \"ever provided the licenses to manufacture an imitation of this firearm to another company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hinkle responded: \"No, sir, they have not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hinkle proceeded to compare the Facebook photos against real and photographic versions of what he testified was the nearest non-gun comparator to the Springfield XD .45 caliber handgun: an airsoft replica of a Springfield XD(m) .40 caliber handgun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-50 (Page ID #745-48). He noted, for example, distinctions between the muzzles, including the presence of an orange tip,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 151-52 (Page ID #749-50), and between the cocking serrations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 154-55 (Page ID #752-53). He compared the shape of the rear of the replica XD(m) .40 to the shape of the rear of the real XD .45 and the shape of the rear of the gun in the Facebook photos, noting that the former was angled along the side whereas the latter two were boxier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 155-58 (Page ID #753-56).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appellant's App'x at 16-17 (Facebook photos, boxy),\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-38 (real XD .45, boxy),\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-44 (replica XD(m) .40, trapezoidal). At the end of Hinkle's direct examination, Hinkle concluded that the two were \"totally different firearms\" and suggested again that the image in the photos must be \"an actual firearm\" because \"[t]hey never made an airsoft.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159 (Page ID #757). Although Farrad's attorney attempted to get Hinkle to admit on cross examination that he could not tell from photographs whether something was in fact a \"real firearm,\" Hinkle insisted that he could tell from the photographs alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169 (Page ID #767).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following Hinkle's testimony, the Government rested, and Farrad moved without argument for a directed verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186 (Page ID #784). Following the Government's equally cursory opposition and a brief recitation of the standard, the district court denied Farrad's motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187 (Page ID #785). Farrad did not testify, nor did the defense call any other witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 72 (Trial Tr. Vol. II at 7) (Page ID #795).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Closing arguments occurred on June 17, 2015. The Government began its closing argument by noting that the offense at issue was \"charged to have happened on or about October the 11th, 2013, ... because that was the date the vast majority of the photos ... were uploaded to Facebook by the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (Page ID #797). The Government argued that while it could not prove exactly when the photos were uploaded because \"Facebook strips all of that data out of the photographs that it receives when people upload them,\" Garrison's testimony \"based upon his training and experience\" was that \"when people are involved in criminal conduct and then they document that conduct in photos or videos, they're uploading it right away.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government also suggested that Garrison's testimony was \"in line with what we do on a daily basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (Page ID #798).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Farrad's trial counsel argued, meanwhile, that the Government's case was built on \"[p]ure speculation,\" and that people project false images of themselves all the time, for all sorts of reasons-for example, employing \"a sign out front that says this house is protected by a security system\" when in fact no such security system exists, or a sticker that says \"[t]his house protected by Smith &amp; Wesson\" when in fact no firearm exists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (Page ID #802-03). Defense counsel also emphasized that there was no physical evidence connecting Farrad to a real firearm, argued that the lack of physical evidence belied the Government's argument, and questioned whether the photos were clear enough or Hinkle believable enough to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the photos in fact showed a real firearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-21 (Page ID #805-09).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court then instructed the jury, noting among other directives that because \"[t]he indictment charges the crime happened on or about October 11, 2013, ... the government does not have to prove that the crime happened on that exact date, but the government must prove that the crime happened reasonably close to that date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33 (Page ID #821). Farrad summarily renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal after the jury had been excused for deliberations, which motion the district court again summarily denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45 (Page ID #832-33). The jury found Farrad guilty. R. 40 (Verdict Form) (Page ID #159).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sentencing and Motion for New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Prior to sentencing, the probation department determined that Farrad qualified as an armed career criminal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"the ACCA\") based on a Tennessee conviction for simple robbery and federal convictions for eight counts of distribution and intent to distribute crack cocaine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 53 (Revised Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") at 6-9) (Page ID #411-14). Farrad objected, arguing (among other issues) that the record did not establish that his eight drug-trafficking convictions were committed on different occasions, that the application of the ACCA to him at sentencing violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, and that his eight drug-trafficking convictions did not categorically qualify as serious drug offenses under the ACCA.

The jury heard that nearly all of the Facebook photos in evidence had been uploaded on that day (with the other having been uploaded four days earlier), R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 83, 99-104) (Page ID #681, 697-702), and the jury also heard Garrison's testimony that, in his training and experience, \"criminals specifically ... like to brag about their ... activities,\" and thus tend to upload inculpatory materials near in time to commission of criminal acts,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86 (Page ID 684). The jury also heard, however, that Facebook users \"can upload ... pictures to Facebook that were taken\" at any given time,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83 (Page ID #681), and that Facebook \"strips [a photograph's] metadata as the photograph is uploaded to Facebook,\" making it impossible to tell when an uploaded photo was actually taken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 89 (Page ID #687).

In other words, there was a potential gap of as long as eight months between when Farrad could have taken the photo and the date alleged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regardless of the merit of the date theory, however-a question on which we express no opinion-the undisputable problem here for Farrad is that his trial counsel never focused on this theory,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 17-21) (Page ID #802-11),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or filed any motions relating to it.

Accordingly, while the date issue is relevant to our opinion for reasons discussed below,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   section II.C.2\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , it is not an argument that could support relief here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Replica Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Farrad's trial counsel and appellate counsel both focused, instead, primarily on the replica theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 17-21) (Page ID #802-04); Appellant's Br. at 40-41. But there are two big problems with the replica theory-one general and legal, the other specific and factual-in Farrad's case. Even if Farrad could overcome the general and legal problem-an issue on which we express no ultimate opinion-the facts of his case doom the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The legal problem is this: Farrad is not the first person in our circuit to argue that what appears in images to be a gun is really a sophisticated replica, though he may be the first to argue it in this particular context. If a defendant is convicted of armed robbery, however, and claims the gun that witnesses saw was merely a convincing fake, reasonable jurors may infer-at least when corroborated by images or the testimony of a witness with law-enforcement experience-that the gun was real.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If Farrad is like the bank robber who later protests that what his victims saw was not real, his claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There are reasons to believe that Farrad might not be sufficiently comparable to the bank robber in this analogy. After all, in the armed-robber cases, there is a clear (if often unstated) reason why any reasonable juror could credit witness testimony and image-based evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a robber carried a real gun: robberies are violent and dangerous undertakings, and the fact that someone undertook to rob with what appears to be a weapon makes it somewhat more likely that they undertook to rob with an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   weapon.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Medved\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807500\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/935/#p940\">\n    905 F.2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 940 (6th Cir. 1990) (discussing the dangers that arise in an armed robbery regardless of whether a weapon is or merely appears real). For much the same reason, people who show up to book-club meetings usually bring real, rather than fake, copies of the assigned book; they\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   bring a fake copy with blank pages inside, but the point is generally to bring a real one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Facebook photos are, at least arguably, different. As Farrad's trial counsel noted in closing argument, R. 72 (Trial Tr. Vol. II at 14-15) (Page ID #802-03), people advertise false images of themselves all the time-putting signs on their doors suggesting that they have a fancy alarm system, a fierce guard dog, or a high-powered firearm that they do not in fact have. The Facebook poseur is in this sense not like the bank robber: his incentive is not necessarily to show a real gun, which is costlier, harder to procure, and, needless to say, more likely to subject its owner to criminal liability. The simple fact that a person is taking photos and posting them to Facebook does not necessarily allow the kind of behavior-based inference that armed robbery allows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In any event, however, the replica theory falters on the facts, because this is not a case in which a jury was asked to draw a conclusion from a few grainy or ill-lit photos, or asked to guess at an object out of focus or in the distance. Rather, the jury in Farrad's case saw seven different photos, all from different angles, some remarkably close-up and of seemingly high resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's App'x at 5-26. And it heard exceedingly meticulous testimony from Hinkle-pointing to, among other things, markings and serrations on the slide, a lever and ridges on the trigger guard, and the shape and position of the firing pin-that both (a) convincingly likened the item in the close-up photographs to a real Springfield XD .45, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 126-46) (Page ID #724-44), and (b) discredited the closest non-gun comparator that Hinkle could find,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 146-58 (Page ID #744-56). While images in a different case might be more suspicious, the combination of Hinkle's meticulous testimony and the plethora of photographic evidence here provided grounds for a rational juror to conclude that the item in the photos was in fact a real Springfield XD .45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Photoshop Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Farrad argues only briefly on appeal that the photos could have been manipulated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 40, and we can likewise deal with this theory quickly. In the abstract, the Photoshop theory raises some of the same concerns as the replica theory, given that a person seeking to project a (false) image of himself might well manipulate an image to make it look as if they were holding a firearm. (Similarly, a person wishing ill on another might manipulate an image to inculpate them.)

App'x 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (6th Cir. 2017), this case does not present those questions. The jury heard evidence that the photos in question came from a Facebook account registered to a Malik Farrad from Knoxville, Tennessee, and saw photos that appeared to show\n   Farrad in his own apartment-largely ruling out the possibility that this was the work of a forger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 96-98) (Page ID #694-96); Appellant's App'x at 11-14. Farrad's trial counsel, meanwhile, never cross-examined a witness on potential alteration of the images, presented any evidence to that effect, or argued that theory to the jury. This theory is, accordingly, not a winning one for Farrad on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Lookalike Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Similar defects apply to the lookalike theory. Farrad adverts to this argument only briefly as well, asserting that \"the pictures did not clearly disclose who, if anyone, was holding a gun.\" Appellant's Br. at 41. But again, the jury heard that personal details of the Facebook account that posted the photos matched Farrad's personal details, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 96-98) (Page ID #694-96); saw photos that looked like Farrad, Appellant's App'x at 11-14; heard and saw evidence suggesting that the photos were taken in an apartment belonging to Farrad, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 105) (Page ID #703); Appellant's App'x at 19-20, 22-23, 25-28; and heard a defense theory that all but admitted that Farrad was the person in the photos, R. 72 (Trial Tr. Vol. II at 15) (Page ID #803) (\"Maybe it's a case of where Mr. Farrad needed to let the world know that he could protect himself, let them think that he can.\"). The jury could easily infer as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With Farrad's trial and appellate counsel having eschewed the date theory, Farrad's sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge must rise and fall with the replica, Photoshop, and lookalike theories. But the number and detail of the photos, coupled with Hinkle's meticulous testimony and other corroborating details (such as the appearance of Farrad's apartment), render each uniquely ill-suited to Farrad's specific case. We therefore reject Farrad's sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge on the record and arguments before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The rest is up to the jury.\" (quoting 5 JACK B. WEINSTEIN ET AL., WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE \u00b6 901(a), at 901-19 (1996) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This task can be accomplished in a number of ways-with testimony from someone with knowledge of the evidence offered, for example, or by pointing to distinctive characteristics that establish authenticity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID . 901(b)(1), (4). Some items, however, \"are self-authenticating; they require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted.\" FED. R. EVID. 902. This category of self-authenticating evidence includes \"certified domestic records of a regularly conducted activity\"-that is, a business \"record that meets the requirements of Rule 803(6)(A)-(C),\" so long as properly certified by a \"custodian or other qualified person\" and so long as the evidence is subject to challenge by the opposing party. FED. R. EVID. 902(11). The relevant portion of Rule 803 encompasses:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (A) the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   FED. R. EVID. 803(6)(A)-(C). The final two prongs in Rule 803(6), in turn, complete the set of prerequisites for Rule 803(6)'s exception to the rule against hearsay: the first three conditions must have been demonstrated by a qualifying certification from an authorized source, FED. R. EVID. 803(6)(D), and the opponent must not have \"show[n] that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness,\" FED. R. EVID. 803(6)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that the Government secured the requisite certification from Facebook to qualify the photos as self-authenticating business records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 26-1 (Facebook Certification) (Page ID #105); R. 60 (Pretrial Conf. Tr. at 11) (Page ID #456). Instead, the principal question is whether the images qualified as self-authenticating business records at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farrad argues, as he did to the district\n   court, that they did not so qualify, given that Facebook could not authenticate \"who took the pictures, when the pictures were taken, by whom or at what time, what they actually showed.\" Appellant's Br. at 30;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   R. 60 (Pretrial Conf. Tr. at 11) (Page ID #456). The district court disagreed. R. 73 (Pretrial Hr'g Tr. at 33) (Page ID #872).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Farrad is right, the question becomes whether the evidence would have been admissible for some other reason, or whether the error was in any event harmless to the outcome.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052354\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/326/#p334\">\n    626 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (6th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   No opinion in this circuit has spoken directly to the proper standard for assessing the admissibility of photographs taken from an online social-media platform like Facebook. After reviewing analogous cases from inside this circuit and persuasive authority from other circuits, we conclude that the district court was correct to admit the photos, but that it should have done so under a more traditional standard: regular authentication under Rule 901.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   One small issue is worth addressing at the outset: whether, as Farrad has argued throughout, the \"pictures of guns were all out-of-court 'statements' that Farrad illegally possessed a firearm\" and thus hearsay. Appellant's Br. at 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 60 (Pretrial Conf. Tr. at 11) (Page ID #456). They were not. Farrad is correct, of course, that hearsay is any out of court statement \"offer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\" FED. R. EVID. 801(c), and that hearsay encompasses \"nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion,\" FED. R. EVID. 801(a). A paradigmatic case of such nonverbal assertive conduct is \"the act of pointing to identify a suspect in a lineup.\" FED. R. EVID. 801 advisory committee's note to 1972 proposed rules. And as Farrad points out, Appellant's Br. at 34, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496025\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/301/\">\n    588 F.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2009), we ruled that a video in which a doctor demonstrated the correct way to perform nerve-block injections qualified as hearsay, given that it was offered to show that the defendant had performed such injections incorrectly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496025\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496025\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/301/\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But demonstrating a particular procedure for the purpose of showing whether another has erred is more intrinsically and specifically assertive than simply appearing (or having one's possessions appear) in a photo, even if it may be true in some philosophical sense that posing for a photograph does itself encode the general sentiment: here I am. In any case, as the Government notes, Appellee's Br. at 32, even if the photos\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   statements, they would have (so long as authenticated) qualified as statements of a party opponent and thus were not hearsay all the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID. 801(d)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The question, then, is the central one: the authentication of the photos. Although it did not discuss the business-records exception, the closest analogue from our precedents is\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n    701 F. App'x 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2017) -a case that itself illustrates that the business-records exception was not necessary to admit the photos here. The defendant in\n   that case, Jabron Thomas, was charged with armed bank robbery, and he was identified at trial in part through photos obtained from Facebook and another social-media platform, Instagram.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n    at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He argued that the photos \"could not be authenticated and were thus inadmissible in part because [the investigator who obtained them] admitted that he did not know who created the Facebook page or whether the Facebook page itself was authentic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n    at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We turned that argument aside, however, noting that there was simply enough evidence presented \"to support a finding that the [photograph] [was] what the proponent claim[ed] it to be.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting FED. R. EVID. 901(a) ). The photos \"appeared to show Thomas with distinctive tattoos\" and clothing, which was enough given that \"the government was not seeking to authenticate Jabron Thomas's [or any] Facebook page or Instagram page (nor any of the factual information contained therein, such as Thomas's workplace)[,] and the government was not even necessarily presenting the photographs as 'pictures of Jabron Thomas'-the jury was free to consider the photographs as identifying Thomas or not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given that there was sufficient evidence that the photos were what they were claimed to be, in short, we ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in admitting them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n    at 419-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   That rationale is all that is needed to resolve the ultimate question here. As already mentioned above, not only did the details of the account match Farrad, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 96-98) (Page ID #694-96), but more importantly, the photos appeared to show Farrad, his tattoos, and (perhaps most probatively) distinctive features of Farrad's apartment, as confirmed by police investigation, R. 71 (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 105) (Page ID #703); Appellant's App'x at 6, 11-14, 19-20, 22-23, 25-28. The Government was at most seeking to introduce these photos as evidence uploaded by a particular Facebook account that tended to show Farrad in possession of a real gun; the photos were not, however, offered as definitive and irrebuttable proof.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 60 (Pretrial Conf.

In short, while there were still questions about the photos that merited probing, those questions were not so glaring as to prevent the photos from clearing the relatively lower hurdle of authentication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405258\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/414/#p419\">\n    701 F.

Vol. I at 84-87) (Page ID #682-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The ultimate set of questions is whether the district court abused its discretion in finding Garrison's nonscientific testimony, over Farrad's repeated objections, R. 71 (Trial Tr.

Relevance is easy for the Government: one of the necessary questions for the jury was whether Farrad had possessed a firearm \"on or about\" the dates that he uploaded the Facebook photos,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 3 (Indictment) (Page ID #3), and to the extent Garrison could offer evidence based on his training and experience that it was indeed \"more likely\" that a criminal's Facebook upload follows hot on the heels of an actus reus,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 71 (Trial Tr.

Following our framing from\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   , because Garrison lacked \"formal training that would allow [him] to testify from a scientific standpoint,\" in order for his \"testimony to be admissible, a foundation would have to have been laid based upon [Garrison's] firsthand familiarity with\" criminal social-media habits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516050\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1342/#p1349\">\n    25 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If Garrison's initial testimony were all that we had to go on, such a foundation might well have been established.

Farrad may, again, seek post-conviction relief under \u00a7 2255 based on any potential failure by trial counsel to discover the replicas and use them to impeach Hinkle's testimony at trial, but the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Farrad's motion for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

It is clearly \"possible to discern when [each] offense ended and the subsequent point at which the [next] offense began,\" just as it is clearly possible that Farrad \"could have withdrawn from crime after [each] offense ended and not committed the [next] offense,\" despite the fact that each was in the context of an ongoing conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Pham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266212\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/799/#p802\">\n    872 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   802 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This challenge thus fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Third and finally, Farrad argues that his federal drug-trafficking convictions cannot count as ACCA predicates because he was convicted in absentia. This argument, Farrad concedes, Appellant's Br. at 58-59, is to be reviewed only for plain error in light of Farrad's failure to raise it in the district court. The problem for Farrad is that there is no evidence that Farrad was in fact impermissibly convicted in absentia. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(c) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A defendant who was initially present at trial, or who had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, waives the right to be present under the following circumstances:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   (A) when the defendant is voluntarily absent after the trial has begun, regardless of whether the court informed the defendant of an obligation to remain during trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (B) in a noncapital case, when the defendant is voluntarily absent during sentencing; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (C) when the court warns the defendant that it will remove the defendant from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, but the defendant persists in conduct that justifies removal from the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   FED.

The parties disagree about the standard of review: Farrad argues that we should use the normal standard-de novo for law, clear error for facts,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pacheco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174347\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/384/#p389\">\n    841 F.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (6th Cir. 2016) -while the Government argues that plain error applies.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 63,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. at 51-52. This disagreement stems from the procedural history. After Farrad moved for suppression pro se, R. 22 (Pro Se Mot. at 3-4) (Page ID #87-88), the magistrate judge denied Farrad's motion because he was already represented by counsel, R. 24 (Order at 1) (Page ID #93), and Farrad's trial counsel did not renew the motion. Farrad argues that because the magistrate judge nevertheless had discretion to consider Farrad's pro se motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   E.D. Tenn. Local Rule 83.4(c), the district court's ruling amounted to a denial of his motion on the merits. Appellant's Br. at 63-64. The Government argues against such an inference and adds that plain-error review should apply regardless because Farrad's argument on appeal is different from the argument in his pro se motion. Appellee's Br. at 52 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Government is correct: plain-error review applies. Its second rationale is true only in large part; Farrad makes several arguments against the warrant, and all but one went unmade below.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   R. 22 (Pro Se Mot. at 3-4) (Page ID #87-88) (arguing that evidence relied on to secure search warrant was fruit of illegal search and seizure),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 64-69 (arguing (1) that \"affidavit was facially insufficient,\" (2) that \"execution was facially flawed,\" and (3) that affidavit was \"fruit of the poisonous tree\"). Having not been raised in Farrad's pro se motion, Farrad's first two arguments clearly qualify only for plain-error review.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez-Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672790\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/724/#p739\">\n    461 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (6th Cir. 2006). But more foundationally, the magistrate judge's very brief order denying Farrad's pro se motion was clearly based on the procedural problem of having a defendant with counsel filing pro se motions, and nothing in that order discussed the merits or suggested that Farrad's trial counsel could not immediately file a comparable motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 24 (Order at 1-2) (Page ID #93-94). Although the magistrate judge's order does not use the words \"without prejudice,\" any fair reading of it suggests as much.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robert N. Clemens Tr. v. Morgan Stanley DW, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077287\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/840/#p845\">\n    485 F.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (6th Cir. 2007) (presuming, based on different circumstances, that \"the district court must have intended to dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice\" (emphasis added) ). In short, if the district court was to review this motion on the merits, it was for Farrad's trial counsel to renew the motion. Because trial counsel did not, review here is entirely for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The district court did not, in turn, plainly err in failing to order suppression of its own accord. First, with regard to Farrad's argument that the warrant application was facially deficient, Appellant's Br. at 64-65, Farrad has not provided sufficient grounds to conclude that the issuing judge erred in granting the application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p236\">\n    462 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p236\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p236\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (\"A magistrate's determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ), let alone that the executing officer's reliance on that decision was objectively unreasonable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The warrant application established not only that Farrad had been convicted of a felony and that various individuals had reported seeing him armed, but also that law enforcement had come across a photograph on what appeared to be Farrad's Facebook page showing what appeared to be three handguns. R. 5-1 (Warrant Application at 3-4) (Page ID #9-10). That was a colorable basis for the district court to assume good-faith reliance in the absence of a renewed motion. And while Farrad is correct that the application was inartfully worded with regard to the location of what was to be searched,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   R. 5-1 (Warrant Application at 1) (Page ID #7) (providing, in response to prompt for location of \"person or property\" to be searched, both that reviewer should \"See Attachment A\" and that it was \"located in the Eastern District of Tennessee\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Page ID #17) (Attachment A, providing that \"[t]his warrant applies to information ... that is stored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Facebook, a company headquartered in Menlo Park, California\"), for the district judge\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to have faulted the affidavit on that ground would have been the apotheosis of \"interpreting [an affidavit] in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner\"-exactly what the Supreme Court has directed courts not to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p236\">\n    462 U.S. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p236\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). There was certainly no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   There was also no plain error based on improper execution. Farrad seems to aim this challenge in part at the fact that the warrant provides for execution \"on or before November 6, 2013,\" R. 5-4 (Search and Seizure Warrant at 1) (Page ID #25), whereas Facebook's certification is dated April 17, 2015, R. 26-1 (Facebook Certification) (Page ID #105).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 66. But this argument appears to conflate the date of a private third party's evidentiary certification with the date of the Government's warrant execution. Indeed, the return form certified by the executing officer makes clear that the warrant was \"served electronically\" on Facebook on November 1, 2013, regardless of whether Facebook responded right away. R. 5-4 (Search and Seizure Warrant at 2) (Page ID #26). While a\n   <em>\n    search\n   </em>\n   made by a private entity \"act[ing] at the direction of law enforcement agents ... must comport with the Fourth Amendment,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Farrad again points to no authority to suggest that a federal magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee could not permissibly issue a warrant to search electronic records bearing on a suspected in-district crime that were located in another district, and indeed federal law appears to allow exactly that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication ... pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures\n   described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ... by a court of competent jurisdiction.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2711(3)(A)(i) (defining a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" as \"any district court of the United States (including a magistrate judge of such a court) or any United States court of appeals that ... has jurisdiction over the offense being investigated\"). There was, accordingly, no plain error here either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Finally, Farrad argues that \"[t]he search warrant was obtained with illegally obtained evidence and anything received as a result of that search warrant would be 'fruit of the poisonous tree.' \" Appellant's Br. at 67. But in addition to the fact (noted above) that Farrad has pointed to no record evidence to support his assertions regarding an illegal search, Farrad's claim also fails because there is no mention in the affidavit of the ostensibly illegal search to which Farrad alludes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 5-1 (Warrant Application at 3-4) (Page ID #9-10). Thus, while the district court (if presented with the issue) could have conceivably \"look[ed] beyond the four corners of the warrant affidavit to information that was known to the officer and revealed to the issuing magistrate\" to assess good-faith reliance,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the extent that Farrad seeks to argue that Tennessee robbery is not a violent felony under the ACCA, Appellant's Br. at 53, his claim is doomed by binding circuit precedent regardless.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Southers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275479\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/364/#p366\">\n     866 F.3d at 366-69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To the extent he challenges the conviction based on the fact that he was only seventeen years old when he was arrested for that crime, Appellant's Br. at 52-53, that argument also fails under binding circuit precedent given that Farrad was evidently convicted and sentenced as an adult.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

There was, in other words, no plain error on either of these grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    As noted above, Farrad also discusses a potential ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim here.
