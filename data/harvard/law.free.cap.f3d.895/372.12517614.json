The district court instead determined that Erickson's time to file began to run on June 30, 2014-30 days after the state appellate court's May 29, 2014 opinion on remand, and when his period for filing a petition for a PDR on that issue expired. Despite its contrary position in the district court, the State now concedes that Erickson's petition was timely, and it agrees that the district court's judgment should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 relevantly provides that a prisoner in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court must file his \u00a7 2254 application within one year from \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). This limitation period is tolled during the pendency of \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(d)(2). When granting Erickson's COA, this court explained that \"our precedent indicates both that a conviction becomes final 30 days after the final ruling of a Texas court of appeals when a petitioner does not file a PDR and that a conviction becomes final 90 days after the final ruling of the TCCA when a petitioner does not file a petition for writ of certiorari, [but] it does not indicate which date is controlling when they conflict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although this court has not directly addressed this issue,\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Cockrell\n   </em>\n   is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , this court explained that \"a decision becomes final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9332915\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/690/#p694\">\n    319 F.3d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 (5th Cir. 2003) (internal quotations omitted). And because \"direct review includes a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court[,] ... the conclusion of direct review is when the Supreme Court either rejects the petition for certiorari or rules on its merits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9332915\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/690/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v.

Finally, \"[i]f the conviction does not become final by the conclusion of direct review, it becomes final by the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9332915\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/690/#p694\">\n    319 F.3d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. Thaler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    565 U.S. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, although Erickson's time to seek any further relief in state court expired on June 30, 2014-30 days after the state appellate court's opinion on remand-his time to seek relief in the Supreme Court as to the TCCA's denial of his PDR had not yet expired. Erickson's option to file, and time for filing, a writ of certiorari was not affected by the TCCA's grant of the State's PDR. That Erickson did not actually file a petition for certiorari is insignificant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9332915\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/690/#p694\">\n    319 F.3d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the date which Erickson's conviction became final, and the date that must be used to calculate Erickson's one-year deadline for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition, is July 16, 2014-90 days after the TCCA refused his PDR on April 16, 2014. The one-year period was tolled for 133 days, from January 22, 2015 until June 3, 2015, during the pendency of his state habeas application.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Erickson's \u00a7 2254 petition was therefore due on or before November 25, 2015. Because Erickson filed the application on November 12, 2015, his \u00a7 2254 application was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for proceedings on Erickson's habeas petition.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
