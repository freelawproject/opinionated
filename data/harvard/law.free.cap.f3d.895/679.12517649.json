Pepe was convicted of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places, and sentenced to prison for 210 years. The version of the statute under which he was convicted applied to a U.S. citizen \"who travels in foreign commerce, and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2005). Pepe's illicit sexual conduct occurred between three and nine months after his return to Cambodia following a brief trip to the United States to visit family and attend his daughter's wedding. Pepe contends that the statutory language didn't encompass his conduct because, as a resident of Cambodia, he had ceased \"travel[ing] in foreign commerce.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pepe's contention runs up against our previous conclusion that the statute \"does not require that the conduct occur\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   traveling in foreign commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936317\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/1100/#p1107\">\n    435 F.3d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (9th Cir. 2006). Focusing on the word \"and,\" which connected the travel with the conduct, we construed \u00a7 2423(c) to include individuals who, like Pepe, at some point traveled in foreign commerce\n   <em>\n    and thereafter\n   </em>\n   engaged in any illicit sexual conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, Congress subsequently amended the statute to add a new basis for criminal liability. The statute now applies to a U.S. citizen \"who travels in foreign commerce\n   <em>\n    or resides, either temporarily or permanently, in a foreign country\n   </em>\n   , and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2018) (emphasis added). From the statutory amendment, as well as the accompanying legislative history, it is evident that \u00a7 2423(c) was previously inapplicable to U.S. citizens living abroad unless they were traveling-meaning something more than being in transit-when they had illicit sex. Because this subsequent Congressional pronouncement is clearly irreconcilable with our prior construction of the statute, we are not bound by our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government appears to contest that Pepe relocated to Cambodia, but this factual dispute was not resolved below because the district court applied\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   . However, if Pepe resided in Cambodia and was no longer \"traveling,\" then the prior version of \u00a7 2423(c) does not apply to him. We therefore vacate his convictions and sentence and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pepe, a 49-year-old U.S. citizen, left the United States for Cambodia in March 2003 on a one-way ticket. He rented a house, obtained a Cambodian driver's license, bought a car, and secured employment teaching management at a university in Phnom Penh. Pepe \"married\" a Cambodian citizen, Bith Chanry, and the two of them lived together for a while.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also became involved in community activities, such as the Phnom Penh Veterans of Foreign Wars Post and the local Catholic church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pepe occasionally traveled to the United States to visit his family. His last such trip prior to his arrest was to Los Angeles for a week in August 2005 to attend his daughter's wedding. Nearly a year after his return to Cambodia, in June 2006, local authorities took him into custody and searched his home based on information from American officials that a girl had reported him sexually abusing her. He spent seven months in a Cambodian prison and then was handed over to U.S. authorities, who brought him to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pepe was indicted on seven counts of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places between three and nine months following his return to Cambodia from the wedding. He moved to dismiss the indictment and suppress evidence taken from his home and examined in Singapore and the United States. The district court denied each of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Pepe met a prostitute, Basang, at Sharkey Bar in Phnom Penh about five years before his arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pepe paid Basang for sex several times, but she worked for him primarily by procuring girls around 10-12 years old for sex. Basang gave the girls' families money from Pepe in exchange. Pepe paid Basang's rent and gave her $300 to help pay for her parents' gravestones. Basang also translated for him-the girls and their mothers spoke little or no English, and he could not communicate in the languages that they spoke, Khmer and Vietnamese.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The girls, six of whom testified at trial, lived with Pepe at various times for a few days to several weeks. Basang taught the girls to massage and orally copulate Pepe while he and they were naked. After the girls did this, Pepe would give them a dollar bill. In addition, he forcibly raped each of the girls at least once; some, three times or more. Often, when raping a girl for the first time, Pepe or Basang would give the girl a sedative and Pepe would tie her legs to his bed with a rope. If the girl screamed when she awoke, he would slap her, tape her mouth, or cover her head with a pillow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury convicted Pepe on all seven counts. The district court sentenced him to consecutive 30-year sentences for a total of 210 years in prison. In addition, the court ordered him to pay $247,213 in restitution to two Cambodian non-governmental organizations, Hagar and Agape, on the victims' behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the contrary, throughout the proceedings Pepe has maintained that \"he was indeed a resident of Cambodia who had demonstrated a 'permanent intent to resettle' in that country.\" In moving to dismiss the indictment, Pepe represented to the district court that he had \"permanently relocated to Cambodia\" in 2003, more than two years before the conduct at issue.

Given Pepe's claim that he was residing in Cambodia on a permanent basis, we fail to see the relevance of the dissent's contention that the statute has always applied to persons residing abroad temporarily. If the statute did not apply to U.S. citizens permanently living overseas, Pepe's conviction cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The dissent's only response is that Pepe should have raised his statutory argument in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 692 n.1, 694. In fact, he did. The district court understood Pepe to argue that \"he was no longer traveling at the time he allegedly engaged in illicit sexual conduct, because he permanently resided in Cambodia.\" The district court rejected this argument on the ground that Pepe \"did not have to be traveling at the time he engaged in illicit sexual conduct in order to be liable under \u00a7 2423(c).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But even if Pepe didn't present his precise statutory argument to the district court, there was no reason for him to do so.

There was no error, much less plain error, in the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment on an unasserted theory of statutory construction, nor in the district court not\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   instructing the jury on a theory not asserted at trial and not viable under applicable case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, under\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , the prior version of \u00a7 2423(c) applies to Pepe, as the majority concedes. There is nothing in the 2013 amendments that is \"clearly irreconcilable\" with\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   . Thus, it remains good law, binding on this panel, and requires affirmance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Before the district court, he only argued that \"the principles of statutory construction require[ ] that the prohibited conduct in \u00a7 2423(c) occur soon after the travel.\" He did not rest his statutory argument on his alleged intent to resettle-a contention that was vigorously disputed by the United States given his written statements to the Cambodian government that he intended to live his life in the United States, a letter to his family that he intended to return to the United States to live, and a letter to his storage facility in Colorado that gave his permanent address as Oxnard, California and stating that he would be traveling in and out of the country. He claimed to have permanently resettled solely in the context of his constitutional challenges to Congressional authority. The district court never resolved the factual question of whether or not Pepe had permanently resettled in Cambodia.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    I am not necessarily persuaded that there is a meaningful conflict between\n    <em>\n     Clark\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Schmidt\n    </em>\n    . The\n    <em>\n     Clark\n    </em>\n    panel was only confronted with the argument that foreign travel-and thus the reach of the statute-terminated on arrival in the foreign country. It did not specifically construe the term \"foreign travel\" in determining that the statute applied after a citizen's arrival in a foreign country. But that question is, in my mind, irrelevant because the holding is the same in both cases, even if there is some difference in rationale.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    I see no merit in Pepe's other assertions on appeal, but there is no reason to discuss them given that the majority opinion is confined to a single issue on which it bases the reversal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
