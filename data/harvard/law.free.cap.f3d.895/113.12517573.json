An administrative law judge later reduced the citation fine, concluding that\n   Consolidation Coal's breach of its roof control plan, with the resulting roof collapse, was not a \"significant and substantial\" safety violation. On administrative review, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission deadlocked two-to-two on the issue, leaving the administrative law judge's decision as the final agency decision. Because the administrative law judge's decision relied critically on types of evidence long foreclosed by Commission precedent, we vacate the decisions of the Commission and the administrative law judge and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (\"Mine Act\"), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promulgate mandatory mining safety standards, to inspect mines, and to issue citations and civil penalties for violations of those safety standards.

While there, Ratliff noticed that a portion of the mine's roof had collapsed in\n   a crosscut between two entry points. According to the mine's foreman, the roof had collapsed while they were cutting a piece of rock from the area, dislodging \"a couple of [roof] bolts\" and breaking the mining machine's conveyor chain. J.A. 113. Because the roof in this portion of the mine contained several pre-existing cracks, the mine's roof control plan limited miners to a cut of no more than 20 feet at a time. On closer inspection, Ratliff noticed that the cut of rock from this area appeared to exceed 20 feet-the maximum depth permitted under such adverse roof conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By the time Ratliff discovered the collapse, the miners were already in the process of bolting the unsupported roof down. When they finished, Ratliff measured the cut and, as suspected, found that it exceeded the permissible 20-foot depth, measuring 23.5 feet from the last row of roof bolts. Based on this evidence, Ratliff issued a citation to the Consolidation Coal Company, the mine's owner and operator, for violation of the mine's roof control plan. Because the violation \"expose[d] miners to the hazards associated with roof falls,\" the inspector also concluded that the violation was \"significant and substantial\" and set a fine of $3,405. J.A. 40, 127-128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Consolidation Coal contested the citation in a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"). The ALJ agreed with Inspector Ratliff that the cut exceeded the depth permitted under the company's approved roof control plan and so violated a mandatory safety standard. But the ALJ also ruled that the resulting hazard was not \"significant and substantial\" because, in her view, it was not reasonably likely to result in injury, as required by the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Mathies\n   </em>\n   test. The judge rested her finding of no reasonable likelihood of injury on four factual findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1) Miners were unlikely to access the area of unsupported roof because \"they work a substantial distance back\" and \"are not permitted to enter the 'red zone' beyond the next-to-last row of bolts.\" J.A. 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2) The miners that did access this area would only do so under the protection of coal excavation equipment (in the case of employees working on the mine's ventilation) or an Automated Temporary Roof Support (ATRS) system (in the case of miners installing additional roof bolts). J.A. 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3) The mine employed a tighter roof bolting pattern in the area, decreasing \"the likelihood that a roof fall originating in the extended cut would be able to spread into or significantly affect the bolted roof areas behind it.\" J.A. 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4) Miners were already bolting the unsupported roof when the inspector arrived, leaving mine employees subject to the hazard for only a short period of time. J.A. 43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on those findings, the ALJ reduced the fine from $3,405 to $1,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the Secretary sought administrative review of this decision, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission came to an impasse. Two Commissioners concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's findings. And two Commissioners voted to reverse, concluding that the ALJ impermissibly relied on Consolidation Coal's compliance with other, different safety measures, rather than focusing on the hazard resulting specifically from the roof plan violation. They also concluded that the ALJ had ignored record evidence about miners who needed to enter the area potentially affected by the roof collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The two-to-two division of the Commissioners made the ALJ's ruling the final agency decision. The Secretary then petitioned this court for review, arguing that\n   the ALJ impermissibly relied on redundant safety measures and miner precaution in concluding that the violation was not \"significant and substantial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the outset, we are met with Consolidation Coal's argument that we cannot entertain the Secretary's objections because they were not argued before the ALJ, but instead were raised for the first time on appeal to the Commission. Both law and logic foreclose that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a matter of logic, the Secretary's objections speak to alleged flaws in the ALJ's decision itself. The Secretary argues that, in finding no significant and substantial safety violation, the ALJ relied on legally irrelevant factual findings. Having not been warned in advance by Consolidation Coal's arguments that the ALJ might run afoul of Commission precedent in her analysis, the Secretary could hardly be expected to point out the legal errors in the ALJ's decision before that decision issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fortunately, the law here points in that same logical direction. The Mine Act limits this court to objections raised \"before the Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20816\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The statute says nothing about judicial review of objections not raised before the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To be sure, the Mine Act generally limits discretionary petitions for Commission review to questions of fact or law upon which the ALJ has \"been afforded an opportunity to pass,\" unless the petitioning party can show \"good cause\" for failing to raise the issue below.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20823\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). But the Commission also retains the right to review an ALJ's decision\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   if the judge acts \"contrary to law or Commission policy\" or the decision raises \"a novel question of policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20823\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 823(d)(2)(B). That\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   review requires the vote of only two Commissioners,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20823\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which functionally occurred in this case when the two Commissioners favoring reversal pointed to the ALJ's erroneous reliance on redundant safety measures and miner caution. Given that, our review comports with the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On top of all that, ALJs have an independent obligation \"to apply Commission precedent to the legal issue raised\" regardless of whether the Secretary expressly directs them to it.\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Labor v. San Juan Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20FMSHRC%20125\">\n    29 FMSHRC 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 129 (2007) (\"To conclude that the judge was bound to consider only the factors that the Secretary explicitly discussed in her brief, even where the evidence clearly demonstrates the relevance of other factors, would impermissibly constrain the judge's responsibility to apply Commission precedent to the legal issue raised on the facts developed in the record.\"). The ALJ's failure to walk the correct legal path is subject to Commission review as long as the misstep is \"implicitly\" raised or is \"so intertwined with an element tried\" that \"it may properly be considered on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20FMSHRC%20125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20FMSHRC%20125\">\n    at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the ALJ's refusal to consider one prong of the applicable test in\n   <em>\n    San Juan Coal Company\n   </em>\n   , the relevance in this case of alternative safety measures and miner precaution was inherently bound up in the Secretary's argument that the roof control violation was likely to result in injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Secretary's objection that the ALJ, in finding no reasonable likelihood of\n   injury, impermissibly relied on redundant safety measures is well taken. The ALJ's critical fact findings involved Consolidation Coal's compliance with other required safety standards, such as the ATRS system. The ALJ also relied on miners to protect themselves by avoiding the area under the unsecured roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ample Commission precedent holds that such considerations are irrelevant to the likelihood-of-injury analysis. That is because the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Mathies\n   </em>\n   test focuses on the risk of injury created by the safety violation itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Labor v.

Once the ATRS system and miner self-protection are backed out of the ALJ's analysis, the only the remaining factors cited by the ALJ for finding no substantial or significant violation were the tighter roof bolting system and the short duration of the hazard.
