The issue is whether condominium association (\"CA\") assessments that become due after a debtor has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code are discharged upon confirmation of the plan. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). We conclude that such assessments are dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and, accordingly, reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are not in dispute. Goudelock purchased a condominium unit in Redmond, Washington in 2001. Her deed was subject to a declaration of covenants and restrictions (the \"Declaration\") that was recorded against the property in 1978. The Declaration provides that Sixty-01, a CA, may charge property owners assessments for monthly fees and for maintenance, repairs, and capital improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Declaration grants Sixty-01 two methods for collecting unpaid assessments. It provides that all unpaid assessments: (1) constitute a lien on the condominium unit, enforceable through foreclosure; and (2) create a personal obligation through which Sixty-01 can bring suit for damages against the owner of the condominium unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Goudelock stopped paying the CA assessments in 2009 and Sixty-01 sought to enforce its lien by initiating foreclosure proceedings in state court. Goudelock moved out of her condominium unit and, in March of 2011, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. As part of her Chapter 13 plan, Goudelock surrendered the condominium unit. Sixty-01 filed a proof of claim attesting to $18,780.39 in unpaid CA assessments and noted that they continued to accrue at a monthly rate of $388.46. Before the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court, Sixty-01 canceled the foreclosure sale because the mortgage lender paid the outstanding assessments. The condominium unit sat unoccupied until February 26, 2015, when the mortgage lender foreclosed on it. On July 24, 2015, Goudelock completed her plan obligations and received a discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, in April of 2015, Sixty-01 had brought suit in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington to determine the dischargeability of Goudelock's personal obligation to pay the post-petition CA assessments that had accrued between March 2011 (when Goudelock filed her Chapter 13 petition) and February 2015 (when the condominium unit was foreclosed upon). The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in Sixty-01's favor, concluding that the post-petition CA assessments \"were not dischargeable because they arose at the time of their assessment and were an incidence of legal ownership of the burdened property.\"\n   <em>\n    Goudelock v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   No circuit court of appeals has addressed the dischargeability of CA assessments that have become due after the filing of a Chapter 13 petition. There are, however, two appellate decisions addressing the dischargeability of similar post-petition assessments under Chapter 7. Moreover, a number of lower courts have imported the teachings of these two appellate decisions under Chapter 7 to the dischargeability of post-petition association assessments under Chapter 13. The two appellate decisions (and their progeny) represent polar opposite positions and their applicability to Chapter 13 cases is the starting point of our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rosteck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532619,6120917\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/694/\">\n    899 F.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1990), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that the obligation to pay CA assessments was an unmatured contingent debt under the Bankruptcy Code that arose prepetition (when the debtors purchased the property) and that merely became mature when the assessments became due post-petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532619,6120917\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/694/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532619,6120917\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/694/\">\n    at 696-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Takings Clause and Notions of Equity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties raise two additional arguments that warrant brief discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Sixty-01 contends that, because it asserts that the personal obligation to pay CA assessments is a real property interest stemming from the Declaration, the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prohibits the government from discharging the obligation. The Takings Clause provides that \"private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. Sixty-01 argues just that-that the discharge of the post-petition CA assessments would amount to a taking of a substantial property right without just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This argument fails.

Many of these arguments turn on whether the debtor relinquishes his or her property or remains in possession of it post-petition. However, there is no legal basis for distinguishing between whether Goudelock retained possession of her condominium unit post-petition and, thus, continued to enjoy the benefit of occupancy at\n   no cost, or, instead, surrendered it at some point.

In Washington, condominiums formed before 1990 are subject to the Horizontal Property Regimes Act (\"HPRA\"), codified at RCW \u00a7 64.32. Condominiums formed\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    July 1, 1990, are subject to the Washington Condominium Act (\"WCA\"), codified at RCW \u00a7 64.34, which was modeled after the Uniform Condominium Act. However, certain provisions of the newer WCA apply to pre-1990 condominiums. As relevant here, the WCA specifies that its provision governing a lien for assessments, RCW \u00a7 64.34.364, applies to pre-1990 condominiums \"with respect to events and circumstances occurring after July 1, 1990,\" though it does not \"invalidate or supersede existing, inconsistent provisions of the declaration.\" RCW \u00a7 64.34.010. Because Goudelock acquired her condominium in 2001, all events relating thereto necessarily occurred after July 1, 1990. Thus, to the extent that it is consistent with the Declaration, RCW \u00a7 64.34 defines the contours of the lien arising from Goudelock's unpaid assessments. Here, the Declaration and the WCA are consistent. Like the Declaration, the WCA establishes that an association \"has a lien on a unit for any unpaid assessments levied against a unit from the time the assessment is due.\" RCW \u00a7 64.34.364(1). The WCA also provides that \"[i]n addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment shall be the joint and several obligation of the owner or owners of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due.\" RCW \u00a7 64.34.364(12).
