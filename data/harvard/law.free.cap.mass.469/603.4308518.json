The defendant appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Letkowski, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 847 (2013). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, limited to issues concerning the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights as set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-445 (1966), at trial. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his Miranda rights were improper. We conclude also, however, that in the particular circumstances of this case, the improper references, which were not objected to at trial, did not raise a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>The jury could have found the following. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on April 17, 2006, the victim, a student at a college in Springfield, drove from her off-campus job and entered the parking lot of her campus dormitory. When she pulled into the parking lot, she noticed the defendant walking on the sidewalk near one of the dormitories. The victim parked her car. While she was collecting her belongings from it, the defendant approached her and asked whether she knew where a set of nearby dormitories was located. After answering him, the victim returned to gathering her belongings; when she turned around again, the defendant had a knife in his hand and ordered the victim back into her car. He then ordered the victim to give him one hundred dollars, but she told him that she did not have that much money on her. The defendant drove the victim\u2019s motor vehicle (with the victim in the front passenger seat) to an automated teller machine (ATM) in West Springfield, declining to go to the ATM across from the college because, as he later told the police, it was too well lit and was close to a coffee shop which was frequented by the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Once they arrived at the ATM, the defendant ordered the victim to switch places with him; she complied and moved into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>driver\u2019s seat. He placed a black winter hat over his face as the victim drove through the ATM and aimed his face toward the passenger\u2019s side door to avoid being detected by video cameras. The victim removed sixty dollars from her bank account; the defendant removed the hat from his face only after they left the ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The defendant then directed the victim to an apartment complex in Agawam where his former girl friend used to live. He took the victim to the woods behind the complex and twice forced her to perform oral sex; he also digitally penetrated her. During the second instance of oral sex, a car pulled into the apartment complex, which prompted the defendant to have the victim stop and to tell her that, if anyone came into the woods, she should tell them that they were just \u201cmaking out.\u201d The defendant then hit the victim with a belt, directed her to get dressed, brought her to the bottom of a hill, and told her that he did not believe that she would not go to the police and that he could just stab her then and throw her in some nearby water.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">They returned to the car, and the victim drove back toward campus. The defendant made her enter campus from a particular direction that had fewer lights and video cameras. Once the victim parked her car near her dormitory, the defendant escorted her to her door. Before leaving, he insisted that, should the victim go to the police, he knew her home address and where she lived on campus so he could find her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The next day, Longmeadow police officers seized both a knit hat and a knife from the defendant\u2019s car during a valid traffic stop of the defendant, but did not arrest him at that point. The defendant later admitted to police that the knit hat recovered was the one used during the robbery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, a piece of paper containing the victim\u2019s name and information was recovered from a trash barrel outside the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. Analysis of fingerprints lifted from the victim\u2019s car revealed that the fingerprints located on the driver\u2019s side front door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>window and passenger\u2019s side front door window matched the defendant\u2019s prints. The defendant\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was also a match with a vaginal swab taken from the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">b. <em>Defendant\u2019s statement to </em>police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 19, 2006, the defendant was arrested in his parents\u2019 home. The defendant\u2019s mother provided the arresting officers with the defendant\u2019s prescription pain medication,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and he was thereafter taken to the Springfield police department. On arrival, the defendant was read the Miranda warnings, as well as his right to a prompt arraignment. He told the officers that he understood those rights but stated that he did not wish to speak with them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After this invocation, the officers took the defendant to be booked; in conjunction with the booking process, he was photographed and fingerprinted, and submitted to a DNA test. While he was in the booking area, the defendant received some of his prescription pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">After his fingerprints had been taken and the DNA swab obtained, the defendant told the officers that he wanted to give a statement. Accordingly, two hours after he had initially invoked his Miranda rights, the defendant was escorted back to the police interview room where he again was advised of his Miranda rights and his right to prompt arraignment. He indicated that he understood the rights and that he wanted to talk with the officers. The defendant\u2019s resulting statement contained portions that implicated him in the robbery of the victim, but he denied sexually assaulting and beating her.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">c. <em>References to defendant\u2019s invocation of Miranda rights. </em>Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his statements to the police, asserting, in part, that his statements were not voluntary because the officers withheld the defendant\u2019s prescription pain medication and told him they would provide the defendant with his medication if he reconsidered talking to them. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, did not accept the defendant\u2019s allegation about withheld medication, concluded that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary based on the totality of the circumstances, and ultimately denied the motion to suppress in its entirety. The defendant based his defense at trial on his claim that he lacked criminal responsibility, and informed the prosecutor and the trial judge at the outset of the trial that voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police remained a live issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">In three different portions of the trial, the prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s initial invocation of his Miranda right to remain silent and not to speak with police: during her direct examination of Detective Eugene Dean of the Springfield police department; in her cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Melvin Lurie; and in her closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">i. <em>Detective Dean. </em>On the first day of Dean\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor elicited in her direct examination the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">The prosecutor: \u201c[C]an you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how you went over the Miranda warnings with him?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">The witness: \u201cLine by line. Read question number one, and he would read before we ask him any questions.... Number eight is, \u2018Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to me now?\u2019 Stated he understood it, put his initials, but then wrote the word \u2018no\u2019, meaning he did not wish to talk with us any further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cShowing you this document, can you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that document is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">The witness: \u201cYes. That document is your right to a prompt arraignment. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cDid you go over that document with [the defendant]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">The witness: \u201cYes, in the same manner as I did in the first document. . . . \u2018Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to me now?\u2019 He again wrote, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The prosecutor thereafter introduced in evidence the \u201cMiranda Warning\u201d and \u201cArraignment Warning\u201d forms, both of which evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>denced the defendant\u2019s initial invocation of his right to remain silent in his own handwriting. This testimony of Dean and these forms provided the first references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his Miranda rights at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On the second day of Dean\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor again referred to the defendant\u2019s invocation through her questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cI think you told us on Friday, initially, <em>the defendant indicated that he did not wish to speak to </em>you; is that correct\u201d (emphasis added)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">The witness: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">The judge: \u201cWhich is \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhich is his right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">The witness: \u201cIt is, indeed, his right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cAt that time, you brought him back down to the booking area ... so that he could continue with the booking process; is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">The witness: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">The prosecutor: \u201cIt was at that point that he was booked and fingerprinted?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">The witness: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd then he came back upstairs and <em>decided to change his mind. He did want to talk to you?\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">The witness: \u201cHe had told us that while we were downstairs that he requested to go back upstairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">The prosecutor: \u201cAfter he was fingerprinted?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">The witness: \u201cAfter he was fingerprinted and after he gave a DNA sample.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ii. <em>Dr. Lurie. </em>During her cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">The prosecutor: \u201cNow, would it be fair to say that you know that, initially, the defendant did not want to speak to the police. He went through his rights and said, [\u2018]no, I don\u2019t want to.[\u2019] \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">The witness: \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">The prosecutor: \u201c[A]re you aware it was after he got fingerprinted that he indicated he was willing to speak to the police?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">The witness: \u201cThat might be the case; that might not be. If you tell me it is, then I don\u2019t have reason to doubt it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cNow, is \u2014 could it be \u2014 hypothetically, if a person realizes that they are getting fingerprinted, and they realize that they touched something that was used in the course of a crime, hypothetically, is it not reasonable to assume that a person thinks [\u2018]they might have my fingerprints, I\u2019m going to tell them my side of the story.[\u2019] \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">iii. <em>Closing argument. </em>In her closing, the prosecutor rehearsed the various actions taken by the defendant during the criminal events that, the prosecutor argued, showed that the defendant was criminally responsible and described them as \u201ccalculated\u201d actions. The prosecutor then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201cWhat I suggest [is] he calculated the scenario \u2014 at first, he said he didn\u2019t want to talk to the police which is his right. He has every right to say he did not want to talk to the police and that should not be taken against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u201cBut, then he finishes the booking process. What does that involve? They are rolling his fingerprints, and he\u2019s thinking to himself as they are rolling finger by finger by finger by finger, damn, damn. I drove that girl\u2019s car. I touched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>steering wheel. Okay. I want to talk to the cops. I want to tell my side of the story.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t impulsive behavior. It was cold. It was calculated. And he should be punished for it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s invocation of right to silence. </em>At trial, the defendant conceded that he committed the acts of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and intimidation of the victim that were at issue in the case; his defense, and the question in dispute, was whether he was criminally responsible for those acts. Relying principally on <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-619 (1976), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 694-697 (1983), he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s several references to his initial invocation of his right to remain silent violated his constitutional due process rights in that the prosecutor was using the defendant\u2019s invocation to argue, impermissibly, that he was indeed criminally responsible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant. We begin with the governing constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\u201cThere is no question that, under the fundamental principles of jurisprudence, evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s postarrest, post-Miranda silence cannot be used for the substantive purpose of permitting an inference of guilt....\u201d <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. at 694, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 175, 181 (1975). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>prohibition exists because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201c[sjilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person being arrested. . . . Moreover, while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 520-521 (1978), quoting <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 617-618. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. 61, 73 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. 654, 658-659 (2000). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 797 (1996). Moreover, \u201c[fundamental unfairness results from the use of evidence of such silence regardless whether the person exercising his or her constitutional right to remain silent claims insanity as a defense.\u201d <em>Mahdi, supra </em>at 695.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">There are, however, \u201crare instances where evidence of a defendant\u2019s postarrest, post-Miranda silence . . . may be admissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePace, </em>433 Mass. 379, 383 (2001), overruled on other grounds, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, </em>449 Mass. 71, 80 (2007). Such instances include explaining why a police interview of the defendant abruptly ended and the jury would be confused without the explanation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105, 110 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass. 1005 (1995); rebutting the defendant\u2019s suggestion at trial that some impropriety on the part of the police prevented him from com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>pleting his statement to them, see <em>id.; </em>and rebutting a claim by the defendant that he had given the police at the time of his arrest the same exculpatory explanation as he was presenting to the jury at trial. See <em>DePace, supra </em>at 383-384. None of these exceptions applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">i. <em>Direct examination of Detective Dean. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the prosecutor was justified in eliciting that the defendant initially invoked his right to remain silent during her direct examination of Dean to (1) \u201cprovide a complete picture of the defendant\u2019s interaction with the police,\u201d and in particular to explain why the first interview ended in very short order; and (2) rebut the defendant\u2019s theory that the statements elicited during his second police interview were not voluntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">When a defendant gives a statement to the police, it is permissible for the Commonwealth to present a fair and reasonably complete picture of the interaction between police and the defendant, including the administration of Miranda warnings and the defendant\u2019s responses to questions posed to him during that process. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toolan, </em>460 Mass. 452, 472 (2011); <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. at 110. In this case, the defendant gave a statement to the police when they brought him back to the interview room in response to his request near the end of the booking process. The Commonwealth was entitled to, and did, present a full account of that interrogation through the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Dean. The defendant\u2019s earlier invocation of his right to remain silent was a distinct event, separated by time and circumstances; clearly, there was no need, in the name of fairness or completeness, to include a description of that event in presenting evidence about the defendant\u2019s postbooking waiver of Miranda rights and police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In addition, the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. at 109-110, is misplaced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unlike that case, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>defendant waived his Miranda rights and spoke to the police about the alleged crime in question for at least a short while (see note 15, <em>supra), </em>in this case, Dean did not conduct any interview of the defendant the first time he and the defendant spoke, precisely because upon receiving the Miranda warnings, the defendant stated he did not want to speak with the police. See <em>DePace, </em>433 Mass. at 384 (\u201cThe rule in <em>Habarek </em>does not apply to the present case .... Here, there was no evidence of any interview, much less one that ended abruptly\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 469 (1993).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s desire to remain silent were not justified under <em>Habarek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">That the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement to police remained a live issue at trial likewise did not justify the prosecutor\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to silence during her direct examination of Dean. It is true that \u201cunder the Commonwealth\u2019s \u2018humane practice\u2019 rule, where the voluntariness of a statement is a live issue at trial, the jury may hear evidence that a defendant was informed of and understood his Miranda rights.\u201d <em>Toolan, </em>460 Mass. at 471. But evidence that Miranda warnings were provided and that the defendant understood them does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>itself require reference to the fact that the defendant earlier exercised the rights included in those warnings. See <em>id. </em>at 472-473.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is particularly the case where, as here, the prosecutor introduced the evidence of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Miranda rights at a time when the defendant had yet to raise the issue of voluntariness before the jury. The references to the fact that the defendant initially declined to speak to police during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Dean constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">ii. <em>Cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert. </em>In cross-examining Dr. Lurie, the prosecutor again mentioned the defendant\u2019s initial assertion of his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues that in doing so, the prosecutor was clearly addressing the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement, and that she was careful to distinguish the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d line of questioning from her questions that dealt with the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. The defendant disputes this characterization. He contends that the true focus of the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to silence and then waiver was on his capacity to appreciate the wrongful nature of his conduct and to take steps post hoc to exculpate himself \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>is, the focus was on the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">It is true Dr. Lurie testified that, in his opinion, the defendant\u2019s statement to the police was not voluntary. But just as it was not necessary for the prosecutor to refer to the defendant\u2019s initial invocation of his rights in order to address the voluntariness issue with Detective Dean, it was equally unnecessary in cross-examining Lurie. The prosecutor could have asked questions to challenge Lurie\u2019s view on voluntariness without the reference, and certainly could have posed the same hypothetical question whether a person in the defendant\u2019s position who had been fingerprinted would want to tell his story to the police without any mention of the defendant\u2019s earlier exercise of his right not to speak. See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 295 (1986) (carefully framed questions can accomplish same task as comment on silence).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Moreover, assuming for the sake of argument that it would have been permissible to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s initial invocation in order to respond to his claim of involuntariness, cf. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. at 110, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s claim, the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not so focused. As the defendant points out (see note 19, <em>supra), </em>right before the prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s initial decision not to speak to police, she listed a series of the defendant\u2019s actions on the night the crimes were committed to show that he understood the consequences of his actions. The Commonwealth argues that the prosecutor paused following these questions before turning to the voluntariness issue. The transcript does reflect a pause, but we question whether that pause, by itself, was sufficient to signal to the jury that the prosecutor was no longer addressing the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility defense. Moreover, the prosecutor followed her reference to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence with more questions about particular aspects of the criminal episode that arguably showed appreciation and control (i.e., criminal responsibility). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 716-717 (1998) (prejudice created by correct jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>instruction sandwiched between two incorrect instructions on same issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In sum, the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to silence in the cross-examination of Lurie were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">iii. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument challenged by the defendant followed the same pattern as her cross-examination of Lurie, and indeed built on it. As earlier described, the prosecutor in her closing listed actions by the defendant that reflected his capacity for appreciation and control in relation to his conduct, characterizing them for the jury as \u201ccalculated\u201d actions; she then moved to the defendant\u2019s initial exercise of his right to silence and subsequent decision to speak to the police after being fingerprinted, describing the defendant\u2019s thought pattern in essentially the same words as she had in her hypothetical question earlier posed to Lurie, and then labeling the entire invocation-waiver sequence as a \u201ccalculated . . . scenario.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were addressing the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement, not his criminal responsibility, and that she was entitled to do so to reply to the defendant\u2019s contrary position. Again, assuming the propriety of raising the defendant\u2019s initial invocation of Miranda rights as a response to a defense challenge to voluntariness, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument ignores the close proximity and significant degree of parallelism between the portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument countering the defendant\u2019s contention that he lacked criminal responsibility, and the portion purporting to address the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement. We agree with the defendant that the prosecutor\u2019s closing left the impression that the defendant\u2019s invocation in significant part demonstrated that he was criminally responsible.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is precisely what <em>Mahdi </em>prohibits. See Mahdi, 388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Mass. at 694-695.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">b. <em>Effect of errors. </em>With one partial exception, the defendant did not object at trial to the prosecutor\u2019s references to his invocation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Both the defendant and the Commonwealth agree, as do we, that the proper standard of review is whether the errors created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 42 &amp; n.20 (2000) (unpreserved error concerning admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s invocation of right to remain silent in first degree murder appeal was properly reviewed under substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. at 13, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201cAn error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice unless we are persuaded that it did not materially influence[ ] the guilty verdict. ... In making that determination, we consider the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant (without consideration of any evidence erroneously admitted), the nature of the error, . . . whether the error is sufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the [jury\u2019s] result might have been otherwise but for the error, and whether it can be inferred from the record that counsel\u2019s failure to object was not simply a reasonable tactical decision.\u201d (Quotations, citations, and footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 297-298 (2002) (review of denial of motion for new trial; articulation of factors for reviewing substantial risk of miscarriage of justice).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>We first review the considerations set forth in <em>Alphas. </em>As to the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant admitted to committing the acts constituting the crimes charged, and even without the evidence of the defendant\u2019s invocation of his Miranda rights, the Commonwealth\u2019s case that the defendant was criminally responsible was very strong. The testimony of the victim, as well as the defendant\u2019s own statement to the police, provided detailed, compelling evidence that the defendant understood and appreciated that what he was doing was criminal and that he had the capacity to direct and control his behavior.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Turning to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>nature of the error and the failure of defense counsel to object, for all the reasons we have discussed previously, the prosecutor\u2019s various references to the defendant\u2019s initial invocation constituted a constitutional error that at least in part related to the premise of the defense. Nevertheless, in the context of the other evidence presented at trial, the error does not create a plausible inference that if it had not occurred, the jury would have decided the case differently. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986). In these circumstances, we conclude that no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, we turn to the factors that the court set out in <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. at 696-697, for assessing the degree of harm caused by constitutional evidentiary errors. See note 22, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Mahdi </em>factors are \u201c(1) the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; (2) who introduced the issue at trial; (3) the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt; (4) the frequency of the reference; and (5) the availability or effect of curative instructions\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Id. </em>Many of the factors weigh against the Commonwealth here. The prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of Miranda rights, when used to suggest criminal responsibility, directly connected to the premise of the defendant\u2019s defense (factor 1); the Commonwealth introduced the evidence at trial (factor 2); the prosecutor referred to the invocation in three contexts (factor 4); and there were no targeted curative instructions by the judge (factor 5) \u2022\u2014 although the absence of such instructions is consistent with the evidence being admitted without objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 812 (2001).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But as discussed, the victim\u2019s testimony and, significantly, the defendant\u2019s own statement described the series of intentional actions he took during the criminal episode and offered explanations for those actions (see note 23, <em>supra), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>and these explanations provided very powerful evidence of the defendant\u2019s ability to appreciate both the wrongfulness of his actions and his ability to conform his actions to the requirements of the law \u2014 i.e., that he possessed criminal responsibility while committing the crimes (factor 3). See <em>id. </em>at 814 (\u201clengthy laundry list of rational, calculating, nondelusional conduct. .. admittedly engaged in by [the defendant] before, during, and just after the crime\u201d supported \u201c[the Commonwealth\u2019s] expert\u2019s testimony that [the defendant] was fully capable of complex thought and action when he committed the murders, and was able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and form it to the requirements of the law\u201d [footnote omitted]). See also <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. at 42-43.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In light of the strength of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility, even considering the <em>Mahdi </em>factors, we conclude that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent constituted error, but they did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. For the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, <em>Letkowski, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 858-859, the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The facts we set out here include some explanations of the defendant\u2019s reasons for taking certain actions.

That court viewed the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s initial invocation during her direct examination of Detective Eugene Dean as being intended to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim that his statement to the police was not voluntary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Letkowski, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 847, 853-854 (2013). The court concluded, however, that the references came before the defendant had raised the voluntariness issue at trial and therefore were improper as a matter of timing. See <em>id. </em>at 855-856. Nevertheless, because the defendant later did raise the voluntariness of his statement as a trial issue, in the Appeals Court\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the detective about the defendant\u2019s initial invocation ultimately would have been admissible, and the timing error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 856-857. As for the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s initial invocation during her cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert and in her closing argument, the Appeals Court opined that the references \u201ccame dangerously close to using the defendant\u2019s initial silence against him and should not have been said.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 292 (1986), where the United States Supreme Court rejected a State\u2019s argument that <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-619 (1976), did not preclude the State from contending that a defendant\u2019s post-Miranda invocation of his right to remain silent and not to speak with the police was evidence that he did not lack criminal responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">\u201cThe point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity. In both situations, the State gives warnings to protect constitutional rights and implicitly promises that any exercise of those rights will not be penalized. In both situations, the State then seeks to make use of the defendant\u2019s exercise of those rights in obtaining his conviction. The implicit promise, the breach, and the consequent penalty are identical in both situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass. 1005 (1995), the defendant, after waiving his Miranda rights, spoke to a police officer, provided some information, and then stated that he did not want to say any more, at which point the interview ended. <em>Id. </em>at 109 &amp; n.l. At trial, the interrogating officer recounted the entire interview on direct examination, including the defendant\u2019s statement about not wanting to say more. <em>Id. </em>at 109. Then, following a question by defense counsel during cross-examination about the fact that the interview had not been taped, <em>id., </em>the officer stated on redirect that no tape had been made because the defendant \u201cexercised his right to remain silent so [the officer] terminated the conversation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110.

First of all, there was no need to mention the initial invocation at all, which would render \u201cunnecessary repetition\u201d a nonissue. In any event, it is not unusual for the police to give a suspect multiple sets of Miranda warnings. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. 61, 68 (2010) (Miranda warnings given twice); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tolan, </em>453 Mass. 634, 644 (2009) (police read defendant Miranda warnings multiple times during interview). And, here there was an intervening event \u2014 the defendant\u2019s booking \u2014 that provided the jury with a sufficient explanation for why the initial interaction with Dean was cut short and would need to be resumed later in time. More to the point, we expect prosecutors, defense counsel, and trial judges to work together in order to find ways to provide juries with a reasonably complete picture of an interrogation without trenching on or even implicating the defendant\u2019s exercise of constitutional rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 799 n.5 (1996). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toolan, </em>460 Mass. 452, 472-473 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We recognize that a defendant\u2019s initial exercise of his right to silence and then a change of mind and request to speak to the police could be deemed probative of the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement. But the fact that evidence might be relevant or probative does not mean that it can always properly be introduced. As suggested in note 16, <em>supra, </em>when introduction of such arguably relevant evidence directly implicates the defendant\u2019s protected exercise of his constitutional rights, an inquiry whether alternatives are available should be undertaken \u25a0\u2014 before trial, if possible, and at sidebar during trial, if not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The pertinent portions of the cross-examination are set out in the fact section of this opinion. To summarize, the prosecutor asked Dr. Lurie if he knew the defendant had initially invoked his right not to speak with the police, and, following some intervening questions, asked if Lurie knew that, after the defendant was fingerprinted, he wanted to speak to the police. The prosecutor then asked this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cNow, is \u2014 could it be \u2014 hypothetically, if a person realizes that they are getting fingerprinted, and they realize that they touched something that was used in the course of a crime, hypothetically, is it not reasonable to assume that a person thinks [\u2018]they might have my fingerprints, I\u2019m going to tell them my side of the story. [\u2019] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">After defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, Lurie answered that he thought the fingerprints issue was irrelevant \u2014 what mattered was that the defendant was desperate for pain medication, and, Lurie stated, the defendant agreed to give a statement in exchange for receiving medicine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In particular, the defendant points out that the prosecutor immediately preceded her references to the defendant\u2019s initial decision to decline to speak to police with questions highlighting a series of decisions by the defendant during the criminal event that evidenced he was not \u201coblivious\u201d to the consequences of his criminal behavior. The defendant argues that the prosecutor left the jury with the same impression about the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence, i.e., that the defendant\u2019s ability first to invoke his Miranda rights and then waive them when he realized that \u201cthey might have my fingerprints\u201d also proved that he was not oblivious to such consequences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Cf. <em>Toolan, </em>460 Mass. at 472 (conviction reversed on other grounds; prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and police testimony focused on defendant\u2019s actions and statements about whether to exercise Miranda rights came \u201cdangerously close to an improper suggestion that the defendant was manipulating his constitutional rights to his own advantage\u201d; \u201c[o]n remand, the Commonwealth should exercise care to avoid using the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Miranda rights against him by suggesting that his invocations of or deliberations on those rights demonstrated his criminal responsibility\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The defendant objected to the hypothetical question the prosecutor asked Dr. Lurie about what a person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances would think about speaking to the police once fingerprinted, and the trial judge overruled the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 696-697 (1983), are ones that the court originally set out for determining whether the Commonwealth\u2019s impermissible use of the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 a standard which does not apply to unpreserved errors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 174 n.6 (1999). A number, but not all, of this court\u2019s decisions reviewing convictions of murder in the first degree have applied the <em>Mahdi </em>factors when determining whether such error, unpreserved at trial, raised a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 811-815 (2001) (applying <em>Mahdi </em>factors to introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence as evidence of criminal responsibility to determine whether errors created substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>467 Mass. 674, 690-691 (2014) (using <em>Mahdi </em>factors to determine whether admission of defendant\u2019s requests to confer with counsel created substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 42-43 &amp; n.20 (2000) (unpreserved error concerning invocation of right to silence; court concluded there was no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice based solely on strength of Commonwealth\u2019s case). Decisions also have varied in using the <em>Mahdi </em>factors to assess whether an unpreserved <em>Doyle </em>error raises a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 829 (2009) (stating that court uses five <em>Mahdi </em>factors to determine whether unpreserved <em>Doyle </em>error created substantial risk of miscarriage of justice), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ewing, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 531, 544-545 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>449 Mass. 1035 (2007) (looking <em>at Mahdi </em>factors to determine whether prosecutor\u2019s impermissible but unobjected-to questions and comments infringing on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent after arrest created substantial risk of miscarriage of justice), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>451 Mass. 200, 209 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999) (analyzing whether unpreserved possible <em>Doyle </em>issue created substantial risk of miscarriage of justice; no mention of <em>Mahdi </em>factors). The Commonwealth and the defendant have applied the <em>Mahdi </em>factors in their arguments before this court, and in assessing whether the defendant was prejudiced by the errors, we consider in the text first the substantial risk factors set forth in <em>Alphas, supra, </em>and then the <em>Mahdi </em>factors. The difference between the two sets of factors is not great. We leave for decision in another case the question which set properly should apply to determine whether an unpreserved <em>Doyle </em>error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and requires reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant through his statement, and the victim through her testimony, provided the jury with information that during the criminal episode: (1) the defendant drove the victim\u2019s car as part of the abduction rather than his own; (2) the defendant drove with the victim to an ATM in West Springfield rather than the ATM near the college because that ATM was well-lit and near a coffee shop frequented by police; (3) once they arrived at the West Springfield ATM, the defendant switched places with the victim and moved from the driver\u2019s seat to the passenger\u2019s seat, pulled a hat over his face, and looked toward the passenger\u2019s side window, all to avoid being detected on the drive-through ATM\u2019s video <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>camera; (4) the defendant thereafter took the victim to an apartment complex that he knew had a wooded area where he and the victim would be shaded from view; (5) during the criminal episode, the defendant wrote the victim\u2019s name and information down on a piece of paper, and threatened to harm the victim should she go to the police; and (6) he also directed her to use a particular entrance of the college when they returned to the campus because there were fewer lights and video cameras.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Moreover, the fact that the defendant ultimately spoke with the police serves to mitigate the potential for impermissible inferences being drawn by the jury from the defendant\u2019s initial refusal to speak with them.
