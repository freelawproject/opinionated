G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, seventh par. <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 51 (2006) <em>(Alliance I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">1. <em>Environmental justice policy. </em>The interveners<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> argue that the board erred by failing properly to apply the Commonwealth\u2019s environmental justice (EJ) policy, as promulgated by the predecessor to the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The resolution of this issue requires a two-part analysis: whether the EJ policy is among the factors the board must consider under \u00a7 <em>69J\u00bc </em>(and is therefore subject to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>review); and if so, whether the board correctly applied the policy to Brockton Power\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The EX policy states: \u201cEnvironmental justice is based on the principle that all people have a right to be protected from environmental pollution and to live in and enjoy a clean and healthful environment. Environmental justice is the equal protection and meaningful involvement of all people with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies and the equitable distribution of environmental benefits.\u201d The EJ policy defines \u201c[ejqual [protection\u201d to mean \u201cthat no group of people, because of race, ethnicity, class, gender, or handicap bears an unfair share of environmental pollution from industrial, commercial, state and municipal operations or have limited access to natural resources, including greenspace (open space) and water resources.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An \u201c[environmental [\u00a1justice [pjopulation\u201d is defined as \u201ca neighborhood whose annual median household income is equal to or less than [sixty-five] percent of the statewide median or whose population is made up [of twenty-five] percent [m]inority, [fjoreign [b]orn, or [1] acting [ejnglish [ljanguage [p]roficiency.\u201d Brockton Power\u2019s proposed project site was within one-half mile of EJ communities to the west, north, and northeast.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The EJ policy directs agencies within the EOEEA to \u201cdevelop their own strategies to proactively promote environmental justice in all neighborhoods in ways that are tailored to the specific mission of each agency. . . . [EOEEA] agencies shall identify and promote agency-sponsored projects, funding decisions, rule-makings or other actions intended to further environmental justice in the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The EJ policy also mandates specific agency action in two areas: enhanced public participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>EJ communities and, in certain circumstances, enhanced substantive review of new projects in EJ communities when a proposed generating facility exceeds thresholds established by the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H (MEPA).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">With respect to public participation, the EJ policy mandates that \u201call [EOEEA] agencies shall have an inclusive, robust public participation program that focuses agency resources on outreach activities that enhance public participation opportunities for agency activities that potentially affect EJ populations.\u201d The policy calls for \u201cenhanced public participation\u201d through \u201cuse of alternative media outlets such as community or ethnic newspapers . . . and translation of materials or interpretation services at public meetings\u201d in cases where a project exceeds Environmental Notification Form (ENF) thresholds for \u201cair, solid and hazardous waste ... or wastewater and sewage sludge treatment and disposal\u201d as determined by the Secretary of the EOEEA (Secretary) under MEPA and its implementing regulations, and the project site is within one mile (or, in the case of air emissions, five miles) from an EJ population.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In addition to these procedural requirements, the EJ policy substantively provides for enhanced analysis and review of \u201cimpacts and mitigation\u201d in relation to projects that meet two conditions: (1) the project exceeds \u201ca mandatory EIR [environmental impact report] threshold for air, solid and hazardous waste . . . , or wastewater sewage sludge treatment and disposal\u201d; and (2) the project is located within one mile of an EJ population, or within five miles for projects exceeding the EIR threshold for air. \u201cEn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>hanced analysis . . . may include analysis of multiple air impacts; data on baseline public health conditions within affected EJ [population; analysis of technological, site planning, and operational alternatives to reduce impacts; and proposed on-site and off-site mitigation measures to reduce multiple impacts and increase environmental benefits to the affected EJ [p]opulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The project at issue here, construction of Brockton Power\u2019s facility, was subject to mandatory MEPA review. In conducting that review, the Secretary certified that because the project exceeded the ENF threshold for air and is located within five miles of an EJ community, it was subject to enhanced public participation under the EJ policy. However, the Secretary also certified that the project did not exceed the mandatory EIR threshold for air pollutants, and therefore was not subject to enhanced review under the EJ policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The board addressed the EJ policy in its decision, interpreting it to provide for both \u201cenhanced analysis\u201d and additional procedures during a review of a petition filed with the board pursuant to \u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1. </em>The board concluded, however, that the EJ policy\u2019s enhanced analysis provisions applied only to \u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1 </em>petitions that propose a generating facility that would exceed the EIR threshold for air emissions. Because the Secretary\u2019s MEPA certification had determined that the facility\u2019s expected emissions did not exceed this threshold, the board found that the policy, as applied to Brockton Power\u2019s petition, was limited to additional procedures, namely, \u201cenhanced outreach and public participation\u201d during the board\u2019s review process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Before turning to the interveners\u2019 claims, however, we first discuss whether the board\u2019s interpretation and application of the EJ policy in its decision is subject to our review at all. The board, joined by Brockton Power, contends that judicial review of this aspect of its decision is not available, because the EJ policy states that it \u201cis intended only to improve the internal management of [EOEEA] agencies\u201d and expressly disclaims the creation of \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>right, benefit, or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity,\u201d as well as \u201cany right to judicial review involving compliance or noncompliance\u201d with the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The board\u2019s contention fails. As the board recognized in its decision, \u00a7 <em>69 JM, </em>fifth par., requires the board to determine whether \u201cplans for the construction of the proposed generating facility are consistent with current health and environmental protection policies of the commonwealth and with such energy policies as are adopted by the commonwealth for the specific purpose of guiding the decisions of the board,\u201d and also that the EJ policy is among the \u201cenvironmental protection policies of the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It follows, therefore, that the board\u2019s application of the EJ policy is subject to judicial review as part of the court\u2019s consideration whether the board\u2019s decision meets the requirements of \u00a7 <em>69PA, </em>fifth par. Cf. <em>Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Aviation Admin., </em>355 F.3d 678, 688-689 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (where defendant agency included analysis of compliance with Federal executive order on environmental justice in its evaluation of compliance with National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA], issue of agency\u2019s compliance with executive order was reviewable by court because it arose under NEPA, not executive order, which disclaimed right of judicial review). Accord <em>Allen </em>v. <em>National Insts. of Health, </em>974 F. Supp. 2d 18, 46-47 (D. Mass. 2013).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The standard of review is that set out in \u00a7 69P, namely, whether the board\u2019s application \u201cwas supported by substantial evidence of record in the board\u2019s proceedings; and was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The interveners\u2019 claims concerning the EJ policy, however, fail on the merits. As mentioned, the Secretary certified that the proposed facility did not exceed the mandatory EIR threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>under MEPA for air pollutants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under the express language of the EJ policy, therefore, Brockton Power\u2019s petition was not subject to \u201cenhanced analysis.\u201d The interveners do not challenge the Secretary\u2019s determination under MEPA, nor do they argue that the board failed to meet the EJ policy\u2019s procedural requirements. In the context of this case, we cannot accept the interveners\u2019 contention that, independent of a triggering MEPA threshold for enhanced analysis, the EJ policy required the board to apply unspecified \u201csubstantive equal protection\u201d principles to its review of Brockton Power\u2019s proposed facility and that the board\u2019s failure to do so rendered its decision arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of the board\u2019s discretion. The interveners do not point to a specific or affirmative requirement in the EJ policy to do so, and we have found none.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">2. <em>Air quality standards. </em>The city and the residents object to the board\u2019s reliance on the National Ambient Air Quality Standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>(NAAQS) to review the environmental and cumulative health impacts of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2 5). They argue that the NAAQS for PM2 5 are insufficiently protective of public health, and that the board\u2019s reliance on the standards is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Clean Air Act, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7408, 7409 (2006), directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop national standards for ambient air quality \u2014 the NAAQS \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 that are to cover for air pollutants \u201creasonably . . . anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\u201d including particulate matter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7408(a)(1)(A). The Clean Air Act charges the EPA with promulgating NAAQS that are protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(b); 40 C.F.R. Part 50 (2006).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In setting the NAAQS, the EPA relies on criteria developed by EPA staff that \u201caccurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or welfare\u201d from the pollutant, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7408(a)(2), and recommendations of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, a seven-member, independent scientific review committee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(2). The EPA reviews and, if necessary, revises the NAAQS every five years. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(1). The NAAQS are implemented, maintained, and enforced by the States under EPA-approved State implementation plans. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. See Reitze, Air Quality Protection Using State Implementation Plans \u2014 Thirty-Seven Years of Increasing Complexity, 15 Vill. Envtl. L.J. 209, 210-213 (2004). In Massachusetts, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in the course of the permitting process for new emission sources, enforces NAAQS in part by comparing total level of expected criteria pollutant (the sum of the background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>concentration and expected emissions from the new source) with the NAAQS. See, e.g., G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 142D; 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 7.00 (2014).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Pursuant to its statutory mandate to review siting petitions for new energy facilities, the board relied on NAAQS to determine whether Brockton Power\u2019s petition \u201cminimize[d] the environmental impacts consistent with the minimization of costs associated with the mitigation, control, and reduction of the environmental impacts of the proposed generating facility.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J%, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">At the time of Brockton Power\u2019s petition, the annual NAAQS for PM2 5 was 15 micrograms per cubic meter (pg/m3). 40 C.F.R. Part 50. According to Brockton Power\u2019s atmospheric dispersion modeling (AERMOD) analysis \u2014 a model approved by the EPA, 70 Fed. Reg. 68,218 (2005) \u2014 the relevant background annual concentration of PM2 5 for the facility site was 9.9 pg/m3.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Upon completion, the facility would emit approximately 85 tons per year (tpy) of PM25 pollutants, resulting in a 0.25 pg/m3 increase in the annual PM2 5. These emissions represent a cumulative annual impact of 1\u00d3.15 pg/m3 PM2 5, or about two-thirds of the annual NAAQS for this criteria pollutant at the time the petition was filed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Considering this evidence, the board determined that Brockton Power\u2019s description of the health and environmental impacts of PM2.s emissions from the facility was substantially accurate and complete, and that such environmental impacts would be minimized under the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The interveners argue, however, that by relying on the NAAQS set by the EPA and DEP, the board failed to comply with its independent duty to analyze the petition under G. L. c. 164, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1, </em>fifth par., and that, moreover, the NAAQS for PM2 5 are themselves arbitrary, capricious, and not based on substantial evidence. The interveners\u2019 arguments fail. As the board explained, it \u201cgives great weight to expected compliance with [EPA] and [DEP] air quality regulatory requirements as an indicator of whether the potential impacts to air quality of a proposed facility would be minimized.\u201d The board\u2019s position is reasonable in light of the EPA\u2019s mandate and expertise under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7408, 7409, as implemented by the EPA\u2019s regulations and enforced by the DEP in Massachusetts. Moreover, the NAAQS methodology, as well as the data used to calculate the estimated ambient pollutant concentrations for the facility, were fully presented in Brockton Power\u2019s petition and analyzed in the board\u2019s final decision.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although the board must ensure that the facility\u2019s environmental impacts are accurately modeled and described, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69114, fifth par., it is not required to establish its own quantitative values with respect to criteria pollutants (or any other environmental impact) to guide its siting decisions. \u201cThe legislative scheme contemplates that much of what the board does in the area of air pollution will be dependent on decisions of the department, which has a significant and independent role in the permit process for new generating facilities.\u201d <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 377, 381-382 (2001) <em>(Andover). </em>We conclude that the board\u2019s reliance on the NAAQS was consistent with its statutory mandate and precedent, and was neither arbitrary nor an abuse of discretion. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The interveners may, of course, challenge the basis of a NAAQS standard set by the EPA and relied on by the board in its statutory review. Here, the interveners contend that the NAAQS standard for PM2 5 used by the EPA and DEP has been discredited, and that, consequently, the board erred by relying on this standard. This argument is also without merit. In <em>American Farm Bur. Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Agency, </em>559 F.3d 512 (D.C. Cir. 2009) <em>(American Farm), </em>the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered the EPA\u2019s \u201cdecision to set the primary annual NAAQS for PM25 at 15 pg/m3\u201d and held that \u201cthe EPA failed adequately to explain why ... its annual standard is sufficient \u2018to protect the public health [with] an adequate margin of safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519-520, quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(b)(1). Accordingly, the court remanded the standard to the EPA for reconsideration or an adequate explanation of the NAAQS. <em>Id. </em>at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At the time of the board\u2019s final decision, the EPA was in the process of reconsidering the NAAQS for PM2 5, in light of the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>American Farm. </em>As the board recognized, during the rulemaking process leading up to the adoption of this standard, see 71 Fed. Reg. 61,144, 61,144-61,146 (2006), the EPA staff and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee advocated an annual PM2 5 NAAQS of between 12 and 14 pg/m3.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In its decision, the board observed that the total estimated annual PM2 5 of 10.15 pg/m3 \u201cis far below the lowest of the possible limits (12 pg/m3) that were being considered and recommended during [the EPA] rulemaking.\u201d Accordingly, the board determined that \u201cthe facility meets the NAAQS standard that is currently in place, as well as any reasonably foreseeable revised standard that may be established by [the] EPA on remand.\u201d We note that in January, 2013, subsequent to the board\u2019s final decision, the EPA adopted an annual NAAQS for PM2 5 of 12 pg/m3. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.18 (2013); 78 Fed. Reg. 3,086-01 (2013). We conclude, therefore, that the board did not abuse its discretion by considering the NAAQS for PM2 5 in the course of its statutory review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">3. <em>Logan Airport data. </em>The meteorological data that Brockton Power used for predicting emissions of criteria pollutants under AERMOD, the atmospheric dispersion modeling system approved by the EPA, were derived from a National Weather Service (NWS) monitoring station at Logan Airport in Boston, approximately twenty miles from the proposed site. The city and the residents contend that this modeling did not accurately and completely describe the facility\u2019s impact, because the Logan Airport data were not representative of meteorological conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>at the site in Brockton, which lacks the influence of ocean breezes at Logan Airport; these interveners suggest that Brockton Power should have used meteorological data from a different source, or should have gathered data itself specifically from the facility site.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In its decision, the board found that the data at the Logan Airport site were adequate for the purposes of its review under \u00a7 <em>69PA, </em>fifth par., because \u201cgiven established wind patterns and wind regimes experienced in general over eastern Massachusetts, meteorological data for Logan Airport is representative of conditions at the proposed Brockton site.\u201d In addition, the board noted that the DEP, which ultimately would be responsible for approving Brockton Power\u2019s air permit, raised no concerns with respect to the company\u2019s air modeling in its comments on the final environmental impact report under MEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The record shows that no suitable meteorological data for the Brockton site were available, and as none of the interveners disputes, the data from the Taunton Municipal Airport NWS monitoring station, a location closer to the Brockton site that the city and the residents contend more closely approximates meteorological conditions in Brockton, failed to meet the EPA guidelines for air quality modeling data capture<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in four out of five years prior to Brockton Power\u2019s petition, making it unsuitable for AERMOD dispersal analysis. In contrast, the Logan Airport NWS monitoring site provided five years of off-site data fully compliant with the EPA data capture guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Despite the inadequacy of the Taunton meteorological data, at the city\u2019s request, Brockton Power modeled data from 2005 (the single year for which the Taunton data met the EPA guidelines) for both the Taunton and Logan Airport sites. This modeling exercise produced cumulative concentrations for several criteria pollutants that were higher than when the Logan Airport data were used. In no instance, however, did the Taunton data result in expected cumulative concentrations exceeding the annual or twenty-four hour thresholds set by the EPA.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> With respect to annual PM2 5, for example, models from both sites yielded nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>identical cumulative expected concentrations below the NAAQS of 15 pg/m3 (the standard at the time of the board\u2019s final decision) and 12 pg/m3 (the NAAQS subsequently adopted by the EPA after <em>American Farm).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The city concedes that the Taunton data were not adequate for AERMOD analysis, but contends that the estimated differences between ambient air pollutants at each site demonstrate that \u201cmeteorological data may vary significantly from location to location, even within eastern Massachusetts\u201d and consequently that modeling using Logan Airport data failed accurately and completely to describe the facility\u2019s air emission impacts as required by \u00a7 69J!4, fifth par. Instead, the city and the residents suggest the board should have required Brockton Power to provide site-specific data \u2014 although it did not exist, as the city and residents acknowledge. Nothing in the statute, however, requires the board to use on-site meteorological data in its review of a petition for accuracy, completeness, and minimization of environmental impacts. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69114, fifth par. The five years of Logan Airport data, considered in combination with the one year of supplemental Taunton data, constituted substantial evidence on which the board could base its analysis of air emissions under \u00a7 69J!4. Moreover, to the extent the interveners argue that the board abdicated its statutory duty by referencing the DEP\u2019s acceptance of Logan Airport data in the course of the MEPA review, we disagree. The board\u2019s role \u201cwith respect to air emissions is limited to a review of the [petitioner\u2019s] description of the environmental impacts of the proposed generating facility for substantial accuracy and completeness, and a determination whether [the] construction plans minimize the environmental impacts consistent with the minimization of costs associated with the mitigation, control, and reduction of the environmental impacts of the proposed facility.\u201d <em>Andover, </em>435 Mass. at 380. The board\u2019s conclusion pursuant to \u00a7 69J!4, fifth par., that air emission estimates using Logan Airport data were substantially accurate and complete necessarily referenced the DEP (which uses EPA-derived NAAQS thresholds), as the agency responsible for evaluating Brockton Power\u2019s air dispersal modeling procedures and compliance with the air regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">4. <em>Town drinking water. </em>The town challenges the board\u2019s determination that the facility\u2019s impact on the town\u2019s drinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>water supply was \u201csubstantially accurate and complete\u201d as required by \u00a7 69134. The town\u2019s challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The facility\u2019s cooling tower would require an average annual volume of 1.6 million gallons per day (mgd) of water (or 1.9 mgd at peak, during a hot summer day), which Brockton Power anticipated would be sourced from discharge from the city\u2019s advanced water reclamation facility (AWRF). This would reduce the volume of the annual average flow immediately downstream from the AWRF, where the treated wastewater is discharged into the Salisbury Plain River, from 40.0 mgd to 38.4 mgd, which is still above the average annual naturally occurring flow of 20.5 mgd. The board noted that the availability of AWRF water for use by the facility was uncertain at the time of its final decision, and directed the company to submit a project change filing to the board in the event that it modified the anticipated source for the majority of the project\u2019s water requirements.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The town obtains its drinking water supply from high yielding wells in a Zone II aquifer encompassing a large portion of northeastern West Bridgewater and a small area of southeastern Brockton, totaling more than 740 acres.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The town\u2019s current permit issued pursuant to the Massachusetts Water Management Act, G. L. c. 21G, authorizes up to 1.53 mgd of withdrawal from wells in the Zone II aquifer, although actual use is between 0.60 to 0.77 mgd. Under extremely conservative assumptions (low-flow conditions in the river and peak operations at the facility), the estimated effect on river flow, below the AWRF, would be fifteen per cent at most, or sufficient to maintain a flow of 10.9 mgd.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Based on these estimates, the board concluded that recharge to the town\u2019s wells would not be adversely affected by the facility\u2019s withdrawals.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The town raises three primary objections to the board\u2019s analysis of the facility\u2019s impact on the aquifer. The first focuses on the timing of the testimony addressing the facility\u2019s water use. The town argues that because the expert testimony and the analysis regarding the aquifer were introduced in the course of the hearings before the board, rather than in the actual petition that Brockton Power submitted at the start of the review process, the description of environmental impacts in the petition was not \u201csubstantially accurate and complete,\u201d as required by \u00a7 69114, fifth par. However, the language and structure of the statute make clear that the term \u201cpetition\u201d refers to a project proponent\u2019s over-all submissions to the board, including evidentiary hearings in the course of the board\u2019s petition review process, and is not limited to the initial petition commencing the board\u2019s review. See <em>Andover, </em>435 Mass. at 386 (changes in estimates of air impacts during proceeding did not violate requirement that petitioner\u2019s description of proposed project and environmental impacts be \u201csubstantially accurate and complete\u201d). Our review of the record here persuades us that the board properly considered all substantial evidence submitted in the course of its review, including Brockton Power\u2019s submissions and expert testimony addressing the facility\u2019s impact on the Zone II aquifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The town\u2019s second contention \u2014 that the board neglected to make required subsidiary findings \u2014 also fails.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The board\u2019s decision contained a \u201cstatement of reasons . . . including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision,\u201d which is an adequate \u201c \u2018guide to its reasons\u2019 so that [a] court may \u2018exercise . . . [its] function of appellate review\u2019 \u201d as required by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 868 (1977) (citations omitted). Our review of the extensive record before the board assures us that substantial evidence supported the board\u2019s conclusion that the facility would allow water flows in the Salisbury Plain River in excess of the volume necessary to ensure recharge of the aqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>fer.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The absent subsidiary findings claimed by the town are either unnecessary or implicit in the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Finally, the town\u2019s arguments regarding the reliability and admissibility of testimony by Brockton Power\u2019s expert witness \u2014 evidence the town contends was based on hydrology reports that are hearsay and otherwise unreliable \u2014 lack merit. The board has broad discretion to weigh and assess the credibility of evidence, including hearsay evidence. See, e.g., <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 418 (2001) <em>(Box Pond). </em>Here, the expert\u2019s testimony and submissions referenced hydrology reports examining the Zone II aquifer in the context of conservative estimates of the wastewater recharge on the aquifer. The board had an opportunity to consider the methodology and accuracy of the reports in the course of the hearings. We conclude that Brockton Power\u2019s submissions, including the evidence presented by its expert, were substantially accurate and complete, and that the town has not met its burden of showing that the board abused its discretion in crediting the company\u2019s evidence. See <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>457 Mass. 663, 690 (2010) <em>(Alliance II); Box Pond, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"><em>5. Traffic impacts. </em>We address briefly the city\u2019s contention that the board lacked statutory authority to establish traffic routes for deliveries of ULSD and aqueous ammonia as a condition of its approval of the petition. The board\u2019s final decision directed Brockton Power to require that its ULSD and aqueous ammonia vendors use one of two State highways (Routes 27 and 123) through the city, effectively precluding deliveries using Route 106, which runs through the town, unless the vendor is located in the town.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The board concluded that, consistent with the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>pany\u2019s petition and traffic analysis, limiting deliveries to these routes would minimize the traffic impacts of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Section 69144, fourth par., requires the board to review a range of environmental impacts including \u201clocal and regional land use impact, local and regional cumulative health impact . . . , and noise impact of the proposed generating facility\u201d as a part of its statutory review. The board has consistently interpreted this mandate to include the environmental impacts of traffic, and \u201c[w]e accord substantial discretion to an agency to interpret the statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Alliance II, </em>457 Mass. at 681. See, e.g., <em>City Council of Agawam </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>437 Mass. 821, 830-831 (2002); <em>Andover, </em>435 Mass. at 391. Here, the effect of deliveries to the facility comes under the board\u2019s jurisdiction as a \u201clocal and regional land use impact.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J\u00bc, fourth par. Considering that traffic from construction and regular deliveries presents potentially significant environmental impacts, the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute is entirely reasonable. See, e.g., <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>461 Mass. 166, 187 (2011) (\u201cagency\u2019s powers are shaped by its organic statute taken as a whole . ..

At the time the EJ policy was issued, the Energy Facilities Siting Board (board) was under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs. The EJ policy expressly states that \u201c[tjhis policy is not intended to regulate agencies outside the EOEA secretariat____This policy is not intended to interfere with, supersede, or create any new obligations on the [board], an entity which is not by law or otherwise a part of the EOEA secretariat.\u201d In April, 2007, the Legislature created the EOEEA, and placed the former EOEA and two energy-related agencies, the Department of Public Utilities (under which the board is organized, see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H) and the Department of Energy Resources, within the new executive office. See St. 2007 c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 28, 53. See also G. L. c. 21A, \u00a7 1. The board concluded in this case that as of April, 2007, it was subject to the EOEEA\u2019s EJ policy, and all parties agree with this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Meaningful [i]nvolvement\u201d is defined in the EJ policy to mean \u201cthat all neighborhoods have the right to participate in partnership with government in environmental decision-making including needs assessment, planning, implementation, enforcement, and evaluation, and neighborhoods are enabled and administratively assisted to participate fully through education and training means, and encouraged to develop environmental stewardship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The board apparently has not yet undertaken any \u201crulemakings\u201d or developed guidelines in order to carry out these EJ policy directives, but of course it may establish rules and agency policy through adjudication as well as rulemaking.

L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H (MEPA), and its implementing regulations establish a process to ensure that State permitting agencies have adequate information on which to base their permitting decisions, and that environmental impacts of the project are avoided or minimized.

Pursuant to MEPA, a project proponent requiring a permit from a State agency files an environmental notification form (ENF) with the Secretary of the EOEEA (Secretary), who determines whether the project meets the review threshold requiring an environmental impact report (EIR). See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62A; 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.06. If so, and after submission of a final environmental impact report (FEIR) and opportunity for review by the public, the Secretary certifies whether the FEIR has complied with MEPA. G.

There is no argument made here that these projected quantities exceed the mandatory EIR threshold for air pollution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The issue of timing is important here \u2014 i.e., the fact that the petition in this case was filed within a few months after the EJ policy became applicable to the board. The EJ policy does impose a general, but affirmative, requirement on all agencies covered by it (and therefore the board) to develop strategies designed \u201cto proactively promote environmental justice in all neighborhoods\u201d in a manner tailored to and consistent with that agency\u2019s \u201cspecific mission\u201d; and to promote, inter alia, \u201crulemakings or other actions intended to further environmental justice in the Commonwealth.\u201d There may be an argument that under this general requirement, the board, in connection with issuing \u201cits own list of [petition review] guidelines\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 69J14, fourth par., or otherwise, has an obligation under the EJ policy to incorporate specific environmental justice principles into its consideration of petitions to construct generating facilities.

At most, during the coldest days of winter, ULSD deliveries would occur twice per hour. The board noted that the company would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>minimize the impact of deliveries by scheduling deliveries during the period of lowest traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The board\u2019s conclusion that the designated routes will minimize these impacts is supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P. The town\u2019s expert testified that it would be difficult for trucks carrying ULSD to make a left-hand turn from Route 106 to Route 18, as required to approach the facility from the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
