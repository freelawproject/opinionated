One of those offenses was the dissemination of visual material depicting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct, one of the \u201csex offense[s] involving a child\u201d enumerated in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, that requires a defendant convicted of such an offense to be subject to GPS monitoring as a condition of any term of probation, during \u201cthe length of his probation for any such offense.\u201d We are called upon to decide whether the imposition of GPS monitoring in such circumstances is mandatory and, if so, whether such statutory mandate either constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, or violates substantive and procedural due process pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and arts. 1,10,11, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">It is plain that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, affords a sentencing judge no discretion whether to impose GPS monitoring on a defendant sentenced, as here, to a probationary term for an enumerated offense. Although, given the inadequate record before us, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, we conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, does not violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process. Because the statute applied to the defendant in the circumstances, and because there was no constitutional bar to its application, the failure to include GPS monitoring as a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation was error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On August 15, 2011, a Suffolk County grand jury issued two indictments charging dissemination or possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of obscene matter, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29; two indictments charging dissemination of visual material depicting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29B, a predicate offense under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47; and one indictment charging purchase or possession of visual material depicting a child involved in sexual conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C. The defendant, who had no previous convictions of a sex offense, had acquired child pornography through LimeWire, an Internet-based file sharing system. The allegation that the defendant engaged in distribution stemmed from the fact that the defendant\u2019s use of LimeWire\u2019s default settings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permitted other users to access his files.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In conjunction with a proposed plea agreement, the Commonwealth submitted a sentencing memorandum proposing that the defendant be sentenced to from four to five years in State prison followed by ten years of probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After conducting two lobby conferences and reviewing an expert forensic evaluation of the materials found on the defendant\u2019s computer, the judge convened a plea and sentencing hearing on December 10, 2012. During the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy, the judge and both counsel discussed whether the defendant would be required to wear a GPS device as one of the conditions of his probation. A member of the court staff informed the judge that the imposition of GPS monitoring as a condition of probation was discretionary. The judge then sentenced the defendant to a one-year term of incarceration for his convictions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a729 and 29C, and to a probationary period of five years for his convictions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a729 and 29B. She declined to require that the defendant wear a GPS device as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Three days later, the Commonwealth sought and was granted a further hearing, at which it argued that, pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, GPS monitoring was a required condition of probation for the offense of dissemination of visual material depicting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct to which the defendant had pleaded guilty. The judge again declined to impose GPS monitoring.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In so doing, she noted that the statute was \u201cproblematic\u201d for its failure to distinguish between contact sex offenders and noncontact offenders, and explained that \u201cdealing with this case individually\u201d had led her to conclude that GPS monitoring was unnecessary. Several months later, the Commonwealth filed a petition for relief in the county court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, requesting that the single justice vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings in accordance with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant opposed the petition, arguing that GPS monitoring would violate his right against unreasonable searches and seizures and his right to due process under both the State and Federal Constitutions. The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>a. <em>Requirements under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47. </em>The parties dispute whether G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, mandates GPS monitoring as a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation. The Commonwealth contends that, where a defendant is convicted of an enumerated offense and subsequently sentenced to a term of probation, the sentencing judge has no discretion to decline to impose GPS monitoring as a condition of that probation. The defendant maintains, to the contrary, that the judge is permitted to determine on a case-by-case basis whether GPS monitoring is appropriate given a defendant\u2019s risk of reoffense.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">To determine whether G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, affords a sentencing judge any discretion concerning the imposition of GPS monitoring as a term of probation for certain predicate offenses, we begin with the plain language of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanson H., </em>464 Mass. 807, 810 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>453 Mass. 739, 743 (2009). Ordinarily, we will \u201cnot look beyond the words of the statute where the language is plain and unambiguous,\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984), nor will we add words to the statute that the Legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 126 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">General Laws c. 265, 47, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cAny person who is placed on probation for any offense listed within the definition of \u2018sex offense,\u2019 a \u2018sex offense involving a child\u2019 or a \u2018sexually violent offense,\u2019 as defined in [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C,] shall, as a requirement of any term of probation, wear a global positioning system device ... at all times for the length of his probation for any such offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In turn, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, defines the terms \u201c[sjex offense\u201d and \u201c[s]ex offense involving a child\u201d to include the dissemination of visual material depicting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct, as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29B.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Because \u201c[t]he word \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily interpreted as having a mandatory or imperative obligation,\u201d <em>Hashimi </em>v. Kalil, 388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983), we have determined that the GPS requirement of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, applies to any defendant who has been convicted of a predicate offense and sentenced to a term of probation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canadyan, </em>458 Mass. 574, 575 n.2 (2010) (\u201cHaving been placed on probation for a \u2018sex offense,\u2019 the defendant was required to wear a [GPS device] as a condition of his probation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 569 (2009) (GPS requirement of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, \u201capplies to <em>every </em>person who is convicted of [predicate] crimes and receives a probationary term as part of the criminal proceeding\u2019s disposition\u201d). Thus, we conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, affords judges no discretion to decide whether GPS monitoring should apply in any particular set of circumstances; where a defendant is convicted of a qualifying offense and is sentenced to a term of probation, the sentencing judge must impose GPS monitoring as a condition of that probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">b. <em>Constitutional claims. </em>We turn to the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments. The defendant contends that the imposition of GPS monitoring would violate his right to due process under both the Federal and State Constitutions. Specifically, he objects to the determination that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, affords a sentencing judge no discretion to decide whether GPS monitoring ought to be imposed on an individual defendant, including those who have committed only noncontact offenses. Because the Legislature may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>establish, within constitutional limits, mandatory minimum sentences for certain predicate offenses, and because G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, constitutes no more than such a sentence, we conclude that the imposition of GPS monitoring on the defendant would not offend due process. The defendant also maintains that GPS monitoring would encroach upon his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The record here, however, is too sparse to permit an adequate assessment of the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, and we accordingly decline to reach it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">i. <em>Due process. </em>\u201cA probation condition is enforceable, even if it infringes on a defendant\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights, so long as the condition is \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to the goals of sentencing and probation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>435 Mass. 455, 459 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 403 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 17 (2010). The defendant urges that we employ this \u201creasonably related\u201d test to assess whether GPS monitoring constitutionally may be imposed on all probationers convicted of predicate offenses. Doing so, he contends, would compel the conclusion that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, offends due process as applied to defendants convicted, as he was, of only noncontact sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The \u201creasonably related\u201d test, however, is inapplicable here. To date, we have used that test only to analyze the validity of conditions of probation that are imposed by a sentencing judge in his or her discretion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>465 Mass. 372, 389 (2013) (\u201cIn determining a sentence, a judge is authorized ... to impose any conditions that the judge deems proper\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, supra </em>at 459, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 92 (1993) (\u201cA judge, in furnishing an appropriate individualized sentence, may consider \u2018many factors\u2019 . . . \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 402-403 (discussing sentencing judge\u2019s latitude in imposing conditions on probation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>414 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996) (noting that \u201cthe judge should consider several goals\u201d in imposing sentence). We have never applied the \u201creasonably related\u201d test to those conditions of probation that the Legislature has concluded are mandatory. Instead, where the Legislature has prescribed particular punishments for a given offense, we ask only whether that mandatory sentence meets the rational basis test. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, </em>401 Mass. 237, 241-242 (1987) (applying rational basis test to due process challenge to mandatory minimum sentence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 918 (1976) (legislatively mandated punishments subject only to rational basis review and need not withstand \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">This diminished level of scrutiny is based on our recognition that, while \u201c[a] judge\u2019s latitude in sentencing is great but not infinite,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 857, 859 (2009), the Legislature has broad power to determine the appropriate punishment for a given offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 909 (\u201cLegislature has great latitude to . . . prescribe penalties to vindicate the legitimate interests of society\u201d); <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>283 Mass. 369, 374 (1933) (\u201cIt is for the General Court in the main to establish the maximum terms of sentence for the several crimes known to the law\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224, 233 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>369 Mass. 242, 248 (1975) (Tauro, C.J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 610-611 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We have recognized also that, by establishing mandatory minimum sentences for particular offenses, the Legislature curtails the ability of a sentencing judge to determine the appropriate sentence in a given case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, supra </em>at 239, citing <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983) (\u201cthe Legislature has latitude in determining limits on the discretion that the trial judges possess in sentencing convicted criminals\u201d). Since a term of probation constitutes a \u201csentence\u201d, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, supra </em>at 414, the Legislature likewise may restrict a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion to determine the terms of probation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 919; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189, 199 (1969), quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 586 (1959) (\u201cUnless the punishment exceeds a constitutional limit, the task of assigning penalties is for the Legislature\u201d). Indeed, in construing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, we have not questioned the Legislature\u2019s ability to establish mandatory conditions of probation in general or to require GPS monitoring in particular. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanson H., </em>464 Mass. 807, 810-817 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>453 Mass. 739, 748 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In light of this, we discern no reason to apply the \u201creasonably related\u201d test to such legislatively mandated conditions of probation as the requirement of GPS monitoring in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47. Accordingly, we do not consider whether the imposition of GPS monitoring as a mandatory condition of probation for those convicted of certain predicate offenses pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, is reasonably related to the goals of sentencing and probation. Instead, we inquire only whether there is a rational basis to support the Legislature\u2019s determination. We conclude that there is.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Permissible legislative objectives concerning criminal sentencing include deterrence, isolation and incapacitation, retribution and moral reinforcement, as well as reformation and rehabilitation. See <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 499 (1981), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, supra </em>at 251 &amp; n.11. The provisions of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, reasonably can be viewed as serving many, if not all, of these goals. We have noted the danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 159 (2004). The Legislature permissibly has determined that the risk of being subjected to GPS monitoring might deter future or repeat offenders. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 571 (2009) (penal nature of GPS monitoring promotes deterrence). The Legislature similarly was free to conclude that enabling police to track the movements of all convicted sex offenders would promote the security and well-being of the general public. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Board, </em>450 Mass. 780, 789-790 (2008). Within constitutional limitations, the Legislature may establish harsh punishments for particular offenses in order to discourage reoffense and promote rehabilitation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 912-913 (Legislature had not \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ceeded its prerogative\u201d in imposing \u201charsh, inflexible sentence\u201d). \u201cThe present statute,\u201d therefore, \u201cis obviously an attempt to deter through a nondiscretionary penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, supra </em>at 572, and note again today, that \u201c[t]he sanction [of GPS monitoring] appears excessive ... to the extent that it applies without exception to convicted sex offenders sentenced to a probationary term, regardless of any individualized determination of their dangerousness or risk of reoffense.\u201d At least for purposes of due process analysis, however, this is \u201ca debate that has already been settled on the floor of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, supra </em>at 242. In promulgating G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, the Legislature saw fit to impose GPS monitoring as a condition of probation even for those sex offenders convicted of noncontact offenses. See <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 415, 429 (1995) (it is for Legislature to determine best means by which to address issues implicating public safety). We cannot say that the Legislature\u2019s determination is without rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">ii. <em>Search and seizure. </em>We generally decline \u201cto consider constitutional issues for the first time on appeal in order to avoid an unnecessary constitutional decision.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 613 n.4 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, supra </em>at 743. This is particularly so where \u201cthe record accompanying [constitutional claims] is lacking ... in providing a basis for their intelligent resolution.\u201d <em>Gagnon, petitioner, </em>416 Mass. 775, 780, 625 N.E.2d 555 (1994), citing <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>410 Mass. 847, 850 n.7 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">While the defendant contends that the imposition of GPS monitoring constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure of his person, questions of reasonableness are necessarily fact-dependent. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 383 (2007) (in Fourth Amendment context, court must \u201cslosh [its] way through the factbound morass of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krisco Corp., </em>421 Mass. 37, 42 (1995) (reasonableness inquiry in Fourth Amendment context \u201cis highly dependent on the particular facts involved\u201d). Here, neither the Commonwealth nor the defendant presented evidence concerning the details of the GPS monitoring to which the defendant is subject. Absent such a record, we are unable to address the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>378 Mass. 202, 203 (1979) (\u201cWhere constitutional questions and matters of asserted public policy are raised, it is preferable to pass on the issues in light of a fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>developed trial record rather than, as here, in the abstract\u201d); <em>Tardiff, </em>petitioner, 328 Mass. 265, 267, 103 N.E.2d 265 (1952), quoting <em>Atlantic Maritime Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>228 Mass. 519, 522 (1917) (fact-finding duty \u201cis not an appropriate function of a court of last resort\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Where the defendant was sentenced to a probationary term for a predicate offense pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 7, the sentencing judge was mandated to impose GPS monitoring as a condition of probation. Because the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is now moot, however, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>we remand the matter to the single justice for entry of a judgment dismissing the Commonwealth\u2019s petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">On December 9, 2013, approximately one year after she initially sentenced the defendant, and after she had denied the Commonwealth\u2019s subsequent motion that global positioning system (GPS) monitoring be imposed, the sentencing judge added GPS monitoring as a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation, and reduced the term of his probationary period from five years to two years. The appellate attorneys did not become aware of this modification until after the case had been briefed and argued; on March 20, 2014, the Commonwealth notified this court of the modified terms of the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Although the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is now moot, \u201cwe exercise our discretion!, as both parties request we do,] to hear the merits of this case because the issue is of significant public interest, fully briefed by the parties, and very likely to arise again in similar circumstances, yet evade review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanson H., </em>464 Mass. 807, 808 n.2 (2013), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 560 n.3 (2009) (deciding whether G.

L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, namely, the dissemination of visual material depicting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct, and was sentenced to a probationary term of five years for that offense and two others. He therefore falls within the ambit of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The defendant does not challenge the mandatory requirements of G.
