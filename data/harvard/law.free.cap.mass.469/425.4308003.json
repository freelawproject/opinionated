L. c. 233, \u00a7 20C, unconstitutional. He argues that, in litigating his own motions to suppress, he should have been afforded target standing to challenge the violation of his alleged coventurers\u2019 constitutional rights. He further argues that the witness immunity statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20C, is facially unconstitutional, in that it operates to benefit only the Commonwealth and unfairly skews the adversary system, and unconstitutional as applied to him, in that the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on a \u201cspate\u201d of immunized witnesses deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The defendant also contends that the trial judge\u2019s failure to exclude identification testimony, and his failure to instruct the jury pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-448 (2004), concerning the partial recording of the defendant\u2019s interrogation by police, were erroneous and require a new trial. Concluding that there was no prejudicial error, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions. After a review of the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we discern no reason to exercise our power to reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder to a lesser degree of guilt or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">1. <em>Introduction. </em>On December 16, 2008, the victim\u2019s body was found burning in a pit on Jennifer Lane in Hyannis. The victim, sixteen year old Jordan Mendes, had been stabbed in the neck and face twenty-seven times, and had suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was last seen alive shortly after 2 p.m., the end of the school day, on December 15, 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Forty-five witnesses testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, five of them pursuant to a grant of immunity. The prosecutor elicited testimony that the victim, his half-brother Charlie M.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (then aged thirteen), and the defendant (then aged twenty), were involved in the sale of drugs, particularly the prescription painkiller Percocet. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant, as part of a joint venture with Charlie and John R., also thirteen at that time, killed the victim in a scheme to steal drugs and cash from him. The defense theory was that Charlie, the picked-on younger brother of the victim, was the true culprit, who retaliated against the victim\u2019s bullying by killing him, without the defendant\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Before the defendant was questioned in connection with the victim\u2019s death, police interviewed both Charlie and John on December 18, 2008. Charlie and John made statements inculpating the defendant, and based on those statements, police issued a \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert for the defendant. Police stopped the defendant in his vehicle later that night and brought him to Barnstable police headquarters, where he was interrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Information learned in the course of John\u2019s interview also was set forth in the affidavit supporting the application for a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle, which was allowed. In proceedings against Charlie and John, however, a Juvenile Court judge suppressed the entirety of Charlie\u2019s December 18, 2008, statement to police, and most of John\u2019s, due to the officers\u2019 failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to follow proper procedures for interrogating juveniles under the age of fourteen. Before trial, the defendant unsuccessfully sought to have suppressed the evidence seized pursuant to the search of his vehicle. He argued, inter alia, that information in the search warrant affidavit that had been obtained from John in contravention of John\u2019s constitutional rights should have been redacted, and that what would have remained following such redaction was insufficient to establish probable cause. A Superior Court judge disagreed, ruling that there was no need to suppress evidence against the defendant obtained as a result of a violation of a third party\u2019s constitutional rights, and that, in any event, even if the affidavit were redacted as the defendant wanted, there would still have been probable cause for the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">2. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have found the following. The victim, a sophomore at Barnstable High School, lived with his grandmother in an apartment in Hyannis. He had his own bedroom, which he always locked when he was not at home; even his grandmother could not access his bedroom without the key. He also had installed locks on his closet doors. On his belt loop, he carried a key chain that included a key to his grandmother\u2019s apartment, a key to a safe, and a key bearing the Boston Red Sox insignia. The victim\u2019s room was very neat, and he swept the floor in a particular manner so that he would be able to see footprints if someone had been in his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The victim spent a great deal of time with his half-brother Charlie and was often at Charlie\u2019s mother\u2019s house on Arrowhead Drive in Hyannis (Arrowhead Drive house). The two were both involved in selling drugs, particularly Percocet. The victim often carried large amounts of cash, and at least once was seen with up to $10,000 on his person, which he organized into stacks of $1,000, folding each stack in half and wrapping it with a rubber band.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">a. <em>Monday, December 15, 2008. </em>After school ended at 2 p.m. on December 15, 2008, a classmate dropped the victim off on Arrowhead Drive. Charlie, John, and the defendant also had been dropped off at the Arrowhead Drive house around the same time by Diana R.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> one of the defendant\u2019s classmates at Cape Cod Community College. Charlie telephoned Louis L.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a student at Barnstable High School, expressing interest in purchasing a black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Nissan Maxima that Louis was selling for $11,000. Louis and his girl friend picked up Charlie and the defendant in the Nissan and drove to the high school parking lot. At the school, Charlie gave Louis $11,000 in cash, which was organized into piles of $1,000, with each stack folded in half and wrapped in a rubber band; a photograph of Charlie holding the cash, taken by Louis, was admitted in evidence at trial. The defendant showed Louis his driver\u2019s license, and Louis agreed to let the defendant test drive the vehicle with Charlie.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">At some point after 4 p.m., Charlie\u2019s grandmother, who was also the victim\u2019s grandmother, saw Charlie enter her locked apartment through the front door, using the victim\u2019s keys.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Charlie had never before used the victim\u2019s keys to enter the apartment. She asked Charlie if he would buy her some ginger ale, because she was not feeling well. After a stop at a convenience store, Charlie returned with the ginger ale to his grandmother\u2019s apartment, in a black vehicle, between 7 and 9 p.m.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Charlie\u2019s grandmother asked him if he had a cigarette, and he gave her a filtered menthol cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Later that evening, Charlie dropped by the house of the victim\u2019s godmother in Hyannis. The victim kept some of his belongings in the closet of the upstairs bathroom there, including a safe box containing money. Although another bathroom was available, Charlie waited for someone else to finish showering in order to use the upstairs bathroom in particular. After making use of that bathroom, he left.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">At approximately 8:00 p.m., the defendant, Charlie, and John met Louis at a pharmacy in Hyannis to return the Nissan, which the defendant had been driving, and Louis gave them back the $11,000 in cash. As they were walking away, Louis called after them that they had left their keys on a key chain in the ignition; he testified that he recognized the keys as belonging to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">At some time during the evening, the defendant telephoned Diana and told her that he would give her ten Percocet pills if she came to the Arrowhead Drive house right away, where he, Char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>lie, and John were. When Diana arrived at the house, she saw that the three of them had a \u201cbig bag\u201d containing, in her estimation, approximately one thousand Percocet pills; she testified that she never before had seen them with such a large supply. The four of them then spent time at another house on Elm Street before returning to the Arrowhead Drive house for the night. Diana initially did not want to spend the night at the Arrowhead Drive house, preferring instead to spend time with the victim, with whom she was \u201chooking up,\u201d but the three males repeatedly assured her that the victim would be coming to the house. While she waited for the victim to arrive, Diana consumed Percocet and Oxycontin with the others, and eventually agreed to spend the night.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Diana telephoned the victim throughout the night, but was unable to reach him. The victim never showed up at the Arrowhead Drive house.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">b. <em>Tuesday, December 16, 2008. </em>In the morning, Charlie asked Diana to drive him to his grandmother\u2019s apartment, because he was worried that the victim had not come to the Arrowhead Drive house the night before. Diana drove Charlie, John, and the defendant to the apartment. Once there, Charlie went into the victim\u2019s bedroom and then left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Charlie then said that he \u201cwanted to get a car,\u201d so Diana drove them to a dealership in Hyannis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Charlie and the defendant spoke with a salesman about purchasing a silver 2000 BMW and negotiated a sale price for the vehicle, which had a sticker price of $10,995.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Charlie presented $7,500 in cash and the defendant supplied the difference, grouped in $1,000 increments and wrapped in mbber bands. The vehicle was registered in the defendant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Meanwhile, the victim\u2019s grandmother was growing increasingly worried about her grandson, whom she had not seen since the previous day. She and the victim\u2019s mother drove to the houses of different friends and family members, looking for the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>to no avail. Charlie returned to his grandmother\u2019s apartment with John between 5 and 6 p.m. that evening, wearing a new jacket. His grandmother took the victim\u2019s keys from Charlie and went into the victim\u2019s bedroom. She noticed that there was duct tape on a door in the room; she testified that the victim was \u201cimmaculate about his room\u201d and would not have put tape on his door.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The victim\u2019s grandmother then received a telephone call from her son, the father of both Charlie and the victim, who told her to take the victim\u2019s sister with her to check the places where the children used to play. Charlie and John then left the apartment. Sometime early that evening, Charlie was seen behind the wheel of a BMW at a local gasoline station, as the defendant walked towards it, carrying a red gasoline can. The defendant got into the BMW and John came out of it, holding the can as he walked toward the gasoline pumps.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Approximately twenty-five minutes after leaving her apartment, the victim\u2019s grandmother and sister arrived at a place in the woods where the children often spent time. They noticed a bright orange light in the distance, and realized that it was a fire emanating from a pit. The victim\u2019s body was burning at the bottom of the pit. Emergency personnel arrived at the scene, extinguished the fire, and extracted the victim\u2019s body, which had been wrapped in a sheet and a comforter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Evidence later recovered from the scene included a package of Newport menthol cigarettes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a red pushpin, and a pink Starburst candy;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a certified accelerant detection dog also twice alerted to the presence of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">After she received news of the victim\u2019s death, Diana telephoned the defendant and asked him if he knew what had happened and whether he knew who was responsible. The defendant responded, \u201cWe think we have an idea,\u201d and told her that he and Charlie were going to New York.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">c. <em>Thursday, December 18, 2008. </em>On December 18, 2008, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>defendant drove in the BMW to the home of his friend Sam T.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant was carrying bags of Oxycontin and Percocet pills, and showed Sam a \u201cwad\u201d of cash that appeared to be at least $1,000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Along with two other friends, they went to the mall, where the defendant spent cash on purchases for a friend and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Later that evening, after dropping off the other friends, Sam and the defendant drove to Wellfleet to meet their friend Ella M. During the trip, the defendant said, \u201cI have something to tell you. I killed Jordan Mendes. I shot him, and I stabbed him. I bodied him.\u201d He said that he and Charlie had planned to rob the victim for his money,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but then \u201cshit went bad\u201d and he shot the victim while they were in the basement of the Arrowhead Drive house after school one day, and also stabbed him in the neck. The defendant told Sam that he and Charlie had rolled the body in a blanket, thrown it in a ditch, and burned it with gasoline. The defendant went on to say that he was not worried about getting caught because he had \u201ccleaned it up\u201d with bleach.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In Wellfleet, the two picked up Ella<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and drove to a restaurant. Sam went inside the restaurant while the defendant and Ella consumed a crushed Percocet pill in the vehicle, using a $100 bill that the defendant supplied to inhale it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant told Ella that he \u201chad all the money in the world\u201d and wanted to spoil her and take her out to dinner whenever she desired. After they were seated inside the restaurant, the defendant told Ella that he loved her but that he was \u201cgoing away for a long time\u201d and that she would not be able to see him. He then took a \u201cwad of money\u201d out of his pocket and scattered it on the table. Ella counted somewhere between $500 and $1,000, but the defendant said that he had over $28,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">After dinner, Ella and the defendant continued to talk in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>BMW. When Ella asked him how he came to have so much money, the defendant told her, \u201cWe jumped someone,\u201d and that he had robbed that person of his pills and money.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant, \u201cvery nervous [and] shaking,\u201d said that \u201cit was a mess\u201d and \u201cmentioned something about blood.\u201d He said that he was going to be in a lot of trouble and reiterated that he would be going away for a long time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Sam and the defendant dropped off Ella and returned to Sam\u2019s house, where the defendant left pills, approximately $2,000 in cash, and a knife. On the way back from Sam\u2019s house, the defendant was stopped by police, who had received a \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert regarding a BMW registered to the defendant. An officer of the Barnstable police department read the defendant the Miranda rights after the defendant got out of the vehicle, but did not place him under arrest. Another officer asked the defendant if he would go voluntarily to the police station to speak with detectives about a recent homicide, and the defendant agreed. The BMW was towed to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">A redacted<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> recording of the defendant\u2019s interview with police was played for the jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> During the interview, the defendant did not admit to killing the victim, but made statements concerning his whereabouts over the prior days that were inconsistent with other evidence. For example, he claimed that, after Diana dropped him off at the Arrowhead Drive house on the afternoon of December 15, 2008, he stayed there for the rest of the day, and maintained that he spent the entirety of December 16, 2008 at his own home in South Yarmouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">d. <em>Police investigation, </em>i. <em>Search of Arrowhead Drive house. </em>Police searched the Arrowhead Drive house pursuant to a warrant, finding, among other things, a number of stains in the base<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ment that tested positive for the presence of blood.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A forensic expert testified that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) consistent with the victim\u2019s DNA profile was found in several of the blood stains, including stains on the wall, on an end table, on a remote control, and on the floor.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> She testified that the probability of the DNA profile of a randomly selected Caucasian individual matching that found in the blood stains was at least 1 in 19.18 quintillion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Additionally, a DNA mixture from at least two individuals was found on a sneaker, to which the victim and the defendant were included as potential contributors and Charlie and John were excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">ii. <em>Search of Nissan. </em>In Louis\u2019s Nissan, between the passenger seat and the center console, police found a black folding knife that tested positive for the presence of blood and contained a DNA mixture of at least two individuals. The major profile of DNA extracted from the knife blade was consistent with that of the victim, and the defendant could not be excluded as a potential contributor. The probability of DNA in the mixture matching the DNA profile of a randomly selected Caucasian individual was 1 in 28. A tennis racquet that tested positive for the presence of blood and bore DNA consistent with the victim\u2019s was found in the Nissan\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">iii. <em>Search of BMW. </em>Pursuant to a search warrant, police found a number of new articles of clothing, with store tags still on them, in the trunk of the defendant\u2019s BMW, as well as some clothing that appeared to have been worn. One T-shirt and one pair of sneakers that appeared to have been worn tested positive for the presence of blood; DNA found on the T-shirt matched the defendant\u2019s profile, and neither the victim nor John could be excluded as contributors to DNA found on the sneaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant raises constitutional issues concerning the availability of \u201ctarget standing\u201d under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the witness immunity statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20E. The defendant also argues that there was error in the admission of testimony from a police officer who identified him as the person shown in surveillance footage, and in the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">a. <em>Target standing. </em>Probable cause to stop and search the defendant\u2019s BMW rested in part on statements made by John and Charlie implicating the defendant. A Juvenile Court judge ordered the majority of those statements suppressed in the juvenile proceedings against John and Charlie, primarily due to the failure of police to adhere to the protocol established by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128, 134 (1983), for interrogating juveniles under the age of fourteen. The defendant argues that, as the real target of the police investigation, he should have been granted standing to assert the violation of John and Charlie\u2019s constitutional rights in litigating his own motions to suppress, and the failure to afford him such standing resulted in the erroneous denial of his motions. He asks this court to recognize the concept of target standing, which we have not done previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although the United States Supreme Court has rejected the theory under the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 133-138 (1978), \u201c[w]e have left open the question whether target standing has vitality under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scardamaglia, </em>410 Mass. 375, 379 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>406 Mass. 425, 429 (1990). We have expressed a \u201creluctance to grant a wide scope to target standing, and perhaps thereby to deny the trier of fact highly relevant evidence of guilt,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 380, but have recognized certain circumstances in which allowing such standing may have a salutary deterrent effect on police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">For example, \u201c[ujnconstitutional [police conduct directed at] small fish intentionally undertaken in order to catch big ones may have to be discouraged by allowing the big fish, when caught, to rely on the violation of the rights of the small fish, as to whose prosecution the police are relatively indifferent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, supra </em>at 429, citing 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.3(h), at 354-355 (2d ed. 1987). See 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.3(h), at 301 (5th ed. 2012) (posing hypothetical situation in which target standing might lie where X is arrested for armed robbery, and subsequently, \u201cacting with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>specific intention of finding additional evidence incriminating X with respect to that crime, the police conduct a fruitful search of X\u2019s wife\u201d). Nonetheless, \u201cthe need to create a deterrent effect on police misconduct by the recognition of target standing is not great except perhaps in the case of distinctly egregious police conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scardamaglia, supra </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We need not resolve in this case the extent of the availability of target standing under art. 14, because the defendant\u2019s claim that he was, in fact, the target of the police investigation is belied by the record. Rather than pointing to the defendant as the \u201cbig fish\u201d that police sought, the record indicates that, before conducting the interviews, police had information suggesting that Charlie and John, in addition to the defendant, could have played significant roles in the victim\u2019s death, and actively were pursuing both juveniles as suspects. Police officers testified at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress that they knew prior to the interviews that Charlie had used the victim\u2019s keys to access the victim\u2019s bedroom on December 15, 2008, and that the victim never gave his keys to anyone; that the victim\u2019s grandmother believed that the victim had in his possession a large amount of cash, which Charlie was trying to find; that Charlie was known to own a gun; that John, who had been with Charlie earlier in the day on December 16, 2008, had been seen running from the rear of the Arrowhead Drive house as police approached; that the defendant recently had purchased a BMW; and that Charlie, John, and someone matching the defendant\u2019s description had been seen near a silver BMW with a gasoline container.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Thus, unlike a wife who is searched by police with the specific intent of finding evidence incriminating her husband, Charlie and John were not ostensibly innocent \u201csmall fish, as to whose prosecution the police [were] relatively indifferent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, supra </em>at 429. Rather, insofar as information already known to police suggested the juveniles\u2019 material involvement in the victim\u2019s death, it appears that police \u201cwere genuinely interested in implicating [them], and thus the added threat of exclusion vis-a-vis [the defendant] would not seem necessary in such circumstances.\u201d 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.3(h), at 305 (5th ed. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Indeed, it is not the case that Charlie and John were without opportunity to contest the police misconduct directed at them, a circumstance which otherwise might counsel in favor of allowing a third party to assert their rights instead. To the contrary, in sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>arate criminal proceedings, Charlie and John both successfully challenged the violations of their respective constitutional rights, resulting in the suppression of all statements obtained as a result of those violations. To be sure, because both Charlie and John were juveniles under the age of fourteen, only the defendant could be prosecuted as an adult, subject to the prospect of a life sentence without the possibility of parole. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 58, 72B. See also G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. But that alone cannot suffice to establish the defendant as the actual target of the investigation, particularly where, as here, there was ample evidence of the juveniles\u2019 involvement. Thus, even assuming the availability of target standing under art. 14, the defendant cannot establish that he was the prime target of the police investigation and therefore was properly denied target standing to challenge the violations of the juveniles\u2019 constitutional rights.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">b. <em>Constitutionality of immunity statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20E. </em>The defendant also challenges the constitutional validity of the witness immunity statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20E, both facially and as applied to him. The defendant argues that the scheme for immunizing witnesses in the Commonwealth, whereby an order granting immunity to a trial witness may be issued only \u201cat the request of the attorney general or a district attorney,\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E <em>(a), </em>is unconstitutional insofar as it \u201cclearly inures to the benefit of only one party in our adversary system of justice.\u201d That the power to seek immunity for witnesses lies only with the government, the defendant contends, bestows on the prosecution \u201can undue tactical advantage,\u201d rendering a defendant\u2019s trial \u201cfun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>damentally unfair and its result unreliable.\u201d The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on a \u201cspate\u201d of immunized witnesses in his case deprived him of his Federal and State constitutional rights by undermining \u201cthe procedural safeguards which ostensibly protect the defendant from conviction based upon false evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Turning first to the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge, the Commonwealth in this case elicited testimony from five immunized witnesses: Diana, Louis, Sam, Sam\u2019s mother, and Ella.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Based on their testimony, viewed in the aggregate, the jury could have found that the defendant had been at the Arrowhead Drive house around the time that the victim was last seen alive on December 15, 2008; that he test-drove Louis\u2019s Nissan on December 15, 2008, in which the victim\u2019s keys were seen at the time and a knife later was found; that he had at least $2,000 in cash and large bags of pills on his person on December 18, 2008, some of which he sold; and that he confessed to shooting and stabbing the victim and robbing him of pills and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Defense counsel lodged his first objection to the Commonwealth\u2019s asserted overreliance on immunized witnesses before the fifth such witness took the stand, arguing that this excessive resort to offers of immunity constituted a \u201cstructural flaw.\u201d The judge took no action, noting that the objection had been raised \u201cat the eleventh hour.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Our jurisprudence has not vested criminal defendants with expansive rights vis-a-vis the immunization of witnesses. To the contrary, \u201c[w]e have held, without qualification, that a defendant \u2018has no standing to argue that the testimony of . . . purportedly immunized witnesses [is] the product of improper grants of immunity,\u2019 \u201d reasoning that \u201c[t]he privilege against self-incrimination is a personal right of the witness, and one that the witness is in a position to protect by his own means.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 345, 349 (1982), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>370 Mass. 119, 121 (1976). While a prospective defense witness\u2019s assertion of his right under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution could affect a defendant\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>present his defense most effectively, the compulsory process provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions do not mandate a judicial grant of immunity to such a witness as a matter of course. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>388 Mass. 637, 646 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>417 Mass. 619 (1994). Although we have left open the possibility that \u201cunique circumstances\u201d could require a judge to grant a limited form of immunity to a defense witness, see <em>id., </em>we have not been presented yet with such a scenario. See <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 827, 834 n.7 (2009) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Other courts have recognized that such unique circumstances might emerge \u201cwhere there exists prosecutorial misconduct arising from the government\u2019s deliberate intent to distort the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d 1169, 1190 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Granito </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 845 (1990), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 818 (2005), quoting <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>124 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (judicial grant of immunity not required where there was no evidence of \u201cattempt to harass or intimidate potential witnesses, or . . . that the prosecutor deliberately withheld immunity for the purpose of hiding exculpatory evidence from the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Here, however, the defendant has pointed to no such prosecutorial misconduct, nor has he even suggested the existence of a witness who was deterred from testifying in his favor due to his inability to secure a grant of immunity. Under these circumstances, \u201cwe see no logical basis for departing from the principle . .. that \u2018it is up to the jury to evaluate the credibility of a[n immunized] witness\u2019 . . . based merely upon the number of witnesses that received inducements from the government in exchange for their testimony.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142, 152 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 878 (1998), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1552 (5th Cir. 1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>462 Mass. 53, 74, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 796 (2012) (assessing credibility of witnesses who have received consideration in exchange for testimony is within province of jury). Standing alone, the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of immunized witnesses, particularly where a defendant has not sought to immunize his own prospective witness, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>deprive a defendant of his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Commonwealth is, in any event, constrained by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201, which provides that a defendant cannot be convicted solely on the basis of immunized testimony. That was not the situation here, as the immunized testimony was amply corroborated by nonimmunized witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>425 Mass. 357, 360 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>373 Mass. 11, 19 (1977) (\u201c[T]o provide the requisite credibility, \u2018there must be some evidence in support of the testimony of an immunized witness on at least one element of proof essential to convict the defendant\u2019 \u201d). There was evidence that a blood mixture containing DNA matching the victim\u2019s, to which the defendant could not be excluded as a potential contributor, was found on a knife discovered in a vehicle that the defendant had been driving. There was also testimony that, approximately one week before the victim\u2019s death and the defendant\u2019s purchase of the BMW, the defendant told a classmate that, within a week, he would \u201cbe getting a BMW for ten stacks.\u201d Although two of the immunized witnesses provided powerful testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s confession to them that he had killed the victim, a third, nonimmunized witness also testified to a similar statement by the defendant. Finally, the defendant was seen holding a tank of gasoline at a gasoline station shortly before the victim\u2019s body was discovered on fire, having been doused with an accelerant. This evidence \u201cnot only corroborate[d] the essential elements needed to convict the defendant but also link[ed him] to the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Other safeguards further preserved the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The judge instructed the jury, before each immunized witness testified, that they could consider a witness\u2019s grant of immunity in assessing his or her credibility, and gave a similar instruction in his final charge. The judge also instructed the jury in his final charge that they could not convict solely on the basis of immunized testimony. In addition, defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined four of the five immunized witnesses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>nature of the inducements they received from the government. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>458 Mass. 100, 110-111 (2010), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 548 (2011) (rejecting due process challenge to witness payments contingent on outcome of case where, inter alia, judge gave \u201ccomprehensive instructions concerning witness credibility\u201d and defense counsel cross-examined witnesses on nature of payments). We discern no basis to doubt that the defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Finally, because we conclude that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E, is constitutional as applied to the defendant, his facial challenge must fail. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abramms, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 587 (2006) (Brown, J., concurring), citing <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 652 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (\u201cWhere a constitutional construction of a challenged statute is possible, a facial challenge must be rejected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">c. <em>Other errors, </em>i. <em>Identification testimony. </em>Eight still photographs extracted from video surveillance footage taken on December 15, 2008, at a convenience store were admitted in evidence at trial. A detective testified, over objection, that the person seen in the photographs was the defendant. The defendant argues that such identification testimony was improper and unduly prejudicial, because the criteria for the admission of lay opinion identification testimony were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The defendant is correct that the admission of this testimony was erroneous. The general rule is that a \u201cwitness\u2019s opinion concerning the identity of a person depicted in a surveillance photograph is admissible if there is some basis for concluding that the witness is more likely to correctly identify the defendant from the photograph than is the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleas, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 321, 326 (2000), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>729 F.2d 1158, 1160 (8th Cir. 1984). \u201cPut another way, \u2018such testimony is admissible . . . when the witness possesses sufficiently relevant familiarity with the defendant that the jury cannot also possess.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-327, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>48 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1995). If the witness lacks such familiarity, it is the province of the jury to draw their own conclusions regarding the identity of the person depicted without the witness\u2019s assistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>421 Mass. 357, 366 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 41-42 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>354 Mass. 249 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1039 (1969), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 137 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Here, there is no indication that the detective possessed any special familiarity with the defendant that the jury lacked, or that the defendant\u2019s appearance had changed since the time the footage was taken, such that the jury needed assistance in identifying the individual depicted. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 460 (1978) (police officer\u2019s testimony could aid jury in identifying person in photograph as defendant where officer testified that he had known defendant for long time and had seen him often, and defendant testified that he had lost twenty-five pounds since date photograph was taken).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Although we are cognizant of the \u201cincrease[d] potential for inappropriate prejudice to the defendant\u201d stemming from \u201cidentification testimony from a police officer who is so designated,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>464 Mass. 855, 879 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleas, supra </em>at 327, we cannot say that the improper testimony here constituted reversible error. The testimony, brief and fleeting as it was, did not overwhelm the other compelling, properly admitted evidence against the defendant. The defendant argues that the testimony \u201cplaced [him] near [the victim\u2019s] apartment around the time that the Commonwealth alleged he was murdered,\u201d but, where there was no indication that the defendant\u2019s appearance at trial was different than it was in the photographs, the jury were capable of drawing the same conclusion. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 968, 969 (1985) (erroneous identification testimony harmless where \u201cphotographs upon which the non-eyewitnesses based their opinions were introduced in evidence, permitting the jury to decide independently whether the defendant was the person on film\u201d). Moreover, the defendant, in his interview with police, admitted to being in the convenience store on the night in question. Thus, the improper testimony was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">ii. <em>Failure to give </em>DiGiambattista <em>instruction. </em>As discussed, see note 24, <em>supra, </em>the audio portion of the first four minutes of the defendant\u2019s police interview was not recorded, although there was a complete video recording. The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s failure to give an instruction pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423 (2004) (DiGiambattista), was prejudicial, where the prosecutor argued in her closing argument that there was no coercion during the interview, and where the jury asked to review the digital video disc (DVD) of the interview during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We do not agree with the defendant that the issue properly was preserved for appellate review. Generally, if defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>requests a specific instruction and the judge rejects it, or gives an instruction inconsistent with the requested one, we consider the objection to have been preserved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Biancardi, </em>421 Mass. 251, 253-254 (1995). Here, however, although defense counsel requested a <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction, the judge never rejected the request; rather, he told counsel that he would consider giving such an instruction in his final charge, but ultimately did not do so. Under the circumstances, \u201cit was entirely likely that the omission was inadvertent and that the judge would have rectified the error had it been brought to his attention. [Defense counsel] should have brought the omission to the judge\u2019s attention by objecting at the end of the charge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>452 Mass. 133, 139 (2008). Because he did not, our review is for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We held in <em>DiGiambattista, supra </em>at 447-448, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cwhen the prosecution introduces evidence of a defendant\u2019s confession or statement that is the product of a custodial interrogation or an interrogation conducted at a place of detention (e.g., a police station), and there is not at least an audiotape recording of the complete interrogation, the defendant is entitled (on request) to a jury instruction advising that the State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference that such interrogations be recorded whenever practicable, and cautioning the jury that, because of the absence of any recording of the interrogation in the case before them, they should weigh evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Further, \u201c[w]here voluntariness is a live issue and the humane practice instruction is given, [as it was here,] the jury should also be advised that the absence of a recording permits (but does not compel) them to conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The failure to give a <em>DiGiambattista </em>instmction was erroneous. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion, the State police sergeant\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> concerning the substance of the unrecorded portion of the interview does not cure \u201cthe failure to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>serve the evidence in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447 n.23. Nor is it the case, as the Commonwealth argues, that there was no need for a cautionary instruction because the entire recording was available to the defendant \u2022\u2014 the defendant had the full video recording, but no party had the full audio recording, which did not exist. Since the audiotape recording of the defendant\u2019s interrogation was incomplete and defense counsel requested the <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction, the requirements for giving such an instruction were met, and the instruction should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Nonetheless, there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant does not contest the interviewing State police sergeant\u2019s testimony as to the introductory nature of the first four minutes of the interview, and nothing in the record suggests that any substantive exchange took place during that time. To the contrary, the recorded portion began as the sergeant introduced himself and his partner to the defendant and explained that the interview would be recorded, tending to corroborate the sergeant\u2019s trial testimony. See note 33, <em>supra. </em>The recorded portion, spanning thirty-five pages of transcript, also captured the defendant\u2019s waiver of Miranda rights, and the form memorializing the waiver was admitted at trial. Thus, it appears that most, if not all, of the substance of the interview was recorded and played for the jury, who accordingly were well situated to determine the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In any event, even if the jury had disregarded the defendant\u2019s recorded statements in their entirety, there was ample other evidence supporting a conviction of murder in the first degree. The defendant\u2019s statements did not directly incriminate him, while other overwhelming evidence did. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 801-802 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011) (trial judge\u2019s error in giving only part of <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction did not prejudice defendant where his unrecorded police interview was \u201csome of the weakest evidence against him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">4. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we consider an error neither objected to by the defendant at trial nor raised in his appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Where, as here, the Commonwealth proceeds against a defendant on a joint venture theory of an offense that includes posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>sion of a weapon as an element, the judge should instruct the jury that they must find that the defendant knew of his coventurers\u2019 possession of that weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>460 Mass. 64, 68-70 (2011), and cases cited. After the defendant\u2019s 2011 trial, we clarified that, where the Commonwealth proceeds on alternate theories of a defendant\u2019s guilt (that the defendant was the main perpetrator of the offense or that his coventurer in fact carried out the offense), further explanation is required. In such a case, the judge should instruct the jury that, to convict the defendant, they must find either that a coventurer committed the offense and the defendant participated while knowing that the coventurer possessed a weapon, or that the defendant himself committed the offense with a weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolling, </em>462 Mass. 440, 450 (2012). \u201c[T]he requirement of knowledge of a weapon in the context of murder in the first degree on a joint venture theory applies only where the conviction is for felony-murder and the underlying felony has as one of its elements the use or possession of a weapon.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>465 Mass. 87, 100 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On all four offenses charged, the Commonwealth here proceeded against the defendant on alternate theories of his guilt. Three of those offenses included an element of possession of a weapon, namely, felony-murder with armed robbery as the predicate offense,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the armed robbery itself, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. As such, the judge should have instructed the jury regarding the requirement of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his alleged coventurers\u2019 possession of a dangerous weapon. However, his failure to do so did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant did not argue at trial that his alleged coventurers carried out the offenses with weapons that he did not know they possessed. Indeed, such a position would have been weak at best in light of evidence, such as confessions to two different people as well as DNA evidence, that the defendant himself used a weapon to kill the victim. It is therefore unlikely that the omitted jury instruction would have affected the outcome of the case, and we discern no reason, on this or any other basis, to order a new trial or to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the conviction of murder to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The defendant also was convicted of armed robbery, the predicate felony underlying the felony-murder conviction; two counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; and disinterring a body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The cause of death was determined to be a gunshot wound to the torso with perforations of the liver and colon, and incise and stab wounds to the head and neck, including trachea and major blood vessels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">There was no testimony concerning the time of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">A pseudonym.

A package of Starburst candies also was found in the basement, and a red gasoline tank was recovered from a shed in the backyard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The defendant presented one witness, a different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) expert, who testified that she would have excluded the defendant as a potential contributor to the DNA found on the knife blade.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The defendant is Caucasian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Since the defendant\u2019s argument fails because he was not in fact the prime target of the police investigation, we do not consider whether the police misconduct directed at John and Charlie was \u201cdistinctly egregious.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scardamaglia, </em>410 Mass. 375, 380 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\">We note also that the Superior Court motion judge found that there was probable cause to stop the defendant\u2019s BMW, seize it, and interrogate the defendant even without considering the information gleaned from illegally obtained statements, a finding that is supported by the record. In particular, before police issued the \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert for the defendant or stopped his vehicle, they had information that the defendant had been at the Arrowhead Drive house around the time that the victim was last seen alive; that Charlie and the defendant had purchased a BMW with cash on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, which was particularly significant given that the killing appeared to be motivated by robbery of a large amount of cash; and that Charlie, John, and a person matching the defendant\u2019s description were seen with a gasoline container shortly before the victim\u2019s body was found burning in a pit amidst an odor of gasoline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Commonwealth also intended to offer immunity to a sixth witness, and obtained an order granting immunity to a seventh witness. Both nonetheless refused to testify and were found to be in contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In a motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, defense counsel also raised the issue of the Commonwealth\u2019s excessive reliance on immunized witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to exercise our general superintendence power pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to announce a rule limiting the Commonwealth\u2019s authority to immunize witnesses. A prerequisite to the invocation of this court\u2019s \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d general superintendence power is \u201ca substantial claim of violation of [a litigant\u2019s] substantive rights,\u201d which has not been demonstrated here.
