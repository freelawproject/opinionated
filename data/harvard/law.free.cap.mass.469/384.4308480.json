L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), and specifically whether forfeiture is warranted where a teacher has engaged in criminal activity that endangers children generally, but does not involve the students whom he taught, the school district for which he worked, or the use of his status as a teacher. The plaintiff, Ronald T. Garney, a ninth grade science teacher, was arrested in 2006 for the purchase and possession of child pornography. Shortly after his arrest, he received notice that he would be dismissed from his position for conduct unbecoming a teacher and resigned prior to his dismissal. He subsequently pleaded guilty to purchasing and possessing child pornography. In August, 2007, when he reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>retirement age, Garney filed a retirement application with the defendant, the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (MTRS), and received retirement benefits until 2009, when the MTRS board (board) issued a decision concluding that Garney\u2019s benefits were forfeited by operation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), due to his convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A District Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision, and Garney petitioned for certiorari review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. A Superior Court judge reversed the decision of the District Court and vacated the decision of the board. MTRS appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Although cognizant of the severity of the offenses of which Garney was convicted, we conclude that on the specific facts of this case, those offenses neither directly involved his position as a teacher nor contravened a particular law applicable to that position, and therefore did not come within the forfeiture provision of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). Consequently, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge allowing Garney\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and vacating the board\u2019s decision otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Background. </em>For over twenty years, Garney worked as a ninth grade science teacher and served as a coach and referee at sporting events for the Amherst-Pelham regional school district (district).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In November, 2004, the office of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified Garney as a purchaser of child pornography in the course of an investigation into Web sites that sold such illicit material.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It informed the Amherst police department, which monitored Garney\u2019s postal mail, electronic mail (e-mail) address, and credit card activity until November 28, 2006, when it executed a warrant to search Garney\u2019s apartment. There, police found images of child pornography on his home computer, as well as several hand-labeled compact discs and video recordings, on either videotape cassettes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>or digital video discs, containing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Garney admitted to viewing child pornography since as early as 1994, to purchasing and possessing child pornography, and to joining several child pornography Web sites as early as 2000 or 2001. He indicated that he had renewed his membership to one such Web site in the weeks prior to his arrest and had last visited one of the Web sites the day prior to his arrest. Although Garney occasionally used an e-mail address issued to him by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to access the Web sites, there were no other connections to his position as a teacher. He accessed and stored the illicit material on his home computer, purchased it using his own funds, and did not possess or view material that depicted any of his students or otherwise involve them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">As a result of the investigation and Garney\u2019s arrest for the purchase and possession of child pornography, the superintendent of the school district informed Garney that the district intended to dismiss him for conduct unbecoming a teacher, pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. Two days prior to the effective date of his dismissal, on December 13, 2006, Garney resigned his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Garney was thereafter indicted and, on December 20, 2007, pleaded guilty to eleven counts of purchasing and possessing child pornography, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C. He was sentenced to from two and one-half to three years in a house of correction, followed by probation, registration as a sex offender, and other penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">On August 7, 2007, after his arrest but prior to his plea and sentencing, Garney filed a retirement application with MTRS. His retirement became effective on August 22, 2007, at which time he had twenty-two years and three months of retirement credit, and he began to receive a gross monthly retirement benefit of $2,393.78. On May 22, 2008, after his convictions, MTRS notified Garney that it was initiating proceedings to consider whether his convictions triggered the operation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), which requires forfeiture of public employee retirement benefits \u201cafter final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to [the employee\u2019s] office or position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>After receiving recommended findings of fact from a hearing officer, the board concluded on March 27, 2009, that Garney\u2019s retirement was forfeited by operation of both G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 10 (1) and 15 (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board determined that there was \u201ca direct link between Mr. Garney\u2019s employment and his possession of child pornography,\u201d in part because he used an e-mail address provided by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and that therefore he met the requirements of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), warranting forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">On Garney\u2019s petition for review pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (3), a District Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision. The judge observed that teachers occupy a position of special trust, see <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 349 (1983), and that the crime Garney committed directly contravened his duty to protect the welfare of children. Therefore, the requisite link between his criminal convictions and his public position was established, such that his crimes \u201cinvolv[ed] violation of the laws applicable to his office or position.\u201d See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). Relying on <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 175 (2006), the judge noted that the private nature of the crime, and the fact that it did not involve any school resources or any of Garney\u2019s students,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not call for a different result where the welfare of children is a core tenet of the teaching position, and the crime that Garney committed was directly at odds with this tenet.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Garney then petitioned the Superior Court for certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. A Superior Court judge allowed Garney\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, reversed the decision of the District Court judge, and vacated the decision of the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that Garney\u2019s pension was forfeited under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). Relying on our decisions in <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 171, and <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 4-5 (1996), the judge reasoned that, although Garney\u2019s crimes were severe and undoubtedly warranted both criminal prosecution and dismissal from his position, there was not a direct link between his convictions and his position as a teacher, because his criminal offenses did not involve the use of school resources and he did not use his position as a teacher to facilitate his crime. Further, the judge rejected the District Court judge\u2019s interpretation of <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 175, 179-180, and the argument of MTRS that because teachers fill a special societal role, a conviction of possession of child pornography necessarily violates the laws applicable to that role. MTRS appealed, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion to clarify the scope of our decision in <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 178-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Our review of the board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, is a limited one. See <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 173. We may \u201ccorrect only a substantial error of law, evidenced by the record, which adversely affects a material right of the plaintiff.... [and] may rectify only those errors of law which have resulted in manifest injustice to the plaintiff or which have adversely affected the real interests of the general public . . . .\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 790 (2000), quoting <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The parties\u2019 dispute pertains to the scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), which directs the forfeiture of a pension following certain criminal conduct by a member of a contributory retirement system for public employees. See <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>467 Mass. 662, 663 (2014). Section 15 (4) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn no event shall any member after final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, be entitled to receive a retirement allowance</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Where we must interpret the terms of a statute, we look \u201cto the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all [the statute\u2019s] words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934), and cases cited. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>(2001). Because G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15, involves the forfeiture of property, it is penal in nature, and we must draw its limits narrowly, so as not to exceed the scope or reach of the penalty as contemplated by the Legislature. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 174-175. See <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 3 &amp; n.3; <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 686-687 (1986) (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15, \u201cimposes a penalty on employees\u201d and \u201cenforce [s] the criminal law by suspending the sword of retirement benefits forfeiture over those employees who otherwise might be tempted to transgress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We have observed previously that \u201c[t]he substantive touchstone [of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4),] intended by the General Court is criminal activity <em>connected with </em>the office or position. . . . [T]he General Court did not intend pension forfeiture to follow as [an automatic consequence] of any and all criminal convictions. Only those violations related to the member\u2019s official capacity were targeted. Looking to the facts of each case for a <em>direct link </em>between the criminal offense and the member\u2019s office or position best effectuates the legislative intent of \u00a7 15 (4)\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 4-5. This \u201cdirect link\u201d requirement \u201cdoes not mean that the crime itself must reference public employment or the employee\u2019s particular position or responsibilities,\u201d <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Justices of the Quincy Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616 (2006), <em>S.C., Maher </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>452 Mass. 517 (2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1166 (2009), or that the crime necessarily must have been committed at or during work. <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 116, 119 (2013). However, where the crime itself does not reference public employment or bear a direct factual link through use of the position\u2019s resources, there must be some direct connection between the criminal offense and the employee\u2019s official capacity by way of the laws directly applicable to the public position. See <em>Gaffney, supra </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">It is clear that the criminal offenses for which Gamey was convicted neither referenced public employment nor bore a direct factual link to his teaching position. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 29C. Gamey committed his crimes outside of school, without using school resources or otherwise using his position to facilitate his crimes, and without involving students in his illicit activities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In numerous cases, this lack of a factual link has been fatal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>retirement board\u2019s claim that forfeiture is warranted. See, e.g., <em>Retirement Bd. of Maynard </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 113 (2013) (no forfeiture where fire fighter sexually abused boys because offenses were \u201cpersonal in nature, occurring outside the firehouse while [fire fighter] was not on duty,\u201d and \u201cno evidence that [fire fighter] used his position, uniform, or equipment for the purposes of his indecent acts\u201d); <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Beverly, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543, 545 (2011) (no forfeiture where public library employee convicted of possession of child pornography because offenses occurred at home on personal computer, and employee did not use position to facilitate crime); <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 646-647, 654 (2010) (no forfeiture where housing authority custodian convicted of indecent assault and battery of daughter because offense not committed on public property or against anyone who resided there, and otherwise had no connection to custodian\u2019s official position). See also Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. vs. Lambert, Mass. Super. Ct., No. SUCV200502540B, slip op. at 1-2, 9 (Mar. 26, 2007) (Superior Court judge held forfeiture not warranted where teacher convicted of possession of child pornography because offense committed at home, on personal computer, without involvement of any students or children known to teacher). Contrast <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 4, 5 (forfeiture where superintendent of town water and sewer department convicted of larceny because superintendent tasked with managing budget and stole from own department); <em>Durkin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 116-117, 119 (forfeiture where police officer convicted of assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon for shooting another officer with department-issued firearm while intoxicated off duty); <em>Maher, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 616-617 (forfeiture where city inspector convicted of breaking into city hall and stealing documents from own personnel file because \u201cmultiple, direct links\u201d between offenses and position).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Relying on our decision in <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 179-180, MTRS argues that, despite the lack of a factual connection between Carney\u2019s crimes and his public position, there is a direct link here because the position of a teacher is one that holds a special public trust, and Carney\u2019s criminal conduct of possessing child pornography strikes at the \u201cheart\u201d of this position by vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>lating one of its \u201cfundamental tenets,\u201d as embodied in the professional standards for teachers. As a result, MTRS contends, the board and the District Court judge correctly concluded that forfeiture was warranted. Gamey asserts that creating a distinct forfeiture category for teachers because of their special obligations to society would expand G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), \u201cto accomplish an unexpressed result,\u201d <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 175, and accordingly asks us to affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s determination that there was no direct link between Gamey\u2019s conduct and his position. We conclude that the fact that Gamey\u2019s position is one of special public tmst, and that criminal conduct of the type committed by Gamey violates that tmst, is insufficient in and of itself to warrant forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). Rather, the conduct must either directly involve the position or be contrary to a central function of the position as articulated in applicable laws, thereby creating a direct link to the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">1. <em>Special public trust. </em>Undoubtedly, teachers hold a position of special public tmst; they must impart \u201cthe basic values of our society\u201d to students and ensure their well-being in the process. <em>Perryman, 17 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 351. See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 709 (1999) (Ireland, J., concurring); <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 538 (1983). Indeed, \u201cconduct consistent with this special trust is an obligation of the employment.\u201d <em>Perryman, supra </em>at 349. It is for this reason that teachers must demonstrate \u201csound moral character\u201d to acquire teacher certification, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38G, and may be suspended or dismissed from service where they engage in \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 42D, or have been convicted \u201cof a crime involving moral turpitude\u201d or that otherwise \u201cdiscredits the profession\u201d or demonstrates a lack of \u201cgood moral character,\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.15(8)(a)(l)(c) (2012). However, these parameters for entering or remaining in the profession are not the same as the standard for forfeiting a pension to which an employee has contributed and that he or she earned over the course of many years of public service. See <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 178-179 (\u201cstandard for pension forfeiture based on dereliction of duty is more narrow and specific\u201d than standard for dismissal, and not every offense implicating norms and expectations of position necessarily violates applicable law and requires forfeiture); <em>Durkin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 119 n.5 (\u201cnot every off-duty illegal act qualifies\u201d for forfeiture). See also <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 3 &amp; n.3 (language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 [4], must be constmed narrowly because of its penal character).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In advocating for a reading of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), that requires forfeiture where a teacher\u2019s criminal conduct violates the special public trust placed in teachers, MTRS misinterprets Bulger, 446 Mass. at 176-180, as adopting a broader reading of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), than the narrow language of the statute permits. Our decision in <em>Bulger, supra, </em>did not call for forfeiture whenever a special public trust is violated. Rather, the court concluded that forfeiture was warranted where a clerk-magistrate\u2019s specific criminal conduct, perjury and obstruction of justice, was directly contrary to the most fundamental tenets of his position, to ensure truth-telling injudicial matters and proceedings and to uphold the integrity of the judicial system. <em>Id. </em>These tenets and responsibilities were embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility for Clerks of the Courts, S.J.C. Rule 3:12, as amended, 427 Mass. 1322 (1998) (code), a law applicable to his position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 176-177. See also <em>Berkwitz, petitioner, </em>323 Mass. 41, 47 (1948) (court rules have force of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We reached a similar conclusion in a more recent case, <em>Buo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>nomo, </em>467 Mass. at 670-671. There, we concluded that a register of probate violated the laws applicable to his office by committing larceny, embezzlement, and associated crimes, because the code requires clerks and registers \u201cto contribute to the preservation of public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the courts\u201d and to \u201ccomply with the laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:12, Canons 1 and 2, as appearing in 407 Mass. 1301 (1990). His conduct, we determined, \u201ccompromised the integrity of and public trust in the office of register of probate\u201d and therefore explicitly violated the core function of his position as embodied in the provisions of the code. See <em>Buonomo, supra </em>at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The narrow basis for our holdings in <em>Bulger </em>and <em>Buonomo </em>demonstrates that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), requires something more specific than a violation of a special public trust in the particular public position. The plain language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), clearly requires a direct link between the criminal offense and a violation of the laws applicable to the office. <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 4-5. See <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 179 (where member is \u201cconvicted of a criminal offense that does <em>not </em>involve any violation of the laws applicable to his office or position ... the member does not forfeit his entitlement to a retirement allowance\u201d). Criminal conduct that is merely inconsistent with a concept of special public trust placed in the position or defiant of a general professional norm applicable to the position, but not violative of a fundamental precept of the position embodied in a law applicable to it, may be adequate to warrant dismissal, but it is insufficient to justify forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). See <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 179-180; <em>Gaffney, </em>423 Mass. at 4-5. See also <em>Tyler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 109-110, 113; <em>Scully, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 543, 545; <em>Herrick, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Were we to hold otherwise, and conclude that where a teacher\u2019s criminal conduct violates the special public trust placed in teachers, forfeiture is warranted, we would permit forfeiture nearly any time a teacher engages in criminal conduct. This would expand the parameters of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), well beyond what the Legislature intended for it to encompass. Cf. <em>Tyler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 112 (considerations of fire fighter\u2019s general obligation to protect the public \u201cwhile understandable, are so broad ... as to engulf nearly every public official, especially police officers and fire fighters, convicted of any crime. The reach of the statute as currently written is not so broad\u201d). Cf. also Lambert, Mass. Super. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Ct\u201e No. SUCV2005-02540B, slip op. at 9 (application of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 [4], cannot extend to any \u201cviolation of broad standards of fitness to serve as a teacher\u201d because this would expand scope beyond that intended by Legislature, as \u201c[virtually every criminal conviction of a teacher puts in question the soundness of his moral character and fitness for the position\u201d). Our reading of the statute is consistent with the mandate that we interpret the statute narrowly. See Bulger, 446 Mass. at 174-175.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">2. <em>Laws applicable to teaching position. </em>We turn next to whether Garney\u2019s conduct violated any laws applicable to his position as a teacher, and conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">At its core, the function of a teacher is that of educator. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 723, 2346 (1993) (defining \u201ceducate\u201d as \u201cto bring up\u201d or \u201cto train by formal instruction and supervised practice\u201d; defining \u201cteacher\u201d as \u201cone that teaches or instructs\u201d; and defining \u201cteach\u201d as \u201cto show, instruct,\u201d \u201cto cause to know a subject,\u201d and \u201cto impart the knowledge of\u2019). Teachers must give effect to the mandate embodied in Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, that \u201cthe magistrates and Legislatures of this Commonwealth . . . provide education in the public schools.\u201d <em>McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Educ., </em>415 Mass. 545, 621 (1993). This mandate derives from the belief that an educated people is \u201cessential to the preservation of... [a] democratic State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. Since 1789, teachers have been instructed to \u201cexert their best endeavors to impress on the minds of children and youth committed to their care and instruction the principles of piety and justice[,] ... a sacred regard for truth,\u201d and other virtues, such as humanity, sobriety, moderation, and temperance, and \u201cto point out to [students] the evil tendency of the opposite vices.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 30. See <em>McDuffy, supra </em>at 594 &amp; n.66, quoting St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Private possession of child pornography by a secondary school teacher does not directly contravene this central function where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>there is no indication that this possession compromised the safety, welfare, or learning of the children whom he was tasked with teaching or impeded his ability to provide adequate educational lessons to his students. As reprehensible as Gamey\u2019s crimes may be, the entirely private nature of his conduct does not call into question the effectiveness of the educational system of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The central function of the teaching position is buttressed by additional, important principles, the violation of which may be a ground for dismissal from a teaching position, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, but whose fulfilment is not so central to the role of the teacher in ensuring students\u2019 education that a violation justifies forfeiture of retirement benefits. For example, teachers are expected to \u201c[u]nderstand[ ] [their] legal and moral responsibilities\u201d and \u201c[u]nderstand[ ] legal and ethical issues as they apply to responsible and acceptable use of the Internet and other resources.\u201d See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.08(2)(e)(l), (7) (2005).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if Gamey\u2019s criminal offenses suggest a lack of understanding of these ethical obligations and responsibilities, his personal possession of pornography, without any known impact on his teaching or his students, cannot be said to violate the core function of teaching so as to create the direct link required between conduct and office for forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). The critical alignment of crime and office through an applicable law, as required by this narrow statute, is simply not present.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In this respect, a teacher\u2019s conduct that fails to reach inside the schoolhouse doors does not satisfy the standard for forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). For this reason, MTRS\u2019s claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Garney\u2019s status as a mandated reporter of child abuse provides the requisite connection for forfeiture also must fail. As a mandated reporter, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21, a teacher who, \u201cin his [or her] professional capacity, has reasonable cause to believe that a child is suffering physical or emotional injury resulting from [abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse]... shall immediately communicate with the [Department of Children and Families] ... [and] file a written report. . . detailing the suspected abuse or neglect\u201d or \u201cnotify the person or designated agent in charge of [the school].\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (a). See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, </em>437 Mass. 340, 352-353 (2002). The report filed must contain the names and addresses of the child and the adults responsible for the child\u2019s care, as well as the child\u2019s age, sex, extent of injuries or abuse, and other relevant information. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Although mandated reporters may report suspected abuse or neglect of which they become aware at any time, the duty to report applies only to information learned in one\u2019s professional capacity, in this case while Garney was fulfilling his teaching and coaching responsibilities. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (a) (duty applies when mandated reporter learns of abuse or neglect \u201cin his [or her] professional capacity\u201d). Not only did Garney not know the identities of the children in the pornography and therefore did not have the requisite information, but he also did not learn of this abuse in his professional capacity. As Garney\u2019s criminal conduct was independent of his role as a teacher, he was not required under the plain meaning of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, to report this conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In sum, we recognize that Garney\u2019s possession of child por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>nography, in violation of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 29C, was violative of children\u2019s safety, rights, and dignity overall, and further violative of the special public trust placed in teachers to ensure the welfare of children in the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 30; St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (enacting G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 29C). Nonetheless, there is no reference to public employment in the criminal statute under which Gamey was convicted, no direct factual link between Gamey\u2019s conduct and his teaching position, and no violation of any identifiable law applicable to that position. Consequently, we must conclude that forfeiture of Gamey\u2019s retirement benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 51 (4), was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the decision of the Superior Court reversing the decision of the District Court and vacating the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The board also concluded that Ronald T. Garney did not have a right to a superannuation retirement allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (1), because of his convictions. This issue was disposed of during the Superior Court proceedings and is not before us. See note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Gamey taught in the Amherst-Pelham regional school district from 1984 until his resignation in 2006.

We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 169, 171 (2006), a clerk-magistrate of the Boston Juvenile Court was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in Federal court during grand jury investigations of alleged criminal offenses committed by his brother, James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, and others, and of criminal offenses related to harboring and concealing James Bulger. In assessing whether the clerk-magistrate had violated a law applicable to his office in engaging in this criminal conduct, the court first identified the central functions of the clerk-magistrate position underlying its daily tasks: to administer oaths, thereby ensuring truth-telling; to ensure \u201cthe effective functioning of the courts\u201d; and to preserve the integrity of judicial processes. See <em>id. </em>at 176-177, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>439 Mass. 352, 359 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The court observed that the Code of Professional Responsibility for Clerks of the Courts (code), in \u201cenunciating the high standards to which clerks are held,\u201d forbids a broader range of conduct than that which merits forfeiture. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 177 &amp; n.6, 178. Among the code\u2019s requirements are that clerk-magistrates \u201ccomply with the laws of the Commonwealth [and] rules of the court\u201d and \u201cconduct personal affairs in such a way as not to cause public disrespect for the court and the judicial system.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:12, Canons 2 and 4(B), as appearing in 407 Mass. 1301 (1990). After considering the relationship between the code and the clerk-magistrate\u2019s crimes, the court concluded that his specific criminal offenses constituted an identifiable \u201cviolation of [a] law[] applicable to [the] office or position,\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), because they contradicted the \u201cfundamental tenets of the code and of his oath of office.\u201d <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 179-180. His crimes were so connected to the core function of his position in preserving the integrity of the judicial system and ensuring truth-telling that they could not be \u201cseparated from the nature of his particular office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">As noted above, the penal character of the forfeiture required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), compels us to interpret the statutory language narrowly. See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3 &amp; n.3 (1996). If the Legislature desires a different result, it must state so clearly in amended legislation. See <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>467 Mass. 662, 672 (2014) (Legislature expanded applicability of forfeiture to \u201cbroader range of circumstances\u201d with St. 1987, c. 679, \u00a7 47, in response to <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 687-688 [1986], which interpreted predecessor statute narrowly).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> Although this older version of the regulations was in place at the time of Gamey\u2019s convictions and the board\u2019s decision, a more recent version of 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.08(2) (2014) sets forth four categories of professional standards for teachers: curriculum, planning, and assessment; teaching all students; family and community engagement; and professional culture. This final category articulates the expectation that teachers will \u201c[p]romote[ ] the learning and growth of all students through ethical, culturally proficient, skilled, and collaborative practice.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.08(2)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">This is in stark contrast to the relationship between the criminal offenses and the core responsibilities of the position in <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 175-180. There, the clerk-magistrate\u2019s convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice struck at the very core of the role of the clerk-magistrate and compromised the integrity of the judicial system; this close nexus is what warranted forfeiture. See <em>id. </em>at 179-180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The mandated reporter statute was clearly intended to ensure the immediate care and protection of identifiable endangered children within the Commonwealth, as the statutory scheme instructs the Department of Children and Families (department) to investigate reports promptly and in person. See <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>439 Mass. 766, 772 (2003); <em>B.K. </em>v. <em>Department of Children &amp; Families, </em>79 Mass.

Investigation into the well-being of the child subjects of pornography is likely beyond the investigative and protective functions of the department where, as here, the identities of the majority of the children are unknown, and those who had been identified at the time of Garney\u2019s plea and whose locations were known were located in other, primarily foreign, jurisdictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We agree with the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement System that a particular public position\u2019s status as a mandated reporter suggests that the position may hold a special public trust. See <em>Retirement Bd. of Maynard </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 114-115 (2013) (Graham, J., dissenting) (mandated reporter status is \u201c[ijllustrative of the special trust conferred on firefighters and [emergency medical technicians]\u201d). However, we have concluded that a violation of the special public trust placed in teachers is not determinative to the analysis under G.
