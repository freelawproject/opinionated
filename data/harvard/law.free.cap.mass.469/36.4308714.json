L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, and seven counts of being a habitual offender, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982), the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>indictments, which the Commonwealth opposed. He claimed that the seven photocopies of photographs of naked children (excerpted from a National Geographic magazine, a sociology textbook, and a naturist catalogue) on which the indictments were based did not constitute child pornography within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, and were protected by his right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Following a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion to dismiss, concluding that none of the photocopies constituted a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d of the children\u2019s body parts as described in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii). The Commonwealth filed an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The case was entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred it to this court on our own motion. At issue is whether the judge properly dismissed the indictments on the ground that the grand jury were not presented with any evidence to support a finding of probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of child pornography. Because we conclude that the photocopies did not depict a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii), we affirm the order of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29C, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cWhoever knowingly purchases or possesses a . . . photograph or other similar visual reproduction ... of any child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of [eighteen] years of age and such child is . . . (vii) depicted or portrayed in any pose, posture or setting involving a <em>lewd exhibition </em>of the unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks or, if such person is female, a fully or partially developed breast of the child; with knowledge of the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>or content thereof shall be punished .. .\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting this statute was to protect children from sexual exploitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1. The focus of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, is the knowing purchase or possession of child pornography, not its dissemination. Contrast G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29B (statute criminalizing dissemination of visual material of child in state of nudity or sexual conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">2. <em>Factual background. </em>The facts are drawn from the evidence presented to the grand jury. The defendant is an inmate at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk. On August 31, 2011, correction officers conducted a search of the defendant\u2019s cell, which he shared with another inmate. In a padlocked footlocker assigned to the defendant, the officers found an envelope containing seven photocopies of photographs that depicted naked children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The photocopies, which will be described in detail later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in this opinion, were black and white, and they appeared grainy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant admitted that the photocopies were his, and he told the officers that they were \u201cfrom a pamphlet from a nudist colony that he had gotten many, many years ago that he had cut out and stuck in the envelope.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on his years of training and experience, Sergeant David McSweeney of the State police testified that all of the images were of real children (not computer depictions or morphed images) who were under the age of eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the proper standard of review is whether the evidence before the grand jury established probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of child pornography. We agree with the Commonwealth, mindful of special considerations that arise when a case involves expression that may be protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Ordinarily, a \u201ccourt will not inquire into the competency or sufficiency of the evidence before the grand jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>373 Mass. 591, 592 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>323 Mass. 205, 211-212 (1948). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 825 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. at 161-163. However, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163, we recognized a limited exception to this general rule, concluding that a court must dismiss an indictment where the grand jury \u201cfail[ ] to hear any evidence of criminal activity by the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>453 Mass. 880, 883-884 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, supra. </em>At the very least, the grand jury must hear enough evidence to establish the identity of the accused<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to support a finding of probable cause to arrest the accused for the offense charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>citing <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 572, 573-574 (1973), and <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 531 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>414 Mass. 642, 643 (1993). \u201cA grand jury finding of probable cause is necessary if indictments are to fulfil their traditional function as an effective protection \u2018against unfounded criminal prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, supra </em>at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It is well established that \u201c[pjrobable cause to arrest \u2018requires more than mere suspicion but something less than evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169, 174 (1982). See generally K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3.51 (3d ed. 2007). \u201cThe evidence before the grand jury must consist of reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a reasonable or prudent person in believing that the defendant has committed the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>362 Mass. 24, 26 (1972). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. at 163. Where the Commonwealth has not produced any evidence to support a finding of probable cause to arrest, an indictment must be dismissed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levesque, </em>436 Mass. 443, 447 (2002). Conversely, where the Commonwealth satisfies the probable cause standard, the determination whether a visual depiction constitutes a \u201clewd\u201d exhibition within the meaning of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii), is one for a fact finder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>373 Mass. at 592-594 (sufficiency of evidence reserved for trial on merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We proceed to consider whether, in this case, the grand jury were presented with any evidence to support a finding of probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of child pornography under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant has conceded that he possessed the photocopies, that the children depicted in them were real children, that they were under the age of eighteen, and that they were nude. Therefore, the probable cause determination turns on whether the photocopies depicted a \u201clewd exhibition.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii). Typically, when considering an appeal from the allowance of a motion to dismiss an indictment, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington W., </em>462 Mass. 204, 210 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>453 Mass. at 885. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levesque, supra </em>at 444. However, because this case involves depictions of naked children, we must be sure that the grand jurors \u201chave not encroached on expression protected by the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 303 (2012). Accordingly, we undertake a de novo review of the challenged pictures. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 714 (2002) <em>(Bean). </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 303-307 (conducting de novo review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of photograph of naked adolescent to determine lewdness); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Militello, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 331 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In <em>Bean, supra </em>at 708, following a bench trial in the Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of posing a fifteen year old girl for photographs with her breast exposed in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A (a). The photographs were the primary evidence of whether the defendant had acted with \u201clascivious intent,\u201d which is a necessary element of the crime of posing or exhibiting a child in a state of nudity or sexual conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 708-709, 714, citing G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A. In determining that de novo review of the photographs was appropriate, we pointed out that the United States Supreme Court had emphasized in <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 504-505 (1984), that \u201ccases involving speech under the First Amendment require independent appellate review of the offending material to ensure that protected speech is not infringed.\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 714. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Servs., </em>432 Mass. 251, 258 (2000), quoting <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d 905, 912-913 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Nahant v. O\u2019Connor, </em>510 U.S. 1024 (1993) (\u201cappellate court has an obligation to \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free speech\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>338 Mass. 442, 446-447 (1959), citing <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 497-498 (1957) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (appellate courts must judge pruriency of alleged pornographic material to determine whether material is afforded constitutional protection). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1999), and cases cited. We noted in <em>Bean </em>that \u201c[t]he fact finder is in no better position to evaluate the content and significance of these photographs than an appellate court.\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 714 n.15. Unlike testimony from a witness, an objective analysis of tangible evidence such as photographs requires no credibility determinations, rendering de novo review appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 (2004). After conducting an independent review of the photographs in <em>Bean, </em>this court concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed because the evidence of lascivious intent was insufficient. See <em>Bean, supra </em>at 709, 715-717.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We recognize that <em>Bean </em>involved a review of evidence presented at trial, whereas the present case involves a review of evidence presented to a grand jury. Nonetheless, the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>constitutional concern raised in each case is the same \u2014 whether photographs of the naked body are entitled to protection under the First Amendment based on an assessment of whether or not they are lewd. See <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. at 714-715. See also note 11, <em>supra. </em>The nature of this assessment by an appellate court does not change based on whether it occurs after indictments are handed down or after trial. Consequently, we deem it proper to consider whether the grand jury in this case were presented with any evidence to support a finding of probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of child pornography by reviewing de novo the seven photocopies at issue to determine whether they are themselves lewd.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the Appeals Court cogently pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 306, \u201cwhere First Amendment rights are at issue,\u201d we must approach the lewdness determination with \u201ccircumspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth asserts that the evidence before the grand jury provided probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of child pornography under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, because the seven photocopies depicted naked young children with their genitals exposed, the photocopies were a lewd exhibition. As such, the Commonwealth continues, the motion judge erred in dismissing the indictments.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29C, does not define a \u201clewd\u201d exhibi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tion. It is well settled that \u201cnudity alone is not enough to render a photograph lewd.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 302. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 112-114 (1990) (depictions of nudity, without more, constitute protected expression); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 33. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villard, </em>885 F.2d 117, 125 (3d Cir. 1989), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villard, </em>700 F. Supp. 803, 812 (D.N.J. 1988) (\u201cWhen a picture does not constitute child pornography, even though it portrays nudity, it does not become child pornography because it is placed in the hands of a pedophile\u201d). In deciding whether a particular exhibition of a child\u2019s naked body is lewd, courts have looked to the criteria articulated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987), which commonly are referred to as the <em>Dost </em>factors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 302-305. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 31-32. The <em>Dost </em>factors are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201c1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201c2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201c3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201c5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201c6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The <em>Dost </em>factors are neither comprehensive nor dispositive, but they do provide guidance for a court\u2019s analysis whether a visual depiction constitutes a \u201clewd\u201d exhibition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Bean, supra </em>at 713-714, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 32; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 302-303. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2006), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 32. A determination regarding lewdness \u201cmust be made on a case-by-case basis\u201d and should be founded on \u201cthe overall content of the visual depiction.\u201d <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 832. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, supra, </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra. </em>A visual depiction need not involve all of the <em>Dost </em>factors in order to be deemed lewd. See <em>Dost, supra. </em>Moreover, there may be other factors that are equally or more important in the lewdness analysis. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We consider the <em>Dost </em>factors in the context of the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, namely to protect children from sexual exploitation. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>States have a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of children, see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 756-757 (1982), quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982), and, consequently, States may proscribe the possession of child pornography. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>495 U.S. at 111; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kenney, 449 Mass. 840, 848-849 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 302, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. at 848. As the Legislature has pointed out, \u201cthe mere possession or control of any sexually exploitative material results in continuing victimization of children as such material is a permanent record of an act or acts of sexual abuse or exploitation of a child and ... each time such material is viewed the child is harmed.\u201d St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1 (2). The Legislature found that in order to \u201cstop the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, it [was] necessary to ban the possession of any sexually exploitative materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We turn now to consideration of the photocopies that were found in the possession of the defendant. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">Grand Jury Exhibit 7 is a picture of a man and four prepubescent children standing on some rocks in front of a body of water. The man is wearing a hat, and two of the children are wearing sandals. Otherwise, they all are nude. All are smiling. The man is holding one child in his arms, two children are standing on his right side, and one child is standing on his left side. The girl standing on the man\u2019s right side is holding something in her hands. The genitals of the man and of two of the children (boys) are visible. The picture is approximately two inches by two and one-half inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">Grand Jury Exhibit 8 is a picture of a prepubescent child as seen from the rear. The child is nude, except for socks and sneakers. No genitals are visible. The picture is approximately one inch by three inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">Grand Jury Exhibit 9 is a picture of a prepubescent boy as seen from the side. He is nude, except for sandals. His genitals are visible, albeit not clearly. The boy\u2019s arms are bent at the elbow and outstretched as if reaching for or touching something in front of him. The picture is approximately one inch by two and one-half inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Grand Jury Exhibit 10 is a picture of two prepubescent boys, one standing in front of the other. The rear child appears to be pouring water from a hose over the head of the child in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the front. Both are nude, and their genitals are visible. Their lower legs and feet do not appear in the picture. The picture is approximately one and one-half inches by two and one-half inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">Grand Jury Exhibit 11 is a picture of two prepubescent children, a boy and a girl, standing side by side. Both are nude, and their genitals are visible. The girl appears to have her arm around the boy\u2019s waist, she is resting her head on his shoulder, and she is smiling. Their lower legs and feet do not appear in the picture. The picture is approximately one and one-half inches by three inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">Grand Jury Exhibit 12 is a picture of a prepubescent child, as seen from the rear, standing at the edge of a body of water. The child is nude. No genitals are visible. The picture is approximately one inch by three and one-half inches in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">Grand Jury Exhibit 13 is a picture of a prepubescent boy, bending over a bicycle and appearing to adjust its seat. He is nude, except for sandals. His genitals are visible, albeit not clearly. The picture is approximately two inches by three inches in size.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Based on our de novo review of the photocopies, it is plainly apparent that their only notable feature is the nudity of the children. In none of the photocopies is the focal point of the visual depiction a child\u2019s genitals, and the children are not shown in any unnatural poses. Rather, the children are portrayed either simply standing around or engaging in ordinary activities in unremarkable settings. The visibility of the children\u2019s genitals is merely an inherent aspect of the fact that they are naked. There is nothing remotely sexual, either explicitly or implicitly, in any of the photocopies. The demeanor, facial expressions, and body language of the children suggest nothing inappropriate. In the photocopies depicting more than one child, the children appear to be comfortable in their surroundings and enjoying each other\u2019s company in a nonsexual manner. Nothing about the photocopies indicates in any way that they were derived from the sexual exploitation of the children depicted therein, such that their possession would result in the continuing victimization of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As we have said, the depiction of mere nudity is insufficient to render a visual image lewd. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. at 112-114; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 33; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass.

See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (i)-(vi). The parties agree that only \u00a7 29C (vii) is relevant to the photocopies at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The Legislature articulated the reasons underlying the enactment of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, when it stated: \u201cThe general court hereby finds: (1) that the sexual exploitation of children constitutes a wrongful invasion of a child\u2019s right to privacy and results in social, developmental and emotional injury to such child and that to protect children from sexual exploitation it is necessary to prohibit the production of material which involves or is derived from such exploitation and to exclude all such material from the channels of trade and commerce; (2) that the mere possession or control of any sexually exploitative material results in continuing victimization of children as such material is a permanent record of an act or acts of sexual abuse or exploitation of a child and that each time such material is viewed the child is harmed; (3) that such material is used to break the will and resistance of other children so as to encourage them to participate in similar acts; (4) that laws banning the production and distribution of such material are insufficient to halt this abuse and exploitation; (5) that to stop the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, it is necessary to ban the possession of any sexually exploitative materials; and (6) that the [Cjommonwealth has a compelling interest in outlawing the possession of any materials which sexually exploit children in order to protect the privacy, health and emotional welfare of children and society as a whole.\u201d St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\">During their search of the defendant\u2019s cell, correction officers also found several hand-drawn pictures of children engaged in sexual acts (two of which were in the envelope with the photocopies), a sketch of a boy holding a baseball bat (later determined to be an image of Adam Walsh, a six year old boy who was abducted and murdered in 1981), and the \u201cmakings of a small teddy bear.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Because these additional items did not serve as bases for his indictments, we do not consider them further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Department of Correction Officer Michael O\u2019Malley testified that any pictures that depict nudity are deemed contraband, the possession of which constitutes a disciplinary infraction. This policy was implemented by the Department of Correction in 2002. The existence of this policy has no bearing on whether the photocopies at issue are \u201clewd\u201d and, therefore, whether their possession constitutes a crime under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 302 (2012) (depiction of mere nudity insufficient to render photograph lewd).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b57-13\">The photocopies originated from three sources: a special issue of National Geographic magazine devoted to China (one photocopy); an Internet edition of a textbook entitled \u201cSociology\u201d (one photocopy); and a naturist catalogue entitled \u201cIntematurally Inc.,\u201d which offered for sale travel packages, books, videos, and photographs relating to nude recreation (five photocopies). The grand jury were not presented with the original source materials for the photocopies. Rather, the source materials were introduced by defense counsel, without objection from the Commonwealth, at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments. During this hearing, the assistant district attorney stated that, at the time of the grand jury proceedings, the Commonwealth did not have any information regarding the origins of the photocopies. The motion judge considered this source material in allowing the motion to dismiss. Its relevance to our analysis will be discussed in note 12, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We also have departed from the general rule of not inquiring into the competency or sufficiency of evidence before a grand jury where a defendant shows that the integrity of the grand jury proceeding itself was impaired. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmey, </em>447 Mass. 121, 130 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 619-622 (1986). In the present case, no such claim has been raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Here, there has been no challenge to the identity of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The defendant points out that the grand jury were not instructed on the legal definition of child pornography. Generally speaking, the Commonwealth is not required to provide legal instructions on the elements of an offense for which it seeks an indictment, out of a concern that such a requirement \u201cwould add delay and complexity without serving any significant purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. 44, 48 (1999). We have recognized only two limited exceptions to this general rule, neither of which is applicable here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walczak, </em>463 Mass. 808, 810 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, supra. </em>Given our disposition of this case, we do not decide whether the general rule against the provision of instructions to a grand jury should be expanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The depiction of nudity, in the absence of lasciviousness or lewdness, is protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 112 (1990); <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 213 (1975). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 313 (Milkey, 1, dissenting) (\u201ca statute that sought to punish the portrayal of mere nudity, even of children, would be constitutionally infirm\u201d). In contrast, child pornography, such as described in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, is a category of material that is outside the protection of the First Amendment. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 111; <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 763, 765 &amp; n.18 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. 840, 848-849 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The Commonwealth contends that the original source material for the photocopies should <em>not </em>be considered because it was not presented to the grand jury, and it had no bearing on the grand jurors\u2019 assessment of the actual photocopies possessed by the defendant. We recognize that where the grand jury were not presented with the source material, their assessment whether the photocopies depicted a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii), could only be based on the photocopies themselves. However, because First Amendment considerations necessitate de novo review of the challenged evidence, we may evaluate the pictures in the context of their source material. Had the Commonwealth been aware of the source material at the time of the grand jury proceedings, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>it would have been incumbent on the assistant district attorney to present such evidence to the grand jurors. In our view, the context of the photocopies informs our analysis whether they should be interpreted as a \u201clewd exhibition.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The Commonwealth also has asserted that the grand jury could conclude that the defendant possessed child pornography based not only on the photocopies themselves, but also on how the defendant stored those images (in an envelope inside his footlocker) and on what other items he possessed and kept with the photocopies (hand-drawn pictures of children engaged in sexual acts). Whether the photocopies depict a \u201clewd exhibition,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii), depends on what is visually portrayed in the pictures themselves, not on other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ancillary evidence that may be suggestive of the defendant\u2019s state of mind. The context for the defendant\u2019s possession of the seven photocopies is irrelevant to the objective assessment of their lewdness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The factors articulated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987), arose \u201cfrom a line of cases in which the courts were called on to interpret the Federal Child Protection Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252), which defines \u2018sexually explicit conduct\u2019 by reference to the phrase \u2018lascivious exhibition of the genitals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 713 (2002), quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(E) (2000). In the present case, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii), expressly refers to a \u201clewd\u201d exhibition, rather than a \u201clascivious\u201d exhibition. Nonetheless, for the purpose of our analysis, we treat these terms as synonymous. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2006) (courts uniformly have equated terms \u201clascivious\u201d and \u201clewd\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239, 1243 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987) (\u201c \u2018Lascivious\u2019 is no different in its meaning than \u2018lewd\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The parties here have framed their arguments in the context of the <em>Dost </em>factors. It is notable that in <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 829-830, the defendants were charged with, among other things, using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of <em>producing </em>visual depictions of such conduct. The sixth <em>Dost </em>factor is applicable in such a context because it inquires about the producer\u2019s intent vis-a-vis the viewer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1999). Where, as here, a case involves only the possession of child pornography, the circumstances surrounding its production, including the producer\u2019s intent, likely will be unknown. Therefore, the sixth <em>Dost </em>factor may provide limited guidance with regard to the lewdness determination in such a case. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>546 F.3d 245, 252 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1204 (2009), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The images in the photocopies originated from photographs accompanying written materials of an educational or recreational nature that are readily available to the general public, albeit perhaps to niche audiences. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Generally speaking, these types of images are not deemed \u201clewd.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 306 (photographs in medical textbook, pictorials in National Geographic, and works in art museum typically not lewd exhibitions). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Various Articles of Merchandise, Schedule No. 287, </em>230 F.3d 649, 657 (3d Cir. 2000) (photographs from magazines devoted to nudists\u2019 lifestyles not deemed lewd). Moreover, \u201c[c]hild pornography is not created when the [viewer] derives sexual enjoyment from an otherwise innocent photofgraph].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villard, </em>885 F.2d 117, 125 (3d Cir. 1989), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villard, </em>700 F.
