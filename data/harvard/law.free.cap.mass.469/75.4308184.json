The plaintiff, Milton C. Weiler, Jr., the former president and chief operating officer of the defendant corporation, PortfolioScope, Inc. (PortfolioScope), brought suit against the defendants raising various claims, including breach of contract, violation of G. L. c. 93A, and fraudulent transfers pursuant to the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA). After a jury-waived trial, Weiler prevailed, and a judgment entered in his favor. The Appeals Court reversed the judgment in part, and we granted Weiler\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the reasons discussed hereafter, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in almost all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the pertinent facts as found by the trial judge; additional facts are discussed in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the issues raised. In 1981 and 1998, respectively, Weiler co-founded Computer Aided Decisions and CAD Research, Inc. (CAD entities), companies that developed and marketed software to help manage investment portfolios. In early 2000, Spencer Trask &amp; Co. (Spencer Trask), a venture capital firm effectively controlled by the defendant Kevin Kimberlin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> acquired the CAD entities from Weiler and the cofounder. After the purchase, the CAD entities were merged into a new company that became the defendant PortfolioScope. Weiler received cash as well as stock and stock options in the new company at the time of the sale and served at that time as its president and chief operating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">In 2001, PortfolioScope began experiencing financial difficulty, and it received a series of loans from Wachovia Bank, N.A. (Wachovia), beginning on February 20, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kevin Kimberlin Partners, L.P. (KKP), guaranteed these Wachovia loans, and in that connection, on February 20, 2001, PortfolioScope executed a security agreement granting KKP a security interest in all of PortfolioScope\u2019s property, including its deposit accounts and cash. On July 25, 2001, PortfolioScope executed a demand note in favor of Wachovia in the amount of $4.01 million.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 10, 2002, KKP paid off PortfolioScope\u2019s debt to Wachovia, and thereafter received an assignment of all of Wachovia\u2019s rights and interests in PortfolioScope. The assignment agreement incorporated the security agreement that PortfolioScope previously had executed in favor of KKP. Between 2003 and 2008, PortfolioScope received additional loans from KKP directly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Weiler served as PortfolioScope\u2019s president and chief operating officer from January, 2000, to May, 2002. Kimberlin hired the defendant Joseph T. Whelihan in January, 2002, to become PortfolioScope\u2019s chief executive officer. On February 13, 2002, Weiler entered into a stock option purchase and sale agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>with PortfolioScope (five per cent agreement), in which Weiler agreed to sell back to PortfolioScope 666,667 vested and unvested stock options in the company, and in exchange would be paid a contingent purchase price. On October 21, 2002, the parties amended the five per cent agreement (five per cent amendment) to include a provision that PortfolioScope would pay Weiler five per cent of the net proceeds received in connection with a pending lawsuit between PortfolioScope and iFlex Solutions Limited (iFlex litigation).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whelihan, as PortfolioScope\u2019s chief executive officer, signed both the five per cent agreement and the five per cent amendment on behalf of the company; the five per cent agreement also was initialed by Kimberlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Between May, 2002, and October 21, 2008, Weiler consulted with PortfolioScope, principally in connection with the then-pending iFlex litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 21, 2008, the iFlex litigation settled for $10 million. The law firm serving as PortfolioScope\u2019s counsel in that litigation received the $10 million settlement funds on November 7, and, after deducting the amount claimed by the firm as legal fees, transferred approximately $8.2 million to PortfolioScope on November 12. That same day, Kimberlin directed Whelihan to wire $5.2 million of the proceeds to a Spencer Trask brokerage account because he wanted to gain immediate access to the settlement proceeds. On November 17, again at Kimberlin\u2019s direction, Whelihan wired another $1,296 million to the Spencer Trask account and, separately, another $1,231,186.13, also to Spencer Trask.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Also on November 17, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Kimberlin\u2019s direction, Whelihan wired $500,000 to an account in Whelihan\u2019s wife\u2019s name. Finally, on November 25, Whelihan paid himself $15,000 from the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds, a transaction authorized by Kimberlin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Taken together, these transfers accounted for almost all of the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">After the iFlex litigation settled, beginning on November 10, 2008, Weiler initiated a series of \u201cincreasingly frustrated\u201d inquiries directed at Whelihan, Kimberlin, and others connected to PortfolioScope and Spencer Trask as to when he was to be paid his entitlement under the five per cent amendment. On December 2, 2008 \u2014 after the iFlex litigation proceeds were essentially depleted \u2014 Whelihan sent a message via electronic mail (e-mail) to Weiler, with a copy to Kimberlin, asking whether Weiler would settle for an amount less than that he was otherwise entitled to under the five per cent amendment. On December 4, Weiler responded that he would accept $406,000 as payment in full. When no transfer of funds was made, Weiler sent an e-mail to Whelihan on December 8, asking when he should expect payment; Whelihan asked Weiler to \u201chold on a little longer.\u201d Weiler made a subsequent inquiry on December 17, to which Whelihan indicated that Weiler was \u201c[his] first priority tomorrow. Promise.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Weiler never received payment from PortfolioScope.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On March 23, 2009, Whelihan sent an e-mail to Weiler informing him that he was sending Weiler a $20,000 check as part of an instalment plan as an incentive to help with the pending litigation between PortfolioScope and Charles Hunt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See note 8, <em>supra. </em>Shortly thereafter, Weiler served his complaint in this action, alleging various claims against PortfolioScope, Whelihan, and Kimberlin (collectively, defendants).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Only after the lawsuit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>filed did Weiler learn that (1) Whelihan had transferred $515,000 to himself; and (2) the defendants were asserting that Weiler was not being paid because KKP was a secured creditor of PortfolioScope and had a priority interest in the settlement proceeds that trumped Weiler\u2019s contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">After a bench trial, the judge issued a written decision in which she made detailed findings and concluded that (1) PortfolioScope committed a breach of the five per cent amendment and the consulting agreements with Weiler as well as the covenant of good faith and fair dealing;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (2) Kimberlin tortiously interfered with Weiler\u2019s contractual rights vis-a-vis PortfolioScope; (3) the defendants converted funds belonging to Weiler; (4) the defendants knowingly and wilfully engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11; (5) the defendants violated the UFTA; and (6) the defendants conspired against Weiler.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendants appealed to the Appeals Court, which affirmed the judgment against PortfolioScope for breach of contract, but otherwise reversed, concluding that judgment should enter in favor of the defendants on all other counts in Weiler\u2019s amended complaint. <em>Weiler </em>v. <em>PortfolioScope, Inc., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 233 (2013). We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court with the exception of Weiler\u2019s claim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendants argue that the judge erred in certain fundamental respects in her interpretation of the five per cent agreement and five per cent amendment, as well as in her analysis of secured transaction principles as applied to this case; in the defendants\u2019 view, these errors infected almost every part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the disposition of the case. As to the five per cent agreement and amendment, the defendants contend that the judge misinterpreted the five per cent amendment as giving Weiler a right to five per cent of the actual settlement proceeds of the iFlex litigation (less legal fees), rather than a right to five per cent of the value of the settlement (less legal fees). With respect to secured transaction principles, the defendants contend that the judge failed to accord proper legal significance to the fact that the $515,000 in transfers from the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds to Whelihan and the approximately $6.5 million in transfers from the proceeds to Spencer Trask in substance and legal effect were transfers to PortfolioScope\u2019s secured creditor, KKP, an entity that as a matter of law had priority over Weiler.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Appeals Court agreed with the defendants. See <em>Weiler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 218, 223-226. We also agree that the five per cent amendment did not give Weiler a right to recover from the actual settlement proceeds, but in the factual circumstances of this case, conclude that any error in the judge\u2019s interpretation of the five per cent amendment affects only Weiler\u2019s claim for conversion. On the law of secured transactions, the judge\u2019s factual findings in this case persuade us that no legal error infected the judge\u2019s consideration of KKP\u2019s security interest in the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact in a bench trial unless they are clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>Makrigiannis </em>v. <em>Nintendo of Am., Inc., </em>442 Mass. 675, 677 (2004), and the credibility of the witnesses rests within the purview of the trial judge. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">b. <em>Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by PortfolioScope. </em>The judge found that PortfolioScope committed a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>paid $515,000, which constituted more than five per cent of the net proceeds of the iFlex litigation, to Whelihan. She explained that there was \u201csimply no tenable argument that the [five per cent] [agreement<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> permitted PortfolioScope to make any payment to Whelihan before paying Weiler.\u201d PortfolioScope takes the position that it did not commit a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because its payment to Whelihan was directed by KKP \u2014 PortfolioScope\u2019s secured creditor. Its argument is that PortfolioScope was required to comply with KKP\u2019s instructions to pay Whelihan directly.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-405 (a).

Nickerson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>456 Mass. 562, 570 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>PortfolioScope\u2019s argument, that the payment to Whelihan was actually a payment ordered by its secured creditor KKP, is at odds with the trial judge\u2019s findings concerning the transfers made to Whelihan from the iFlex litigation proceeds. The judge found that the $500,000 transfer was made \u201cat Kimberlin\u2019s direction,\u201d and the $15,000 transfer was \u201cauthorized by Kmberlin.\u201d What is absent from these findings \u2014 and what is necessary for PortfolioScope\u2019s secured creditor argument \u2014 is that Kmberlin authorized or directed these payments <em>on behalf of KKP. </em>The defendants apparently assume that Kmberlin did so, but do not identify the basis for this assumption; the mere fact that Kmberlin controlled KKP is not a sufficient one.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">What the judge\u2019s findings do indicate is that PortfolioScope, at Kmberlin\u2019s direction, transferred $515,000 to Whelihan, who was neither a secured creditor of PortfolioScope nor otherwise entitled to the funds;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that PortfolioScope\u2019s $515,000 payment to Whelihan represented more than five per cent of the net proceeds from the iFlex litigation, which was the amount to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Weiler was entitled under the five per cent amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the judge found that these transfers were motivated by a desire to enrich Whelihan at the expense of Weiler who had provided substantial services in order to make the iFlex litigation settlement possible \u2014 a finding that is supported by the evidence. See <em>T.W. Nickerson, Inc., </em>456 Mass. at 574 (looking to whether defendant\u2019s motivation was \u201cto affect negatively the plaintiff\u2019s rights\u201d under the contract to determine whether breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing occurred). See also <em>Chokel, </em>449 Mass. at 278 n.5; <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc., </em>411 Mass. at 472-473. PortfolioScope\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">c. <em>Tortious interference with contractual relations by Kimberlin. </em>\u201cTo prevail on a claim of tortious interference with a contract, a plaintiff must establish that \u2018(1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>459 Mass. 697, 715-716 (2011), quoting <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991). Accord <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 260 (2007). However, \u201c[wjhere the defendant is a corporate official acting in the scope of his corporate responsibilities, a plaintiff has a heightened burden of showing the improper motive or means constituted \u2018actual malice,\u2019 that is, \u2018a spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Psy-Ed Corp., supra </em>at 716, quoting <em>Blackstone, supra </em>at 260-261.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The judge concluded that Kimberlin intentionally interfered with Weiler\u2019s right to be paid from the iFlex litigation proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>under the five per cent amendment by authorizing Whelihan to pay $515,000 to himself, and that Kimberlin did so with improper motive or means; the judge did not apply the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard in reaching this result, or even discuss the standard \u2014 presumably because the defendants did not mention this standard or suggest that the standard had any application to this case. The Appeals Court reversed, concluding that because Kimberlin served as chair of the board and sole director of Spencer Trask, which owned ninety per cent of PortfolioScope, he qualified as a \u201ccorporate official\u201d of Portfolioscope to whom the actual malice standard applied, and Weiler failed to meet the \u201cheightened burden\u201d that the standard imposes. <em>Weiler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 228. Before this court, Kimberlin embraces the Appeals Court\u2019s theory and argues that he is entitled to the actual malice standard because, as the Appeals Court concluded, he was a PortfolioScope \u201ccorporate official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We have stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018actual malice\u2019 standard for proving improper motive or means on the part of a corporate official is a burden placed on the plaintiff, not a defense that must be proved by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blackstone, </em>448 Mass. at 261. See <em>id. </em>at 261 n.10. That the plaintiff must prove a corporate official acted with actual malice, however, does not absolve the defendant from bringing to the attention of the plaintiff and the court in some fashion that he claims to qualify as a \u201ccorporate official\u201d of the relevant corporation and therefore is entitled to have the actual malice standard apply. See <em>id. </em>at 256, 259, 268 (defendant, one of two directors of close corporation employing plaintiff, requested actual malice jury instruction at trial; error not to give it). Cf. <em>Teller </em>v. <em>Schepens, </em>381 Mass. 621, 623 (1980) (once defendant raises statute of limitations issue, plaintiff bears burden of proving claims are not time barred). Cf. also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>465 Mass. 762, <em>771 </em>(2013) (where defendant was charged with joint venture possession of firearm, his claim that coventurer possessed license to carry firearm would be defense to charge; defendant not required to produce evidence of coventurer\u2019s license, but only bears burden of raising issue of license; once issue raised, burden on Commonwealth to prove coventurer was not licensed). The need to identify the \u201ccorporate official\u201d issue is especially pronounced in a case like the present one, where the complexities of the corporate and individual relationships raise, at 'best, a possibility that the defendant qualifies as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>corporate official.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">To summarize: only where a defendant raises a claim that he qualifies as a corporate official does the plaintiff then bear the burden of proving either that the defendant does not so qualify and is not entitled to the actual malice standard, or that the defendant did act with actual malice. Here, Kimberlin did not argue or suggest at trial (or before the Appeals Court) that he was a \u201ccorporate official\u201d of PortfolioScope and thereby was entitled to the actual malice standard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Rather, he advances it for the first time before this court. Having failed to raise the issue below, he has waived it. See <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mass. Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>455 Mass. 783, 795 n.18 (2010), and cases cited; <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 63 (1983), citing <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakeley, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977) (issues not raised below are usually not considered on appeal unless \u201cthe questions presented are of some public importance and the result we reach is not changed by our consideration of them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendants claim also that even if Kimberlin was not entitled to the benefit of the actual malice standard, Weiler failed to establish that Kimberlin used improper motive or means in interfering with the five per cent amendment because Kimberlin, acting on behalf of the secured creditor KKP, was privileged to interfere with Weiler\u2019s contract in order to further KKP\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>legitimate economic interest.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As discussed, the judge did not find that in directing or authorizing Whelihan to transfer $515,000 from PortfolioScope to himself (Whelihan), Kimberlin was acting on behalf of KKP in its capacity as PortfolioScope\u2019s secured creditor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">d. <em>Conversion. </em>To be liable for conversion, a defendant must wrongfully \u201cexercise dominion or control over the personal property of\u201d the plaintiff. See <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank of Hampden County </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 240, 244 (1983). Accord <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>102 Mass. 503, 506 (1869). The defendants argue that the conversion claim cannot stand because the iFlex litigation proceeds never constituted Weiler\u2019s property. Weiler counters that money can be the subject of conversion, and, therefore, the judge correctly held the defendants liable for converting Weiler\u2019s five per cent share of the iFlex litigation net proceeds pursuant to the five per cent amendment. Weiler is correct that conversion may lie if an individual wrongly exercises dominion or control over the money of another. <em>Matter of Hilson, </em>448 Mass. 603, 611 (2007), citing <em>Morrin </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>205 Mass. 205, 211 (1910). However, as previously stated, we agree with the defendants and the Appeals Court, see <em>Weiler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 223, that under the terms of the five per cent agreement and five per cent amendment, Weiler was entitled to the <em>value </em>of five per cent of the net proceeds of the iFlex litigation; the contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>documents did not give him a right to five per cent of the iFlex litigation funds themselves. Contrast <em>Matter of Hilson, supra. </em>Therefore, the judgment for Weiler on his conversion claim must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">e. <em>Fraudulent transfers. </em>Under the UFTA, a transfer made by a debtor before or after the creditor\u2019s claim arose is fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud, see G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1), or if made without receiving the reasonably equivalent value of the property in exchange and, after the transfer, the debtor would not have enough assets to carry on its business or pay expected creditors. See G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 (a) (2).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the defendants violated the UFTA, based on her finding that the transfers were made with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud Weiler. See G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1). With respect to the $515,000 transferred by PortfolioScope to Whelihan, the judge pointed to the following: (1) at the time of the transfers, Whelihan was not a secured or even an unsecured creditor of PortfolioScope, and PortfolioScope received no value in exchange for the transfers;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (2) Whelihan was an \u201cinsider,\u201d see G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 2; (3) the settlement proceeds as a whole represented substantially all of PortfolioScope\u2019s assets; and (4) Whelihan and Kimberlin attempted to conceal the transfers while simultaneously delaying response to Weiler\u2019s requests to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>paid. As to the $6,496 million<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> transferred by PortfolioScope to the Spencer Trask brokerage account, the judge observed that (1) the transfers were made to Spencer Trask, a PortfolioScope insider, for the benefit of KKP, controlled by Kimberlin; (2) the transfers involved substantially all of PortfolioScope\u2019s assets, rendering it insolvent; (3) KKP never perfected its security interest until after Weiler commenced this litigation; (4) neither Whelihan nor Kimberlin ever informed Weiler that Portfolio-Scope was unable to pay him because it was required to pay its secured creditor, KKP; and (5) both Kimberlin and Whelihan engaged in a series of actions that were intended to conceal the transfers from Weiler and avoid his attempts to collect what was due him.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The defendants contend that the trial judge\u2019s finding that the transfers to Whelihan and to Spencer Trask were made with intent to hinder or delay was clearly erroneous. We disagree.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">i. <em>Transfers to Whelihan. </em>The defendants\u2019 only argument as to why the transfers made to Whelihan are not fraudulent within the meaning of the UFTA is that the payment to Whelihan was, in actuality, a transfer to KKP, PortfolioScope\u2019s secured creditor. As discussed, the trial judge\u2019s findings do not support this factual claim, and therefore the issue of paying a secured creditor is irrelevant. The question that remains is whether the evidence showed that the Whelihan transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud, or, more particularly, whether the judge\u2019s finding that they were made with such intent was clearly erroneous. Cf. <em>Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>A.D.B. Investors, </em>926 F.2d 1248, 1255 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>intent to hinder, delay, or defraud under \u00a7 548 of United States Bankruptcy Code \u201cis a finding of fact, which [is] not disturb[ed] absent clear error\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">General Laws c. 109A, \u00a7 5 <em>(b), </em>provides a nonexclusive list of factors that may be considered in determining whether the parties made the transfers with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See Alford v. Thibault, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 828 (2013). \u201cWhile the \u2018presence of a single badge of fraud may spur mere suspicion, the confluence of several can constitute conclusive evidence of an actual intent to defraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hasbro, Inc. </em>v. <em>Serafino, </em>37 F. Supp. 2d 94, 98 (D. Mass. 1999), quoting <em>Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc., supra </em>at 1254-1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The subsidiary findings listed by the judge in support of her ultimate finding of actual intent included at least four indicia listed in the UFTA, see G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 <em>(b): </em>the transfers to Whelihan, the chief executive officer of PortfolioScope, were to an insider, see \u00a7 5 <em>(b) </em>(l);<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Whelihan and Kimberlin concealed the transfers from Weiler, see \u00a7 5 <em>(b) </em>(3); the transfers to Whelihan, combined with the virtually simultaneous transfers to Spencer Trask, accounted for substantially all of PortfolioScope\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>assets at that time, see \u00a7 5 <em>(b) </em>(5); and, because Whelihan was not a secured or unsecured creditor of PortfolioScope and had no entitlement to any portion of the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds, PortfolioScope received no value \u2014 much less something of equivalent value \u2014 as a result of the transfer, see \u00a7 5 <em>(b) </em>(8). As the trial evidence supports these findings, the judge\u2019s determination that the transfer of $515,000 to Whelihan was made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">ii. <em>Transfers to Spencer Trask. </em>Kimberlin principally argues that because KKP was a secured creditor of PortfolioScope, the approximately $6.5 million in transfers to KKP through Spencer Trask represented a preference of paying one creditor over another, and, therefore, it is not fraudulent under the UFTA. \u201cFraudulent conveyance laws, such as the Bankruptcy Code and [Sjtate statutes adopting some form of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or the [UFTA], are intended to prevent shareholders, <em>secured creditors, </em>and others from benefitting at the expense of others, <em>including unsecured </em>creditors\u201d (emphasis added). <em>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., </em>274 B.R. 71, 81 (D. Del. 2002). Accordingly, compliance with the law of secured transactions, see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 to 9-709, does not by itself protect a secured creditor from a fraudulent transfer claim. See <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan Marshall Indus., Inc., </em>278 Ill. App. 3d 241, 250-252 (1996) (although no dispute that art. 9 of Uniform Commercial Code was complied with, genuine issue of material fact remained whether transfers made with actual intent to defraud). Cf. <em>Sheffield Progressive, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kingston Tool Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 50 (1980), quoting 1B Coogan, Hogan, &amp; Vagts, Secured Transactions Under the Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 13.07(1), at 1381 (1980) (\u201cClearly, article 9 does not replace the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Cases decided before the enactment of the UFTA in Massachusetts have stated that when a debtor has paid one creditor over another, even when the payment comprised substantially all of the debtor\u2019s assets, this fact by itself is insufficient to establish an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud. See, e.g., <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Columbia Diamond Ring Co., Inc., </em>366 Mass. 835, 843-844 (1975). See also <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Wylde, </em>308 Mass. 268, 281-283, cert. denied, 314 U.S. 638 (1941). Implicit in those cases, however, is a premise that the debtor is acting in good faith in making the challenged transfers \u2014 that the debtor\u2019s motivation or purpose in doing so was to pay the creditor the antecedent debt, not to advance a goal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of secretly benefiting the debtor\u2019s own, personal interests at the expense of the unpaid creditor. See <em>Mason, supra </em>at 282-283. As to the approximately $6.5 million in transfers to Spencer Trask, the judge expressly rejected a conclusion that PortfolioScope, acting through Whelihan and Kimberlin in effecting these transfers, was acting in good faith, concluding instead that the defendants\u2019 purpose was to benefit Kimberlin and Whelihan at Weiler\u2019s expense. And, as is true of the transfers to Whelihan, the indicia of actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud found by the judge \u2014 the defendants\u2019 failure at the time of making the transfers to explain to Weiler that PortfolioScope was unable to pay him because of the need to pay its secured creditor KKP; their concealment from Weiler of the transfers; and the fact that the transfers to Spencer Trask, combined with the transfers to Whelihan, constituted substantially all of PortfolioScope\u2019s assets \u2014 are supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">f. <em>G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. </em>The trial judge concluded that by improperly using the iFlex litigation settlement proceeds to benefit themselves rather than meeting PortfolioScope\u2019s contractual obligations to pay Weiler and by intentionally misleading and concealing their improper conduct, the defendants acted unfairly or deceptively within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and did so knowingly and wilfully, entitling Weiler to double damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The Appeals Court disagreed. Although the defendants had not raised the issue in the Superior Court or on appeal, the Appeals Court concluded that Weiler was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to recover under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, because \u201cthe dispute... arose out of a private transaction between PortfolioScope and Weiler in his role as a former employee and options holder of the company,\u201d <em>Weiler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 230, and as a result Weiler did not meet the trade or commerce requirement of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 230-231. Weiler argues that the defendants have waived this defense \u2014 that it is too late for them to take up the intra-corporate transaction banner at this stage of the case. The defendants do not contest that they did not previously raise this issue, but claim that the \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d requirement of \u00a7 11, goes to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and therefore cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Our cases make clear that G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, does not cover internal employment or intra-enterprise disputes. See, e.g., <em>Selmark Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ehrlich, </em>467 Mass. 525, 549-551 (2014); <em>Psy-Ed Corp., </em>459 Mass. at 719-720; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 12-15 (1983). This does not mean, however, that the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction even to entertain arguments that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair or deceptive conduct on the part of various individuals and entities falls squarely within the proper \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d scope of \u00a7 11, and is <em>not </em>a private employment or intra-corporate dispute. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, first par. (granting Superior Court jurisdiction to hear such claims).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See also <em>Wachovia Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006) (question for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction is, \u201cHas the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre?\u201d); <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd., No. 3974 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>457 Mass. 53, 56-57 (2010).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Our cases routinely have addressed the argument or defense that a dispute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>intra-corporate in nature, and therefore fails to satisfy the \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d requirement of \u00a7 11, as a basis for a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). See, e.g., <em>First Enters., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>425 Mass. 344, 345 n.3, 347-348 (1997) (analyzing whether G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, claim was properly dismissed for failure to state claim under rule 12 [b] [6] because it constituted intra-enterprise dispute); <em>Manning, </em>388 Mass. at 9, 12-14 (same); <em>Cavicchi </em>v. <em>Koski, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 654, 655, 662-663 (2006) (same). We continue to view a rule 12 (b) (6) motion as the proper vehicle for a party to raise such a defense. A rule 12 (b) (6) motion, however, does not implicate the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, and it may be waived. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (h) (2), 365 Mass. 754 (1974) (failure to state claim on which relief can be granted may be raised by pleading, motion to dismiss, or motion for judgment on pleadings, or at trial). Compare Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (h) (3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974) <em>(\u201cWhenever </em>it appears by suggestion of a party or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action\u201d [emphasis added]). Because the defendants did not raise the issue of employment or intra-enterprise dispute before judgment entered in the Superior Court (and also did not raise the issue before the Appeals Court), it is waived.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The defendants do not challenge the judge\u2019s disposition of Weiler\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>c. 93 A claim on any other ground, and therefore, the judgment on this claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed as to all counts of the first amended complaint with the exception of count 9 for conversion, and as to that count, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Kevin Kimberlin owns approximately ninety-five per cent of Spencer Trask &amp; Co.

To have a security interest in commercial tort claims, they must be named expressly in the security agreement and must be in existence at the time the security agreement is created. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-108 (e) (1) (description by type insufficient for commercial tort claims); G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-204 (b) (2) (after-acquired property clause ineffective against commercial tort claims). At all relevant times in this case, however, the iFlex litigation settlement had been reduced to cash and placed in PortfolioScope\u2019s account, and KKP had a security interest in PortfolioScope\u2019s cash and deposit accounts. For the purposes of our discussion, we assume, without deciding, that KKP\u2019s security interest in PortfolioScope\u2019s assets extended to the settlement proceeds of the iFlex litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">It is clear from the context that the trial judge was focusing on the five per cent amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The Appeals Court essentially adopted this rationale in reversing the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim against PortfolioScope. See <em>Weiler </em>v. <em>PortfolioScope, Inc., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 226-227 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Moreover, a finding that Kimberlin acted on behalf of KKP in directing Whelihan to pay himself from the iFlex litigation proceeds logically would seem to require a corollary finding that KKP credited the $515,000 transferred to Whelihan against PortfolioScope\u2019s debt to KKP. We do not read the judge\u2019s decision as including such a finding. The judge stated, \u201cKKP, L.P. <em>allegedly </em>gave PortfolioScope a $500,000 credit on PortfolioScope\u2019s secured debt obligation for the $500,000 Whelihan payment\u201d (emphasis added). This was the only fact included in the judge\u2019s decision that she qualified with \u201callegedly,\u201d and the judge also stated at a different point in her decision, when discussing Weiler\u2019s UFTA claim, that \u201cPortfolioScope received no value in exchange for\u201d the transfers of $515,000 to Whelihan. Moreover, the only evidence that PortfolioScope did receive credit was the testimony of Kimberlin, a witness the judge discredited in several respects. The defendants did not introduce any financial or other business records of either PortfolioScope or KKP reflecting this alleged credit. Cf. <em>Automobile Insurers Bur. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>430 Mass. 285, 291 (1999) (commissioner could properly draw adverse inference from insurers\u2019 failure to produce complete information on subject \u201cpeculiarly within their control\u201d). Given that the judge\u2019s findings quoted here indicate she did not believe Kimberlin\u2019s testimony, the factual premise on which the defendants\u2019 argument is built does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">At oral argument before this court, counsel for the defendants agreed that, if PortfolioScope had not credited the $515,000 payment to Whelihan against the amount it owed to KKP, the failure to have done so would undermine the defendants\u2019 contention that PortfsolioScope\u2019s payment to Whelihan constituted a payment to the secured creditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The judge expressly discredited Whelihan\u2019s testimony that he was \u201cowed\u201d $500,000 for past services rendered to PortfolioScope and various other entities connected to Kimberlin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The judge\u2019s discussion of the implied covenant claim may be read to indicate that she interpreted the five per cent amendment as giving Weiler a right to recover five per cent of the actual iFlex litigation settlement proceeds. As previously stated, we agree with the defendants and the Appeals Court that such an interpretation is not correct, but the error has no significance because the settlement proceeds represented essentially all of PortfolioScope\u2019s assets. In other words, the company would have been required to transfer a portion of the settlement proceeds in order to meet its contractual obligation to Weiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Although it is true that approximately $1,231 million of the iFlex litigation settlement funds, which represented more than five per cent of the net proceeds, purportedly went to satisfy an escrow order for then-pending litigation between PortfolioScope and Charles Hunt, during the time period involved in this case, PortfolioScope had no ability to reach that money to pay Weiler, and there was no guarantee that that sum would ever be returned to PortfolioScope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Contrast <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 762, 781 (2001) (executive director constituted corporate official); <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 578, 587 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>424 Mass. 1 (1996) (shareholder-directors actively involved in management as corporate officials); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut.

In <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 267 (2007), this court concluded that a director of a close corporation, even if not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company, still \u201chas an important interest in and responsibility for the conduct of business\u201d because of his status as director, and qualifies as a corporate official to whom the actual malice standard would apply. The court left open whether the same would be true for a person who was simply a shareholder of a close corporation. See <em>id. </em>at 267 n.16.

Advancing a corporate official claim would run counter to this stance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Appeals Court adopted this reasoning in concluding that, even if Kimberlin were not a corporate official, reversal of the tortious interference claim against him was required.

As to improper motive, the judge in substance found that Kimberlin directed the transfer in an effort to benefit Whelihan, his consultant for Spencer Trask who otherwise was not entitled to the $515,000, to the detriment of Weiler, who had a legitimate contractual claim to the money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The defendants\u2019 sole argument as to why Weiler\u2019s claim for civil conspiracy cannot stand is that there was no underlying tort to which they could conspire.

She further rejected Whelihan\u2019s assertion that he had been working for years as a Spencer Trask employee without compensation, citing the fact that Whelihan was receiving a monthly $9,000 retainer from Spencer Trask.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This sum consisted of the $5.2 million wired on November 12 and the $1,296 million wired on November 17. The judge did not find the approximately $1,231 million transfer, apparently designed to satisfy the Superior Court escrow order in the Hunt litigation, to be a fraudulent transfer under the UFTA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The Appeals Court concluded that the transfers at issue did not violate the UFTA. <em>Weiler, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 231-233. That court reasoned that, because \u201cthe transfers were made at the instruction of KKP, a secured creditor and holder of a demand note,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 232, Weiler was required to prove that PortfolioScope received some hidden benefit in making the transfers. <em>Id. </em>at 232-233.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Essentially, the defendants\u2019 argument is that KKP was a secured creditor of PortfolioScope, that the various transfers were made in satisfaction of that security interest, and that accordingly they are insulated from being found to have violated the UFTA. Additionally, they claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that the transfers to Spencer Trask were to an \u201cinsider,\u201d and to support the finding that PorfolioScope became insolvent as a result of the transfers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">See <em>In re Spatz, 222 </em>B.R. 157, 164 (N.D.

L. c. 109A, \u00a7 2 (officer of debtor corporation is insider for purposes of UFTA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The judge also found that the $6.5 million in transfers to Spencer Trask effectively rendered PortfolioScope insolvent. The defendants, as noted, contend that this finding was clearly erroneous. It may be that the evidence failed to show that PortfolioScope was insolvent within the meaning of the UFTA, see G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 3. Nevertheless, there still is sufficient evidence of actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud to affirm the judge\u2019s conclusion that the transfers were fraudulent under \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1) of the UFTA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The defendants argue that, although Spencer Trask may have qualified as an insider under the UFTA as it was a ninety per cent owner of PortfolioScope, Spencer Trask was a transferee in \u201cname only\u201d; the actual transferee was KKP, its secured creditor. We are not convinced that we should ignore that Spencer Trask was the initial transferee for purposes of the UFTA, especially where Kimberlin admitted that he did not have a \u201cgood answer\u201d as to why he directed Whelihan to wire the settlement proceeds purportedly for KKP to a Spencer Trask brokerage account. In any event, even if the transfers were not made to an insider, they were nonetheless made to an entity with which PortfolioScope \u201chad an intimate financial relationship.\u201d <em>Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>A.D.B.

Here, the Superior Court is clearly granted the authority to hear G. L. c. 93A claims. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (1) and 11. Whether the parties were engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d at the time the alleged unfair or deceptive practices occurred is a substantive question. Cf. <em>Doe, No. 3974, supra </em>at 57 (whether sex offender was person who resides in Massachusetts, which board was required to prove for statutory definition of \u201csex offender,\u201d was substantive question not going to board\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, and was waived when not raised until appeal); <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 520-521 (2007) (requirement that project be \u201cfundable\u201d before permit decision could be challenged was substantive as opposed to jurisdictional).

L. c. 93A action where claim was that defendant failed \u201cproperly to perform an agreement for grading, seeding and paving work on a cemetery owned by the plaintiff,\u201d as claims were only tangentially related to housing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although we do not decide the issue, it is far from clear that the dispute here in any event could qualify as a private, employment-related or intra-enterprise controversy outside the trade or commerce boundary line of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Kimberlin was not a stockholder, officer, director, or employee of PortfolioScope, there are a variety of separately organized entities involved in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>case, and the conduct of the defendants giving rise to Weiler\u2019s claim under \u00a7 11 took place six years after the five per cent agreement and five per cent amendment were signed \u2014 six years in which Weiler had been working not as an employee of PortfolioScope but as a consultant. In short, the factual circumstances of this case appear to be significantly different from the direct employer-employee or shareholder-corporation disputes to which we have held G. L. c. 93A inapplicable.
