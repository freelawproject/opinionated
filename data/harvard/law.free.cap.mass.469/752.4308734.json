Glovsky sought to solicit signatures for his nomination to public office outside the entrance to a supermarket owned by the defendant, Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc. (Roche Bros.), but was informed that Roche Bros, prohibited this activity on its property. Glovsky filed suit in the Superior Court claiming that Roche Bros, had violated his right to equal ballot access under art. 9 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He requested relief under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (act), for a violation of his rights \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roche Bros.\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), was allowed. Glovsky appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. We conclude that Glovsky adequately has alleged a right under art. 9 to solicit nominating signatures outside Roche Bros.\u2019 supermarket, but that Roche Bros, did not violate this right \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\"><em>Background. </em>The complaint sets forth the following allegations. In early 2012, Glovsky undertook a bid for election to the second district seat on the Governor\u2019s Council. To place his name on the September 6, 2012, State primary ballot, Glovsky needed to submit, by May 29, 2012, nomination papers containing at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>least 1,000 certified names. On February 7, 2012, Glovsky obtained nomination papers from the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth and began collecting signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On the afternoon of March 14, 2012, Glovsky traveled to a location in Westwood, near the geographic center of the Governor\u2019s Council second district, intending to solicit signatures on Roche Bros.\u2019 property there. Roche Bros.\u2019 Westwood property consists of 4.99 acres and contains a 47,568 square foot supermarket building. As alleged in the complaint, Roche Bros.\u2019 Web site describes its Westwood supermarket as \u201cthe first to incorporate a \u2018department\u2019 concept of merchandising, adding a bakery, florist, and a restaurant to make shopping more enjoyable.\u201d The store is the only supermarket in Westwood, which, as of July, 2009, reported a population of 14,330. Roche Bros, also leases space inside the building to a banking institution, which operates a \u201cfull service banking\u201d branch there. The bank has its own separate business logo displayed on the building\u2019s marquee, and maintains a twenty-four hour deposit slot in the building\u2019s exterior wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Upon arriving at the Westwood property, Glovsky notified Roche Bros, personnel that he intended to solicit nominating signatures from voters on the sidewalk immediately outside the entrance to the store. Jim Visconti, the store manager, informed Glovsky that Roche Bros, had adopted a policy that \u201cno longer\u201d permitted signature solicitation anywhere on its Westwood property. Glovsky\u2019s complaint alleges that he felt \u201cintimidated\u201d by this delivery of Roche Bros.\u2019 policy and \u201cthreatened by the inherent consequences he understood could result if he acted against such a clearly stated prohibition.\u201d As a result, Glovsky left the property despite believing that he had a right under art. 9 to solicit signatures there.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>467 Mass. 720, 724 (2014). To survive a motion to dismiss, these allegations must \u201cplausibly suggest\u201d an entitlement to relief, raising the right to relief \u201cabove the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">b. <em>Article 9. </em>Glovsky argues that he has a protected right under art. 9 to solicit signatures in support of his nomination to public office on the property of the Roche Bros, supermarket in Westwood. Article 9 provides that \u201c[a]ll elections ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>free; and all the inhabitants of this commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employments.\u201d This provision protects the \u201cfundamental right\u201d of equal access to the ballot, a \u201cbasic right,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>413 Mass. 1201, 1210 (1992), that is \u201cof fundamental importance in our form of government because through the ballot the people can control their government.\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int'l, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 83, 91, 93 (1983) <em>(Batchelder I). </em>See <em>Libertarian Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 538, 560 (2012) (art. 9 protects \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201cintertwine[d]\u201d rights of candidates to participate equally in electoral process and of voters to cast their ballots as they see fit). This right of ballot access encompasses an individual\u2019s right to solicit signatures in support of a candidate\u2019s nomination to public office. See <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 84, 92. Significantly, art. 9 does not require State action. See <em>Libertarian Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 558; <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 84, we held that art. 9 protects the right to solicit nominating signatures in the common areas of a private shopping mall or shopping center, despite the property owner\u2019s objection. The present case requires us to consider whether art. 9 extends the right to solicit nominating signatures to private property like that of Roche Bros.\u2019 Westwood supermarket, which is not alleged to be a shopping mall or shopping center. As in <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 91, \u201c[w]e are concerned with ballot access and not with any claim of a right to exercise free speech apart from the question of ballot access.\u201d As we noted in that case, \u201c[t]he difference between free speech and art. 9 rights to free elections and to be a candidate equally with others is not purely theoretical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In determining that the plaintiff in <em>Batchelder I </em>had a right to solicit nominating signatures in a shopping mail\u2019s common areas, we balanced his need to solicit signatures on the property in order to effectuate his right to equal ballot access against the burden that such conduct would impose on the mall owner\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>interests. See <em>id. </em>at 91-93. First, we emphasized that the art. 9 right to solicit signatures, unlike the broader right to free speech protected by art. 16, requires personal contact with voters and cannot be effectuated through other means of communication. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92. Because of the growing importance of shopping malls in retail merchandising, they had begun to function \u201cmuch as the \u2018downtown\u2019 area of a municipality did in earlier years,\u201d and the shopping center at issue represented the \u201cmost favorable\u201d area in the district for seeking signatures. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93. Accordingly, prohibiting the plaintiff\u2019s access would have \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d his art. 9 right. <em>Id. </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Second, the plaintiff sought only to engage in \u201cunobtrusive and reasonable solicitations in the common areas of the mall,\u201d not in the stores themselves, so that his activity would not unduly burden the mall owner\u2019s property interests; indeed, those common areas \u201cha[d] been dedicated to the public as a practical matter\u201d based on the mall owner\u2019s use of the property to host frequent civic, charitable, and other events in order to attract customers and generate good will. See <em>id. </em>at 92, 93 n.12. Nor had the mall owner shown that requiring it to permit access by those soliciting nominating signatures would infringe its own constitutional property or speech rights, either by adversely affecting its economic interests or by forcing it to associate with the plaintiff\u2019s views. <em>Id. </em>at 93. The mall owner adequately could protect its interests by adopting reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to minimize the burden that signature solicitation placed on it. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 93.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Roche Bros, seeks to limit the exercise of the art. 9 right to the common areas of a large shopping mall, thereby creating a bright-line distinction between such common areas and the area immediately outside the entrance to a supermarket. Pointing to our observations in <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 92, that shopping malls had begun to \u201cfunction in many parts of this State much as the \u2018downtown\u2019 area of a municipality did in earlier years\u201d and that the common areas of the mall in question \u201cha[d] been dedicated to the public as a practical matter,\u201d Roche Bros, argues that art. 9 protects solicitation of nominating signatures only on private property that serves as the functional equivalent of a traditional public forum. Citing cases from California and other jurisdictions, Roche Bros, contends that the private property located at the entrance to a freestanding retail establishment, such as the supermarket here, does not meet this test because the owner of such property has invited the public only to pass through the area in entering or exiting the store, not to congregate there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Roche Bros, misreads our opinion in <em>Batchelder I. </em>Functional equivalence to a traditional public forum is not the test for determining whether art. 9 protects signature solicitation on private property. For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 585-587 (1983), we distinguished <em>Batchelder I </em>based on the different right at stake and the different property in question, and only separately and for purposes of addressing a claimed right under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution did we discuss whether the property served \u201ca public function\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>had been \u201cdedicated to certain types of public use\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 587. Rather, the extent to which private property serves the role of a traditional public forum or effectively has been dedicated to the public is relevant in the context of art. 9 only as a factor in balancing the interests of the individual soliciting signatures against those of the property owner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In many rural and suburban communities, the local supermarket may serve as one of the few places in which an individual soliciting signatures would be able to approach members of the public in large numbers. We disagree with Roche Bros.\u2019 contention that, for purposes of a claim to ballot access under art. 9, the privately owned area immediately outside the entrance to such a supermarket differs as a matter of kind from the common areas of a shopping mall or shopping center so as to warrant dismissal of Glovsky\u2019s claim pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Applying the balancing test employed in <em>Batchelder I </em>to the facts as asserted in Glovsky\u2019s complaint, we conclude that Glovsky adequately has alleged a right under art. 9 to solicit nominating signatures on the private property outside the entrance to Roche Bros.\u2019 Westwood supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Glovsky has alleged a substantial interest in soliciting signatures in this area for his nomination to public office. He \u201ccannot reasonably obtain\u201d such signatures other than by \u201cpersonal contact with voters,\u201d <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 92, and \u201c[f]rom the standpoint of a signature gatherer . . . there could hardly be a more ideal or efficient spot to conduct one\u2019s business than the single entrance and exit of a [supermarket or giant] grocery store.\u201d <em>Waremart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Progressive Campaigns, Inc., </em>139 Wash. 2d 623, 649 (1999) (Madsen, J., concurring). In general, super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>markets offer a variety of groceries, household items, and other merchandise that in many communities would be dispersed among several shops along a public way. See, e.g., <em>Colgate-Palmolive Co. </em>v. <em>Elm Farm Foods Co., </em>337 Mass. 221, 223 (1958) (supermarkets commonly sell \u201cmeats, groceries, vegetables, toilet articles, household wares, and other merchandise\u201d). In addition to such items, the Westwood property includes a bakery, a florist, and a restaurant. It also accommodates a \u201cfull service banking\u201d branch. Because the property allegedly contains the only supermarket in West-wood, as well as these other amenities, it reasonably can be inferred that the property draws a significant portion of the town\u2019s voters. In some communities, an individual might solicit signatures from members of the public as they traverse the public way connecting the various shops that offer such amenities; to deprive Glovsky of similar access to the public where the assorted products have been consolidated under a single roof could \u201csubstantially impair[ ]\u201d the fundamental rights protected by art. 9. See <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Moreover, the allegations in the complaint support the reasonable inference that allowing individuals to solicit nominating signatures in the area outside the Westwood supermarket building would not unduly burden Roche Bros.\u2019 property interests. Roche Bros, invites the public at large to shop at its property and offers numerous amenities to attract a significant number of people with diverse needs and interests. Furthermore, as the only supermarket in Westwood and especially given the other features it offers, it is likely that the property does draw large numbers of people on a daily basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Like the plaintiff in <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 92, Glovsky seeks only the right to engage in \u201cunobtrusive and reasonable solicitations\u201d outside the store entrance. Nothing in the undeveloped record before us suggests that the proposed, presumably brief, interactions with shoppers as they enter or leave the supermarket would interfere with Roche Bros.\u2019 use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>its property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Roche Bros, argues that, as compared to the common areas of a shopping mall, requiring it to permit signature solicitation outside its entrance would impose an undue burden because the close proximity to its free-standing establishment would create greater risks both that Roche Bros, will be seen as indorsing the potential political candidate in question and that its patrons will be unable to avoid the solicitations as they enter or leave the supermarket. Without further evidentiary support, however, these hypothetical risks do not outweigh the interest of an individual seeking nominating signatures in accessing the property. It cannot be assumed at this stage of the proceeding that Roche Bros, would be identified with the views expressed by a person soliciting nominating signatures merely because the person does so on premises owned by Roche Bros, but open to the general public. See <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 93. See also <em>PruneYard Shopping Ctr. </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 87 (1980) (PruneYard). For example, Roche Bros, could post signs in the area disavowing any association with potential political candidates. See <em>PruneYard, supra. </em>Additionally, Roche Bros, could prevent those soliciting signatures from harassing its patrons and impairing its commercial interests by prescribing reasonable restrictions on the location, time, and manner in which the nominating signatures may be sought. See <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 84, 93. See also <em>PruneYard, supra </em>at 83.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We are not persuaded by the California cases on which Roche Bros, relies for the proposition that a State constitutional right to engage in expressive activity in the common areas of a shopping mall should not extend to the area outside a supermarket.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See note 6, <em>supra. </em>California decisional law recognizes an expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>right to engage in free speech on certain private property that is broader than the limited art. 9 right to solicit nominating signatures that we have recognized thus far. See <em>Fashion Valley Mall, LLC </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>42 Cal. 4th 850, 869-870 (2007), citing Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2. Although the California Supreme Court has identified the State\u2019s constitutional provision addressing the right to petition the government as an additional ground for protecting the solicitation of petition signatures on certain private property, see <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Ctr., </em>23 Cal. 3d 899, 910 (1979), aff\u2019d, <em>PruneYard, supra, </em>citing Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, the California courts have not interpreted this provision as extending the right to solicit signatures beyond the protection afforded by California\u2019s free speech clause. See <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th 106, 122 (2003) (\u201cTo establish a right to solicit signatures at the entrance to a specific store, it must be shown that the particular location is impressed with the character of a traditional public forum for purposes of free speech\u201d); <em>Westside Sane/Freeze </em>v. <em>Ernest W. Hahn, Inc., </em>224 Cal. App. 3d 546, 554 (1990) (California\u2019s free speech clause provides \u201cprimary source\u201d for right to solicit signatures identified in <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Ctr., supra). </em>Accordingly, recognition by the California courts of an individual\u2019s right to solicit signatures on private property would open the property to a host of \u201cother forms of expressive activity\u201d and thereby impose a greater burden on the property owner than we so far have recognized under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, supra </em>at 128-129.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Furthermore, in concluding that the balance of interests weighs in favor of the supermarket owner, the California cases rely on the fact that such an owner has invited the public only to pass through the area outside the store\u2019s entrance, not to congregate there. See <em>Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 8, </em>55 Cal. 4th 1083, 1092-1093 (2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2799 (2013); <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th at 120-122; <em>Trader Joe\u2019s Co. </em>v. <em>Progressive Campaigns, Inc., </em>73 Cal. App. 4th 425, 433-434 (1999). For purposes of art. 9, however, this consideration carries little weight in balancing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>interests presented. In <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 92, when comparing shopping malls to the \u201cdowntown\u201d area of a municipality, we focused on the malls as an attraction for retail shopping, not on whether people congregate in particular parts of the malls. In terms of access to the public, it matters little to a signature gatherer whether people congregate in an area or merely pass through. Likewise, although signature solicitation might intrude less on a property owner\u2019s interests if the owner already permits people to congregate on the property to engage in political and expressive activities, see <em>id. </em>at 93 n.12, that does not imply that such solicitation necessarily would burden the interests of any other property owner. As discussed, nothing in the record suggests that unobtrusive signature solicitation, subject to such reasonable restrictions as Roche Bros, may prescribe, would impair Roche Bros.\u2019 commercial interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We conclude that Glovsky plausibly has alleged a right under art. 9 to solicit nominating signatures on the private property outside Roche Bros.\u2019 Westwood supermarket. We now turn to whether Glovsky may seek relief under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act for Roche Bros.\u2019 alleged violation of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">c. <em>Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. </em>\u201cNot every violation of law is a violation of the [Massachusetts Civil Rights Act].\u201d <em>Brunette </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Sch., </em>433 Mass. 179, 182 (2001), quoting <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 404 Mass. 325, 333 (1989). To establish a claim under the act, \u201ca plaintiff must prove that (1) the exercise or enjoyment of some constitutional or statutory right; (2) has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with; and (3) such interference was by threats, intimidation, or coercion.\u201d <em>Currier </em>v. <em>National Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>462 Mass. 1, 12 (2012). See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I; G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H. The Legislature \u201cexplicitly limited the [act\u2019s] remedy to situations where the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion\u201d in order to prevent it from establishing a \u201cvast constitutional tort.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Currier </em>v. <em>National Bd. of Med.

See <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 718 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">For purposes of the act, we define \u201cthreats, intimidation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>coercion\u201d as follows: a \u201cthreat\u201d consists of \u201cthe intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm\u201d; \u201cintimidation\u201d involves \u201cputting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\u201d; and \u201ccoercion\u201d is \u201cthe application to another of such force, either physical or moral, as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.\u201d <em>Haufler </em>v. Zotos, 446 Mass. 489, 505 (2006), quoting <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994), and <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. at 646. We employ a reasonable person standard in determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes such threats, intimidation, or coercion. <em>Haufler </em>v. <em>Zotos, supra. A </em>claim under the act is properly dismissed where the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fail to satisfy this standard. See, e.g., <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 708 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Glovsky argues that Roche Bros, interfered with his art. 9 right \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion\u201d when Visconti, Roche Bros.\u2019 store manager, informed him that Roche Bros, had adopted a policy against signature solicitation, causing Glovsky to feel \u201cintimidated\u201d and \u201cthreatened\u201d such that he vacated the premises. Glovsky relies on <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 823 (1985) <em>(Batchelder II), </em>where we held that a mall security officer\u2019s order that the plaintiff stop soliciting signatures involved sufficient intimidation or coercion to support a claim under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Batchelder II, supra </em>at 823, however, turned on the threat of immediate arrest or forcible ejection implicit within an \u201corder[ ]\u201d from a \u201cuniformed security officer.\u201d See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. at 333; <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. at 719. See also <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Sch., </em>433 Mass. at 184, quoting <em>Reproductive Rights Network </em>v. <em>President of the Univ. of Mass., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 508 (1998) (distinguishing <em>Batchelder II </em>based on security officer\u2019s \u201cheavy-handed use of police power\u201d). Glovsky does not allege that Visconti threatened physically to remove him from the premises or to have him arrested, contrast <em>Sarvis </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>47 Mass.

Our subsequent discussion of <em>Batchelder I </em>in cases dealing with free speech rights under art. 16, however, provides guidance as to the factors that might be considered when weighing any limitations on the art. 9 right. As these cases suggest, the balance of interests between an individual soliciting nominating signatures and the owner of private property would come out differently if the property owner has not opened the premises to the public for the owner\u2019s own commercial benefit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 585-586 (1983) <em>(Batchelder I </em>distinguished where case involved art. 16 rights, and private technology laboratory did not open its property for its commercial benefit, although it did permit public to pass through property\u2019s outdoor area). Likewise, the balance would come out differently if the property is devoted to activities involving a small or narrow group of clientele or a special expectation of privacy.

Accordingly, the strict functional equivalency test urged by Roche Bros, effectively would impose the type of State action requirement that <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 88, expressly rejected. Instead, art. 9 demands a more pragmatic and flexible view of the extent to which private property serves the public in the manner of a traditional public forum such that excluding signature solicitors from that property would undermine the right to equal ballot access.

By failing to recognize the enormous differences between large shopping complexes that duplicate traditional downtown functions and freestanding stores selling multiple products, the court completely undoes the intended balance between the rights of property owners and the rights of those whom they invite to use their property, and creates serious consequences for property owners who miscalculate their obligations despite their best intentions. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc. (Roche Bros.), advocates for a functional equivalence test that is supported by <em>Batchelder I </em>and by the decisional law of other jurisdictions that have grappled with this issue. This test would provide clearer guidance to property owners and individuals and would achieve an appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ate balancing of interests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the functional equivalence test, where private property intentionally fills \u201cthe societal role of a town center\u201d such that it is the functional equivalent of a traditional downtown district, private property rights must yield to an individual\u2019s exercise of his or her art. 9 right, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. See <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th 106, 115 (2003), citing <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Ctr., </em>23 Cal. 3d 899 (1979), aff\u2019d, <em>PruneYard Shopping Ctr. </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74 (1980). The primary consideration in this test is the intended use, design, and character of the property and its common areas in relation to the life of the community, reflected largely in the nature of the invitation extended to the public. Where a property owner invites the public for nearly limitless use, and thereby replicates the environment and function of a downtown district in facilitating mixed commercial and social endeavors, the balance of rights tips in favor of the individual seeking to exercise rights guaranteed in such public forums. See <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 506 (1946) (\u201cThe more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it\u201d). The inverse is that where a property owner invites the public for a more limited use, reflected in a utilitarian design facilitating only the specific commercial purpose of the invitation, the balance tips in favor of the owner, as the limited invitation results in the retention of some of the property\u2019s private nature. See <em>Lloyd Corp. </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>407 U.S. 551, 569 (1972) (\u201cproperty [does not] lose its private character merely because the public is generally invited to use it for designated purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The functional equivalence test finds support in <em>Batchelder I </em>and in the analyses employed by other courts on this issue. <em>Batchelder I </em>involved the then largest shopping mall in Massachusetts, which included ninety-five separate retail stores, a movie theater, a bowling alley, an exercise facility, a beauty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>salon, a religious facility, and common areas that, as a practical matter, were dedicated to the public. See <em>Batchelder I, </em>388 Mass. at 85, 86 &amp; n.4, 92-93 &amp; n.12. The court concluded that where the mall offered such a breadth of potential uses of the property to the public, it functioned as the equivalent of a downtown area, intentionally recreating the traditional downtown district. Consequently, the mall owners could not deny visitors the right to solicit signatures that they would otherwise enjoy in equivalent public spaces. See <em>id. </em>at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The United States Supreme Court and the California appellate courts, on whose decisions this court relied in <em>Batchelder I, </em>388 Mass. at 87-88, 90-91, have similarly affirmed a limited right to engage in signature solicitation or speech-related rights on private property that holds itself out to the public for nearly unlimited use consistent with the function of a downtown district.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>PruneYard, </em>447 U.S. at 78-79, <em>aff\u2019g Robins, </em>23 Cal. 3d at 910-911 (State constitutional free speech right can be extended to large shopping center); <em>Marsh, </em>326 U.S. at 502-503, 509 (business district of town wholly owned by private corporation, which contained residences, streets, sewers, and business block with shopping center, was so broadly open for public use that private property owners\u2019 right to limit use must yield to right to distribute religious literature that would be otherwise available on public property); <em>Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>United Food &amp; Commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>Workers Union Local 8, </em>55 Cal. 4th 1083, 1104 (2012), cert. denied, 133 S.

See, e.g., <em>Bock </em>v. <em>Westminster Mall Co., </em>819 P.2d 55, 61, 62 (Colo. 1991) (assessing whether common areas of mall \u201ceffectively function as a public place\u201d or \u201cequivalent of a downtown business district\u201d); <em>New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East </em>v. <em>J.M.B.

The functional equivalence test therefore has support both in our own precedent and that of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Applying this test, it is clear that there is a meaningful difference between large shopping malls, which consistently have been deemed places where a solicitation right may not be infringed, and freestanding supermarkets, which consistently have been deemed places where such rights are not protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">A large shopping mall like the one at issue in <em>Batchelder I </em>can span over eighty acres, typically serving hundreds of thousands of visitors per week, and containing a wide variety of retail and department stores, commercial establishments, and many other services and amenities.

Cf. <em>Ralphs Grocery Co., </em>55 Cal. 4th at 1092 (\u201careas immediately adjacent to the entrances of individual stores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>typically lack seating and are not designed to promote relaxation and socializing,\u201d but rather \u201cserve utilitarian purposes of facilitating customers\u2019 entrance to and exit from the stores and also, from the store\u2019s perspective, advertising the goods and services available within\u201d). This limited purpose is meaningfully different from the vast invitation of the open spaces intentionally provided in large shopping malls. Absent common areas, advertised programming, or a host of unrelated amenities designed to encourage visitors to pursue varied needs, the invitation Roche Bros, extends to the public for use of its property is a far more limited one than that of a large mall: to purchase the goods and services Roche Bros, offers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Costco Cos. </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>96 Cal. App. 4th 740, 755 (2002). All of the areas and features of the store are designed toward this purpose. There is no general invitation to gather or to come to the store for some other purpose; there is only the invitation to shop and to utilize the ancillary services provided in furtherance of this invitation. See <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>107 Cal. App. 4th at 120-121. See also <em>Lloyd Corp., </em>407 U.S. at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">I am very troubled by the court\u2019s suggestion that the variety of the items sold by Roche Bros, is particularly relevant to the analysis. See <em>ante </em>at 758-759. This is a matter of convenience and not of constitutional importance. The court allows itself to be distracted by the plaintiff\u2019s argument that because the supermarket offers products that in a bygone era would require visits to numerous stores, the supermarket must be considered a wholesale replica of a downtown shopping district. This argument shifts the inquiry from the design and purposeful use of the property to the inventory of the particular store, which may change with the seasons, global product availability, business priorities, consumer demand, or any number of variables irrelevant to the constitutional analysis we are conducting here. It diminishes the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>of other more important considerations by focusing on an individual store owner\u2019s business acumen in determining that a customer might like to buy aspirin and tissues along with orange juice. Were inventory determinative, every general store in the Commonwealth that is not accessible by a public walkway, from the shoeshine-cum-sundries shops nestled within the corporate towers of downtown Boston to the pharmacies and big-box stores which now dot our urban and suburban environment, might be found to have surrendered their property rights to those of individual citizens, with no further inquiry into whether these stores truly function as the equivalent to downtown districts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">It cannot be that a single store, designed to invite customers for a limited commercial purpose, falls into the same class as a large shopping mall simply because it carries a varied inventory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This convenience factor does not import the social and gathering functions that result from the intentional design and use of a property\u2019s common areas to facilitate community congregation, nor does it transform the invitation from a specific commercial one (fulfil all of your daily shopping needs here) to an all-inclusive one (do whatever you would like here). See <em>Trader Joe\u2019s Co. </em>v. <em>Progressive Campaigns, Inc., </em>73 Cal. App. 4th 425, 433 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Rather, supermarkets that lack common spaces designed to facilitate congregation and encourage visitors with varied agendas fail to replicate the historic downtown district. For this reason, other States have explicitly rejected the analogy of a single store or supermarket, even where situated among a few other stores, to a downtown district or to a large shopping mall, and accordingly they have declined to extend certain individual liberties to such private property. See <em>Ralphs Grocery Co., </em>55 Cal. 4th at 1093, 1104 (entryway to supermarket not public forum because not \u201cdesigned and furnished in a way that induces shoppers to congregate,\u201d but rather \u201cto walk to or from a parking area\u201d); <em>Van, </em>155 Cal.

See also <em>Lloyd Corp., </em>407 U.S. at 569 (\u201cFew would argue that a free-standing store, with abutting parking space for customers, assumes significant public attributes merely because the public is invited to shop there\u201d). This court, however, has chosen to ignore this consensus and the predictable reasoning underlying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Even under the <em>Batchelder I </em>balancing test as the court interprets it, which entails more interest-based rather than size, scope, and functional considerations, the balance to be struck for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>supermarket like Roche Bros, should not lean in favor of art. 9 rights. I need not discuss the individual interests of using a local grocery store as a place for the solicitation of signatures \u2014 that much is clear from the court\u2019s opinion, and I do not dispute the importance of this interest. But the court undervalues Roche Bros.\u2019 claims of perceived indorsement and interference with its commercial enterprise and its own constitutional property and speech rights, such that the court miscalculates the interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Where a retail business stands alone in its physical space, unaccompanied by other stores, there is a real risk that it will be seen as indorsing a candidate for whom signatures are being solicited outside its entrance. In addition, where there is only one entrance, and the supposed \u201ccommon area\u201d of the property consists of the walkway to that entrance, other customers will be unable to avoid the solicitations as they enter and leave the store.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the California Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[s]oliciting signatures . . . pose[s] a significantly greater risk of interfering with normal business operations when those activities are conducted in close proximity to the entrances and exits of individual stores rather than in the less heavily trafficked and more congenial common areas.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ralphs Grocery Co., </em>55 Cal. 4th at 1092. Cf. <em>J.M.B. Realty Corp., </em>138 N.J. at 374 (where property stands alone, \u201cexercise of free speech will generate greater interference with their normal use\u201d). The right to solicit signatures cannot truly be exercised \u201cunobtrusively]\u201d when it is done so directly in front of the only ingress and egress of a freestanding store. See <em>Batchelder I, </em>388 Mass. at 92. Although the art. 9 right, as has been noted, is narrower than the right to free speech, a single, freestanding store may nonetheless suffer an impact or interference from its exercise, particularly if it serves to stifle the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>erty owner\u2019s exercise of its own property or speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The solutions the court proposes for overcoming perceived indorsement and commercial interference do not cure these concerns. See <em>ante </em>at 760. There are numerous reasons why posting disclaimers would be impracticable or undesirable for property owners, and time, place, and manner restrictions can go only so far in countering perceived indorsement and interference while still being minimal and reasonable limitations on the solicitation right. Cf. <em>PruneYard, </em>447 U.S. at 96 (Powell, J., concurring in part and in the judgment) (\u201cEven large establishments may be able to [demonstrate] . . . substantial annoyance to customers\u201d of exercise of free speech right \u201cthat could be eliminated only by elaborate, expensive, and possibly unenforceable time, place, and manner restrictions\u201d). These important considerations as to the burden on the owner of property occupied by a stand-alone store have led courts in other States employing nearly identical balancing tests to find the balance tipped decidedly in favor of the owner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The consequences of today\u2019s decision are significant. Aside from swinging the pendulum too far in favor of the exercise of individual rights at the expense of those of property owners, the court\u2019s decision offers an unworkable test in several respects. No retail store except the smallest, most highly specialized one can safely determine that it falls outside the scope of the art. 9 right. All other property owners must interpret the sweeping strokes and muddied reasoning of the court\u2019s decision to parse whether they are obligated to respect an individual\u2019s exercise of the art. 9 right in any common or outdoor areas, even when that exercise interferes with their own constitutional rights or with the livelihood of their commercial enterprise, and even when, under an appropriate analysis, their rights as property owners would rightfully trump those of their visitors. To preserve their independence from perceived indorsement and to ensure a safe and easy shopping experience for other customers, property owners will need to craft careful time, place, and manner restrictions that minimize interference. See <em>Batchelder I, </em>388 Mass. at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In addition, in determining whether they must permit solicitation activity and the extent to which they may restrict such activity, property owners will be inclined to err on the side of caution where the court creates today the likelihood that, if the business makes the incorrect calculation, it will owe compensatory money damages under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>(act) to the aggrieved individual. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. It is worth repeating that we have consistently avoided reading the act as creating a \u201cvast constitutional tort\u201d by recognizing actionable conduct in only very limited circumstances. <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 718 (1989), quoting <em>Bell </em>v. Mazza, 394 Mass. 176, 182 (1985). See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, </em>419 Mass. 548, 564, 565-566, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 931 (1995). But the court\u2019s decision opens the door for a host of claims under the act where they are unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In vastly expanding the realm of private properties on which the art. 9 right may be exercised, and in interpreting the requirements for a successful claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act in this way, the court creates a burdensome and unnavigable standard for property owners. This holding goes too far in eroding the rights of property owners to use their property for commercial endeavors without undue interference. Because I believe that the exercise of the art. 9 right on private property should be limited to properties that serve as the functional equivalent of a traditional downtown area, and that the Roche Bros, supermarket at issue here does not so serve, I would affirm the grant of Roche Bros.\u2019 motion to dismiss on all grounds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">That some jurisdictions employ this functional equivalence test to determine whether the conduct of a private property owner constitutes State action for the purposes of a constitutional rights analysis is not problematic. See <em>ante </em>at note 6. Where we are concerned with private property owners who lure the public from downtown areas by providing a full and nearly identical spectrum of services and resources without providing the individual rights typically afforded in public spaces, the analytical framework employed to determine when a private actor is behaving like a State actor is particularly fitting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The court rejects Roche Bros.\u2019 reliance on California decisional law as a guidepost for the legal analysis here because the right to solicit signatures there is based in the right to free speech, which confers along with it a host of other rights. See <em>ante </em>at 760-762. The court notes that because the art. 9 right is less intrusive in its exercise and less broad in scope, it should extend to more areas than the free speech right. See <em>ante </em>at 755-756. I am not convinced that the balancing must be conducted any differently, or that the result cannot be instructive, where the factual scenarios and the ultimate \u201cspeech\u201d sought are so similar to those of the case at hand. There is no reason why the basis of the right should preclude our comparison where the ultimate right sought, the right to solicit signatures, is the same. Further, <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 83, 87-88, 90-91 (1983) <em>(Batchelder I), </em>and cases cited, clearly relied on California and United States Supreme Court precedent in articulating the analytical framework for the art. 9 right. Despite emphasizing the unique need for personal contact in soliciting signatures and the narrow scope of the right as compared to free speech rights more generally, see <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 91-92, the <em>Batchelder I </em>court indicated no substantive difference based on the origin of the right meriting a different analytical framework. Accordingly, I consider the decisional law of California and other States that have similarly rooted their right to solicit signatures in their State constitutional free speech provisions to be more persuasive than not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> As the Supreme Court of New Jersey observed, \u201cThe hope is that once there they will spend.

As but two examples, the recently developed The Street in Chestnut Hill and Legacy Place in Dedham are both designed with the clear intention of replicating Main Street. The Street blurs the line between commercial and noncommercial purposes by offering a wide range of high-end retail stores intermixed with restaurants, a medical center, a movie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>theater, a bank, an optician, hair salons, a large supermarket, a fitness facility, and common areas for rest and relaxation.

A pharmacy, a movie rental facility, photograph printing services, a United States mail box, lottery ticket sales, small children\u2019s rides outside the entrance, public payphones, or any number of other, small-scale services are all amenities of convenience, ancillary to the primary purpose of shopping for groceries and other household items. They render it more likely that a customer will choose to shop for groceries at this store instead of another option; they do not signal to the public that they should come to the store to engage in noncommercial activities.

Where many malls carry a name that is localized (e.g., Northshore Mall, Natick Mall) or catchy (e.g., Assembly Row, Legacy Place), only the most informed visitor would know the identity of the mail\u2019s owner. Further, because large malls contain \u201cnumerous separate business establishments\u201d and numerous entrances, it is unlikely that permitting the solicitation of signatures would impair the value or use of the property as a mall or interfere with normal business operations.
