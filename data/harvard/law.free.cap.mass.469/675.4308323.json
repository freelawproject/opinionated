L. c. 93B, \u00a7 12A, against a motor vehicle distributor with which it was not affiliated. In the case before us, the principal question is whether amendments to the statute in 2002 broadened the scope of standing under c. 93B, such that Massachusetts motor vehicle dealers now have standing to maintain an action for an alleged violation of the statute against unaffiliated motor vehicle manufacturers or distributors. We hold that the 2002 amendments did not have this effect. Chapter 93B is aimed primarily at protecting motor vehicle dealers from injury caused by the unfair business practices of manufacturers and distributors with which they are associated, generally in a franchise relationship. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the basis of lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Procedural background. </em>The plaintiff Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association, Inc. (MS AD A), is a Statewide organization that represents the interests of new automobile and truck franchised dealerships in Massachusetts; two of the other plaintiffs, Connolly Buick Co., Inc., doing business as Herb Connolly Chevrolet, and Jake Kaplan\u2019s Inc., doing business as Fisker Norwood, are Massachusetts motor vehicle dealers. The plaintiffs commenced this action against Tesla Motors, Inc., an automobile manufacturer, and its Massachusetts subsidiary, Tesla Motors MA, Inc., alleging that the defendants were operating \u201can automobile dealership showroom in the Natick Mall without a license and in violation of law which prohibits a manufacturer from owning a dealership.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were in violation of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7\u00a7 3 <em>(a)</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 4 (c) (10),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and were engaged in a civil conspiracy \u201cto evade Massachusetts law and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>operate an automobile dealership without the required licenses.\u201d They sought declaratory relief, a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that would, among other things, prevent the defendants from owning directly or indirectly any Tesla brand dealership in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint both for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) and (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). They argued, among other things, that the plaintiffs lacked standing to claim a violation of G. L. c. 93B and conspiracy to violate c. 93B because they were not \u201caffiliated dealers\u201d of Tesla or Tesla MA. After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action. He subsequently denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration and dismissed the complaint for lack of standing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Tesla is a manufacturer of electric motor vehicles. It was incorporated in Delaware in 2003. Tesla Motors MA is its wholly owned subsidiary, incorporated in Massachusetts in 2012 \u201cto lease and operate stores, galleries and service centers for the sale and service of Tesla vehicles in Massachusetts and to provide the public with information about electric vehicle ownership.\u201d Neither of the defendants is affiliated in any way with the plaintiffs. The defendants are not members of MSADA, and neither of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the plaintiff individual dealers ever sold or distributed Tesla brand vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">At the time the complaint was filed, the defendants were not licensed to sell motor vehicles in Massachusetts. However, Tesla MA had filed with the board of selectmen of Natick (board) an application for a class 1 license pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a758 and 59.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Tesla MA was also operating a \u201cgallery\u201d in the Natick Mall at which interested individuals could view a Tesla display vehicle and learn about Tesla products and electric motor vehicles in general. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the gallery was the functional equivalent of a dealership showroom, intended to generate sales of Tesla vehicles. The defendants have denied that any sales of vehicles have been made or facilitated at the gallery. In any event, between the time of the motion judge\u2019s ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction and his ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the board approved Tesla MA\u2019s license application and issued a class 1 license to Tesla MA, permitting it to operate a sales office located on West Central Street in Natick (town).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>Statutory framework. </em>Chapter 93B was added to the General Laws in 1970 (see St. 1970, c. 814, \u00a7 1). It was, and continues to be, \u201ca comprehensive statute covering an array of business practices in the automobile industry.\u201d <em>Beard </em>Motors, 395 Mass. at 430. It \u201cwas enacted in recognition of the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. \u201cThe statute aims at eliminating industry practices which may be reasonably thought to operate unfairly or coercively. It is designed to protect franchisees from having to succumb to dictation by manufacturers pressing their own interests in disregard of the health of other elements in the trade and perhaps ultimately of the welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc., 376 </em>Mass. 313, 322 (1978) <em>(Tober). </em>See Brown, A Bill of Rights for Auto Dealers, 12 B.C. Indus. &amp; Commercial L. Rev. 757 (1971) (Brown).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">General Laws c. 93B, as enacted in 1970, remained in effect and in the same general form through 2002. Before the 2002 amendments, c. 93B, \u00a7 3 (a), declared unlawful the use of \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as defined in [c. 93B, \u00a7] 4.\u201d See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>inserted by St. 1970, c. 814, \u00a7 1. Section 4 (3), in turn, itemized \u201ca considerable array of oppressive practices,\u201d <em>Tober, 376 </em>Mass. at 320, by manufacturers and distributors that were deemed to be violations of \u00a7 3 (a). See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (3) (a)-(m), inserted by St. 1970, c. 814, \u00a7 1, and as amended through St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 3. When originally enacted, this itemized list was described by one author as the \u201cThe Dealers\u2019 \u2018Bill of Rights\u2019 Provision,\u201d and was intended to protect franchised dealerships from specific types of abuses by their manufacturers. Brown, <em>supra </em>at 799-806. Chapter 93B also had a section authorizing the Attorney General, at the request of a dealer, manufacturer, or distributor, to enforce compliance with the chapter in accordance with G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 4-8, inclusive, see c. 93B, \u00a7 12, as amended by St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 5, as well as a provision conferring a private right of action on motor vehicle dealers damaged by one or more of the proscribed acts or practices. See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 12A, as amended by St. 1985, c. 689, \u00a72.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The 2002 statutes repealed in its entirety the then-existing c. 93B and replaced it with a new c. 93B. See St. 2002, c. 222, \u00a7 3. However, many of the core provisions and the general structure of the previous statute have remained essentially the same. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>cally, \u00a7 3 <em>(a) </em>of the new c. 93B<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> continues to declare unlawful the use of \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices, as defined in [\u00a7] 4,\u201d and \u00a7 4 (c), like the former \u00a7 4 (3), consists of an itemized list of specific acts that are deemed to be violative of \u00a7 3 <em>(a). </em>Although the section number has changed, c. 93B continues to give the Attorney General the power to enforce compliance with the statute on request of any dealer, manufacturer, or distributor, see c. 93B, \u00a7 14, inserted by St. 2002, c. 222, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Of particular concern in this case are new \u00a7 4 (c) (10) and new \u00a7 15 (a). Under \u00a7 4 (c) (10), it is unlawful for a manufacturer, distributor, or franchisor representative \u201cto own or operate, either directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, parent company or firm, a motor vehicle dealership located in the commonwealth of the same line make as any of the vehicles manufactured, assembled or distributed by the manufacturer or distributor.\u201d G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (10), inserted by St. 2002, c. 222, \u00a7 3. Under the cognate provision of the version of the statute that existed just before its 2002 amendments, it was unlawful for a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler \u201cto own and operate, either directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, parent or affiliated company or firm, a motor vehicle dealership within the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make.\u201d See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (3) <em>(k), </em>as amended through St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 3. Section 15 (a) creates a private right of action for dealers injured by statutory violations \u2014 a right that formerly was set out in c. 93B, \u00a7 12A \u2014 and adds a private right of action for manufacturers and distributors who may suffer injury on account of statutory violations by dealers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs urge us to read literally the language of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7\u00a7 4 (c) (10) and 15 <em>(a), </em>and to conclude that they have standing. In particular, they argue that the plain language of \u00a7 15 <em>(a) </em>permits \u201c[a]ny . . . motor vehicle dealer\u201d who has been injured by \u201cany act prohibited or declared unlawful under\u201d c. 93B to maintain an action against the offending entity. Because they see the defendants\u2019 operation of a factory-owned store selling Tesla brand vehicles as a violation of \u00a7 4 <em>(c) </em>(10), and therefore an unlawful act within the meaning of \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>they assert that \u00a7 15 <em>(a) </em>gives them standing. The plaintiffs\u2019 position is that, given the unambiguous language of \u00a7 15 <em>(a) </em>and \u00a7 4 (c) <em>(10), </em>the motion judge erred in considering the history and purpose of c. 93B and this court\u2019s decision in the <em>Beard Motors </em>case to adopt a reading of the statute different from the one they advance. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">First, although the parties do not address this point, it is not entirely clear that the plain language of \u00a7 4 <em>(c) </em>(10) applies to the defendants\u2019 conduct and renders it unlawful, as the plaintiffs contend. They maintain that \u00a7 4 (c) (10) prohibits a manufacturer such as Tesla, directly or through a subsidiary such as Tesla MA, from owning or operating in the Commonwealth \u201ca motor vehicle dealership\u201d selling its own line make of automobiles. \u201cMotor vehicle dealership\u201d is a term defined in c. 93B as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cany person who, in the ordinary course of its business, is engaged in the business of selling new motor vehicles to consumers or other end users <em>pursuant to a franchise agreement </em>and who has obtained a class 1 license pursuant to the provisions of [G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59]\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 2002, c. 222, \u00a7 3. Because neither Tesla nor Tesla MA is engaged in the business of selling new Tesla motor vehicles in Massachusetts \u201cpursuant to a franchise agreement,\u201d there appears to be a question whether Tesla\u2019s business model involves the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle dealership\u201d within the meaning of c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (10), and therefore whether, by its literal terms, the proscription of \u00a7 4 <em>(c) </em>(10) applies to the defendants at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Second, and more significantly, the plaintiffs take too narrow an approach to the task of interpreting the statutory provisions at issue. Although the specific language of a statute is obviously key, \u201c[t]he general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. Rollins, 286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). This is particularly true when a party\u2019s standing is the issue to be decided. Indeed, in the <em>Beard Motors </em>case, where the plaintiff\u2019s standing was precisely the question at hand, this court rejected essentially the same approach to statutory interpretation as the plaintiffs here advance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cWe have often recognized that not every party who can claim an injury as a result of violations of a statute or regulation has standing to bring an action thereunder. This is true even when a literal reading of the statute, without regard to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting it, would appear to provide a broader grant of standing. See, e.g., <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>374 Mass. 278, 283 (1978) (statute authorizing action by \u2018any . . . person interested\u2019); <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 429 (1949) (statute authorizing action by \u2018any person aggrieved\u2019); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>235 Mass. 33, 34-35 (1920) (same). The scope of the grant of authority to bring an action for violation of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 12A [now \u00a7 15], must be determined with reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>context and subject matter of the statute. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 44 (1977); <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Commissioners on Height of Bldgs. in Boston, </em>242 Mass. 30, 33 (1922). Whether Beard has standing under \u00a7 12A depends upon the intent of the Legislature. To determine the intent of the Legislature, we look to both the language and purposes of the act. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, supra </em>at 284.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201cUnless the Legislature has clearly indicated that it intends a broader grant of standing, see, e.g., <em>Fournier </em>v. <em>Troianello, 332 </em>Mass. 636, 639 (1955), we have generally looked to whether the party claiming to have standing has alleged an injury \u2018within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u2019 <em>Penal Insts. Comm\u2019r for Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>382 Mass. 527, 532 (1981), quoting <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., 313 </em>Mass. 290, 293 (1977). See also <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, supra </em>at 429-430 (\u2018It was no part of the purpose of the zoning regulations to protect business from competition,\u2019 therefore, a person alleging injury due to increase in competition is not a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 within the meaning of the statute). An analysis of the provisions of G. L. c. 93B and of the Legislature\u2019s apparent objectives in enacting the statute leads to the conclusion that Beard has not alleged injury within the area of concern of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>Beard Motors, </em>395 Mass. at 431-432.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The plaintiffs here attempt to distinguish the holding of <em>Beard Motors </em>by focusing on its particular facts, arguing that the court looked to the history and purpose of the statute to avoid reaching an illogical result in the case. We disagree. <em>Beard Motors </em>and the cases cited in that case stand for the well-settled proposition that, in matters of standing to maintain actions for statutory violations, courts must look to the history and purpose of the statute to determine its intended \u201carea of concern.\u201d The objective is not merely to avoid illogical results, but to respect the Legislature\u2019s intent by recognizing standing only for those whom the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>intended to protect.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The plaintiffs also maintain that, even if one were to take into account the history and purpose of the statute, they have standing to pursue their claim because theirs is a type of injury that the Legislature intended to be remedied by c. 93B. Their claimed injury is that they will be at a disadvantage competing with the defendants, who will be selling Tesla brand vehicles through company-owned stores and not through franchised dealerships. They allege that \u201c[ujnless the defendants are enjoined, they will be allowed to compete unfairly with the dealers as their model of manufacturer owned dealerships with remote service centers will allow Tesla and Tesla MA financial savings which would not be available to Massachusetts dealers who must spend considerably to conform to Massachusetts law. This could cause inequitable pricing which also [could] cause consumer confusion and the inability to fairly consider the various automobiles offered.\u201d Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, however, the type of competitive injury they describe between unaffiliated entities is not within the statute\u2019s area of concern. See <em>American Honda Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Bernardi\u2019s, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 425, 436 (2000) (discussing \u201crelevant market area\u201d requirement of statute then in effect; \u201cChapter 93B was not intended to provide all dealers with a statutory right to seek protection from potential competition\u201d); <em>Tober, </em>376 Mass. at 322-323 (discussing statute\u2019s purpose as \u201cpreserving a sound competitive market free of the domination of oligopolists at the top of a vertical chain of manufacturer, distribution and sale. . . . But if the statute works sometimes to protect established dealers from new competition, this may be seen not as the object of the legislation, but as an incident in the pursuit of an ultimately procompetitive goal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">As previously discussed, the purpose of c. 93B historically was to protect motor vehicle dealers from a host of unfair acts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>practices directed at them by their own brand manufacturers and distributors. The 2002 amendments did not change this goal. It is difficult, if not impossible, to view the current version of c. 93B, \u00a7 4 <em>(c), </em>as representing anything other than the same dominant thrust, i.e., to prevent abuses by manufacturers of their franchisee dealers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The various subsections of \u00a7 4 (c) other than \u00a7 4 (c) (10) all clearly relate to relationships between manufacturers, distributors, and franchise representatives, on the one hand, and their affiliated dealers, on the other. See G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (1) (governing allocation of new vehicles by manufacturers and distributors to their dealers); \u00a7 4 (c) (2) (governing disclosure to dealers of methodology by which such vehicles are allocated); \u00a7 4 (c) (3) (governing delivery of vehicles from manufacturers and distributors to their franchised dealers); \u00a7 4 (c) (4) (proscribing threats to terminate franchise agreements); \u00a7 4 (c) (5) (prohibiting sales of same model vehicles to different dealers at disparate prices); \u00a7 4 (c) (6) (prohibiting sales to individuals at price lower than price offered and charged to dealers); \u00a7 4 (c) (7) (prohibiting sales of parts and accessories to different dealers at disparate prices); \u00a7 4 (c) (8) (proscribing imposition of unreasonable restrictions on financial arrangement or structure of dealerships); \u00a7 4 (c) (9) (proscribing receipt of money, goods, or services from persons transacting with dealers, without accounting to dealers for same); \u00a7 4 (c) (11) (prohibiting coercion of dealers to release, assign, or waive prospectively their rights under chapter); \u00a7 4 (c) (12) (proscribing use of parent company, subsidiary, or agent to accomplish what otherwise would be prohibited conduct by manufacturer or distributor under chapter). It would be anomalous to find, within this detailed list of rights and protections that are conferred on dealers vis-a-vis their manufacturers and distributors, a lone provision giving dealers protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>against competition from an unaffiliated manufacturer. Yet that is how the plaintiffs would have us construe \u00a7 4 (c) (10). Absent a clear indication that the Legislature intended to have \u00a7 4 (c) (10) differ from \u00a7 4 (c) (11)-(12) in such a significant way, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of \u00a7 4 (c) (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">As the defendants suggest, the language of that subsection can more easily and naturally be understood as eliminating the \u201crelevant market area\u201d restriction that existed in c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (3) (k), as amended by St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 3, the antecedent version of \u00a7 4 (c) (10) that was in effect prior to the 2002 amendments. Under \u00a7 4 (3) <em>(k), </em>a manufacturer was precluded (with limited exceptions not relevant here) from owning and operating \u201ca motor vehicle dealership within the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make.\u201d Dealers were thus protected from having to compete with their affiliated manufacturers for sales within a defined geographical area.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The 2002 amendments broadened that protection: \u00a7 4 (c) (10) precludes a manufacturer from competing for sales with an affiliated dealership by operating a dealership anywhere within the Commonwealth, not just within the defined \u201crelevant market area\u201d of one of its affiliated dealers. G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The legislative history relating specifically to the enactment of \u00a7 4 (c) (10) in 2002 supports our reading of this section. The sole item of legislative history relied on by the plaintiffs is a \u201cposition paper\u201d written by MS ADA and presented to the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor in May, 2001, at the time the committee was considering an earlier version of amendments to c. 93B, 2001 Senate Doc. No. 87. The MSADA paper explained the key provisions of that bill and expressed the association\u2019s support for it. The paper stated that 2001 Senate Doc. No. 87 would eliminate two \u201cloopholes\u201d under c. 93B as then in effect,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> by \u201cexplicitly prevent[ing] factory ownership or operation of new or used vehicle stores.\u201d Specifically, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>paper, the Senate bill would \u201cprohibit the direct sale of new cars to consumers by the factories.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">However, 2001 Senate Doc. No. 87 was not the bill that ultimately was enacted. Rather, the bill that, a year later, the Legislature enacted and the then Acting Governor Jane Swift signed into law as St. 2002, c. 222, was 2002 Senate Doc. No. 2412.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This bill, and therefore the new G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 <em>(c) </em>(10), that resulted from it, did not include the language from 2001 Senate Doc. No. 87 barring manufacturers from obtaining directly or through a subsidiary a class 1 license that is emphasized in note 18, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, language that would have put into place (with certainty) the type of prohibition that the plaintiffs here seek to read into \u00a7 4 (c) (10) was not included in the statute as enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Moreover, two other documents in Acting Governor Swift\u2019s papers concerning the passage of St. 2002, c. 222, indicate that the language in the proposed \u00a7 4 <em>(c) </em>(10) precluding a manufacturer from owning or operating a motor vehicle dealership was intended and understood to apply only to manufacturers owning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>or operating dealerships in competition with their affiliated, own brand dealers. In particular, the acting Governor\u2019s papers include a paper prepared by MS ADA in May, 2002, addressing the predecessor to 2002 Senate Doc. No. 2412, 2002 House Doc. No. 4997. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>This second paper, like the one written to address the Senate bill a year earlier, summarized the key provisions of 2002 House Doc. No. 4997 and expressed the association\u2019s support for it. Recognizing (at least implicitly) that the absolute ban on manufacturers obtaining class 1 licenses had by that time been eliminated from the proposed legislation, the association wrote in its 2002 paper that \u201cHouse 4997 would create a statewide ban on factory ownership of dealerships to prevent manufacturers from directly competing <em>with their own-dealers </em>by indirectly owning or operating dealerships in Massachusetts\u201d (emphasis added). In other words, a manufacturer might obtain a class 1 license to sell vehicles, but under the new legislation it would not be able sell the same line make in Massachusetts if it already had an affiliated dealer within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The second relevant paper in the acting Governor\u2019s file is a memorandum to her from her deputy chief legal counsel in August, 2002, when 2002 Senate Doc. No. 2412 was before her for signature. The memorandum states that \u201c[t]he purpose of this law is apparently to protect dealers in their relationships with manufacturers, given the imbalance of bargaining power between the two.\u201d Further, in an apparent reference to \u00a7 4 (c) (10), the memorandum states that \u201cdealers wanted to clarify that manufacturers should not be able to operate as dealers too <em>(and thereby compete with their own </em>franchisees)\u201d (emphasis added); the memorandum also indicates that the bill\u2019s language was in response to dealers\u2019 complaints \u201cthat manufacturers can compete unfairly <em>with their own franchisees </em>by owning their own dealerships\u201d (emphasis added). Finally, the memorandum assures the acting Governor that the amendments to G. L. c. 93B included in the proposed legislation were negotiated at length to the satisfaction of all concerned \u2014 manufacturers, dealers, and consumer interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We take from these additional materials in the acting Governor\u2019s file that St. 2002, c. 222, was intended and understood only to prohibit manufacturer-owned dealerships when, unlike Tesla, the manufacturer already had an affiliated dealer or dealers in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>With a proper understanding of the language, history, and purpose of the statute in mind, we hold that G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 15, does not confer standing on a motor vehicle dealer to maintain an action for violation of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (10), against a manufacturer with which the dealer is not affiliated.

L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, alleging that the license violated G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (c) (10). A different judge in the Superior Court allowed Tesla MA to intervene in that action and then dismissed the action on motion of Tesla MA and the board of selectmen of Natick. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action because they had not demonstrated a legally cognizable injury, and because the statute governing the issuance of the license, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, did not give them a right to challenge the granting of the license. The order dismissing the complaint in that action came after the order dismissing the complaint in this case, but neither MSADA nor Brigham-Gill appealed the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Tesla and Tesla MA argue, as an alternative basis for upholding the judgment of dismissal in this case, that the plaintiffs are barred by principles of res judicata from relitigating the issue of standing.

The agreement was conditioned on Bullock\u2019s obtaining consent to the assignment from the relevant Toyota distributor and the Toyota importer for the United States. <em>Id. </em>It suffices to say that consent was not forthcoming and the sale did not take place. <em>Id. </em>Beard commenced an action against the distributor and the importer, claiming a violation of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (3) (z), <em>id. </em>at 430, as then in effect, which required the written consent to the assignment of the manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, <em>\u201cwhich consent shall not unreasonably be </em>withheld\u2019 (emphasis added). G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4 (3) (z), as amended through St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 3. The sole issue in the case was whether Beard, never having been a Toyota dealer, had standing under G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 12A (now \u00a7 15 [a]), to maintain an action against Toyota, claiming violation of a subsection of \u00a7 4 (3) (now \u00a7 4 [c]). <em>Beard Motors, </em>395 Mass. at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This court examined the language, history, and purposes of the statute. Despite the seemingly broad language of \u00a7 12A, which, like the present \u00a7 15 <em>(a), </em>on its face conferred standing on <em>any </em>motor vehicle dealer to maintain an action against a distributor alleging an unfair act or practice in violation of the statute, Beard did not have standing because its alleged injury was not within the statute\u2019s intended area of concern. <em>Id. </em>at 431-433.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The plaintiffs claim to recognize that a determination of the statute\u2019s area of concern is critical, yet argue that the area of concern is to be determined (absent ambiguity or illogical results) solely from the language of the statute. To the contrary, numerous cases of this court, addressing standing issues in a variety of contexts, have held that we find the intended area of concern, and hence the interests that the Legislature intended to protect, based on consideration not only of the language of a statute, but also on an examination of its history and purpose. In addition to the cases cited in the passage from <em>Beard Motors </em>quoted in the text, see, e.g., <em>HSBC Bank USA, N.A. </em>v. <em>Matt, </em>464 Mass. 193, 200 (2013), and cases cited; <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl.

L. c. 93B, because those cases involved subsections of c. 93B, \u00a7 4, that applied on their face only to affiliated parties. We are not persuaded by this myopic reading of the cases. <em>Beard Motors, </em>in particular, spoke in broad terms about the history and intent of the entire statute, not just the specific subsection that was in play in that case. <em>Beard Motors, </em>395 Mass. at 430-433.
