The librarian had been suspended for \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d the librarian, pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D. The arbitrator applied a just cause standard of review and overturned the sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>pension on the ground that the school district failed to meet its burden of proof. The school district filed an action to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, and for declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231 A. A judge in the Superior Court denied the school district\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and allowed the librarian\u2019s cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings, thereby confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. The school district appealed, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We hold that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by reviewing the merits of the suspension. We further hold that the proper standard of review is whether the district sustained its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the particular reason cited for the suspension. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>The librarian, Ann Marie Speicher, had been employed as a school librarian for at least three consecutive school years by the Assabet Valley Regional Vocational School District (district) as of October 29, 2009. As such, she was considered a \u201cteacher\u201d under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, and entitled to professional teacher status under G. L. c. 71 \u00a7 42. A district employee with professional teacher status may seek review of a suspension by following the arbitration procedures set forth in \u00a7 42. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The district superintendent, based on an investigation conducted by Speicher\u2019s principal, suspended Speicher without pay for twenty days for conduct deemed by the superintendent to be unbecoming a \u201cteacher.\u201d The superintendent determined that Speicher had vouched for a student\u2019s presence in the library for an amount of time in excess of the time the student actually was in the library \u2014 time that otherwise would have constituted the student\u2019s unexcused absence from a classroom. Before being suspended, Speicher was afforded all the procedural steps and safeguards set forth in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D, including a predisciplinary meeting with the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Speicher sought review of the suspension by an arbitrator, pursuant to \u00a7 42D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district maintained at arbitration that the scope of arbitration was limited to the question whether Speicher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>received the procedural due process safeguards set forth in \u00a7 42D, and not a review of the merits of her suspension. Speicher, in contrast, contended that she was entitled to a review of the merits of the suspension decision, and that the standard of review should be \u201cjust cause.\u201d The arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing, and he considered the merits of the suspension. He made findings of fact and rulings of law. He applied a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard and concluded that the district had failed to sustain its burden of proof as to whether Speicher had in fact vouched for the student, as alleged. He determined that Speicher\u2019s twenty-day suspension violated \u00a7 42D and must be rescinded, that Speicher should be made whole for all lost wages and benefits resulting from the suspension, and that all references to the suspension should be removed from her personnel file. In confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award, the Superior Court judge concluded that the arbitrator was not shown to have exceeded his authority by reviewing the merits of the suspension, reasoning that nothing in \u00a7 42D prohibited the arbitrator from reviewing the superintendent\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">2. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42D, the teacher <em>suspension </em>statute, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cThe superintendent may suspend any employee of the school district subject to the provisions of this section. The principal of a school may suspend any teacher or other employee assigned to the school subject to the provisions of this section. Any employee shall have seven days written notice of the intent to suspend and the grounds upon which the suspension is to be imposed; provided, however, that the superintendent may, for good cause, require the immediate suspension of any employee, in which case the employee shall receive written notice of the immediate suspension and the cause therefor at the time the suspension is imposed. The employee shall be entitled (i) to review the decision to suspend with the superintendent or principal if said decision to suspend was made by the principal; (ii) to be represented by counsel in such meetings; [and] (iii) to provide information pertinent to the decision and to the employee\u2019s status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cNo teacher or other employee shall be suspended for a period exceeding one month, except with the consent of the teacher or other employee, and no teacher or other employee shall receive compensation for any period of lawful suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201cNo teacher shall be interrogated prior to any notice given to him relative to the suspension unless the teacher or other employee is notified of his right to be represented by counsel during any such investigation. A suspended teacher or other employee <em>may seek review of the suspension by following the arbitration procedures set forth in [\u00a742, the teacher dismissal statute]. </em>Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting any provision of a collective bargaining agreement with respect to suspension of teachers or other employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, the teacher <em>dismissal </em>statute, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201cA principal may dismiss or demote any teacher or other person assigned full-time to the school, subject to the review and approval of the superintendent; and subject to the provisions of this section, the superintendent may dismiss any employee of the school district. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201cA teacher with professional teacher status, pursuant to [\u00a7 41], shall not be dismissed except for inefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, <em>conduct unbecoming a teacher, </em>insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to [\u00a7 38] of this chapter <em>or other just cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201cA teacher with professional teacher status may seek <em>review of a dismissal decision </em>within thirty days after receiving notice of his dismissal by filing a petition for arbitration with the commissioner. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201cAt <em>the arbitral hearing, </em>the teacher and the school district may be represented by an attorney or other representative, present evidence, and call witnesses and <em>the school district shall have the burden of proof.

See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The district contends that the plain language of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D, which contains no standard of review, contemplates only arbitral review of the procedures followed by the superintendent in cases of teacher suspension, and not arbitral review of the merits of the suspension. Speicher argues that notwithstanding the absence of a standard of review in \u00a7 42D, the language of that statute that affords suspended employees \u201creview of the suspension\u201d means that she was entitled to arbitral review of the merits of her suspension. Speicher further contends that the arbitrator correctly employed a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard of review because it was reasonable to do so where \u00a7 42D is silent as to the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cAbsent proof of one of the grounds specified in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, a reviewing court is \u2018strictly bound by the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, even if they are in error.\u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Robishaw, </em>456 Mass. 653, 660-661 (2010), quoting <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of </em>Pittsfield, 438 Mass. 753, 758 (2003). One such ground for vacating an award is that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3). Where, as here, \u201cthe source of authority to arbitrate ... is a statute, and not an agreement, judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the authorizing statute . . . and the scope of his or her authority thereunder is broader and less deferential than in cases involving judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision relating to similar issues arising out of an agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>460 Mass. 844, 856-857 (2011). See <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223, 229 (2001) (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We begin our analysis with perhaps two of the most familiar rules of statutory construction. First, \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purposes of its frames may be effectuated,\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975); and second, \u201c[t]he statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, supra, </em>citing <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Turning to the statute, \u00a7 42D provides that any employee who has been suspended thereunder may seek \u201creview of the suspension.\u201d The statute further specifies that the form of review is \u201carbitration,\u201d and the \u201cprocedures\u201d for seeking review are \u201cset forth in [\u00a7 42].\u201d Section 42 contains the phrase \u201creview of a dismissal decision,\u201d and no one suggests that a \u201creview\u201d under \u00a7 42 means anything but full arbitral review of the merits of the dismissal. The word \u201creview\u201d (by arbitration) was added to both \u00a7\u00a742 and 42D by the act. Where the word \u201creview\u201d appears in these related sections of the same statutory enactment, it should be given the same meaning in both sections. See <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000) (\u201cWhere words in a statute are used in one part of a statute in a definite sense, they should be given the same meaning in another part of the statute\u201d). In this context \u201creview of the suspension\u201d means review of the decision to suspend. Stated otherwise, and contrary to the district\u2019s argument, it means review of the merits of the suspension as well as the procedures followed to reach the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Moreover, we said in <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ. </em>that \u201cthe changes to the dismissal process for teachers with professional teacher status reflect a legislative judgment that it was in the public interest to \u2018depoliticize[e] and streamlin[e] the dismissal process by requiring that contested dismissals proceed directly to arbitration.\u2019 \u201d 460 Mass. at 856, quoting <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 225 n.1 (Cordy, J., concurring). The same reasoning applies to suspensions, particularly where dismissals and suspensions were addressed at the same time by the Legislature. We note that arbitration of the merits of a suspension would further the legislative goal of depoliticizing the disciplinary process, whereas disallowing arbitration of a suspension would have the opposite effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Finally, although not as consequential as dismissals, suspensions are nonetheless serious enough to warrant review, as they can have significant future consequences. Here, in addition to her twenty-day suspension, Speicher was warned that any further misconduct would result in dismissal. For these reasons, we conclude that the arbitrator acted within his authority when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>considered the merits of Speicher\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">We next turn to the standard of review. The standard of review is a question of law. If the arbitrator applied an incorrect standard of review, that error generally is not reviewable. See <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. Robishaw, 456 Mass. at 660. However, because the issue of the correct standard of review has been briefed fully by parties, is a matter of public importance, and is likely to recur, we address it. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 543 n.4 (2010). The parties have observed correctly that \u00a7 42D does not contain a standard of review. However, \u00a7 42D has incorporated by specific reference those portions of \u00a7 42 that govern the arbitral procedure for reviewing dismissals of school district employees. This is an appropriate legislative procedure. See 1AN.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 22:25 (7th ed. 2012); 2B Singer &amp; Singer, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 51:7, 51:8. It is not without complication. \u201cA statute of specific reference incorporates provisions as they exist at the time of adoption, without subsequent amendments, unless a legislature has expressly or by strong implication shown its intention to incorporate subsequent amendments with the statute. In the absence of such intention, subsequent amendment of the referred statute has no effect on the reference statute.\u201d 2B Singer &amp; Singer, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 51:8 (footnotes omitted). See <em>Salem &amp; Beverly Water Supply Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 74, 77-78 (1988). Here, the arbitral procedure of \u00a7 42 was specifically incorporated by reference in \u00a7 42D by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 47. Section 42 has since been amended, but the amendment does not relate to the subject matter of this appeal, and the amendment does not take effect until September 1, 2016. See St. 2012, c. 131, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The arbitral procedures of \u00a7 42 in turn incorporate the standard of review set forth within that section, which places the burden of proof on the school district. Section 42 further provides that when determining whether the district has met its burden of proof, the arbitrator must focus upon the \u201cgrounds for dismissal consistent with this section.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the permissible grounds for dismissal under \u00a7 42 also are incorporated by reference into the arbitral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>procedures set forth in \u00a7 42, and they apply to suspensions under \u00a7 42D. The grounds for discipline enumerated in \u00a7 42 are \u201cinefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, <em>conduct unbecoming a teacher, </em>insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to [\u00a7 38] of this chapter <em>or other just cause\u201d </em>(emphases added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the context of \u00a7 42, the enumerated grounds for discipline constitute just cause for discipline, in addition to \u201cother just cause.\u201d See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 233 (Cordy, J., concurring). Thus, when reviewing a suspension, the statute requires an arbitrator to determine (1) whether the district sustained its burden of proving that the teacher committed the conduct alleged, and (2) whether the conduct alleged is serious enough to meet an enumerated ground providing just cause for suspension, i.e., not trivial misconduct. See <em>School Comm. of Lexington </em>v. <em>Zagaeski, </em>469 Mass. 104, 117 (2014), citing <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). The statute does not, however, empower an arbitrator to substitute his judgment for that of the superintendent as to the level of discipline that is warranted, according to some generalized notion of \u201cjust cause.\u201d See <em>Zagaeski, supra </em>at 115-116; <em>Geller, supra </em>at 231, 234 (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Here, the arbitrator did not act in excess of his authority by reviewing the merits of Speicher\u2019s suspension and concluding that the district had not met its burden of proving the alleged just cause for suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Teachers Association in support of Ann Marie Speicher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The arbitration proceeded pursuant to statute, namely, G.
