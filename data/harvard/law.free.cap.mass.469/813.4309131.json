Several years later, the plaintiff, having by then funded both its own defense and the environmental remediation ordered, brought suit against the insurer, alleging breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief; on a motion for partial summary judgment, the plaintiff obtained declaratory relief establishing the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. The plaintiff then amended its complaint to assert a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (\u00a7 11), arising out of the insurer\u2019s failure to defend; the insurer did not avail itself of the statutory mechanism permitting a defendant to limit its liability to single damages by tendering with its answer a written offer of settlement. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fifth par. Thereafter, and while reserving its rights as to its pending claims, the plaintiff accepted reimbursement from the insurer, with interest, for its expenses in litigating and resolving the DEP matter. It is the consequence of having done so that gives rise to this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">The essential question before us is whether the plaintiff, having been thus compensated for its losses, may nonetheless continue to press its pending claims, particularly under G. L. c. 93A. The insurer maintains that, because the plaintiff has no uncompensated losses, its contract claims must fail as a matter of law, as must its G. L. c. 93A claim, since, as to the latter, the plaintiff no longer can establish the requisite \u201closs of money or property\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>constituting actual damages for purposes of \u00a7 11. The insurer also asserts that the G. L. c. 93A claim must fail for the separate reason that, absent a judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claims establishing an amount of actual damages, and where the plaintiff has been made whole, there is no predicate for calculating multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We conclude that, because the statute does not require a plaintiff to demonstrate uncompensated loss or to obtain a judgment on an underlying claim in order to proceed, neither the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of full reimbursement of its expenses nor the absence of a judgment establishing contract damages precludes the plaintiff from pursuing a claim under G. L. c. 93A. In the circumstances here, however, the plaintiff may not press its remaining contract and declaratory judgment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">1. <em>Background and prior proceedings, </em>a. <em>Factual background. </em>The plaintiff, Auto Flat Car Crushers, Inc. (Auto Flat), operates a vehicle-crushing service in Millis. At all relevant times, it has been insured under a garage insurance policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued by the defendant, Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover). In February, 2004, Auto Flat was hired to remove 600 vehicles from an automobile salvage yard in Spencer. The removal process entailed detaching the vehicles\u2019 fuel tanks and emptying their contents into large drums before crushing the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In March of that year, Auto Flat received a notice of responsibility from the DEP, pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, informing it that a release of oil or other hazardous material had occurred at the salvage yard in Spencer. DEP identified Auto Flat as \u201ca party with potential liability\u201d and ordered it to take various responsive actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Auto Flat advised Hanover of the notice and sought defense and indemnification in the matter. By letter dated June 4, 2004, Hanover denied coverage, claiming that the loss \u201cdid not arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the garage location,\u201d nor was it \u201ca result of operations incidental to a garage business.\u201d Hanover also cited the policy\u2019s pollution exclusion as barring coverage for Auto Flat\u2019s losses. After Auto Flat renewed its request for coverage, Hanover issued another denial letter, dated November 9, 2004, referring to exclusions not mentioned in its first letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In August, 2008, having incurred considerable legal expenses and remediation costs in connection with the then-concluded DEP matter, Auto Flat again contacted Hanover, asserting its \u201cconclusion that Hanover improperly denied both defense and indemnity coverage.\u201d After Hanover reaffirmed its denial of coverage, citing the reasons given in its first letter of denial, Auto Flat commenced its action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Auto Flat\u2019s four-count complaint (1) sought a declaration that Hanover had a duty to defend Auto Flat against DEP allegations that it had released hazardous materials into the environment; (2) alleged breach of contract by virtue of Hanover\u2019s failure so to defend; (3) sought a declaration that Hanover had a duty to indemnify Auto Flat for the costs of complying with DBF\u2019s cleanup directives; and (4) alleged breach of contract by virtue of Hanover\u2019s failure so to indemnify. Hanover filed counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment on the claims concerning the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. Three entries of partial summary judgment followed, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">b. <em>Partial summary judgment on duty to defend (count 1) and subsequent correspondence between parties. </em>In December, 2009, a Superior Court judge allowed Auto Flat\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on count 1, the duty to defend, ruling that the policy provided Auto Flat with coverage for a defense against the DEP allegations. In March, 2010, Auto Flat amended its complaint to add a fifth count alleging that Hanover\u2019s denial of such defense constituted a violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">On May 6, 2010, at Hanover\u2019s request, Auto Flat sent Hanover an accounting of its expenses to that point. The accounting included legal fees incurred in connection with the DEP matter and in establishing Hanover\u2019s duty to defend, and cleanup costs incurred at the behest of DEP. A few days later, and approximately six years after Auto Flat first made a claim for insurance coverage, Hanover agreed to reimburse Auto Flat for all of its expenses, less certain downward adjustments where it stated that Auto Flat\u2019s figures were legally unwarranted or insufficiently documented. Hanover enclosed a check for $449,924.47 with its letter; the check included both $314,170.70 for payment of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>penses incurred<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and $135,753.77 in interest. Hanover stated that it would \u201cconsider making additional reimbursement upon the receipt of additional documentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Auto Flat did not agree that the amount paid represented the full amount owed, but accepted the payment \u201cwithout prejudice to either the insured\u2019s right [to] pursue additional amounts owed for defense and indemnity or to pursue damages under [G. L. c.] 93A.\u201d Auto Flat thereafter submitted additional invoices, and Hanover responded with two more checks. In total, Hanover paid Auto Flat $539,757.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">By letter dated October 20, 2010, Auto Flat acknowledged Hanover\u2019s payment of expenses incurred in the DEP matter. Noting, however, the \u201cremaining issues\u201d of postjudgment legal fees<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> incurred after the entry of partial summary judgment establishing the duty to defend, and the pending G. L. c. 93A claim, Auto Flat indicated its \u201cwillingfness] at [that] time to make a final settlement of the remaining claims,\u201d and made a demand for settlement in the amount of $246,007.71. Asserting that it was undisputed that \u201cHanover [had] fully reimbursed Auto Flat for its defense and indemnification of the claim with interest,\u201d Hanover \u201cdenie[d] any allegation that it violated [G. L.] c. 93A,\u201d and declined to offer any additional payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">c. <em>Partial summary judgment on counts 2 through 5. </em>In April, 2011, Hanover moved for partial summary judgment on counts 2 through 4 of Auto Flat\u2019s complaint, which sought contract damages for breach of the already-adjudicated duty to defend, a declaration that Hanover had a duty to indemnify Auto Flat, and contract damages for breach of the duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hanover argued that, even if Auto Flat could establish a breach of contract as to either duty, Auto Flat already had been made whole by Hanover\u2019s reimbursement of all expenses incurred in the DEP matter, plus twelve per cent interest per annum. Accordingly, Hanover maintained, Auto Flat could not demonstrate that it continued to suffer damages, and its breach of contract claims therefore failed as a matter of law. Hanover asserted also that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Auto Flat was not entitled to a declaration regarding Hanover\u2019s duty to indemnify because \u201cthere [was] simply nothing to indemnify.\u201d A different judge allowed Hanover\u2019s motion, incorporating by reference the rationale offered in Hanover\u2019s supporting memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Hanover thereafter sought summary judgment on count 5 of Auto Flat\u2019s complaint, which alleged a violation of G. L. c. 93A by virtue of Hanover\u2019s failure to defend Auto Flat in the DEP litigation. Hanover made much the same argument as it had in its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract and indemnification claims, namely that Hanover\u2019s reimbursement of Auto Flat\u2019s expenses precluded a finding that Auto Flat had suffered a loss of money or property, as required to establish a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">A third judge denied Hanover\u2019s motion, concluding that Auto Flat had suffered a monetary loss \u201cas a matter of historical fact,\u201d notwithstanding Hanover\u2019s payments, which, in any event, were made after the commencement of the action. Citing <em>Ameripride Linen &amp; Apparel Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Eat Well, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 68-70 (2005), the judge reasoned that, \u201c[i]n actions brought under [G. L. c.] 93A, amounts earlier paid by one party to another are appropriately considered as a basis for setoff against a possible award of multiple damages, and not as a bar to the underlying action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The parties then filed a joint motion seeking to report the decisions on counts 2 through 4 and count 5 to the Appeals Court for interlocutory review, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996). The motion was allowed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The central dispute on appeal concerns Auto Flat\u2019s ability to pursue a claim under G. L. c. 93A after accepting Hanover\u2019s payments in reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection with the DEP matter. Although the parties now agree that Auto Flat\u2019s damages stemming from Hanover\u2019s breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>duty to defend have been reimbursed fully, with interest,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the parties continue to disagree over whether such compensatory payments eliminated Auto Flat\u2019s actual damages as a matter of law, such that its underlying breach of contract claim, or its G. L. c. 93A claim, was precluded as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Hanover argues that, in addition to eliminating Auto Flat\u2019s contract damages, its postcomplaint reimbursement of Auto Flat\u2019s expenses also eliminated all of Auto Flat\u2019s actual damages, establishment of which would be necessary for any recovery under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Accordingly, Hanover contends, the denial of its motion for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claim (count 5) was error, but the allowance of summary judgment in its favor on the breach of contract claims (counts 2 and 4), and on the issue of the duty to indemnify (count 3), was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Auto Flat, on the other hand, contends that it has viable contract and G. L. c. 93A claims against Hanover. The G. L. c. 93A claim arises from Hanover\u2019s asserted unfair or deceptive act or practice of refusing, in the circumstances, to provide its insured a defense in the DEP litigation. Auto Flat\u2019s asserted actual damages for purposes of \u00a7 11 are those expenses it incurred as a matter of historical fact and for which it belatedly received full compensation, regardless of whether those expenses were established in a judgment on its claims alleging Hanover\u2019s contractual breaches of the duties to defend and indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Auto Flat argues that, if a judgment is needed in order to establish the amount of actual damages, Hanover\u2019s unilateral and belated tender, absent a settlement between the parties, should not bar entry of a judgment in its favor on its breach of contract claims. In particular, Auto Flat maintains an entitlement to a judgment on count 2, alleging a breach of the contractual duty to defend, for which Hanover\u2019s liability was established by the initial declaratory judgment; such judgment, it contends, would serve as a predicate for any award of multiple damages under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>G. L. c. 93A. Auto Flat argues that the payments it received from Hanover should be viewed as an offset against any G. L. c. 93A damages that might be awarded, after multiplication as appropriate, rather than as a bar to recovery in the first instance under G. L. c. 93A. Auto Flat accordingly asks that we affirm the ruling on count 5, the G. L. c. 93A claim, and reverse the ruling on counts 2 through 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We first consider whether the judge properly denied Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on count 5 before addressing whether the allowance of Hanover\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on counts 2 through 4 was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">a. <em>Partial summary judgment on G. L. c. 93A claim (count 5). </em>Whether Auto Flat\u2019s acceptance of Hanover\u2019s payments eliminated its actual damages, such that it could not proceed on its G. L. c. 93A claim, presents a question of law appropriate for resolution in a motion for summary judgment. Our review is de novo. See <em>Premier Capital, LLC </em>v. <em>KMZ, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 467, 469 (2013), and cases cited. In reviewing a denial of a motion for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party, Auto Flat, will have the burden of proof at trial, we consider whether the moving party, Hanover, has \u201cdemonstrate^], by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), [as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002),] unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, </em>464 Mass. 517, 522 (2013), quoting <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">To be successful, a plaintiff bringing a claim under \u00a7 11 must establish (1) that the defendant engaged in an unfair method of competition or committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, as defined by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, or the regulations promulgated thereunder; (2) a loss of money or property suffered as a result;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (3) a causal connection between the loss suffered and the defendant\u2019s unfair or deceptive method, act, or practice. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>11; R.W. Granger &amp; Sons </em>v. J <em>&amp; S Insulation, Inc., </em>435 Mass. 66, 80-81 (2001); <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 718 (1989). Cf. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Admit One Ticket Agency LLC, </em>454 Mass. 611, 615-616 (2009), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 797 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Hanover does not dispute that Auto Flat has at least a reasonable expectation of proving both the first and third elements. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>As the third judge observed, the claim that Hanover engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by refusing to provide a defense in the DEP litigation \u201cmust at least be viewed as reasonably credible, given Auto Flat\u2019s successful motion for partial summary judgment [on count 1 of its complaint seeking a declaration of Hanover\u2019s duty to defend].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is also undisputed, and indeed the parties acknowledge, that Hanover\u2019s refusal to defend Auto Flat caused the latter to incur substantial out-of-pocket expenses. At issue, then, is the second element: whether, after accepting payments from Hanover, which both parties now agree fully reimbursed Auto Flat\u2019s underlying losses incurred as a result of the breach of the duty to defend, Auto Flat still has a reasonable expectation of proving that it has suffered actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">As to this question, the parties dispute two main points. They disagree, most fundamentally, over whether the damages element of \u00a7 11 requires a showing of uncompensated loss. They also differ over whether a judgment establishing the amount of damages is a prerequisite to recovery under \u00a7 11, and the amount that can be recovered in the absence of such a judgment. We consider each point in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">i. <em>Whether G. L. c. 93A requires a showing of uncompensated loss. </em>Hanover argues that its payments to Auto Flat, made after Auto Flat had obtained a declaratory judgment establishing Hanover\u2019s liability and had asserted a G. L. c. 93A claim against Hanover arising from the insurer\u2019s failure to defend, negated Auto Flat\u2019s actual damages and therefore should bar a claim under the statute. The cases that Hanover cites in support of this argument, however, hold only that concrete monetary or property loss is necessary to support a \u00a7 11 claim. See <em>Transamerica Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Turner Constr. Co., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 452 (1992) (affirming dismissal of G. L. c. 93A claim against insurer where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>insurer paid all defense and settlement costs upfront, such that insured at no point suffered any loss of money). Cf. <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 45 (1975) (\u201csevere emotional distress\u201d does not constitute \u201closs of money or property\u201d). As we explain below, the plain language of \u00a7 11 and cases interpreting it, as well as the policy underlying G. L. c. 93A, make clear that a plaintiff who can establish that it has sustained such concrete monetary or property loss will have satisfied the actual damages element of \u00a7 11, without also having to prove that the loss remains uncompensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">General Laws c. 93A \u201cis a statute of broad impact which creates new substantive rights and provides new procedural devices for the enforcement of those rights.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1975). Recovery under the statute is not \u201climited by traditional tort and contract law requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 244 n.8 (1974). Although acceptance of a defendant\u2019s tender of payment may affect the continued viability of a plaintiff\u2019s contract claims, see <em>Barron Chiropractic &amp; Rehabilitation, P.C. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Group, ante </em>800, 806-807 (2014), such acceptance does not vitiate a claim under G. L. c. 93A as a matter of course, unless the latter claim has been expressly settled. See <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88, 95-96 (2001) (insured\u2019s acceptance of insurer\u2019s late tender of payment extinguishes remedy under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, but recourse to G. L. c. 93A is preserved). Even if the amount tendered represents the full amount recoverable as actual damages under G. L. c. 93A, as Auto Flat concedes is the case here, that alone does not preclude a claim under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Section 11, the particular provision governing actions between businesses, serves \u201cthe important public policy of encouraging the fair and efficient resolution of business disputes\u201d; it is intended to deter misconduct while providing a remedy for those who have suffered a specific harm as a result of a defendant\u2019s prohibited conduct. <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons </em>v. J <em>&amp; S Insulation, Inc., supra </em>at 83-84, citing <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 857 (1983). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991). Section 11 bestows a right of action on \u201c[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal,\u201d as a result of the unfair or deceptive act or practice, or unfair method of competition, of another person who engaged in trade or commerce. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>first par. Such monetary or property loss constitutes the \u201cactual damages\u201d to which a prevailing plaintiff is entitled; a plaintiff may recover up to three times that amount upon a finding of a wilful or knowing violation of the statute. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fourth par. \u201cSaid damages may include . . . attorneys\u2019 fees and costs,\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fourth par., and comprise \u201call foreseeable and consequential damages arising out of conduct which violates the statute.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 979 (1985), citing <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 101 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Thus, under the plain language of \u00a7 11, \u201c[i]f any person invades a [plaintiff\u2019s] legally protected interests, and if that invasion causes the [plaintiff] a loss [of money or property] ... the [plaintiff] is entitled to redress under our consumer protection statute.\u201d <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 802 (2006). Where a plaintiff can demonstrate that it has suffered actual damages, i.e., a concrete loss of money or property, \u00a7 11 does not impose a further requirement that the plaintiff establish outstanding uncompensated loss. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. 303, 314 &amp; n.10 (1976) (because language of False Claims Act then in effect \u201csp[oke] of doubling \u2018damages\u2019 and not doubling \u2018net damages\u2019 or \u2018uncompensated damages,\u2019 \u201d Federal government\u2019s recovery of actual damages did not preclude action under that statute for multiple damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The injury requirement of G. L. c. 93A is designed \u201cto guard against vicarious suits by self-constituted attorneys general who see a wrong but have not actually been harmed by the wrong.\u201d M.C. Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A \u00a7 4.18 (2d ed. 2007), and cases cited. Thus, plaintiffs proceeding under either \u00a7 9 or \u00a7 11 of G. L. c. 93A are obligated to allege and ultimately to prove a \u201cdistinct injury,\u201d <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Michaels Stores, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 492, 503 (2013); under \u00a7 11, first par., such injury encompasses \u201cany loss of money or property, real or personal.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 45 (1975) (\u201c \u2018money\u2019 means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>money, not time, and . . . \u2018property\u2019 means the kind of property that is purchased or leased, not such intangibles as a right to a sense of security, to peace of mind, or to personal liberty\u201d). Where a plaintiff has sustained the requisite \u201cdistinct injury,\u201d <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Michaels Stores, Inc., supra, </em>we have allowed recoveries under G. L. c. 93A without requiring additional elements of proof as to damages. See <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons v. J&amp;S Insulation, Inc., supra </em>at 83-84 (affirming award of double damages as serving important public policy, even where plaintiff was compensated for underlying losses, including interest, prior to entry of judgment on \u00a7 11 claim). Cf. <em>Chery </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 697, 699 (2011) (notwithstanding insurer\u2019s payment of benefits after insured\u2019s filing of claim alleging violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, insured showed, \u201cfor purposes of surviving summary judgment [on G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, claim], an ascertainable loss caused by [insurer\u2019s] dilatory conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">To the extent that a plaintiff already has received compensation for its underlying loss prior to the resolution of its G. L. c. 93A claim, such compensation has been treated as an offset against any damages ultimately awarded, rather than as a bar to recovery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Ameripride Linen &amp; Apparel Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Eat Well, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 68-71 (2005); <em>Friendly Fruit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sodexho, Inc., </em>529 F. Supp. 2d 158, 166 (D. Mass. 2007). See also <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>385 Mass. 390, 399-400 (1982). Treating such compensation as an offset against damages recovered, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>than as a bar to recovery altogether, comports with the policy rationale of G. L. c. 93A, and the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. General Laws c. 93A is a \u201cbroad remedial\u201d statute, <em>Holland </em>v. Jachmann, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 299 (2014); \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s manifest purpose\u201d in enacting it was to deter misconduct, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., supra </em>at 316, and to \u201cencourage vindicative lawsuits.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857. These objectives would not be served by precluding claims on the basis of a lack of uncompensated loss; to the contrary, barring claims under such circumstances effectively \u201cwould undercut the deterrent purposes of [G. L.] c. 93A.\u201d <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Jachmann, supra </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Equating the payments to Auto Flat after the duty to defend was established with a settlement under \u00a7 11, Hanover argues that permitting Auto Flat\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim to proceed in these circumstances would contravene the legislative purpose of the statute to promote settlement. The Legislature, however, has set forth a method by which defendants may settle \u00a7 11 claims. In an effort to prevent needless litigation, \u00a7 11 permits a defendant to tender with its answer a written offer of settlement, and thereby limit its liability to single damages. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fifth par. Hanover failed to comply with these requirements; it did not include such an offer with its answer, or at any other time. A defendant who fails to make a reasonable settlement offer concurrently with its answer, as the statute provides, risks exposure to an award of multiple damages, which is \u201c \u2018the appropriate punishment\u2019 for forcing plaintiffs to litigate clearly valid claims.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857, quoting <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 628 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Under Hanover\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 11 would lose its force; insurers would be free to engage in dilatory conduct, arguably in violation of G. L. c. 93A, with the knowledge that, so long as they ultimately reimbursed claimants for their resulting expenses, statutory liability could be avoided. Even insurers acting in bad faith would be able to shield themselves from exposure to multiple damages, including attorney\u2019s fees, and to preempt an otherwise viable \u00a7 11 claim by reimbursing claimants prior to entry of a judgment. Insurers would be able to do so even where, as here, they initially had declined to tender a written offer of set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>tlement with their answers, as provided by the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such an interpretation would significantly weaken the existing statutory scheme, \u201cdesigned to make it \u2018unprofitable\u2019 \u201d for insurers to engage in unfair or deceptive conduct in the first instance, and would undermine the \u201cprime goal\u201d of \u00a7 11 to promote reasonable settlement offers. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857. We therefore reject Hanover\u2019s argument as \u201cclearly inconsistent with the scheme of [G. L. c. 93A.]\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., supra </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Thus, insofar as Auto Flat can establish a loss of money or property as a result of Hanover\u2019s breach of the duty to defend, and to the extent that failure to defend in the circumstances constitutes a violation of G. L. c. 93A, Auto Flat may maintain its claim under \u00a7 11, notwithstanding its acceptance of Hanover\u2019s compensatory payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">ii. <em>Whether G. L. c. 93A requires prior judgment establishing amount of damages as prerequisite to recovery. </em>The parties also dispute whether the absence of a judgment in Auto Flat\u2019s favor, establishing the amount of damages incurred, precludes or otherwise limits recovery under G. L. c. 93A. Hanover argues that \u201c[r] eco very of damages under [G. L. c.] 93A is triggered by a judgment.\u201d Where there has been no judgment awarding a plaintiff damages, Hanover contends, the plaintiff may recover only loss of use damages (here, interest), which, in any event, also have been reimbursed in this case. Hanover, however, misapprehends the significance of the second sentence of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fifth par., inserted by a 1989 legislative amendment. See St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 2. That sentence does not make a prior judgment a prerequisite to recovery; rather, it provides only that, in certain circumstances, a judgment may constitute an appropriate basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>multiplication, as a penalty for a defendant\u2019s failure \u201cto settle a claim reasonably, [thus] obliging the plaintiff to litigate unnecessarily.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>426 Mass. 683, 686 (1998), citing <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 425 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Before 1989, several appellate decisions had held that the measure of damages for an insurer\u2019s failure to effectuate a prompt settlement of a claim under a policy was \u201cthe damages directly caused by the insurer\u2019s conduct \u2014 typically, loss of the use of such funds from the time when the claim should have been paid to the time that a settlement or judgment was paid \u2014 and not the total amount owed to the claimant under the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., </em>461 Mass. 486, 497-498 (2012), citing <em>Bertassi </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 366 (1988) <em>(Bertassi); Wallace </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 938 (1986) <em>(Wallace); Trempe </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 448 (1985) <em>(Trempe). </em>However, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 93A in 1989, to revise the calculation of damages in certain circumstances. See St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 2 (1989 amendment). As modified by the 1989 amendment, noted with emphasis below, \u00a7 11, fifth par., now provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cIf the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the method of competition or the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of said section two. <em>For the purposes of this chapter, the amount of actual damages to be multiplied by the court shall be the amount of the judgment on all claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction or occurrence . . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\u201cThere is general consensus among courts and commentators that the 1989 amendment was intended to increase the potential penalties for insurers who engaged in unfair claim settlement practices, in response to the <em>Bertassi-Wallace-Trempe </em>line of cases.\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., supra </em>at 498, and cases cited. See <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons </em>v. J <em>&amp; S Insulation, Inc., </em>435 Mass. 66, 82-83 &amp; n.21 (2001). The amendment \u201cexpanded the base on which multiple damages may be awarded.\u201d <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 669 (2002). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>general rule, as provided by the first sentence of the quoted language, is that \u201csingle recovery shall be \u2018the amount of actual damages,\u2019 meaning the (foreseeable) loss to the claimant caused by the violation, this amount to be doubled or tripled where the violation was in bad faith.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 685, quoting <em>Yeagle </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 653 (1997). The second sentence, inserted by the amendment, sets forth an exception to the general rule, applicable \u201cin the particular situation where a claimant has recovered a judgment on the underlying claim.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Yeagle </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., supra. </em>In that situation, the entire amount of the judgment will form the basis for multiplication, even if the judgment represents more than the amount of actual damages attributable to a defendant\u2019s G. L. c. 93A violation. See <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 685-686</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The point is illustrated in cases involving personal injury claims under insurance policies, where the insurer fails to effectuate a prompt settlement after liability has become reasonably clear, in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (f). See, e.g., <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., supra </em>at 497-498. In such cases, an insurer\u2019s unreasonable delay in settling a valid claim may cause a claimant to resort to litigation, and ultimately may result in the claimant\u2019s securing a judgment against the insurer. That judgment usually will provide an amount due under an insurance policy as a result of a covered event such as an automobile accident. In that event, the amount of the judgment corresponds to damages sustained due to the conduct of a third party, e.g., a negligent driver, but does not represent the actual damages incurred by the claimant as the result of the insurer\u2019s unfair or deceptive act or practice of unreasonably delaying in settling the claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 492-493. Nonetheless, by virtue of the 1989 amendment, if the insurer is determined to have engaged in wilful or knowing misconduct, the entire amount of the judgment is to be multiplied, as \u201ca stiff penalty ... on defendants who knowingly or wilfully fail to settle claims where liability on an underlying claim is clear.\u201d <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons v. J &amp; S Insulation, Inc., supra </em>at 85. See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 425 (provision for multiplication of judgment \u201cintended to penalize insurers who unreasonably and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>unfairly force claimants into litigation by wrongfully withholding insurance proceeds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">However, where no judgment has entered establishing a defendant\u2019s monetary liability because, for example, the parties have reached a settlement regarding an amount due under an insurance policy, the provision added by the 1989 amendment pertaining to multiplication of the amount of the judgment has no application.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., supra </em>at 499 n.19. Nevertheless, in such circumstances, the absence of a judgment does not preclude recovery under G. L. c. 93A; rather, the first sentence of \u00a7 11, fifth par., governs. That language provides that a successful plaintiff\u2019s \u201crecovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount\u201d upon a finding of wilful or knowing misconduct. Thus, where no prior judgment has entered, a plaintiff\u2019s actual damages, i.e., \u201call foreseeable and consequential damages arising out of conduct which violates the statute,\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 979 (1985), citing <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 101 (1983), form the basis of recovery. See <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., supra </em>at 499 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In cases where no judgment has entered, the amount of damages recoverable pursuant to G. L. c. 93A therefore will depend on the nature and extent of actual damages flowing from the statutory violation at issue. Where the conduct alleged to violate G. L. c. 93A is an unreasonable delay in settling a claim arising under an insurance policy, we have held that a plaintiff\u2019s actual damages generally comprise \u201cthe interest lost on the money wrongfully withheld by the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 425, quoting S. Young, Chapter 93A and the Insurance Industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>\u00a7 14.19, Chapter 93A Rights and Remedies (Mass. Cent. Legal Educ. 1996 &amp; Supp. 1996). Here, however, the alleged violation of G. L. c. 93A is not a failure to effectuate a prompt settlement, but a breach of the duty to defend. Damages arising from a breach of the duty to defend may entiompass out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the plaintiff, in addition to interest; a breaching insurer will be liable for all \u201cnatural consequences of [the breach] that places its insured in a worse position,\u201d including, in appropriate circumstances, the amount of the settlement reached in the underlying litigation. <em>See Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 764 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Accordingly, Auto Flat may proceed with its G. L. c. 93A claim notwithstanding the absence of a judgment in its favor establishing the amount of contract damages incurred. Discovery as to the G. L. c. 93A claim presumably will take place, and, if this matter proceeds to trial, Auto Flat may offer evidence of \u201call foreseeable and consequential damages\u201d it contends were caused by Hanover\u2019s asserted unfair or deceptive act or practice arising from its refusal and failure to provide a defense in the DEP litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Brown </em>v. <em>LeClair, supra, </em>citing <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., supra. </em>If Auto Flat establishes that Hanover\u2019s breach of the duty to defend constituted a wilful or knowing statutory violation, the amount of actual damages proven to flow from that breach will form the basis for multiplication. Any award of damages will be reduced by the amount that Auto Flat already has accepted from Hanover;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> such offset is to be applied <em>after </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>multiplying Auto Flat\u2019s actual damages, if appropriate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Because neither entry of a judgment nor the existence of uncompensated loss is a prerequisite to recovery under G. L. c. 93A, Hanover has not met its burden of demonstrating that Auto Flat lacks a reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of its case, and the denial of Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on count 5 was proper. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">b. <em>Partial summary judgment on claims for breach of contract and duty to indemnify (counts 2 through 4). </em>As discussed, the second judge allowed Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the claims alleging breach of contract for failure to defend, seeking a declaration regarding Hanover\u2019s duty to indemnify, and asserting contract damages as a result of the failure to indemnify. In allowing the motion, the judge accepted Hanover\u2019s argument that the claims should be dismissed because all damages had been paid, noting that, \u201c[ajfter summary judgment was allowed on [cjount 1 in favor of the plaintiffs, the defendant paid the cost to clean up together with [twelve per cent] interest per annum beginning on the various dates on which the damage occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>At the time of Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on counts 2 through 4, a declaration already had entered holding that Hanover had a duty to defend Auto Flat in the then-concluded DEP litigation. Insofar as Hanover had declined to defend Auto Flat to that point, and instead had \u201cdisclaimed a duty to defend without first obtaining a judicial declaration,\u201d <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. Morrison, 460 Mass. 352, 359 (2011), Hanover stood in breach of its duty. See <em>Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>465 Mass. 741, 745 (2013), citing <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra </em>at 358-359 (\u201cAny uncertainty as to whether the pleadings include or are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they include a claim covered by the policy terms is resolved in favor of the insured, and the insurer must undertake the defense until it obtains a declaratory judgment of no coverage\u201d); <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass.

See <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra </em>at 359, citing <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 763 (1993) (\u201ca breach of the duty to defend is a breach of the insurance contract, and the insured is entitled to contract damages caused by the breach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">On the limited record before us, it is not entirely clear whether, at the time of the motion, the parties agreed on the amount of contract damages attributable to Hanover\u2019s breach of the duty to defend, and the extent to which that amount had been offered and accepted without qualification. Were this a material issue of fact in dispute, as it appears, summary judgment on count 2 may well have been allowed in error. We need not linger on this possibility, however, since it is plain that the parties are now in agreement that Auto Flat has accepted Hanover\u2019s payments in full reimbursement for expenses resulting from the breach of the duty to defend. \u201cSuch acceptance removes the \u2018foundation of [a potential contract] suit\u2019 and necessitates the dismissal of a suit already commenced.\u201d <em>Barron Chiropractic &amp; Rehabilitation, P.

The remaining portions of the judgment allowing Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on counts 3 and 4, and the judgment denying Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on count 5, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-13\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys and United Policyholders on behalf of Auto Flat Car Crushers, Inc.

Nonetheless, by the time of the parties\u2019 joint motion to report the decisions on counts 2 through 4 and count 5 for interlocutory review, they apparently agreed that all of Auto Flat\u2019s damages had been paid, with appropriate interest.

L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 9, need not demonstrate that he or she has suffered a loss of money or property. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Rather, the damages element of G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 9, requires only that a plaintiff establish an invasion of a legally protected interest, in the form of \u201ca distinct injury or harm that arises from the claimed unfair or deceptive act itself.\u201d <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Michaels Stores, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 492, 503 (2013). See <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>445 Mass. 790, 799 (2006), quoting <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 159 (1985). In the absence of actual damages, a plaintiff who prevails on a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, will be awarded statutory damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>of twenty-five dollars, subject to multiplication where appropriate. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions also have addressed whether a plaintiff\u2019s prior recovery of compensatory damages prevents him or her from stating a claim giving rise to punitive damages. While not involving statutes that provide for multiplication of actual damages as the measure of punitive damages, as G. L. c. 93A does, these cases concern common-law causes of action requiring showings of injury comparable to actual damages. These courts have held in pertinent regard that, where a plaintiff has established a concrete loss, he or she may proceed with a claim for punitive damages even where such loss has been fully compensated. See, e.g., <em>Fullington </em>v. <em>Equilon Enters., LLC, </em>210 Cal. App. 4th 667, 689-690 (2012) (plaintiff satisfied \u201cactual damages\u201d element of fraud cause of action notwithstanding already having been compensated; \u201cthe question relevant to determining whether a plaintiff may recover punitive damages is whether he or she suffered a tort for which the law permits the recovery of damages \u2014 <em>not </em>whether those damages have [or have not] already been paid\u201d); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Firstar Bank, N.A., </em>363 Ill. App. 3d 1150, 1160 (2006) (in suit against lender for wrongful repossession of vehicle, payment of compensatory damages prior to trial did not negate fact of legitimate injury, which supported claim for punitive damages).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We are unpersuaded by Hanover\u2019s argument that the only way for a plaintiff to preserve a claim under G. L. c. 93A in such circumstances is to reject the money offered by the insurer in reimbursement of its contract claims. Claims for breach of contract and for violations of G. L. c. 93A are distinct avenues for relief. See <em>Linthicum </em>v. Archambault, 379 Mass. 381, 383 (1979), citing <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 164 (1975). Where a plaintiff is entitled to contract damages, as Auto Flat was after Hanover\u2019s duty to defend was established, he or she is not required to reject payment of those damages in order to preserve a claim under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88, 95-96 (2001). Cf. <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>385 Mass. 390, 398-399 (1982) (tenants who have right to withhold rent due to landlord\u2019s breach of warranty of habitability need not forgo that right in order to establish actual damages and thereby maintain G. L. c. 93A claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The emphasized sentence also was added to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). See St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In such circumstances, the actual damages attributable to the insurer\u2019s conduct generally constitute loss of use damages. See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 425 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Similarly, where parties submit to arbitration a claim for reimbursement under an insurance policy, the ensuing arbitral award does not constitute a \u201cjudgment\u201d; as such, the amount of the award is not subject to multiplication in any ensuing G. L. c. 93A action. See <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. 31, 37-38 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 612 (1992). An arbitrator retains authority, however, to award multiple damages in G. L. c. 93A cases brought before him or her. See <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 669 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">There is no indication in the record that the parties expressly agreed to settle Auto Flat\u2019s breach of contract claim arising out of the breach of the duty to defend, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>but nothing turns on this point. Even had the contract claims been settled, Auto Flat\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim would not be precluded; rather, Auto Flat still would be permitted to seek recovery of its actual damages under \u00a7 11, provided it had not agreed to release its G. L. c. 93A claim. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>was no such release here, however, and the parties clearly did not agree to settle the G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Acknowledging that the amount of money it received from Hanover is equivalent to the amount of actual damages it suffered as a result of Hanover\u2019s breach of the duty to defend, Auto Flat apparently does not claim that it has sustained other consequential damages that remain uncompensated. In proving its actual damages, Auto Flat must in any event establish that the amounts it recovered from Hanover are in compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the breach of the duty to defend on which its G. L. c. 93A claim is solely predicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">As has been noted, Auto Flat does not claim that it suffered damages beyond the amount compensated by Hanover. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>Thus, if Auto Flat successfully proves a G. L. c. 93A violation but fails to demonstrate that the violation was wilful or knowing, such that it is awarded single damages only, the balance after setting off the amount of Hanover\u2019s payments will be zero, not including attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\">For example, in <em>Wolfberg </em>v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 391, 397 (1982), tenants withheld rent after their landlord failed to remedy certain defects in their apartment, and subsequently sent the landlord a demand letter pursuant to G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 9 (3). A judge found that the landlord had violated G. L. c. 93A, and that his response to the demand letter was not made in good faith, warranting double damages pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. <em>Id. </em>at 397. We held that the tenants were entitled to double their actual damages \u2014 comprising the difference between the agreed-upon rent and the value of the apartment with defects, plus reasonable expenses \u2014 to be offset, after multiplication, by the amount of rent withheld. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400. We calculated the damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">\u201c[T]he agreed rent for five months ($330 times five, or $1,650) minus the sum of the fair market value of the apartment, as found for each of those five months ($525), equals $1,125. To this figure is added the tenants\u2019 reasonable expenses ($195), and the sum is doubled, since the judge found that the landlord\u2019s response to the tenants\u2019 G. L. c. 93A demand letter was not made in good faith, for a total of $2,640. From this amount, the rent withheld by the tenants ($990) is deducted. The tenants\u2019 damage award with respect to their G. L. c. 93A counterclaim is therefore $1,650.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 400. See <em>Ameripride Linen &amp; Apparel Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Eat Well, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 68-70 (2005); <em>Friendly Fruit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sodexho, Inc., </em>529 F. Supp. 2d 158, 166 (D. Mass. 2007). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. 303, 316 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Auto Flat has not presented arguments in its brief concerning the propriety of the allowance of Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the claims pertaining to the duty to indemnify (counts 3 and 4). As this issue has not been substantively addressed on appeal, it is deemed waived. See Mass.
