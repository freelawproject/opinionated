We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. This case presents an issue left unresolved by this court in <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223 (2001) (Geller). We must determine the scope of authority granted to an arbitrator by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 (teacher dismissal statute), to reinstate a teacher who was dismissed for conduct that the arbitrator found constituted, at least nominally, a valid basis for dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We conclude that in light of the stated purposes of the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 (Reform Act or Act), of which the teacher dismissal statute is a part, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by awarding reinstatement of Zagaeski on the basis of the \u201cbest interests of the pupils\u201d in the district, despite having found that the school district carried its burden to show facts amounting to conduct unbecoming a teacher. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27; G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. We reverse the decision of the Superior Court judge and vacate the arbitration award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Zagaeski\u2019s dismissal from his position at the Lexington public schools arose from a series of incidents that took place prior to the spring of 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Zagaeski had been employed by the Lexington school district (school district) since 2000 as a physics teacher.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Until 2011, Zagaeski\u2019s teaching evaluations had been uniformly positive, and he had never been disciplined by the district. He was commended by classroom observers for creating a classroom environment in which students felt comfortable asking questions and were engaged in the learning process.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">At Lexington High School, Zagaeski taught an integrated math and physics class for students who tended to be at-risk academically and had struggled in math and science classes in the past. Many of these students also faced behavioral issues and some had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and other learning challenges. In order to engage this student population, Zagaeski developed a teaching style that was less hierarchical. He encouraged collaboration and a more relaxed classroom atmosphere. The arbitrator found that, as a result, \u201cthe students had a more familiar relationship with Dr. Zagaeski than they would have with a teacher following a more traditional teaching style\u201d and that \u201c[Zagaeski] was more flexible with boundaries than another teacher might have been.\u201d However, Zagaeski\u2019s nontraditional boundaries eventually caused problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In April, 2011, a seventeen year old female student in Zagaeski\u2019s class was disappointed with the grade she was then receiving and asked Zagaeski, in front of her classmates, whether there was any way she could \u201cpay ... for a better grade.\u201d A male student in the class asked, \u201cYou mean short of sexual favors?\u201d Rather than correcting the male student for making a comment encouraging the trade of sex for grades, Zagaeski chose to engage in the dialogue himself. \u201cYes, that is the only thing that would be accepted,\u201d he stated. Students in the classroom laughed, and Zagaeski continued by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous\u201d and told the female student that the only way to raise her grade would be better work. He then encouraged her to come after school for extra help if she had questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Two days later, the female student did go to Zagaeski\u2019s classroom after school for extra help. Zagaeski was in his classroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>assisting a second female student in setting up equipment for laboratory work that she would be doing that afternoon. The first female student again asked Zagaeski, \u201c[C]an\u2019t I just pay you for a better grade?\u201d Zagaeski responded, \u201cWell, no ... you know that the only thing that I would accept is a sexual favor.\u201d The second female student exclaimed, \u201cDr. Z!\u201d and laughed. However, the first female student made a complaint to her guidance counsellor about Zagaeski\u2019s comments, which the arbitrator determined was a result of the student feeling troubled by the comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Following the student\u2019s complaint, the school principal commenced an investigation, which was then taken up by the central administration. Zagaeski was provided with written notice that an investigation had commenced into allegations of sexual harassment against him, and he was placed on administrative leave. The assistant superintendent then interviewed a number of staff members and students. He also arranged for an investigative interview of Zagaeski, which was attended by the assistant superintendent, counsel for the school district, union counsel for Zagaeski, and the president of the teacher\u2019s union.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Following the interview, Zagaeski came to understand that the allegations against him were quite serious. He then wrote a letter to the assistant superintendent expressing remorse and an intent to improve his classroom approach. In the letter he admitted to \u201cthe weakness of an appropriate boundary between myself and my students\u201d and the \u201cneed to create much clearer guidelines, not only for the students in my classroom, but for my own behavior towards students as well.\u201d He also stated, \u201cAllowing ... sexually inappropriate comments in the class to go unchallenged, and even to take part in that banter myself is completely out of line ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Subsequently, the district superintendent reviewed Zagaeski\u2019s letter and his personnel file and was briefed by the assistant superintendent regarding the investigative interview and other interviews that the assistant superintendent had conducted with students and staff. The superintendent thereafter provided Zagaeski with formal notice of the district\u2019s intent to dismiss him from employment and of his right to meet with the superintendent to provide additional information on his own behalf. Zagaeski requested such a meeting, which he attended with counsel. Also present at the meeting were the superintendent and assistant superintendent, counsel for the school district, a representative from the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the president of the teacher\u2019s union.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Soon thereafter, the superintendent informed Zagaeski in writing that he was dismissed from his position. The dismissal was based on six separate instances of conduct found to constitute conduct unbecoming a teacher. The dismissal letter also stated that any one of the instances alone would have been sufficient to justify his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">b. <em>Arbitration award. </em>Pursuant to his rights under the teacher dismissal statute, Zagaeski timely filed an appeal from the school district\u2019s dismissal decision, which, as mandated by the statute, resulted in arbitration proceedings. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fourth par. Based on undisputed evidence and Zagaeski\u2019s testimony at the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator concluded that the school district had carried its burden to establish only one of its six bases for dismissal of Zagaeski, specifically Zagaeski\u2019s admission that, \u201cin response to a female student\u2019s inquiry as to whether she \u2018could just pay ... for a higher grade\u2019 [he] responded, \u2018No. The only thing I would accept is a sexual favor.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Regarding this conduct, the arbitrator found that although it was intended only as a joke, it rose to the level of sexual harassment as defined in the school committee\u2019s \u201cPolicy Prohibiting Harassment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The arbitrator further found that even though the comments by Zagaeski were not intended to be taken in earnest, objectively they were inappropriate comments for a teacher to malee to a student. Furthermore, the comments had the subjective effect of offending the student or making her sufficiently uncomfortable to lodge a complaint with her guidance counsellor. Therefore, the arbitrator found that these comments created a hostile or offensive educational environment for the female student.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Nevertheless, the arbitrator went on to find that this instance of sexual harassment was \u201crelatively less egregious\u201d and that the two comments regarding the trade of sex for grades, separated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>two days, could be viewed as \u201cone isolated instance\u201d of sexual harassment. Thus, the arbitrator concluded that Zagaeski\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201crelatively minor and isolated\u201d violation of the harassment policy, which only \u201cnominally\u201d constituted conduct a teacher. The arbitrator further found that in light of Zagaeski\u2019s strong performance throughout his employment, it would be in the best interests of the pupils in the district that he be retained as a teacher. Therefore, the arbitrator issued an award reinstating Zagaeski with full back pay, less two days of unpaid suspension, which was the most severe discipline for which the school district would have had \u201cjust cause,\u201d according to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">c. <em>Superior Court decision. </em>Following the issuance of the arbitration award, the school committee filed a complaint and application to vacate the arbitration award in the Superior Court on the bases that the arbitrator had exceeded his statutory authority in modifying the punishment imposed by the school district and that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy. Zagaeski filed a counterclaim and application to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Under the teacher dismissal statute, judicial review of an arbitration award is limited to the grounds set forth in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. One such ground is if the arbitrator \u201cexceeded [his or her] powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3). The Superior Court judge, referencing existing uncertainty in the case law surrounding the precise scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority under the teacher dismissal statute to reduce or alter the disciplinary penalty imposed by a school district, concluded that the arbitrator had not exceeded his authority in issuing the award. The judge stated that although he was inclined to follow the reasoning of Justice Cordy\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Getter </em>in support of a conclusion that the arbitrator had exceeded the scope of his authority, the judge was given pause by a footnote in the opinion, which states in relevant part, \u201cThis is not the case of an arbitrator finding a teacher to have engaged in minor misconduct that, however, nominally fit within a category on which dismissal could be based. In such circumstances, an arbitrator\u2019s finding that the conduct did not rise to the level of misconduct contemplated by the statute as a ground for dismissal is one that would likely lie within the scope of his authority.\u201d <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). Therefore, because the arbitrator\u2019s award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in this case tracked precisely the footnote in <em>Geller </em>in concluding that Zagaeski\u2019s conduct only \u201cnominally\u201d constituted conduct unbecoming a teacher, the judge concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s award was not in excess of his statutory authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Consequently, the judge denied the school committee\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award and granted Zagaeski\u2019s application to confirm. The school committee appealed from the decision of the Superior Court and filed an application for direct appellate review. We granted the school committee\u2019s application, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>As a general matter, \u201ca reviewing court is strictly bound by an arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, even if they are in error.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. Robishaw, 456 Mass. 653, 660 (2010), quoting <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 758-759 (2003) (Pittsfield). This strict standard of review is highly deferential to the decision of an arbitrator, and it reflects a strong public policy in the Commonwealth in favor of arbitration. <em>Pittsfield, supra </em>at 758. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 228 (Cordy, J., concurring); <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 604 n.4 (2000), quoting <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int'l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 670 (11th Cir. 1988) (\u201cAn arbitrator\u2019s result may be wrong; it may appear unsupported; it may appear poorly reasoned; it may appear foolish. Yet it may not be subject to court interference\u201d). Such strong public policy arises in part from a general recognition that arbitration has long served as an effective means of resolving labor disputes without resort to the courts. <em>Pittsfield, supra. </em>Therefore, in order to protect the efficiency that arbitration affords in resolving these disputes, the Legislature often strictly limits the circumstances in which a court may vacate an arbitral award \u2014 lest arbitration become merely an intermediate step between a dispute and litigation in court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In the education context, the Reform Act replaced de novo review of teacher dismissal decisions by the Superior Court with mandatory arbitration in order to \u201cdepoliticize[ ] and streamline[ ]\u201d the teacher dismissal process. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 225 n.l (Cordy, J., concurring); 1992 House Doc. No. 5750, at 2 (letter from Governor William Weld accompanying first draft of Reform Act). Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6. The Reform Act provided for limited judicial review of arbitration awards by reference to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. However, a reviewing court <em>must </em>vacate an arbitration award under the circumstances set forth in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>including if the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority in granting the award. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3). <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Vong Oung, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 704 (2008), quoting <em>Board of Higher Educ. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n, NEA, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 47 (2004) (under teacher dismissal statute, \u201c[t]he question whether an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority is always subject to judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Ordinarily, where arbitration is mandated by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the scope and limits of the authority of the arbitrator are ascertained by reference to the terms of the agreement. <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Chicopee Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 357, 364 (2011) <em>(Chicopee). </em>Indeed, judicial deference to arbitrators\u2019 awards <em>stems in part </em>from a recognition that the parties bargained for and agreed that an arbitrator would serve as a neutral third party in interpreting the written agreement between the parties, whether it be a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>mercial contract or a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 229-230 (Cordy, J., concurring). In such circumstance, an arbitrator may be uniquely qualified to interpret the \u201claw of the shop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in a case such as this, where arbitration is mandated by statute, the exclusive source of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is the statute itself. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. <em>Chicopee, supra </em>at 365 (observing that in <em>Geller, </em>both Justice Cordy\u2019s concurrence and Justice Cowin\u2019s dissent agreed with this proposition). See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 230 n.5 (Cordy, J., concurring). <em>Id. </em>at 240 (Cowin, J., dissenting). Consequently, courts are as well, if not better, positioned to interpret the \u201claw of the land\u201d in the form of the statutes of the Commonwealth. <em>Geller, supra </em>229-230 (Cordy, J., concurring), and cases cited. Therefore, judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the authorizing statute, particularly regarding the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority under the statute, is \u201cbroader and less deferential\u201d than in cases of judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision arising from the interpretation of a private agreement. <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>460 Mass. 844, 856-857 (2011), citing <em>Geller, supra </em>at 229 (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We conclude that in light of the stated purposes of the Reform Act, of which the teacher dismissal statute is a part, combined with the specific language of the teacher dismissal statute itself, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by awarding reinstatement of Zagaeski. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27; G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth and sixth pars.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">3. <em>Statutory scheme. </em>The statutory scheme governing teacher dismissals set forth in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, was enacted as part of the Reform Act, which brought broad-based changes to the funding and governance structure of the public education system in Massachusetts. Gell<em>er, </em>435 Mass. at 225 n.l (Cordy, J., concurring). See generally St. 1993, c. 71. In enacting this statute, the Legislature declared it a \u201cparamount goal\u201d to provide a public education system of \u201csufficient quality\u201d to afford all children the opportunity to participate in, and contribute to, the political, social, and economic life of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27. The Legislature further identified four specific policy goals the Reform Act was intended to ensure: \u201c(1) that each public school classroom provides the conditions for all pupils to engage fully in learning as an inherently meaningful and enjoyable activity without threats to their sense of security or self-esteem, (2) a consistent commitment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>resources sufficient to provide a high quality public education to every child, (3) a deliberate process for establishing and achieving specific educational performance goals for every child, and (4) an effective mechanism for monitoring progress toward those goals and for holding educators accountable for their achievement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In furtherance of these purposes, the Reform Act made several changes to the statutory scheme governing teacher dismissals, including shifting from school committees to principals and superintendents the responsibility for dismissing teachers, mandating that teachers\u2019 appeals from dismissal decisions proceed directly to arbitration, and providing for limited review of an arbitrator\u2019s award, rather than de novo review of the dismissal decision, in Superior Court. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6, with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">According to the teacher dismissal statute as enacted in 1993, school officials may not dismiss a teacher with \u201cprofessional teacher status\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> except for \u201cinefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards ... or other just cause.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par. If a teacher elects to appeal a dismissal decision to an arbitrator, the burden is on the school district to prove that its dismissal decision was based on one of the grounds set forth in the statute. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The statute further provides the standard by which the arbitrator must review the school district\u2019s decision. Specifically, the statute states: \u201cIn determining whether the district has proven grounds for dismissal consistent with this section, the arbitrator shall consider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Finally, the statute sets forth the range of remedies an arbitrator may grant to a teacher upon a finding that the dismissal decision was \u201cimproper under the standards set forth in this section.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>4. <em>Discussion. </em>The school committee argues in part that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of authority set forth in the teacher dismissal statute by modifying the punishment imposed by the school district despite having found that the school district carried its burden to show conduct unbecoming a teacher. The school committee contends that the arbitrator here found that Zagaeski\u2019s conduct constituted conduct unbecoming a teacher because it is the facts found and the manner in which they are described by the arbitrator, not the label ascribed to the conduct, that is dispositive. See Geller, 435 Mass. at 231 (Cordy, J., concurring). The arbitrator found Zagaeski\u2019s conduct to be \u201cobviously . . . inappropriate,\u201d in violation of the school district\u2019s sexual harassment policy, subjectively offensive, and of the sort to create a \u201chostile educational environment.\u201d Thus, the arbitrator described the conduct in a manner establishing that Zagaeski\u2019s comments constituted conduct unbecoming a teacher even though the arbitrator concluded that the conduct only \u201cnominally\u201d rose to that level.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 231 (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The school committee further argues in favor of the interpretation of the statute set forth in Justice Cordy\u2019s concurrence in <em>Geller. </em>See 435 Mass. at 231, 234 (Cordy, J., concurring). Specifically, the school committee argues that once an arbitrator con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>eludes that the school has proved one of the grounds upon which the statute permits dismissal, the arbitrator is not authorized then to impose a lesser punishment than that selected by the school. See <em>id. </em>According to the school committee, footnote 7 in Justice Cordy\u2019s concurrence could then be understood to mean that only in a circumstance where the conduct at issue is so minor that it does not, in substance, constitute conduct unbecoming a teacher or another enumerated ground permitting dismissal does the arbitrator have the authority to alter the punishment imposed by the school. See <em>id. </em>at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). The school committee contends that here, the conduct found by the arbitrator was sufficiently egregious to constitute in substance, not merely in name, conduct unbecoming a teacher. Therefore the arbitrator\u2019s decision does not fall into the narrow exception for \u201cnominal\u201d conduct contemplated in Justice Cordy\u2019s concurrence in <em>Geller. </em>See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Zagaeski argues, however, that the language of the teacher dismissal statute in fact permits an arbitrator to adjust the discipline imposed upon a teacher even after finding that the conduct rises to the level of one of the grounds for which dismissal is permitted by the statute. Specifically, Zagaeski contends that the language of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par., contemplates the adjustment of a disciplinary penalty by the arbitrator in that it states, \u201cUpon a finding that the dismissal was <em>improper </em>under the standards set forth in this section, an arbitrator may award back pay, benefits, reinstatement, and any other appropriate non-financial relief or any combination thereof\u2019 (emphasis added). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. Zagaeski argues that the finding that dismissal is \u201cimproper\u201d may arise from the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the school district failed to carry its burden to show conduct permitting dismissal, or it may arise from the arbitrator\u2019s independent conclusion that dismissal was excessive in light of the nature of the misconduct found to have occurred. Further, Zagaeski argues that the arbitrator cannot have exceeded his authority by considering Zagaeski\u2019s past performance as a teacher in determining that his dismissal would not be in the best interest of the students in the district because the dismissal statute mandates that the arbitrator engage in such an inquiry. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">a. <em>Scope of arbitrator\u2019s authority to alter discipline imposed by school district. </em>The teacher dismissal statute does not grant the arbitrator the discretion to adjust the discipline selected by the school district to the extent Zagaeski maintains. The purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the Reform Act was not to enhance the employment rights of public school teachers. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27. Rather, the stated purposes of the Reform Act express a concern for the increased accountability of educators and the improvement of the quality of education provided in public schools. <em>Id. </em>Further, the Act eliminated the teacher tenure system, and its reforms to the teacher dismissal statute were intended to \u201cdepoliticize and streamline\u201d the teacher dismissal process. St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. 1992 House Doc. No. 5750, at 2 (letter from Governor William Weld accompanying first draft of Reform Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">To be sure, the Act preserved certain employment protections for public school teachers who achieve professional teacher status, and it replaced the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d with \u201cjust cause\u201d in the catchall provision of the teacher dismissal statute. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 233 n.9 (Cordy, J., concurring) (describing use of phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d as ensuring that dismissals under catchall provision were limited to serious misconduct). However, these changes were intended to serve as a means of furthering the Act\u2019s central goal of enhancing the quality of the Commonwealth\u2019s public schools, not as an end in themselves. <em>See Atwater, </em>460 Mass. at 846, 854. The Act affords some measure of employment protection for teachers to enable schools to attract and retain excellent educators while still ensuring that principals and superintendents can act swiftly in mating critical staffing decisions in the schools for which they are responsible. See <em>id.; Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. 354, 362 (1940) (\u201cManifestly one of the most important duties involved in the management of a school system is the choosing and keeping of proper and competent teachers\u201d). The Legislature\u2019s decision to shift dismissal decisions to principals and superintendents and away from school committees, combined with the Governor\u2019s stated goal of \u201cdepoliticizing\u201d the teacher dismissal process, indicates that the statute was intended to ensure that teachers were dismissed only for valid reasons. However, the Legislature did not necessarily intend for arbitrators to have broad discretion to adjust disciplinary decisions based on misconduct that the school had carried its burden to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Our decisions prior to the Reform Act help to shed light on the balance the Act was intended to achieve between empowering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>school officials to manage the teaching staff effectively while providing some measure of protection to professional status teachers. Specifically, cases prior to the Reform Act expressed concern over teacher dismissal decisions by school committees that were based on \u201cpersonal hostility, ill will or political animosity\u201d such that the school\u2019s stated grounds for dismissal were nothing more than pretext. <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 619 (1961). See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Watertown, </em>330 Mass. 150, 151 (1953) (reorganization of school administration was \u201csubterfuge\u201d and undertaken in bad faith to enable school committee to demote and replace petitioner); <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Revere, </em>249 Mass. 525, 529-530 (1924) (school committee voted to eliminate position of principal not on good faith need to conserve resources but due to disagreement with principal\u2019s political views).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Similar concerns animate footnote 7 in Justice Cordy\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 231 n.7. Justice Cordy concluded that the teacher dismissal statute does not permit an arbitrator to override a school district\u2019s decision to dismiss a teacher if the arbitrator finds that the school has proved conduct amounting to one of the grounds permitting dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 231. However, Justice Cordy acknowledged that at the same time, the statute would permit an arbitrator to override a school district\u2019s dismissal decision if the misconduct in issue is so minor that it does not, in substance, constitute the sort of misconduct for which the statute permits dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 231 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Consequently, if an arbitrator finds that the school district has labeled a teacher\u2019s conduct \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher\u201d when the conduct does not, in substance, truly rise to that level, or that the school district has used that label merely as a pretext to dismiss the teacher based on personal, political, or other unauthorized bases, the arbitrator is empowered to vacate the punishment imposed by the school district. Thus, the statutory directive requiring arbitrators to consider the best interests of the pupils and the need to elevate performance standards in reviewing whether the school district carried its burden to show conduct permitting dismissal is intended in part to prevent politically motivated dismissal decisions. Indeed, the standards governing the arbitrator\u2019s review are likely intended to serve as a direct reminder to the arbitrator of the purposes underlying the Reform Act and the proper considerations for a school district to undertake in its dismissal decisions. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In this case, however, there is no indication in the record before us that the grounds on which Zagaeski was dismissed were mere pretext or that his misconduct was so minor that it did not in substance constitute one of the enumerated bases on which the statute permits dismissal. Therefore, Justice Cordy\u2019s observation in footnote seven in <em>Geller </em>regarding \u201cminor\u201d misconduct, and the concerns expressed in early case law regarding political dismissals based on \u201csubterfuge,\u201d are not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Public school teachers hold a position of special public trust. <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 349 (1983) (\u201cThere are certain forms of employment which carry a position of trust so peculiar to the office and so beyond that imposed by all public service that conduct consistent with this special trust is an obligation of the employment\u201d). <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 538 (1983). They are responsible for more than teaching basic academic skills. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 238-239 (Ireland, J., concurring in the result) (\u201ca teacher\u2019s responsibilities include the maintenance of a safe environment that is conducive to ... students\u2019 growth\u201d). As we recently acknowledged, \u201c[s]tudents must be able to trust that they will be safe in the presence of their teachers and coaches. They must be able to rely on their teachers and coaches to exercise sound judgment and maintain appropriate boundaries, even when they themselves may be unable to do so.\u201d <em>Atwater, </em>460 Mass. at 852 (quoting underlying arbitration award). The creation of a hostile learning environment through sexual harassment, whether verbal or physical, can be detrimental to the well-being of students who experience such harassment in part because it may unreasonably interfere with their education. See G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 <em>(e). </em>Moreover, citizens of this Commonwealth, including public school students, have a constitutional right to be free from gender-based discrimination, which includes certain forms of sexual harassment. Art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 693 (1987) (concluding that sexual harassment can violate rights secured under art. 1). Numerous statutory enactments also make clear the importance of protecting children from sexual harassment in school. See G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 2 <em>(g) </em>(sexual harassment of student in any program or course of study in educational institution is unfair educational practice); G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C (granting right to be free from sexual harassment as defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>G. L. cc. 151B and 151C); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 26.07(2) (requiring public schools to strive to prevent sexual harassment and to respond promptly to reports of its occurrence). Zagaeski\u2019s conduct undermined these policies, as well as one of the central purposes of the Reform Act: to ensure an educational setting that safeguards, rather than warps, a child\u2019s self-esteem. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Of additional concern, teachers are in part responsible for instilling core constitutional values in students in preparation for their participation as citizens in a democracy. See <em>Dupree, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 539. A teacher who models sexually harassing behavior in front of public school students as if it is all in good fun undercuts our constitutional value of freedom from gender discrimination. See <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>400 Mass. at 693. Indeed, students who witness a teacher engage in such conduct may come to believe that such conduct is acceptable in an academic or professional setting. See <em>Dupree, supra </em>at 538, quoting <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 531, 534 (1954) (\u201cAs role models for our children [teachers] have an \u2018extensive and peculiar opportunity to impress [their] attitude and views\u2019 upon their pupils\u201d). Inculcation of those sorts of values by teachers is not acceptable in our public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Reform Act specifically vested in principals the power to dismiss teachers, subject to review and approval by superintendents, in order to raise the accountability of school officials for the success of their schools. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. See also <em>Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. at 760; <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/ Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/ Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 29 n.6 (1996); 1992 House Doc. No. 5750, at 2. We have long-recognized decisions regarding teacher employment as central to effective school management. See <em>Higher Educ. Coord. Council, supra </em>at 28-29; <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 794-795 (1977); <em>Davis, </em>307 Mass. at 362. Although undoubtedly a difficult decision, the superintendent undertook a thorough investigation, determined that Zagaeski engaged in conduct unbecoming a teacher, and dismissed him on that ground. This determination was within the superintendent\u2019s statutory authority and was not unwarranted in light of the broader implications of Zagaeski\u2019s conduct and the purposes underlying the Reform Act. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">b. <em>Best interests of the pupils in the district and the need to elevate performance standards. </em>We further acknowledge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>teacher dismissal statute does authorize the arbitrator to engage in a substantive review of dismissal decisions insofar as it requires arbitrators to consider the \u201cbest interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par. To conclude otherwise would render the statutory mandate that the arbitrator undertake these considerations effectively meaningless. See <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 242-243 (Cowin, J., dissenting). However, we disagree that this statutory language authorizes an arbitrator to draw on a teacher\u2019s past performance to override a dismissal decision based on a teacher\u2019s conduct having threatened the safety and welfare of his or her students. If a teacher\u2019s past performance could be used as a basis on which an arbitrator could award reinstatement \u2014 because, as here, the arbitrator concluded it was in the students\u2019 best interests to have high performing teachers \u2014\u25a0 then the \u201cneed for elevation of performance standards\u201d and the \u201cbest interests of the pupils\u201d would come to mean the same thing. However, the statute should not be construed to render one of the two standards governing the arbitrator\u2019s review as redundant of the other. <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 262 (1984), quoting 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (4th ed. 1973) (\u201c[A] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The distinct meanings of these two standards can be ascertained by reference to the other provisions of the teacher dismissal statute and the stated purposes of the Reform Act. See <em>Saccone </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Mass. 326, 334-335 (1985) (statutes should be construed to constitute \u201charmonious whole\u201d; otherwise their purpose may be defeated [citation omitted]). When the Legislature enacted the Reform Act, it identified the importance of safeguarding students\u2019 \u201csense of security or self-esteem\u201d in the classroom as distinct from, though equally as important as, the establishment and achievement of specific educational performance goals. G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27. This distinction between safety and well-being on one side and academic achievement on the other is also mirrored in the enumerated grounds on which a school district may dismiss a professional status teacher. In one category, a school district may dismiss a teacher for performance-based reasons including \u201cinefficiency,\u201d \u201cincompetency,\u201d or failure to satisfy performance standards. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>other category, a school district may dismiss a teacher for conduct that jeopardizes the well-being of students or the proper functioning of the school community, including \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d \u201cinsubordination,\u201d or \u201cincapacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the standards by which the arbitrator must review a dismissal decision should be construed in light of this same distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Where the teacher conduct in issue is performance-based, the arbitrator should consider the school district\u2019s decision primarily in light of the need to raise performance standards. However, when the conduct in issue has jeopardized the safety or self-esteem of students in the classroom setting, the arbitrator should consider the best interests of the pupils primarily in light of the pupils\u2019 interest in a safe learning environment. Here, the arbitrator permitted the pupils\u2019 interest in the academic success of their school to override their interest in a safe, supportive classroom environment. This determination was in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s authority because it had the effect of nullifying one of the stated purposes of the Reform Act. The Legislature cannot have intended a teacher\u2019s past academic performance to be used to justify reinstatement of a teacher found to have engaged in conduct that created a hostile learning environment for certain students. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>465 Mass. 395, 409 (2013) (statutes may not be interpreted so as to yield absurd results). Despite Zagaeski\u2019s apparent success as a classroom teacher, that \u201ctrack record\u201d should not be used to conclude that it is in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of students to reinstate a teacher who was found to have violated the school\u2019s sexual harassment policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By awarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>reinstatement of Zagaeski based on an interpretation of the \u201cbest interests of the pupils\u201d to mean the same thing as \u201cthe need to elevate performance standards,\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s award overrode the superintendent\u2019s decision on an unauthorized basis and runs contrary to the core purposes of the Reform Act and the high standards of conduct the public expects from its teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Superior Court confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of an order vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42 (teacher dismissal statute), provides in part that a teacher who has served in a school district for at least three consecutive school years may not be dismissed except for \u201cinefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to [G.

We have recognized that an arbitrator may exceed the scope of his or her authority in awarding reinstatement of an employee where the award violates public policy. See <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>460 Mass. 844, 848 (2011). The requirements for establishing that such an award is contrary to public policy are three-fold: (1) the conduct in issue violates a well-defined and dominant public policy set forth in statutory or judicial sources, (2) the conduct in issue is integral to the employee\u2019s duties, and (3) the award itself violates public policy because the employee\u2019s conduct is of the sort that requires dismissal. <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Robishaw, </em>456 Mass. 653, 664 (2010). <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 604-605 (2000). Because we conclude that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority on other grounds, we need not reach this argument. However, we do acknowledge that there is a well-defined and dominant public policy prohibiting teacher-on-student sexual harassment and that Zagaeski\u2019s conduct, undertaken in the classroom setting, was integral to the performance of his employment duties. See G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 2 <em>(g) </em>(sexual harassment of student is unfair educational practice); G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C (granting right to be free from sexual harassment in school); 603 Code Mass.

The provision states in part, \u201cUpon a finding that the dismissal was improper under the standards set forth in this section, the arbitrator may award [equitable remedies].\u201d Plainly, this is a reference back to the standards by which a school district may dismiss a teacher and according to which an arbitrator must review a decision. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, pars. 3, 5, 6. This provision does not authorize the arbitrator to alter any disciplinary penalty he or she finds to be \u201cimproper\u201d according to the dictionary definition of \u201cimproper\" and without reference to the substantive standards set forth in paragraphs three and five of the statute. Furthermore, the range of equitable remedies available enables an arbitrator to make a teacher whole if the school district is found to have failed to carry its burden to show a valid basis for dismissal. The range of remedies does not imply complete discretion of the arbitrator to impose a different punishment that he or she prefers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Prior to the Reform Act, comments alone, without other physical conduct, were recognized as sufficient to constitute \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher.\u201d See <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 616 (1961). Although the Reform Act made significant changes to the teacher dismissal statute, it preserved \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher\u201d as a permitted ground for dismissal of a teacher. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6. Where the Legislature reenacts statutory language following a judicial interpretation of it, the Legislature is presumed to accept that interpretation. <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>428 Mass. 108, 110 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Although a teacher\u2019s length of service and past performance may be considered as factors mitigating against dismissal under the rubric of \u201cjust cause\u201d in collective bargaining agreements, and the Reform Act replaced the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d with \u201cjust cause\u201d as an enumerated basis on which a teacher may be dismissed, the teacher dismissal statute does not permit an arbitrator to engraft an additional just cause analysis onto each of the grounds enumerated in the statute on which dismissal may be based. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. See also <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223, 231, 233 (Cordy, J., concurring). A plain reading of the teacher dismissal statute makes clear that a school district may dismiss a teacher for any of the enumerated bases <em>\u201cor other </em>just cause\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. Therefore, the statute implies that dismissal based on any of the enumerated grounds would be just cause, and \u201cother just cause\u201d stands alone as an additional ground upon which dismissal may be based. The phrase \u201cother just cause\u201d does not permit a reduction in the penalty imposed for conduct constituting one of the other enumerated grounds. See <em>Geller, supra </em>at 232-233 (Cordy, J., concurring).

Consequently, the fact that the Reform Act replaced \u201cother good cause\u201d with \u201cother just cause\u201d as a basis for dismissal, without further change to the text of the provision, is not sufficient to indicate a legislative intent to import an additional just cause analysis into the other grounds permitting dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b140-7\">Lenk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH7\">(dissenting). The arbitrator\u2019s decision, fairly read, reflects his conclusion that the plaintiff, the school committee of Lexington, did not carry its burden of proving that the defendant, Mark Zagaeski, engaged in the serious misconduct necessary to establish \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d one of six enumerated grounds on which a teacher with professional status can be dismissed under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. Instead, based on all of the evidence adduced at the arbitration hearing, he determined that Zagaeski\u2019s isolated episode of inappropriate behavior, while fitting nominally within that statutory category, was only minor in nature. This was a determination well within the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority. Hence, I respectfully dissent, parting company as I do with the court\u2019s independent assessment of the facts as found, its determination that the conduct at issue could not be deemed anything other than the requisite serious misconduct warranting dismissal, and its conclusion that, by reinstating Zagaeski, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority. To the extent that the arbitrator imposed alternative discipline upon Zagaeski, however, I agree that he exceeded the scope of his authority. While the school authorities did not satisfy the statutory requirements when dismissing Zagaeski, it is solely within their purview whether other discipline instead should be imposed. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>would accordingly remand the matter. See <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223, 224 (2001) <em>(Geller).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, delineates the circumstances under which teachers who have attained professional status can be dismissed, as well as the scope of arbitrators\u2019 review of such dismissals. Three paragraphs of the statute are particularly relevant here. I begin with an analysis of these paragraphs, informed by the somewhat unsettled case law construing them, including both Justice Cordy\u2019s concurring opinion and Justice Cowin\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Geller, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>460 Mass. 844, 858 n.11 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par., enumerates six grounds on which a teacher with professional status may be dismissed: inefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination, failure to satisfy performance standards, \u201cor other just cause.\u201d General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par., allocates to the district the burden of proving one of these grounds, and provides that, \u201c[i]n determining whether the district has proven grounds for dismissal . . . , the arbitrator shall consider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">If, in making such a determination, the arbitrator concludes that the district failed to carry its burden of proving an enumerated ground for dismissal, thereby rendering the dismissal \u201cimproper under the standards set forth in [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42,]\u201d the sixth paragraph of the statute authorizes the arbitrator to award certain remedies to the teacher, namely, \u201cback pay, benefits, reinstatement, and any other appropriate non-financial relief or any combination thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">As the court recognizes, the question regarding an arbitrator\u2019s authority to reinstate a teacher who has been found to have engaged in conduct only nominally constituting an enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ground for dismissal remains unresolved after <em>Geller, supra. </em>This reflects in no small measure the deep division in the <em>Geller </em>court as to the arbitrator\u2019s proper role, represented by Justice Cordy\u2019s and Justice Cowin\u2019s opposing opinions. Although neither opinion is entirely consonant with my own view of the statute, both recognize, as I do, that the school district does not satisfy its burden of proving the propriety of the discipline imposed simply by showing facts that could conceivably amount to an enumerated ground for dismissal, without regard to the gravity of the act said to have occurred. Rather, under both Justice Cordy\u2019s and Justice Cowin\u2019s interpretations of the statute, the arbitrator is assigned the duty to determine whether the facts adduced in fact establish \u201cserious misconduct\u201d warranting dismissal on an enumerated ground. See <em>Geller, supra </em>at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 241 (Cowin, J., dissenting). In other words, not all conduct that a school district may see fit to characterize as constituting an enumerated ground for dismissal will in fact rise to the level of serious misconduct that the Legislature envisioned would justify terminating a teacher who has attained professional status. It is the statutorily appointed role of the arbitrator to determine whether proven conduct does indeed rise to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Indeed, that only \u201cserious misconduct\u201d will constitute an enumerated ground for dismissal is implied by the Legislature\u2019s insertion, in the 1993 amendment, of a new category of \u201cother just cause,\u201d and its simultaneous deletion of \u201cother good cause\u201d as a ground for dismissal. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. As Justice Cordy observed in <em>Geller, supra </em>at 233 n.9, \u201c[i]t is reasonable ... to conclude from the substitution of the word \u2018just\u2019 for \u2018good\u2019 that the Legislature intended to limit the broad range of conduct that had previously been considered as warranting dismissal in this catchall category, to serious misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>According to Justice Cordy\u2019s view, however, once an arbitrator determines that a school district has proved \u201cserious misconduct\u201d amounting to an enumerated ground for dismissal, \u201cthe arbitrator does not have the authority to judge whether discharge is an excessive penalty for the violation committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 (Cordy, J., concurring). The arbitrator is \u201cpreclude[d]... from conducting a further \u2018just cause\u2019 analysis (e.g., weighing the teacher\u2019s prior record against the misconduct for the purpose of justifying a different sanction) once he has found that one of the enumerated grounds for dismissal has been proved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Justice Cowin, on the other hand, would have concluded that the statute authorizes an arbitrator to determine \u201cboth whether the grounds [for dismissal] alleged by the school district have occurred and, if so, whether such grounds warrant dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 (Cowin, J., dissenting). According to Justice Cowin, assessing whether the proven grounds warrant dismissal, or merely a less severe penalty, is not only within the arbitrator\u2019s discretion, but required by the statutory directive that arbitrators consider \u201cthe best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.; <em>Geller, supra </em>at 242-243 (Cowin, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">I agree with Justice Co win that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, authorizes an arbitrator to assess whether the facts found warrant dismissal. In my view, it is within the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority to determine both whether the conduct alleged by the school district in fact occurred, and, if it did, to decide whether such conduct \u201cr[o]se to the level of [serious] misconduct contemplated by the statute as a ground for dismissal.\u201d <em>Geller, supra </em>at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). In performing the latter task of determining whether the district has proved grounds for dismissal, the statute requires the arbitrator to take into account \u201cthe best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The Legislature has provided for meaningful review by accredited professional arbitrators, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fourth par., of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>decisions made by school authorities to terminate teachers with professional status. This review is to assure that such decisions are based only on the serious misconduct that the statute details and, of necessity, encompasses both a determination of what occurred and a contextualized assessment of its gravity. The credentialed arbitrator is thus tasked not only with finding facts, but also with weighing those facts in conjunction with the mandatory student-interest and performance criteria, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par., to ascertain whether dismissal is warranted. An arbitrator who does this, and concludes that dismissal was not in fact substantiated, does not thereby overstep his bounds and usurp the role of school authorities. Rather, in so doing, the arbitrator fulfils his or her statutorily mandated duty of discerning whether the district sustained its burden of proving an enumerated ground for dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Unlike Justice Cowin, however, I do not believe that the statute empowers arbitrators to impose alternative penalties on teachers, short of dismissal, that the arbitrator perceives to be more proportional to the severity of the misconduct he or she determined to have occurred. The sixth paragraph of the statute sets out the actions that arbitrators are authorized to take if they conclude that dismissal was \u201cimproper.\u201d Those actions are remedial in nature, and are limited to awarding \u201cback pay, benefits, reinstatement, and any other appropriate non-financial relief or any combination thereof\u2019; the statute makes no express provision for the exercise of an arbitrator\u2019s own judgment in choosing an ostensibly fair punishment. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. The statute thus contemplates that an arbitration hearing will have one of two outcomes: either the arbitrator will determine that the district carried its burden, upholding its dismissal decision, or the arbitrator will find that the district did not carry its burden, reversing the district\u2019s decision and awarding the teacher some form of relief. Should the school district\u2019s dismissal decision be reversed, it remains solely within the purview of the district to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>whether other discipline should then be imposed. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In sum, I believe that it is the proper function of the arbitrator to find and weigh the facts, and subsequently either to reverse or to uphold a school district\u2019s dismissal decision, but not to reduce the punishment imposed by the school. I now turn to a discussion whether the arbitrator here acted within the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">2. <em>Arbitrator\u2019s finding that Zagaeski committed \u201cnominal\u201d misconduct. </em>In substantial reliance on footnote 7 of Justice Cordy\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Geller, supra, </em>the arbitrator found, based on the undisputed facts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the school district did not meet its burden of proving an enumerated ground for dismissal. Footnote 7 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u201cWe note that the arbitrator found [the teacher\u2019s] actions to constitute serious misconduct (\u2018totally inappropriate,\u2019 \u2018unacceptable,\u2019 which \u2018cannot be condoned\u2019), a finding consistent with the evidence adduced at the arbitration hearing. This is not the case of an arbitrator finding a teacher to have engaged in minor misconduct that, however, nominally fit within a category on which dismissal could be based. In such circumstances, an arbitrator\u2019s finding that the conduct did not rise to the level of misconduct contemplated by the statute as a ground for dismissal is one that would likely lie within the scope of his authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\"><em>Geller, supra </em>at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). The arbitrator quoted this footnote in its entirety and used it to frame his discussion of the import of Zagaeski\u2019s comments. At the outset of his opinion, the arbitrator set forth a standard of review that incorporated language from this footnote, noting that both parties\u2019 briefs cited that standard as governing the matter before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The arbitrator began his analysis by noting, rightly, that Zagaeski\u2019s comments to the student regarding trading sexual favors for grades \u201cobviously were inappropriate if taken literally\u201d and were inconsistent with the school district\u2019s policy against sexual harassment. And, indeed, it goes without saying that any insinuation that good grades are available for barter, particularly in exchange for sexual favors, would be wholly improper and have no place in the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">But the arbitrator went on to make nuanced findings that situated the exchange within the context of the \u201cobviously absurd joke\u201d that the student had made to Zagaeski several days before about paying him for a better grade, and another student\u2019s comment about sexual favors, to which Zagaeski had responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d When the student again reiterated her \u201cridiculous request\u201d a couple days later, Zagaeski \u201cresponded with a joking comment of his own,\u201d as a way of referring to the recent exchange, something he considered to be \u201clike an inside joke\u201d with the student.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Given the jesting context in which the remarks were made, Zagaeski\u2019s lack of actual intent to solicit sexual favors from the student, and the one-time nature of his behavior, the arbitrator determined that Zagaeski\u2019s words essentially amounted to \u201cone ill-advised set of interrelated, joking comments, made in response to ill-advised jokes initiated by his students,\u201d and therefore only \u201cnominally\u201d fit within the category of conduct unbecoming a teacher. However, the arbitrator did not, as the court states, conclude that the school district had carried its burden of establishing one of the six enumerated grounds for dismissal. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>contrary, the arbitrator concluded that, \u201c[gjiven the relatively minor, and isolated character of Dr. Zagaeski\u2019s misconduct, and his proven excellence as a teacher over the course of his decade of work in the Lexington Public Schools, the district <em>has not proven grounds for dismissal . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied). As the Superior Court judge observed, \u201c[tjhe arbitrator\u2019s findings regarding Zagaeski\u2019s conduct appear to fit precisely within the scenario set out by Justice Cordy in footnote 7 of <em>[Geller, supra].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The court acknowledges that this question, regarding an arbitrator\u2019s authority to reinstate a teacher after finding that he committed only nominal misconduct, was left open by <em>Geller, supra, </em>but does not provide a direct answer. It instead engages in its own assessment of the facts and concludes that, notwithstanding the arbitrator\u2019s determination that Zagaeski engaged in only nominal and isolated misconduct, it is not possible that the conduct at issue was anything other than serious, and, as such, the arbitrator acted outside of his authority in \u201cadjusting\u201d the school\u2019s disciplinary decision. In so doing, the court inappropriately substitutes its own judgment for that of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The court appears to share the school committee\u2019s conviction that Zagaeski\u2019s very utterance of the words to the student itself suffices to establish serious misconduct. But words alone are only a piece of human communication. Words shorn of context, taken only literally, are at a far remove from language embedded in circumstance. In any attempt to understand an event after the fact, establishing who said what generally will only begin to reveal what actually happened. Indeed, determining what actually happened, and the gravity of what actually happened, is precisely what this arbitrator was called upon to do and did. It is not for us to substitute our view for his.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Given my view that the statute authorizes the arbitrator to assess whether the facts as found warrant dismissal, and keeping in mind the \u201cwell-settled principle of law that arbitration awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>are subject to a narrow scope of review,\u201d <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Chicopee Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 357, 364 (2011), I cannot accept the court\u2019s analysis or conclusion in this regard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I would instead squarely hold that where, as here, an arbitrator determines that the misconduct at issue was of a minor or nominal nature and, as such, did not constitute the serious misconduct necessary to satisfy an enumerated ground for dismissal, he acts well within the scope of his authority when concluding that the district has not sustained its burden of proving grounds for dismissal. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Far from an arbitrary substitution of the arbitrator\u2019s own judgment for that of the school district, such a determination amounts to a conclusion that the dismissal was \u201cimproper,\u201d as per G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. Upon such a finding of impropriety, the arbitrator is empowered to \u201caward back pay, benefits, reinstatement, and any other appropriate non-financial relief or any combination thereof.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. Thus, I believe that the arbitrator here did not exceed his authority in reinstating Zagaeski, particularly in light of his clear reliance on footnote 7 of Justice Cordy\u2019s concurrence in <em>Geller, supra, </em>which essentially provided a roadmap for his decision. I would therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>leave intact the reinstatement award here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">3. <em>Arbitrator\u2019s consideration of \u201cbest interests of the pupils in the district and the need to elevate performance standards.\u201d </em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par., instructs arbitrators to \u201cconsider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards\u201d in determining whether the school district has proved grounds for dismissal. The court decouples this consideration into two separate criteria, applicable to different enumerated grounds for dismissal, in a manner that I believe is not supported by the statutory language and will prove unworkable in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The court breaks the six enumerated grounds warranting dismissal, set forth in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par., into two categories of misconduct, namely, \u201cperformance-based\u201d misconduct on the one hand, and misconduct that \u201cjeopardize[s] the safety or self-esteem of students in the classroom setting\u201d on the other. <em>Ante </em>at 120-121. The category of misconduct at issue, the court holds, determines whether the arbitrator is to consider \u201cthe need to raise performance standards,\u201d or \u201cthe best interests of the pupils primarily in light of the pupils\u2019 interest in a safe learning environment\u201d in determining whether the school district has proved grounds for dismissal. <em>Ante </em>at 121. The court concludes that the arbitrator here exceeded his authority by applying the former criterion, where the conduct at issue fell into a category demanding application of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">By dividing the six enumerated grounds into two classes of misconduct, the court creates an artificial distinction that is not borne out by the statute. The statute simply enumerates the grounds warranting dismissal in one unbroken list, and provides generally that \u201cthe arbitrator shall consider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third &amp; fifth pars. It does not direct arbitrators to cabin their consideration of these factors depending on the type of misconduct determined to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Moreover, it is far from clear that, in practice, \u201cperformance-based\u201d conduct is readily distinguishable from misconduct that \u201chas jeopardized the safety or self-esteem of students in the classroom setting.\u201d Neither is it evident that misconduct grouped in the latter category, including misconduct bearing the somewhat indeterminate label of \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d will in fact jeopardize students in such a manner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In any event, the court\u2019s conclusion that the arbitrator here put undue weight on \u201cthe pupils\u2019 interest in the academic success of their school\u201d simply misconstrues the arbitrator\u2019s findings. <em>Ante </em>at 121. As an initial matter, the arbitrator\u2019s weighing of the mandatory student-interest and performance criteria was not necessary to his decision, as he found that the school district had not sustained its burden of proving an enumerated ground for dismissal because the misconduct at issue was minor, not serious. After so finding, the arbitrator went on to state that, \u201c[ejven if Dr. Zagaeski\u2019s words toward [the student] were characterized as serious rather than a minor act of conduct unbecoming a teacher (which is not the view of this arbitrator), ... the district has not proven grounds for dismissal because the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>standards warrant the retention of Dr. Zagaeski.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Instead of \u201cpermitt[ing] the pupils\u2019 interest in the academic success of their school to override their interest in a safe, supportive classroom environment,\u201d as the court suggests, the arbitrator properly treated the statutory criteria as interconnected. The arbitrator noted the \u201crapport\u201d that Zagaeski had developed with his students over the course of the school year, as well as the atmosphere of \u201cmutual respect\u201d that he had cultivated in his classroom, in part through the use of humor and a less hierarchical approach to teaching. Zagaeski \u201ctried to create a culture of comfort in which the students would feel safe and at ease\u201d and \u201cdeveloped a teaching style designed to meet the students at the level they understood, in an environment that made them comfortable and helped them to achieve academically.\u201d This teaching style contributed to Zagaeski\u2019s \u201crecord of impressive accomplishment in helping a relatively challenged group of students to achieve success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Therefore, in light of Zagaeski\u2019s \u201cproven excellence as a teacher over the course of his decade of work in the Lexington Public Schools,\u201d the arbitrator concluded that \u201cthe best interests of the pupils and the need for elevation of performance standards warrant the retention of Dr. Zagaeski.\u201d In so doing, the arbitrator acted within his authority by considering in an integrated manner the two factors that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par., mandates be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In sum, I would hold that the arbitrator was authorized to conclude, as he did, that Zagaeski had not engaged in the serious misconduct necessary in the first instance to establish the statutory ground of conduct unbecoming to a teacher, that consideration of the mandatory best-interest and performance factors led to the same result, and that the school district had therefore failed to carry its burden of proving a ground warranting dismissal. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">No opinion in <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223 (2001) <em>(Geller), </em>garnered a majority. Justice Cordy authored a concurring opinion, with whom Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Sosman joined.

L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, was not to enhance the employment rights of public school teachers, <em>ante </em>at 115-116, there is also nothing to suggest that the amendment was intended to diminish the rights of teachers with professional status. If anything, insofar as the shift from a \u201cgood cause\u201d to a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard imposed a higher burden on schools, the Reform Act in fact provided greater protection to teachers with professional status, by limiting the circumstances under which they could be dismissed. See <em>Geller, supra </em>at 233 n.9 (Cordy, J., concurring), and cases cited (explaining that \u201cgood cause\u201d had been understood to mean \u201cany ground which is put forward [by the supervising authority] in good faith and which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, or irrelevant to the . . . task of building up and maintaining an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>efficient school system,\u201d whereas \u201cjust cause\u201d suggests \u201csubstantial misconduct which adversely affects the public interest\u201d [citations omitted]).

L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>a reviewing court is \u2018strictly bound by the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, even if they are in error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>460 Mass. 844, 848 (2011), quoting <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Robishaw, </em>456 Mass. 653, 660 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Although arbitrators\u2019 factual findings are \u201cnot open for our review,\u201d <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Robishaw, supra </em>at 664, the arbitrator\u2019s determination here that Zagaeski\u2019s isolated instance of improper joking with a student constituted minor misconduct, only nominally \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d is, in any event, supported by the record, particularly when compared to conduct that has been deemed to fit the rubric of conduct unbecoming a teacher in other cases. For example, in <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., supra </em>at 849-850, the arbitrator found that the teacher invited a student to his house and while there, \u201cinappropriately touched [her], touching her back, reaching down her shirt, and touching her buttocks in a sexual manner as well as hugging the student in an attempt to restrain her from leaving.\u201d In addition, the teacher \u201cmade numerous attempts\" to contact the student via electronic mail and telephone, through her friends, and by following her vehicle and visiting her home, which the arbitrator-labeled \u201cserious\u201d misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 850, 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Similarly, in <em>Geller, supra </em>at 226-227, the arbitrator found that the teacher, who had received a warning from school authorities prior to his dismissal, engaged in \u201cunacceptable\u201d conduct over the course of seven months, culminating in three separate incidents involving the use of physical force against students. Quite unlike here, the arbitrator in that case \u201cfound facts and described those facts in a manner that clearly established the teacher\u2019s] conduct to be \u2018conduct unbecoming a teacher.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Thus, both these cases involved a pattern of serious misconduct over a prolonged period of time, distinguishable from the isolated and quite dissimilar nature of the misconduct at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in reinstating Zagaeski is the central issue that the parties dispute in the case, and, as I have explained, I would hold that he did not. Because, however, as discussed <em>supra, </em>I do not believe that the statute empowers arbitrators to impose alternative discipline short of dismissal, I would hold that the arbitrator lacked authority to order two days of unpaid suspension, and remand to the Superior Court for entry of an order that the arbitrator\u2019s decision be revised accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Indeed, it is difficult to see how the conduct at issue in <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 616 (1961), which the court cites, <em>ante </em>at 114 n.10, 117 \u2014 a teacher\u2019s muttering the words \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to the superintendent at a meeting of school personnel \u2014 \u201cjeopardized the safety or self-esteem of students in the classroom setting.\u201d In cases such as <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Ipswich, supra, </em>it is not clear whether the court\u2019s formulation directs arbitrators to consider \u201cthe need to raise performance standards\u201d or \u201cthe best interests of the pupils primarily in light of the pupils\u2019 interest in a safe learning environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In any event, <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, supra, </em>was decided prior to the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the Reform Act in 1993, which amended the statutory scheme governing the dismissal of teachers. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. Under the old version of the statute, teacher dismissal was measured against a \u201cgood cause\u201d standard, rather than the \u201cjust cause\u201d benchmark that currently prevails. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6. The court cites this case as providing an example of \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher\u201d that has persisted through the amendment. <em>Ante </em>at 114 n.10. To my mind, however, the question whether the conduct at issue in the pre-amendment case of <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, supra, </em>would constitute \u201cjust cause\u201d for dismissal under the amended version of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, is not free from doubt. See <em>Geller, supra </em>at 233 n.9 (Cordy, I., concurring) (Legislature\u2019s substitution of \u201cjust cause\u201d for \u201cgood cause\u201d demonstrates intent to restrict conduct justifying dismissal to \u201cserious misconduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
