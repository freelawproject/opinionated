The city<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Quincy (Quincy) served as trustee of the Adams Temple and School Fund and the Charles Francis Adams Fund (collectively, Funds) through two boards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Woodward School for Girls, Inc. (Woodward), the income beneficiary of the Funds since 1953, filed suit against Quincy initially seeking an accounting and thereafter asserting that Quincy committed a breach of its fiduciary duties to keep adequate records, invest the trust\u2019s assets properly, exercise reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>able prudence in the sales of real estate, and incur only reasonable expenses related to the management of the Funds. We transferred the case here on our own motion following Quincy\u2019s appeal and Woodward\u2019s cross appeal from a Probate and Family Court judge\u2019s ruling removing Quincy as trustee and ordering it to pay a nearly $3 million judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On appeal, Quincy asserts that the trial judge erred in finding that Quincy committed a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Funds by failing to invest in growth equities to protect the principal when the Funds have only an income beneficiary to provide for, and by not heeding specific investment advice it received in 1973. In addition, Quincy challenges the award of damages, alleging that it was based on an improperly introduced and unsound portfolio theory hypothesizing unrealized gains; that it failed to exclude reasonable costs and expenses Quincy would have incurred had Quincy followed that portfolio theory; and that it improperly included prejudgment interest dating back to the dates of the various breaches. Finally, Quincy avers that Woodward\u2019s claims should have been barred by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4, and its accompanying protection of sovereign immunity, and by the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the claims were not barred, and judgment against Quincy for committing a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Funds was proper, but the award of damages was erroneous in the calculation of unrealized gains on the investment portfolio. Specifically, we conclude that the judge erred in two respects: first, in finding that Quincy\u2019s failure to heed specific investment advice it had solicited constituted a breach of its duty to act as a prudent investor; and second, in calculating as damages the gains that might have been realized had Quincy followed that advice. Nonetheless, because there was other evidence of Quincy\u2019s mismanagement of the Funds, the judge did not err in finding that Quincy had committed a breach of its fiduciary duties with regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We further conclude that the judge did not err in including prejudgment interest or in declining to speculate as to potential costs or expenses Quincy may have incurred with proper management. However, because the judge\u2019s calculation of damages with regard to the unrealized gains on the investment portfolio was based on his incorrect assumption that Quincy was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to follow specific investment advice, that calculation was in error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment as to liability, reverse with respect to the calculation of damages on the unrealized gains, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><em>Background. </em>In 1822, former President John Adams executed two deeds of trust, conveying a portion of his real estate holdings to a trust, thereafter named the Adams Temple and School Fund (Adams Fund), and naming Quincy as the trustee. The first deed executed by President Adams (Deed A) was supplemented by a bequest of his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, in 1886, to support the objectives of the Adams Fund (Charles Francis Adams Fund, and, collectively with the Adams Fund, Funds). Deed A contained the basic provisions of the trust and directed the trustee to invest earnings from the real estate \u201cin some solid public fund, either of the Commonwealth, or of the United States\u201d; to build a church; and to apply \u201call future rents, profits, and emoluments, arising from said land\u201d to support a school with particular requirements. The only principal beneficiary identified in the deed was the oldest living male descendant of President Adams, who was to receive the principal only on \u201cgross corruption or mismanagement,\u201d or knowing waste, on the part of Quincy. Shortly after the deeds were executed, the inhabitants of Quincy voted to accept the gifts therein, and Quincy became the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Two acts of the General Court granted Quincy further authority in executing its responsibilities as trustee of the Funds. In 1827, the General Court appointed the treasurer of Quincy as the treasurer of the Adams Fund, incorporated the board of supervisors, and authorized the board of supervisors and the selectmen of Quincy to execute the intentions of President Adams and to receive and manage gifts from others for the purposes articulated in the deeds. See St. 1826, c. 59, approved on Feb. 3, 1827 (1827 Act). Quincy thereafter established a board of managers for the Adams Fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1898, the General Court authorized Quincy as trustee of the Funds to sell and convey the Funds\u2019 real property holdings and to \u201cinvest[ ] and re-invest[ ]\u201d the sale proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201cfrom time to time ... in real estate or in such securities as trustees are authorized to hold in this Commonwealth.\u201d See St. 1898, c. 102 (1898 Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In 1953, pursuant to an unpublished order of this court, after three prior income beneficiaries, Woodward was designated (and remains) the sole income beneficiary of the Funds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">1. <em>Investment advice and state of Funds. </em>By the time Woodward became the beneficiary of the Funds, the real estate holdings of the Adams Fund had diminished significantly, presumably due to sale. At the end of 1952, the assets of the Adams Fund consisted of $4,474 in cash, $253,723.02 in investment assets, and an assessed value of $102,325 in real estate. The value of the Adams Fund\u2019s investment assets in 1973 totaled $321,932.43, an increase that may have been attributable to the further sale of real estate. In April, 1973, the Adams Fund investment assets were invested in a portfolio consisting of ninety per cent fixed income and ten per cent equity securities. That month, Quincy received investment advice it had requested from the South Shore National Bank (bank) with regard to managing the Funds\u2019 investment portfolio. The joint boards of the Funds unanimously voted to adopt an agreement establishing an advisory relationship with the bank and to follow certain diversification investment advice it received from the bank. However, Quincy never implemented the diversification recommendations, and instead, by 1990, nearly one hundred per cent of the Adams Fund\u2019s assets were invested in fixed income instruments. In 2008, the value of the investment assets in the Adams Fund was reportedly still the same: $321,932.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The assets of the Charles Francis Adams Fund, which are far smaller than those of the Adams Fund, have diminished some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>what over time. As of 1953, the Fund had a value of $23,428, consisting of $1,453 in cash and $21,975 in securities (primarily in corporate bonds). It has since declined to $19,982 as of 2005, when it consisted of $2,530 in cash and $17,452 in investments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Despite the lack of growth in the Funds, between 1953 and 2008, the Funds generated over $700,000 in income; this income was either paid to Woodward directly or used to pay the Funds\u2019 expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">2. <em>Request for accounting and present litigation. </em>The present dispute began in 2005, when Woodward had, for two consecutive years, received a smaller distribution from the Funds than it had anticipated. In light of these discrepancies, the chair of the Woodward board of trustees requested an accounting of the Funds from Quincy. As of nearly one and one-half years later, the school had received some information from Quincy but not a full accounting, which it again requested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In July, 2007, after still receiving no response, Woodward filed a complaint and petition for an accounting with a single justice of this court against Quincy as trustee of the Funds. Woodward asserted that \u201cas beneficiary of the Funds, [it] is entitled to know, the real and financial assets currently in the Funds, information about the Funds\u2019 management, and historically what has happened to the Funds\u2019 assets and income.\u201d The single justice transferred the case to the Norfolk County Division of the Probate and Family Court Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">A judge in that court appointed a special master to gather relevant documents regarding the Funds\u2019 assets, prepare an accounting for the Funds for the period of 1953 to 2008, inclusive, and issue a report assessing the propriety of the Funds\u2019 transactions. See G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 2; Rule 20 of the Rules of the Probate and Family Court, Massachusetts Rules of Court, at 1051 (Thomson Reuters 2014). Overall, the special master concluded that Quincy had committed a breach of its fiduciary duties in several respects, primarily because it had \u201cnot maintained adequate books and records to substantiate its stewardship as Trustee,\u201d and it had sold the Funds\u2019 real property at less than fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>market value.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Following the report of the special master, the dispute proceeded to a thirteen-day bench trial. In February, 2011, an amended judgment and amended findings entered, with 220 findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The judge concluded that Quincy failed to keep accurate records of its financial stewardship of the Funds, to obtain appraisals for real property and to sell parcels at fair market value or greater,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to act on professional investment advice it received, and to comport with its duty of loyalty to the Funds. The judge char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>acterized Quincy\u2019s management of the Adams Fund specifically as \u201cinattentive, imprudent and neglectful,\u201d but not so neglectful as to \u201crise to the level of gross corruption or gross mismanagement,\u201d such that the remainder beneficiary would take the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">With regard to Quincy\u2019s investment strategy for the Adams Fund, the judge made several findings relevant to Quincy\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> First, he concluded that Quincy did not commit a breach of its fiduciary duty to the Funds by employing inappropriate investment strategies during the years of 1953 to 1973.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, with regard to the 1973 investment advice Quincy received from the bank, the judge found that Quincy received and unanimously voted to adopt a single portfolio diversification plan, consisting of sixty per cent in equity securities, thirty-five per cent in fixed income, and five per cent in savings (60-35-5 plan). He concluded that Quincy failed to follow this directive, and that it \u201cignored the terms of its own April 11, 1973, vote, and the competent, professional . . . advice contained therein, to the considerable detriment of the [Adams Fund].\u201d Therefore, Quincy acted imprudently and in violation of its fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Third, the judge found that it was imprudent for Quincy to permit the Adams Fund to consist almost entirely of fixed income and cash assets by 1990. The judge rejected Quincy\u2019s assertion that it maintained the Fund\u2019s assets in government securities in order to comport with the explicit directive of the trust instrument; rather, the judge concluded that the Fund had acted in derogation of the 1892 legislation directing Quincy to invest real estate sales proceeds \u201cin real estate or in . . . securities,\u201d by instead investing \u201cthe fungible portion of the trust corpus in corporate bonds as well as in equities/securities.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In light of these findings, the judge awarded Woodward a total judgment of $2,994,868, including prejudgment interest of $1,610,826 and approximately $1.1 million for \u201c[ujnrealized [g]ains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>in portfolio,\u201d and removed Quincy as trustee of the Funds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We will not disturb the findings of the trial judge or the special master unless they are clearly erroneous. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 359-360 (1981); <em>Matter of Jones, </em>379 Mass. 826, 839 (1980). \u201cA finding [of fact] is clearly erroneous ... [if], although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 509 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. <em>Breach of fiduciary duties. </em>The primary issue in this case is whether the judge erred in concluding that Quincy committed a breach of its fiduciary duties by failing to invest in growth securities and by failing to heed investment advice it procured from an investment adviser. Because trustees\u2019 conduct with regard to investment strategy and decision-making is governed by the prudent investor standard, we begin by articulating what that standard requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">a. <em>Prudent investor standard. </em>A trustee\u2019s obligations with regard to investing and managing a trust\u2019s assets are dictated by our common law and by the Massachusetts Prudent Investor Act, G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. See <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>233 Mass. 321, 331 (1919); <em>Harvard College </em>v. <em>Amory, 9 </em>Pick. 446, 461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(1830).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A trastee has a duty to invest the trust\u2019s assets \u201csolely in the interest of the beneficiaries.\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 6. In performing this duty, a trustee must \u201cexercise reasonable care, skill, and caution\u201d in \u201cinvesting] and managing] trust assets as a prudent investor would, considering the purposes, terms, and other circumstances of the trust.\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(a). </em>Among those considerations are \u201cthe possible effect of inflation or deflation\u201d; \u201cthe expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital\u201d; \u201cother resources of the beneficiaries\u201d; and \u201cneeds for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital.\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(c) </em>(2), (5)-(7). See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>363 Mass. 256, 294-295 (1973). We assess investment decisions in the context of the over-all investment strategy of the trust.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(b). </em>See Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 90 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">A trustee exercising \u201creasonable care, skill and caution,\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>undoubtedly will approach investment decisions with some conservatism. This, however, must be balanced with a degree of risk in order to obtain income for the trust and protect the principal against inflation. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 90 comment e; Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 227 comment e (1959). Diversification of investments is therefore considered a central component of prudent investment because it both moderates and reduces risks. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 4; <em>Chase, </em>383 Mass. at 363. Accordingly, trustees are discouraged from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>investing \u201ca disproportionately large part of the trust estate in a particular security or type of security.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 228 comment a. Nonetheless, the standard recognizes that in some circumstances, it may not be prudent to diversify an investment portfolio, particularly where \u201cthe objectives of both prudent risk management and impartiality can be satisfied\u201d without diversification. Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 90 comment g. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 4; Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">b. <em>Investment advice. </em>We turn now to Quincy\u2019s first claim of error. Quincy contends that the judge erred in concluding that Quincy was required to follow specific investment advice it requested and received in 1973. In addition, it asserts that the judge misconstrued the investment advice at issue as providing only one recommendation, when the advice actually consisted of several alternatives, one of which Quincy claims to have followed. We agree that the judge improperly considered strict compliance with investment advice to be required of a prudent investor. We do not, however, consider the judge\u2019s interpretation of the advice provided to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The investment advice in dispute was provided by the bank in a letter dated March 29, 1973, and reviewed by the joint boards of the Funds at a meeting on April 11.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The letter was interpreted by the trial judge as providing a single diversification recommendation of sixty per cent equity securities, thirty-five per cent fixed income, and five per cent savings (60-35-5 plan).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This represented a drastic change from the Adams Fund\u2019s portfolio at the time of ninety per cent fixed income and ten per cent equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>securities. On receiving the investment advice, the joint boards unanimously voted to enter into an advisory relationship with the bank,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and to \u201cmak[e] investments and changes of investments in said Funds substantially within the outline as presented\u201d by the bank in its letter.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, Quincy did not make changes to its portfolio consistent with the advice it received, and instead increased the percentage of investments in fixed income assets so that, by 1990, nearly one hundred per cent of the assets of the Adams Fund were in fixed income investments.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Under both the common law and the Prudent Investor Act, a trustee is permitted to consult with and receive advice from accountants and financial advisers. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 10 (a); <em>Milbank </em>v. <em>J.C. Littlefield, Inc., </em>310 Mass. 55, 62 (1941) (\u201cA trustee may avail himself of the services of others\u201d); Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 77 comment b &amp; \u00a7 80 comment b. Cf. <em>Rothwell </em>v. <em>Rothwell, </em>283 Mass. 563, 571 (1933) (trust disbursements paying agents and attorneys who assisted in trust management were appropriate); <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., </em>234 Mass. 374, 381 (1920) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Indeed, consulting investment advisers may be part of acting prudently and exercising care. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 77 comment b. \u201cAfter obtaining advice or consultation, the trustee can properly take the information or suggestions into account but then (unlike delegation) must exercise independent, prudent, and impartial fiduciary judgment on the matters involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 80 comment b. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>346 Mass. 190, 197 (1963) (trustee may employ bank as investment agent, as long as trustee gives independent consideration to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>agent\u2019s recommendation). In contrast, were we to require a trustee to follow investment advice it receives, we would in effect mandate delegation of a trustee\u2019s fiduciary duties.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We decline to require a trustee to abdicate this fundamental function of a trustee to make investment decisions merely because the trustee seeks advice on acting prudently. See <em>Boston </em>v. Curley, 276 Mass. 549, 562 (1931). However prudent the advice may be, a trustee is not required to follow it. To the extent the judge considered the failure to follow specific advice a per se breach of Quincy\u2019s fiduciary duty of prudent investment, this was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Whether a trustee requested and followed specific investment advice is but one factor in the determination of whether the trustee acted prudently. Receipt of sound investment advice and dismissal or wilful ignorance of it, where the advice was at the time prudent and consistent with the trust beneficiary\u2019s needs and goals, may be indicative of a lack of prudent investing. But such action or inaction in and of itself does not rise to the level of imprudent investing. The judge\u2019s reliance on the 1973 investment advice as a default prudent investment strategy resulted in inadequate consideration of the range of investment strategies that would have been prudent for the Adams Fund.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">c. <em>Concern for principal of income-only fund. </em>Quincy also challenges the trial judge\u2019s finding that it committed a breach of its fiduciary duty by not investing in growth securities. It asserts that as the trustee of a fund with only an income beneficiary, it had a \u201cduty to maximize income, even at the risk of sacrificing growth,\u201d and therefore it was not obligated to invest in growth equities that would protect the principal from inflation. It claims that it acted prudently in structuring the Adams Fund\u2019s investment portfolio as it did because the Fund produced income for Woodward, and the investments comported with the trust instrument\u2019s direction to invest the majority of the Fund\u2019s assets in government-backed bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The judge\u2019s findings regarding the Adams Fund\u2019s investment portfolio demonstrate that the Fund has been primarily invested in fixed income assets since Woodward became the income beneficiary. As a result,.the value of the Fund has remained largely unchanged since 1973. Despite this lack of principal growth, between 1973 and 2008, the Funds generated over $700,000 in income, benefiting from a 7.54 per cent rate of annual return, which was either paid to Woodward directly or used to pay the Funds\u2019 expenses. Nonetheless, the judge found that it was imprudent for Quincy \u201cto permit, by 1990, the [Adams Fund] to consist of essentially 100% fixed income/cash assets,\u201d and that this imprudence significantly harmed the Adams Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Where, as here, the current beneficiary of a trust is an income-only beneficiary, courts in at least three other jurisdictions with similar prudent investor standards have concluded that a trustee owes a duty to that beneficiary to prioritize income over growth, and that investing in fixed income assets over equities is not a breach of fiduciary duty where such investments produce income for the beneficiary but may fail to maintain the principal against inflation. See <em>Tovrea </em>v. Nolan, 178 Ariz. 485, 490 (Ct. App. 1993); <em>SunTrust Bank </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>272 Ga. App. 485, 488-489 (2005); <em>In re Trust Created by Martin, </em>266 Neb. 353, 359-360 (2003). See also <em>Shirk </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>298 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1937). This comports with the obligation under G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 6, to invest for the benefit of the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Although trustees in such cases are required to balance the interests of successive beneficiaries, one of whom is to receive the income during his or her lifetime and the other of whom is to take the principal on the income beneficiary\u2019s death, these courts have consistently concluded that a trustee does not commit a breach of a fiduciary duty \u201cby investing the trust in such manner as to maximize the income payable to [the income beneficiary] rather than expand the corpus of the trust.\u201d <em>SunTrust Bank, </em>272 Ga. App. at 489. See <em>Tovrea, </em>178 Ariz. at 490 (\u201ctrustees\u2019 duty was [primarily] to invest in such a manner as to produce an income for [income beneficiary] and, secondarily, [to] preserve the principal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In theory, the case for maximizing income over growth is even stronger here, because the income beneficiary is an institution and the remainder beneficiary takes only upon \u201cgross corruption or mismanagement . . . notorious negligence, or any waste knowingly permitted,\u201d thereby justifying complete attention to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>interests of Woodward. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 6. However, the Adams Fund\u2019s status as a charitable trust and Woodward\u2019s institutional status make this case distinctly different from those involving trusts with a lifetime beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">A charitable trust such as this one is designed to support an income beneficiary in perpetuity. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>14 Allen 539, 550 (1867) (charitable trusts exempt from rule against perpetuities). As a result, the trustee must necessarily consider both the generation of income <em>and </em>the growth and maintenance of the principal in order to provide income funds to the beneficiary indefinitely. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 90 comment e (\u201cIn balancing the return objectives between flow of income and growth of principal,\u201d trustee must consider trust\u2019s \u201cpurposes and distribution requirements\u201d). In effect, Woodward is equivalent to both the lifetime income beneficiary and all subsequent beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">As such, acting prudently in managing a charitable trust that benefits an institutional income beneficiary requires considering the specific needs of the beneficiary in the short and long term and balancing prioritization of income with protection and preservation of the principal. At a minimum, a trustee must consider how best to guard the principal against inflation, if not how to grow the principal while simultaneously generating income to support the beneficiary. Where the income beneficiary will continue to exist in perpetuity, the mandate of G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>to act with \u201ccaution\u201d necessarily entails considering \u201cthe possible effect of inflation or deflation,\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 (c) (2), and the \u201cpreservation or appreciation of capital,\u201d G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 (c) (7). A trustee must accordingly \u201cinvest with a view both to safety\u201d \u2014 \u201cseeking to avoid or reduce loss of the trust estate\u2019s purchasing power as a result of inflation\u201d \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 and \u201cto securing a reasonable return.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 90 comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In this case, a prudent investor would have realized at some point, long before 2008, that a fund value that is unchanged for decades after 1953 has not kept up with inflation and, given the potential perpetuity of the income beneficiary\u2019s needs, would have taken or attempted to take steps to protect the principal in order to preserve future income opportunities. If Quincy recognized that the Adams Fund was vulnerable to inflation, likely attributable to its lack of diversification, it had a duty to determine which of its assets could be invested in a manner that would guard against this vulnerability. At a minimum, Quincy could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>have invested the proceeds from the sale of real estate in investments that would potentially protect the principal. See St. 1898, c. 102. Instead, Quincy chose to keep the Adams Fund\u2019s investment assets exclusively in bonds, which produced a higher rate of return than a more diversified portfolio but resulted in stagnation of the trust principal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Where, in most instances, an increase in principal will lead to an increase in income, this decision not to diversify was imprudent in light of the Adams Fund\u2019s need to support Woodward in perpetuity and not merely during a human lifetime. Even without the benefit of hindsight, see G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 9, it is clear that Quincy did not take any steps to protect the Adams Fund\u2019s principal against inflation. We therefore conclude that Quincy\u2019s failure to protect the principal against inflation alone was sufficient to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">d. <em>Quincy\u2019s over-all performance. </em>As the above discussions illustrate, Quincy engaged in several shortcomings in its management of the Adams Fund\u2019s investment portfolio that indicate that it failed to perform as a prudent investor would under the circumstances. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 3 <em>(a). </em>Although Quincy sought and received ongoing investment advice from the bank in 1973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and thereafter,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it does not appear that it ever heeded the most significant, and seemingly prudent, advice the bank provided, construed in even the most general terms: to diversify the Adams Fund\u2019s portfolio in such a way that would decrease slightly the annual rate of return but would realize some appreciation for the principal. This factor, while not dispositive, is illustrative of Quincy\u2019s general lack of consideration of diversification, long considered a prudent investment strategy, see G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 4; <em>Chase, </em>383 Mass. at 363, and its disregard for both the 1898 legislative directive and the long-term needs of the income beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We are not persuaded that Quincy was prohibited from following this advice or from otherwise diversifying the Adams Fund\u2019s portfolio by the restrictions in the trust instrument. See note 26, <em>supra. </em>Rather, as Quincy\u2019s legal counsel observed and as the 1898 Act required, Quincy was in fact directed to invest the real estate sale proceeds \u201cin real estate or in such securities as trustees are authorized to hold in this Commonwealth.\u201d St. 1898, c. 102, \u00a7 2. The limitation articulated in Deed A of investing in government-issued bonds did not apply to these proceeds. Thus, contrary to Quincy\u2019s assertion that it was following the restrictions on the investment of the Adams Fund, its nearly complete investment in bonds suggests that Quincy actually contravened the applicable investment restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, and most significantly, Quincy failed to invest with the long-term needs and best interests of the income beneficiary in mind, creating a portfolio that consistently provided income but that left the principal vulnerable to inflation and, as a result, depreciation. See <em>Harvard College, 9 </em>Pick, at 458. Accordingly, based on these considerations, the judge\u2019s ruling that Quincy committed a breach of its fiduciary duty of prudent investment was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">2. <em>Award of damages. </em>We turn next to Quincy\u2019s allegations of error in the theory and calculation of the award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">a. <em>Theory of damages. </em>Quincy contends that the judge improperly devised a new liability theory, that of Quincy\u2019s failure to achieve any capital appreciation for the Adams Fund, that had not previously been an issue in the case. Quincy avers that by \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>jecting\u201d this issue into the case, enabling Woodward to assert the issue by permitting its expert witness to testify based on the theory, and making a finding based on this testimony, the judge engaged in an inappropriate fact-finding method and denied Quincy an adequate opportunity to prepare to defend against the theory. We agree with Woodward that the issue of lack of capital appreciation was present from the beginning of the litigation, and further note that even if it were not, a judge has the authority to raise an issue in the case as long as adequate notice is afforded to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We begin with a brief description of what transpired. On the second day of trial, in the presence of counsel, the judge indicated his disbelief that the Adams Fund\u2019s principal would not have grown significantly over the course of nearly sixty years.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He then proceeded to ask counsel a number of rhetorical but relevant questions about why the value of the Adams Fund had not appreciated, speculating that perhaps various stock investments had been made that did, at least temporarily, lead to some appreciation, the value of which was then lost through unsuccessful investments, but that such transactions were simply not reflected in the Fund\u2019s records. Quincy asserts that these statements \u201cinjected\u201d the issue of capital appreciation into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Thereafter, Woodward identified Scott Winslow as an expert witness who would testify that the Adams Fund\u2019s investment portfolio, being primarily invested in bonds, was such that it resulted in significant underperformance. Quincy moved to exclude Winslow\u2019s testimony, asserting that it \u201cwould introduce a new issue in the middle of trial.\u201d In opposition, Woodward contended that Winslow\u2019s testimony would \u201crespond to the Court\u2019s questions regarding why it was that despite a period of extraordinary growth in the economy, the principal of [the Funds] did not increase in value.\u201d Woodward further asserted that capital appreciation had been an issue from the beginning. The judge denied the motion but ultimately limited Winslow\u2019s testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>this issue to whether the investments were consistent with the advice Quincy had received from the bank, and prohibited Win-slow from testifying about a theoretical proposal that Quincy could have followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Winslow testified that, had Quincy employed the 60-35-5 diversification plan recommended by the bank in 1973, the Adams Fund would have grown in value significantly. Because Quincy did not do so, the Fund\u2019s value remained unchanged from 1973 to 2008. The judge credited this testimony and used it to calculate the damages owed to Woodward.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Although the specific calculations employed by Winslow and adopted by the judge were inappropriate for the award of damages, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>there was no error in the process by which this liability theory was introduced. The question of capital appreciation was indeed mentioned in Woodward\u2019s complaint, in the order appointing a special master, and in Woodward\u2019s pretrial memorandum. Given this early introduction of the issue, we are not persuaded that Quincy was denied a meaningful opportunity to prepare to defend against this assertion. Contrast <em>Harrington McGill </em>v. <em>Old Mother Hubbard Dog Food Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 966, 968 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Even if the issue were not raised in the complaint and other documents, the judge may introduce a recovery theory or unpleaded issue at trial if there is \u201cimplied consent\u201d of the parties, reflected by evidence \u201cthat the parties knew the evidence bearing on the unpleaded issue was in fact aimed at that issue and not some other issue the case involved.\u201d <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 816 (2003). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974); <em>Harrington-McGill, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 968. As the above discussion regarding Quincy\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty evinces, the question whether a trust\u2019s principal has experienced any capital appreciation is part of the inquiry into whether a trustee has engaged in prudent investments. Accordingly, Quincy cannot claim that, where a breach of fiduciary duty was alleged for improper investment strategies, it was unaware that principal appreciation might be an issue or even unaware of the facts that might be used in support of an argument that there was no appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Further, in raising the theory, the judge afforded numerous opportunities for Quincy to respond. Quincy was permitted to depose Winslow prior to cross-examination and to retain an expert and prepare a response to Winslow\u2019s testimony, which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>did. In addition, the judge limited Winslow\u2019s testimony on this issue. Thus, Quincy suffered no prejudice in the way the liability theory was introduced, see <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 965, 965 (1982), and there was no issue of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d in the inclusion of the theory at trial. See <em>Jensen, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">b. <em>Calculation of damages. </em>Quincy also alleges that the judge erred in calculating the award of damages award in three respects: first, by basing the award for unrealized gains on what the value of the Adams Fund would have been had Quincy followed the specific investment advice the judge found that Quincy received in 1973; second, in deciding not to subtract from the unrealized gains the costs and expenses Quincy theoretically would have incurred had it followed the diversification plan; and third, in awarding prejudgment interest dating back to the date of each breach.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We agree that the formula used to calculate unrealized gains was inappropriate, but reject Quincy\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">i. <em>Basis for unrealized gains. </em>Quincy first asserts that the judge\u2019s finding that Quincy should have adopted a specific portfolio diversification plan recommended by the bank in 1973, and the judge\u2019s employment of this plan by way of Winslow\u2019s testimony to calculate the unrealized gains, was clearly erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In awarding damages, the judge concluded that the Adams Fund was \u201centitled to a return on monies it would have reasonably realized but for the imprudent actions of the Trustee.\u201d Because the judge determined that it was imprudent for Quincy to ignore the bank\u2019s investment advice, and interpreted this advice as providing a 60-35-5 diversification plan, the judge calculated the return the Adams Fund would have realized based on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>recommended portfolio and the five per cent rate of return the bank anticipated that such a portfolio would receive. Using this information, Winslow had testified that, had Quincy employed this diversification plan, given the growth in the equity market between 1973 and 2008, the Adams Fund would have grown from its 1973 value of $321,932.43 to a value of $1,457,426 in 2008.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The judge therefore determined that the Fund suffered a loss in value of $1,135,494, or an average annual loss of income of $31,542, from Quincy\u2019s failure to act prudently and to employ the bank\u2019s portfolio recommendation. Accordingly, he included this amount, plus prejudgment interest, in the total award.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">To the extent the damages here were based on the judge\u2019s finding that Quincy ignored the specific investment advice it received in 1973, the finding and calculation were in error.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As discussed above, a trustee is not required to follow investment advice strictly but rather must invest prudently. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. Therefore, an award of damages cannot be based solely on what the trust\u2019s investment portfolio performance would have been had the trustee complied with certain, specific advice. Such reliance on a potential investment portfolio necessarily and improperly employs the benefit of hindsight. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 9. Unfortunately, this is precisely the formula the trial judge employed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The award must be based on more than just the unheeded investment advice a trustee received, and should instead consider the totality of the circumstances as they would have informed prudent investment decisions over the relevant time period. See <em>Quinton </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 792, 800 (2005) (judge must reach \u201capproximate estimate of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages\u201d in considering variety of factors). Cf. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>774, 785 (2007) (valuation of business for purposes of divorce proceeding must not be \u201cmaterially at odds with the totality of the circumstances\u201d). Factors to consider in this case include the state of the relevant bond and equities markets when various investment decisions were made, not just at one point in time decades ago; the terms and limitations of the trust instrument; the specific needs of the income beneficiary in the short and long term; and any risk calculations that may have influenced the trustee\u2019s decisions, including subsequent advice from the bank, the Funds\u2019 financial advisor. Cf. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Parker Mfg. Co., </em>329 Mass. 105, 112, 116-117 (1952) (assessment of value of unique services involves consideration of variety of tangible and intangible factors). As another factor, the judge may \u201ctake into account his general knowledge of economic conditions during the period of [the trustee\u2019s] transgressions.\u201d <em>Quinton, supra. </em>These factors can appropriately guide the judge\u2019s determination of \u201cwhat asset mix a prudent fiduciary would have maintained\u201d for the Adams Fund during the lengthy time frame at issue. See <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>250 F. Supp. 2d 544, 573 (D. Md. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Because the judge here considered merely one possible investment approach and did not account for these other factors, we reverse the award for unrealized gains in the portfolio and remand for further proceedings on this measure. On remand, an assessment of what a prudent investor would have done requires expert testimony on the minimum level of growth equities that would have been prudent for an income-only fund, with consideration of the potential shifts over the lengthy period at issue. A prudent investor may well have followed the 60-35-5 plan, or could have chosen a portfolio with a lower allocation to growth equities. At a minimum, the record must be thoroughly developed and findings made regarding the range of prudent strategies, so that the award, particularly with regard to unrealized gains, is calculated with a fuller understanding of the minimum growth equities allocation in mind.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">ii. <em>Accounting for costs and expenses. </em>Quincy also asserts that the judge erred in failing to subtract from the damages related to the return on investment the costs and expenses the Adams Fund would have incurred in realizing those investment gains. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 8 (trastee may incur \u201ccosts that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the assets, the purpose of the trust, and the skills of the trustee\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The plaintiff bears the burden \u201cto introduce evidence proving its damages to a reasonable certainty.\u201d See <em>Brewster Wallcovering Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Mountain Wallcoverings, Inc., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 609 (2007). The theory or explanation for the damages requested need not be the soundest one; it need only \u201cprovide[ ] a sufficiently (if minimally) rational basis\u201d for the award. <em>Id. </em>at 611. Cf. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass. at 785. Woodward met this burden by presenting Winslow\u2019s testimony. There is no obligation on the part of the judge to decrease potential damages sua sponte because of costs or expenses not admitted in evidence. In the absence of contrary testimony from Quincy regarding what its costs were or would have been had it implemented the investment strategy on which the award was based, the judge did not err in crediting the reasonable opinion proffered by Woodward\u2019s expert as to what costs and expenses a trustee using a hypothetical portfolio would have incurred. Cf. <em>Bernier, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">iii. <em>Award of prejudgment interest. </em>Finally, Quincy challenges the judge\u2019s award of interest on each measure of damages from the last date on which the damage was sustained, consistent with the judge\u2019s findings on these issues.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Quincy avers that the judge erred in including this prejudgment interest because, in tort actions, such interest can be awarded only from the date of the filing of the complaint, and not from the date of the breach itself, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>suant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We conclude that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, does not apply here, and affirm the awards of prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, provides for the addition of interest to the amount of damages awarded in an action involving damage to property and other such tort actions, at a rate of twelve per cent per year from the date of commencement of the action. The statute is intended \u201cto compensate a damaged party for the loss of use or the unlawful detention of money.\u201d <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, <em>717 </em>(1990), quoting <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 390 (1988). The primary goal of this statutory interest award is not to make the aggrieved party whole but, rather, \u201cto compensate for the delay in the plaintiff\u2019s obtaining his money.\u201d See <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>380 Mass. 372, 388 (1980). To achieve this goal, \u00a7 6B affords a standard return that the aggrieved party \u201cwould have had but for the other party\u2019s wrongdoing,\u201d regardless of what the theory of liability or underlying damages calculation is. See <em>McEvoy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In contrast, \u201c[wjhen a breach of trust occurs, the beneficiary of the trust is \u2018entitled to be put in the position he would have been in if no breach of fiduciary duty had been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berish </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>437 Mass. 252, 270 (2002), quoting <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 616 (1993). Making the beneficiary whole, particularly where the breach stems from imprudent investment decisions having an impact on the growth of the trust\u2019s assets, may require awarding interest beginning from the time of the breach, such that the trust\u2019s assets resemble what they would have but for the breach. In such circumstances, the award of prejudgment interest is part and parcel of the award of damages itself, and is not compensation for the delay of litigation in the same sense as interest awarded under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. Accordingly, it was not erroneous for the judge here to find that the Adams Fund was entitled to a return on monies that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>reasonably realized but for Quincy\u2019s imprudent actions, and to award prejudgment interest stemming from the last date of breach in order to make the Adams Fund whole.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">3. <em>Claimed bars to recovery. </em>We discuss briefly Quincy\u2019s remaining assertion that Woodward\u2019s claims should have been barred on the grounds of sovereign immunity; the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.; and laches. We conclude that Woodward\u2019s claims were not so barred, and recovery against Quincy was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">a. <em>Sovereign immunity and applicability of Tort Claims Act. </em>Quincy first argues that because Woodward ultimately brought a breach of fiduciary duty claim, which sounds in tort, Woodward was obligated to follow the requirements of the Tort Claims Act or else Quincy, as a municipality, would be effectively protected against the claim by sovereign immunity. Further, Quincy avers that Woodward failed to satisfy the Tort Claims Act\u2019s presentment requirement specifically, and therefore its claim should have been barred. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4. Woodward, in contrast, asserts that its claim sounds in contract rather than tort, because Quincy\u2019s obligations to manage the Funds arose through a contractual relationship with President Adams, and therefore the Tort Claims Act does not place any conditions on its claim. Alternatively, if its claim does sound in tort rather than contract, Woodward contends that Quincy\u2019s sovereign immunity is impliedly waived, due to Quincy\u2019s acceptance of the role of trustee and subsequent acts by the Legislature affirming this role, such that Woodward\u2019s claim properly survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In determining whether a claim arises in tort or contract, we look to \u201cthe essential nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83, 85 (1974). When Quincy accepted the responsibility to manage President Adams\u2019s property in trust, Quincy and President Adams entered into a contract, see <em>Dunphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 376, 383 (1975), of which Woodward is an intended third-party beneficiary and therefore is entitled to enforce the contract\u2019s terms. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Mass. 57, 61-62 (2000); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Fox Hill Village Homeowners Corp., </em>424 Mass. 365, 366-367 (1997), and cases cited. However, although Woodward initiated this action seeking an accounting, a purely contractual claim, the case evolved into an action for breach of fiduciary duty, a claim that sounds in tort, see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harbor Schs., Inc., </em>446 Mass. 245, 254 (2006); <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Robsham, </em>442 Mass. 205, 210, 213 (2004), and arises by operation of law rather than by contractual obligation. See, e.g., G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. See also <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Logan Hilton Joint Venture, </em>463 Mass. 316, 328 (2012) (\u201cWhere a contractual relationship creates a duty of care to third parties, the duty rests in tort, not contract\u201d). Accordingly, the present case is a tort action. To the extent Woodward asks us to frame its claim as a contractual one, we decline to do so. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Eng\u2019rs, Inc., 396 </em>Mass. 818, 823 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">As Woodward\u2019s claim sounds in tort, Quincy asserts that the Tort Claims Act imposes numerous conditions that Woodward failed to fulfil.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>New England Deaconess Ass\u2019n \u2014Abundant Life Communities, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 580, 587 (2010). The purpose of the conditions imposed by the Tort Claims Act is to limit tort claims against municipalities in order to maintain effective government. See <em>id.; Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>387 Mass. 51, 57 (1982). See also <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 217 (1977). Hence, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10, explicitly excludes certain types of claims that the Legislature clearly decided must give way to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Because the Tort Claims Act is in effect a mechanism for both limiting and preserving sovereign immunity from certain tort claims,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> see <em>Morrissey, </em>458 Mass. at 587, and cases cited, its restrictions do not apply where a municipality has waived sov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ereign immunity, and thereby implicitly waived the protections afforded by the Tort Claims Act. Sovereign immunity may be waived expressly by statute or implicitly, where \u201cgovernmental liability is necessary to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Todino </em>v. <em>Wellfleet, </em>448 Mass. 234, 238 (2007). See <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981), and cases cited. We conclude that Quincy\u2019s sovereign immunity is impliedly waived here.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">First, when Quincy agreed to serve as trustee, it assumed the fiduciary duties of that role, including the consequences for not fulfilling these duties. The policy purposes of sovereign immunity are not served where, as here, a municipality takes on a responsibility beyond its inherent or core government functions and therefore serves in a capacity that could just as easily be accomplished by a nongovernmental entity. See <em>Morrissey, </em>458 Mass. at 587. See also <em>Minton Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 879, 880 (1986) (where municipality has assumed certain obligations through contract, it has waived sovereign immunity against actions brought to enforce such obligations). In essence, by choosing to accept the obligations of trusteeship, Quincy waived any sovereign immunity from claims arising from its duties as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A trustee, regardless of whether it is a municipality, a corporation, or a private individual, is accountable to courts for its conduct in fulfilling, or committing a breach of, the fiduciary duties it owes.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> See <em>Fox of Boylston St. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>418 Mass. 816, 818 (1994). Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Woodbridge, </em>384 Mass. at 42, 44-45, where we determined that sovereign immunity was not waived, the Prudent Investor Act creates \u201ca formal system of actionable guaranties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 42, and expects the same level of conduct from any trustee. See G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. \u201c[A] natural and ordinary reading\u201d of the Prudent Investor Act indicates that where a municipality accepts the obligations of serving as a trustee, it will be held to the same standards and subject to the same penalties as any other trustee. See <em>DeRoche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>447 Mass. 1, 14 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Several legislative acts specific to the Funds further signal that Quincy is liable for any breach of the trustee responsibilities it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>has assumed. The 1827 Act appointed the treasurer of Quincy as treasurer of the Adams Fund and authorized a board of supervisors and the selectmen of Quincy to execute President Adams\u2019s intentions. See St. 1826, c. 59. It further required the treasurer to \u201crender an account of his doings, and exhibit a fair and regular statement of the property in his hands.\u201d St. 1826, c. 59, \u00a7 9. The 1898 Act authorized Quincy, as trustee, to sell and convey the Adams Fund\u2019s real property holdings, and in effect confirmed Quincy\u2019s legal responsibility to administer the Fund and invest its assets. See St. 1898, c. 102. In neither of these acts did the Legislature indicate that Quincy would be held to standards different from those applicable to other trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">To effectuate the purposes of these acts, we must consider sovereign immunity to be impliedly waived. The Legislature could not have intended to enable a municipality to serve as a trustee, by way of the Prudent Investor Act and the 1827 and 1898 Acts, and simultaneously relieve it of the fiduciary duties inherent in the role of a trustee. Reading Quincy\u2019s obligations otherwise would frustrate the general intent of the Prudent Investor Act that trustees further the interests of trust beneficiaries, by eliminating any recourse for mismanagement, and would be illogical in light of the specific acts of the Legislature empowering Quincy to take on such fiduciary responsibilities on behalf of the Funds. Accordingly, the Tort Claims Act cannot be read to limit tort liability where a municipality has agreed to serve as a trustee.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">b. <em>Laches. </em>Quincy also argues that the equitable doctrine of laches bars Woodward\u2019s claim. We agree with Woodward, the trial judge, and the special master that the claim is not barred on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Quincy avers that Woodward unduly delayed in bringing this action, and that this delay prejudiced Quincy because several of its key witnesses had died since the alleged breaches occurred. Quincy\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the judge improperly required actual knowledge by Woodward of Quincy\u2019s mismanagement of the Funds in order to satisfy the laches standard; instead, Quincy asserts that an opportunity to ascertain such facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>is all that is required for a laches defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">At trial, Quincy identified two occasions on which it asserted that Woodward had constructive knowledge of Quincy\u2019s failings as a trustee. First, Quincy suggested that Woodward knew of Quincy\u2019s inadequacies as early as the 1960s, when the headmistress of Woodward communicated to Quincy\u2019s primary record-keeper that she was disappointed that Quincy had sold at least one parcel owned by the Funds for less than fair market value. Second, Quincy alleged that as a result of litigation in the late 1980s between Woodward and Quincy regarding Quincy\u2019s mismanagement of the Woodward Fund, a separate trust, Woodward knew or should have known that Quincy was engaging in similar mismanagement of the Funds at issue here. Quincy contends on appeal that this constructive notice should have been adequate to satisfy the laches standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Both the special master and the trial judge rejected Quincy\u2019s laches claim because it had not established that Woodward had actual knowledge of Quincy\u2019s breach prior to its seeking of an accounting in 2005.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> There is no flaw in the legal analysis employed by the trial judge. To establish a laches defense, the asserting party must establish both actual knowledge, see <em>Latuca, </em>442 Mass. at 213-214; <em>Demoulas, </em>424 Mass. at 518-519; and prejudice. See <em>Stuck </em>v. <em>Schumm, </em>290 Mass. 159, 166 (1935); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Finkelstone, </em>206 Mass. 28, 36 (1910). \u201cConstructive knowledge is insufficient,\u201d <em>Lattuca, supra </em>at 213, as is \u201c[mjere suspicion or mere knowledge that the fiduciary has acted improperly.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>446 Mass. at 255. This requirement of actual knowledge \u201cprotects the beneficiary\u2019s legitimate expectation that the fiduciary will act with the utmost probity in all matters concerning the relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Quincy\u2019s implication, a plaintiff is not required to conduct \u201can independent investigation\u201d to determine if a breach of fiduciary duty has occurred. <em>Demoulas, supra </em>at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We agree with the special master\u2019s characterization that although \u201c[cjommon sense would dictate that if Woodward knew [Quincy] was mismanaging the Woodward Fund . . . , [then Quincy was] engaging in the same practices with regards to the Adams Fund [,]... common sense and constructive notice are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the standards here.\u201d As the special master and trial judge properly concluded, the laches standard simply was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The further amended judgment of the Probate and Family Court, and the amended judgment incorporated therein, is affirmed as to liability. We affirm the judge\u2019s award of damages in part, but remand the case to the Probate and Family Court for recalculation of the damages related to the unrealized investment gains, including prejudgment interest thereon, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Quincy, originally a town, was incorporated as a city in 1888. See St. 1888, c. 347.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-13\">For the purposes of this opinion, the city of Quincy, along with the board of supervisors and the board of managers (together, joint boards) of the funds at issue (the Adams Temple and School Fund, or Adams Fund, and the Charles Francis Adams Fund) (collectively, Funds), are referred to collectively as \u201cQuincy,\u201d except where differentiation is helpful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The parties have stipulated to the consolidation of the appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The board of managers of the Adams Fund was comprised of the mayor of Quincy, the president of the city council, the treasurer and collector, and two members elected annually by the city council. See \u00a7 2.144.020 of the General Ordinances of the City of Quincy. It appears that whereas the board of supervisors and the board of managers shared responsibility for overseeing the Adams Fund, only the board of supervisors oversaw the Charles Francis Adams Fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Woodward School for Girls, Inc. (Woodward), was established and operated by the Woodward Fund, a trust created by the will of Dr. Ebenezer Woodward, a cousin of President John Adams, in 1894. This fund was also managed by Quincy, but its board of managers was separate from those of the Funds. In 1952, Quincy filed a petition asking that the Funds be used to benefit Woodward, which was experiencing financial troubles. This court granted the petition and ordered that \u201cthe net income from the [Funds] ... be paid to and expended by the City of Quincy in its capacity as trustee of the Woodward Fund and Property for the conduct, operation, maintenance, management, and advancement of the Woodward School for Girls.\u201d The Woodward Fund was subsequently liquidated. In his findings in the present dispute, the judge noted that the cy pres decree \u201cdid not . . . provide a requirement for any annual, quarterly, or even periodic, income payments from the [Funds] to the Woodward School.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">As of 1962, the Charles Francis Adams Fund had a value of $24,323. The Fund hovered in this range until 1977, when it dropped to $19,542. As of 1984, the Fund contained $21,975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Quincy had never previously provided an accounting of its stewardship of the Funds to Woodward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">This accounting and report was supplemented by that of a certified public accountant, who was retained to assist the special master. Incorporating the accountant\u2019s findings, the special master made numerous findings, the most relevant of which are summarized here. First, he determined that the return generated by the Funds\u2019 investments was \u201ccomparable to the market return of similar investments.\u201d Second, he concluded that $85,090 in income from the Adams Fund that was not distributed to Woodward \u201cwas maintained in the Fund and reinvested in market rate instruments,\u201d and that $18,864 in income from the Charles Francis Adams Fund was wrongly withheld from Woodward. Third, he concluded that real property sales conducted between 1953 and 1972 were below fair market value, and that the only remaining parcel of real property held by the Funds was leased at less than fair market rent. Fourth, he determined that Quincy\u2019s expenses were significant and required justification. Finally, the special master concluded that Quincy committed a breach of its duty of care to Woodward and \u201cmay have violated its duty to prudently invest trust assets\u201d with regard to the land sales between 1955 and 1972; committed a breach of \u201cits duty of loyalty to Woodward when it engaged in business dealings which caused trust property to be sold for below fair market value\u201d; committed a breach of its duty to furnish information to beneficiaries \u201cby not informing Woodward of the 1972 petition concerning the lease\u201d of real property owned by the Funds, which was not a prudent investment, and by not providing an actual accounting when Woodward requested one until ordered to do so by the court; and committed a breach of its duty to keep accurate records and provide reports. In a supplemental report filed after receipt of additional documentation, the special master concluded that Quincy \u201cdid not adhere to the investment mandates\u201d articulated in Deed A and \u201cvaried the investment portfolio between equities and bonds\u201d when the deed seemed to limit investments to bonds only. The special master also noted that the fifty-five year accounting period at issue exceeded the recommended record retention period and therefore questioned the timeliness of Woodward\u2019s challenge to Quincy\u2019s actions as trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The trial judge subsequently gave \u201cpresumptive weight\u201d to the special master\u2019s findings and conclusions. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (h) (1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1237 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\">With regard to Quincy\u2019s real estate sales on behalf of the Adams Fund, the judge concluded that Quincy failed to fulfil its duty to sell realty for the best possible price, or at least for fair market value, and instead prioritized its own municipal needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\">With regard to the investment strategy for the Charles Francis Adams Fund, the judge concluded that even though the Fund\u2019s corpus had declined by nearly fifteen per cent between 1953 and 2005, it appeared that Quincy had made \u201ca modest effort to pay income of this relatively basic trust over to the Woodward School.\u201d The judge therefore declined to speculate as to any loss in income received by Woodward from this Fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Nonetheless, the judge expressed \u201cserious reservations and concerns\u201d regarding the investment approach employed during this period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">This finding departed from the special master\u2019s finding on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The $2,994,868 total judgment was calculated as follows: $255,566 in miscellaneous damages due to financial mismanagement, including recoupment of funds not received by the Adams Fund as a result of sales of real estate below fair market value, unrealized income from the sale of a particular parcel, the value of \u201cmissing\u201d funds from the South Shore National Bank (bank) account where the trust assets were held and from unreported stock gains, and recoupment of an unexplained account deficiency; $1,135,494 for the unrealized gain in the investment portfolio; and a total of $1,610,826 in prejudgment interest on these items ($475,426 on the miscellaneous damages combined, and $1,135,400 on the unrealized gains); less a credit for disallowed expenses of $7,018. Quincy\u2019s argument on appeal focuses primarily on the unrealized gains and the prejudgment interest portions of the award of damages. It appears to concede that if the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., does not bar the award, Quincy would remain responsible for $119,271 of the $255,566 miscellaneous damages (the amount attributable to unrealized income from the sale of a particular parcel and the unexplained account deficiency), plus certain prejudgment interest on that amount. Quincy asserts that the remainder of the $255,566 (attributable to below-market real estate sales and missing accounts and gains) is barred by laches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Because the Massachusetts Prudent Investor Act, G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (Act), applies only \u201cto decisions or actions of a trustee occurring on or after\u201d the 1998 effective date of the Act, we apply the standards of both the common law and the Act and note distinctions where relevant. See St. 1998, c. 398, \u00a7 3, inserting G. L. c. 203C. In many respects, the Act mirrors the common-law doctrine that has existed since the mid-1800s. See <em>Harvard College </em>v. <em>Amory, </em>9 Pick. 446, 461 (1830). See also <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 363 (1981). However, the Act introduced two significant changes: permissive delegation of duties, and the modern portfolio theory, which recognizes inflation as a factor to be considered in portfolio management decision-making and therefore shifts the assessment of a trustee\u2019s actions to the over-all construction of the portfolio. See Taylor, Massachusetts\u2019 Influence in Shaping the Prudent Investor Rule for Trusts, 78 Mass. L. Rev. 51, 51-52 &amp; n.5 (1993). Compare <em>Chase, supra </em>at 364 (assessing each investment individually, but with some consideration of \u201cthe fund as a whole\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">For actions occurring prior to 1998, we evaluate each investment individually, but also consider investments in the context of the trust as a whole. See <em>Chase, </em>383 Mass. at 364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Quincy had requested this advice after receiving guidance from its legal counsel that it was permissible to seek professional advice regarding investments, but that Quincy would retain responsibility for making investment decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The letter lends itself to several interpretations. It ambiguously refers to three proposals, giving some credence to Quincy\u2019s suggestion that the letter did not provide only one directive. We agree with Quincy that one of the proposals included in the letter was for \u201ca modest upgrading of the balance of the bond portfolio into higher rate bonds,\u201d which Quincy purports to have followed. However, we are not persuaded that the recommendations contained in the letter were meant to be alternatives rather than complements to each other. Our own review of the letter suggests that the primary emphasis with regard to the Adams Fund was the adoption of a diversification plan consisting of sixty per cent in equity securities, thirty-five per cent in fixed income, and five per cent in savings (60-35-5 plan). Accordingly, the judge\u2019s understanding of the letter as providing this recommendation is plausible and not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The agreement authorized the bank \u201cto review periodically and to advise or recommend to [Quincy] the retention, sale or exchange of the securities and other property in the [Funds] and to advise or recommend the purchase of stocks, bonds and other securities.\u201d The agreement indicated that Quincy would ultimately be responsible for making decisions regarding \u201cthe acquisition or disposition of securities and other property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The trial judge found that the boards adopted the specific 60-35-5 diversification proposal discussed above. However, the meeting minutes do not reflect such a precise vote. Accordingly, we conclude that the boards did not adopt any specific reading of the investment advice provided in the letter but rather resolved to follow more generally the advice provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Although Quincy avers that it followed some of the advice in the letter by upgrading the Adams Fund\u2019s bond portfolio to higher rate bonds, as noted above we are not persuaded that this was more than a secondary component of the bank\u2019s broader diversification recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The common law and the Prudent Investor Act take different approaches to delegation of a trustee\u2019s responsibilities. Compare G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(permitting trustee to \u201cdelegate investment and management functions if it is prudent to do so\u201d), with <em>Milbank </em>v. <em>J.C. Littlefield, Inc., </em>310 Mass. 55, 62 (1941) (trustee may not \u201cdelegate his authority as trustee\u201d), and <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Curley, </em>276 Mass. 549, 562-(1931). Merely receiving, considering, and adopting investment advice, however, does not constitute delegation under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We reserve our discussion of the impact of Quincy\u2019s failure to follow the bank\u2019s investment advice for a more holistic analysis of whether it acted prudently. See part l.d, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Quincy asserts that the terms of the trust instrument, Deed A, required it to invest most of the principal, with the exception of real property sales proceeds, in State and Federal bonds. Under the Prudent Investor Act, a trustee may be relieved from the obligations set forth in the Act where the trust instrument requires the trustee to act otherwise and \u201cthe trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust.\" G. L. c. 203C, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 228 comment f (1959) (\u201cBy the terms of the trust the requirement of diversification may be dispensed with\"). However, we are not persuaded that Quincy\u2019s complete reliance on this particularly restrictive trust provision was reasonable. Quincy failed to keep adequate records reflecting which assets could be invested only in bonds and which assets could be more broadly invested and used to diversify the portfolio and secure the principal against inflation. Instead, Quincy invested nearly all of its assets in bonds, which undoubtedly exceeded the allocation that was required by the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Further, if the express terms of the trust proved too restrictive to achieve the trust\u2019s goals, Quincy could have appealed to the court to revise the trust\u2019s terms to better serve its original purpose. See <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>357 Mass. 521, 531 (1970) (\u201ccourts of equity\u201d have general power \u201cin the administration of charitable trusts to permit deviations short of cy pres applications\u201d); <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston, </em>323 Mass. 261, 274-275 (1948) (applying cy pres doctrine because \u201c[equity] will presume that the donor would attach so much more importance to the object of the gift than to the mechanism by which he intended to accomplish it that he would prefer to alter the mechanism to the extent necessary to save the object\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The board meeting minutes reflect that an investment representative from the bank attended the board meetings and provided reports to Quincy in the decades following the 1973 advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Specifically, the judge stated, \u201cIt is inconceivable to me that the value of the portfolio has not doubled, tripled, quadrupled over [sixty] years.\u201d He observed that there had been no growth in the Adams Fund\u2019s portfolio but that \u201c[t]he investments seemed reasonable\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t seem inappropriate.\u201d In encouraging the parties to seek a settlement, the judge noted that he had \u201cno idea what the end result of this case [was] going to be\u201d and that it was \u201cunusual that a trust fund, whereby there would be no invasion of the principal, doesn\u2019t grow over [sixty] years of an incredible period of time of growth in the country. ... It is inconceivable that there would not be an increase.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Quincy also asserts that the judge\u2019s findings were inadequate to support the award. While we agree with Quincy that the judge is required to make subsidiary findings of fact in support of an award, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996), we are not persuaded that the judge did not adequately do so here. See <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Easton, </em>405 Mass. 159, 161-162 (1989) (judge need only \u201carticulate the essential grounds for a decision\u201d and demonstrate that he or she \u201chas dealt fully and properly with all the issues\u201d). Further, to the extent Quincy challenges the judge\u2019s crediting of the testimony of Scott Winslow generally, and his discrediting of the testimony of Quincy\u2019s expert witness, we note that the judge is entitled to credit any properly admitted expert testimony he or she deems credible, and that the judge here explicitly found that Winslow\u2019s opinion was credible. See <em>Delano Growers\u2019 Coop. Winery </em>v. <em>Supreme Wine Co., </em>393 Mass. 666, 682 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Quincy takes issue with the bond indexes employed by Winslow in calculating these numbers. Because we conclude that the formula used to calculate the unrealized gains was inappropriate, we decline to assess whether the indexes Winslow used were appropriate here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> We disagree with Woodward\u2019s assertion that it was proper for the judge to rely on Winslow\u2019s testimony in calculating the award where Quincy did not present any contrary methodology or challenge Winslow\u2019s calculations. Were the methodology employed by the judge sound, and simply not the approach most favorable to Quincy, we would uphold the judge\u2019s calculation. However, we cannot permit a judge\u2019s ruling to stand where it is clearly erroneous, as we conclude it is here. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a). See also <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass'n of Quincy </em>v. <em>Sandwich Water Dist., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 672-673 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Recalculating the unrealized gains on the portfolio also requires careful consideration of the extent of likely stock appreciation and the appropriate rate of return corresponding with the portfolio or portfolios on which the award is based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Although the judge did not exclude any costs or expenses from the calculation of the unrealized return on investments, he did exclude from the total award expenses that he found to be allowable, including reasonable compensation for Quincy\u2019s services, despite the fact that Quincy never submitted a bill for this compensation. In fact, the judge found that Quincy would be due a credit against other funds owed to the Adams Fund of $7,018, given $157,025 in allowed expenses offset by $150,007 in disallowed expenses. This credit was factored into the total award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">For example, the judge found that 1962 was the year of the Adams Fund\u2019s last sale of real estate below fair market value, and thus he included interest from the end of 1962 on the monies not received as a result of these below-market real estate sales. In addition, the judge found that the sale of a property referred to as \u201cVigoda\u201d should have occurred in 1972 but did not occur at all, and therefore he awarded interest from January 1, 1972. The judge employed two different rates of return in calculating the prejudgment interest: five per cent for the unrealized gain in the investment portfolio, and 7.54 per cent for all other measures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Quincy also avers that prejudgment interest is barred in claims against municipalities under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>we conclude that Quincy waived its sovereign immunity on these claims and therefore that the Tort Claims Act does not govern here, we decline to address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">However, the rate of return the judge employed for the unrealized gain in the investment portfolio may require reconsideration on remand, consistent with our discussion above regarding the flaws in this particular analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">There may be circumstances in which it is proper to apply G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, to tort actions arising from the breach of a fiduciary duty of a trustee. See, e.g., <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Robsham, </em>442 Mass. 205, 210 (2004). Where, however, the judge determines that an award of prejudgment interest is necessary to make the beneficiary whole, the additional award of interest under \u00a7 6B would be excessive and improper, as such an award is not punitive in nature. See <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Among these is the requirement that the plaintiff present its claim to the executive officer of the municipality within two years of when the cause of action arises.
