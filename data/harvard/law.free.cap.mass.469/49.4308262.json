L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A; 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 25.1 (2006). The Architectural Access Board (board) issued a final decision concluding that each of the three doorways of a retail store in Kingston, operated by J.M. Hollister, LLC (Hollister), was a separate entrance, and therefore that each doorway was required to be accessible to persons with disabilities. The board also denied Hollister\u2019s request for a variance from compliance with the accessibility regulations. Hollister sought judicial review of the decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision, as did the Appeals Court on appeal. See <em>J.M. Hollister, LLC </em>v. <em>Architectural Access Bd.., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 524 (2013) <em>(Hollister). </em>We granted Hollister\u2019s application for further appellate review and also affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, because the board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence of meaningful differences in the use and functionality of the three doorways at issue, and because the denial of the variance was based on evidence of a substantial benefit of access for persons with disabilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Regulatory framework. </em>General Laws c. 22, \u00a7 13A, empowers the board to adopt rules and regulations \u201cdesigned to make public buildings and facilities accessible to, functional for, and safe for use by persons with disabilities.\u201d See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.1 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These regulations are intended to ensure that \u201call such persons may have the educational, living and recreational opportunities necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible and to assume full responsibilities as citizens.\u201d 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.2 (2006). The regulations require that \u201c[a]ll public entrance(s) of a building or tenancy in a building shall be accessible.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.1. \u201cAccessible\u201d means that the site or building \u201ccan be approached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>entered, and used by persons with disabilities.\u201d 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1. See G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where compliance with the regulations is necessary, an owner or tenant may seek a variance if it believes \u201cthat full compliance with 521 [Code Mass. Regs.] is impracticable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">2. <em>Store design. </em>The facts of this case are largely undisputed on appeal. Hollister is a clothing retailer that leases and operates a store at the Independence Mall in Kingston. When Hollister opened the store in 2005, it received a building permit to replace a fully accessible mall-grade interior entrance with a raised \u201cporch\u201d design common to many Hollister stores.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This entryway through the porch is designed to look like a \u201cCalifornia surf shack,\u201d consisting of two steps leading up to a roofed porch that extends outward from the wall of the store into the mall. <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 514. The porch contains large plants, pictures, and other decorative items.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the back of the porch, a patron has two options: descend two steps to the left, through a doorway to the men\u2019s section (\u201cDudes\u201d), or descend two steps to the right, through a doorway to the women\u2019s section (\u201cBettys\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The porch doorway is not accessible to persons with disabilities because it requires the use of stairs leading up to the porch and then down again into the store.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On either side of and in close proximity to the porch are two accessible doors at mall grade that lead directly into the store without steps or ramps. Both side doorways are designed to look like plantation shuttered windows, and are equipped with automatic door openers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A patron who enters through the left accessible door will arrive in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>location as if he or she had entered through the porch and descended the stairs to the left, whereas a patron who enters through the right accessible door will arrive in the same location as if he or she had descended the stairs to the right. See <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 514. In other words, a patron entering through the porch has a choice of which section of the store to enter, whereas a patron using one of the side accessible doorways enters directly into a particular section.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">3. <em>Procedural history. </em>In January, 2008, Jennifer Niles, a wheelchair user, filed a complaint with the board alleging that the Kingston store was not accessible. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.3.1, 4.2 (2006); note 11, <em>supra. </em>In June of that year, while the board was investigating the complaint, Hollister applied for a variance from its obligation to make all public entrances to the store handicapped accessible. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1. The board denied the variance application because Hollister had failed to prove that it was impractical to make the store accessible. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Hollister appealed from the denial of the variance and requested an adjudicatory hearing before the board. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1.1(a). Hollister alleged that a variance was not needed because the design of the store complied with the requirements,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and alternatively, that if a variance was required, it was deserving of one because the cost of renovating the central porch to make it accessible would be excessive. In November, 2008, after a hearing, the board issued a decision concluding that Hollister was not in compliance with 521 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 25.1. The board did not specifically state in its decision whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>it considered each of the three doorways on the facade to be a separate entrance, such that the inaccessibility of the central porch doorway alone constituted a violation, or whether the noncompliance stemmed from the lack of functionality of the accessible doorway(s) adjacent to the central porch. The board further affirmed its denial of the variance, because Hollister had created the noncomplying condition itself, and it had failed to show that the cost of compliance would be excessive without substantial benefit to persons with disabilities. The board accordingly ordered Hollister to bring the store into compliance. See G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A; 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00, 4.00, 26.00 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Hollister sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision, and in August, 2009, a judge in the Superior Court remanded the matter to the board for further proceedings, because he concluded that the administrative record was not sufficiently developed. The judge asked the board to revisit the question whether the three doorways constituted separate entrances or a single integrated entrance, and to reconsider whether Hollister should be granted a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On remand, the board held an evidentiary hearing. It determined that the three separate doorways on the store\u2019s <em>faqade </em>(the left accessible door, the central porch, and the right accessible door) constituted three separate entrances under the regulatory definition of \u201centrance\u201d as an \u201caccess point,\u201d because each side doorway provided access to only one side of the store, whereas the central, raised doorway provided access to both sides of the store. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 25.1. The board further concluded that a variance was not appropriate because modification was not impracticable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The board therefore denied Hollister\u2019s request for a variance and ordered the store again to bring its central porch entrance into compliance with 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Hollister appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings. In July, 2011, a judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision that the doorways constituted separate entrances, because this decision was based on substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>evidence and a reasonable interpretation of the regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, the judge found that there was substantial evidence to support the denial of a variance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Hollister sought review of the Superior Court ruling by the Appeals Court. See <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 514. In a published decision, the Appeals Court concluded that the board\u2019s finding that \u201cthe three doors were separate entrances because each door constituted a separate access point to the store\u201d was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law,\u201d given the definition of \u201centrance\u201d in the regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 517-518. The board was not required \u201cto consider a door which is accessible by stairs alone to be the same entrance as doors that are physically separate and accessible,\u201d despite Hollister\u2019s contention that the provisions permitting turnstiles and revolving doors, and the contemplation of stairs as part of an accessible entrance, so required. <em>Id. </em>at 518-519. Rather, the court deferred to a reasonable interpretation of the regulatory language adopted by the board and noted that this interpretation was consistent with the remedial purposes of the law, reflected in the legislative history, that all buildings be entirely accessible to persons with disabilities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 520, 522-523.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The Appeals Court also affirmed the denial of the variance, noting that, where there is a substantial benefit to persons with disabilities in requiring compliance, the cost of compliance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>irrelevant. See <em>id. </em>at 523-524, quoting <em>Pyramid Co. of Hadley </em>v. <em>Architectural Barriers Bd., </em>403 Mass. 126, 131 (1988). Given the board\u2019s finding of a substantial benefit, it was reasonable for it to deny the variance, regardless of the credibility and extent of the costs to Hollister. <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 524. We granted Hollister\u2019s application for further appellate review on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Like the courts below, we review the board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and will not disturb the decision unless it was made in excess of the board\u2019s statutory authority; is unsupported by substantial evidence;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. Where, as here, the Legislature has granted broad authority to the board, and the board has interpreted a regulation that it has been tasked by the Legislature with promulgating, we afford \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d to the board\u2019s interpretation of both its enabling statute and its own regulation. <em>Ten Local Citizen Group </em>v. <em>New England Wind, LLC, </em>457 Mass. 222, 228 (2010), quoting <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 (1991). See <em>Iodice </em>v. <em>Architectural Access Bd., </em>424 Mass. 370, 373 (1997). This deference, however, is not without limit. <em>Board of Appeals of Woburn </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 581, 590 (2008), and cases cited. Hollister bears the burden of showing that the board\u2019s interpretation is \u201cnot rational.\u201d <em>Ten Local Citizen Group, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">1. <em>Number of entrances. </em>Hollister essentially makes two arguments, largely identical to those it advanced before the Superior Court and the Appeals Court, regarding the meaning of an \u201centrance\u201d under 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1. First, it asserts that the board\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201centrance\u201d and related terms within the regulations was \u201clegally untenable,\u201d because the regulations clearly consider adjacent doorways on the same facade to be a single entrance. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 26.2, 26.3 (2006). Second, Hollister claims that the board\u2019s determination that the three doorways constitute separate entrances is not supported by substantial evidence and is rooted instead in the board\u2019s unjustified consideration of a disabled patron\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>accessing the store. We are not persuaded by either claim in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Under 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.1, each \u201cpublic entrance! ] of a . . . tenancy in a building [must] be accessible.\u201d An \u201centrance\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny access point to a building or portion of a building ... used for the purpose of entering . . . including] the approach walk,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] stairs, lifts, ramp or other vertical access leading to the entrance platform; the entrance platform itself; vestibules, if provided; the entry door(s) or gate(s); and the hardware of the entry door(s) or gate(s).\u201d 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Hollister argues that multiple doorways on the same fagade must be deemed a single entrance, and where two of the three doorways are accessible, it was inappropriate for the board to conduct further inquiry into the nature of the third doorway. Hollister points to the inclusion in the definition of \u201centrance\u201d of \u201cstairs, lifts, ramp or other vertical access\u201d as supporting its contention that steps and other inaccessible design elements may be part of an accessible multidoor entrance. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1. Hollister reads the regulations too narrowly. The board does not dispute that the regulations plainly enable it to consider multiple doors as a single entrance, including where some of the doorways contain inaccessible elements such as steps. But the board is not <em>required </em>to consider every combination of accessible and inaccessible doorways as a single entrance, particularly where they provide different use patterns, as the board found here. See <em>Iodice, </em>424 Mass. at 375 (\u201cNothing in the wording or context of the access regulations supports the plaintiff\u2019s emphasis\u201d). Mere proximity of an inaccessible doorway to an accessible one does not mean that the board must end its inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The board contends that its assessment of what constitutes an \u201caccess point\u201d and therefore an \u201centrance\u201d instead involves consideration of the functionality and use of each doorway, and of differences in such functionality and use between adjacent doorways. See <em>Iodice, </em>424 Mass. at 376 (board must conduct practi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>cal, functionality-based assessment of public use).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See also 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1 (defining \u201cuse\u201d as \u201c[p]urpose for which the building is designed, used or intended to be used\u201d). Where the term \u201caccess point\u201d is not defined in the regulations, the board is entitled to exercise its authority through the decisional process to define it further. See generally <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass. 46, 49 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The board\u2019s emphasis on use pattern in determining whether multiple doorways constitute a single or multiple entrances is apparent in, and indeed supported by, its rejection of Hollister\u2019s analogy of its raised porch design to turnstiles and revolving doors, which are specifically permitted under the regulations as part of multi-door entrances. Under 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 26.2 and 26.3 (2006), an inaccessible revolving door or turnstile may be part of an accessible entrance if an accessible door or gate is \u201cprovided adjacent to\u201d the revolving door or turnstile and it \u201cpermit[s] the same use pattern.\u201d Hollister contends that these provisions demonstrate that the board must consider an inaccessible doorway and an adjacent accessible doorway as a single accessible entrance. We disagree. First, these provisions pertain to two specific types of inaccessible entryways and do not require the board to extend such treatment to other inaccessible designs, such as Hollister\u2019s raised porch.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Second, and more importantly, Hollister ignores a key component of these narrow provisions, which require not only that an accessible doorway accompany the revolving door or turnstile, but also that the two entryways provide the \u201csame use pattern.\u201d See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 26.2, 26.3. That is, for example, when a person enters through the revolving door or turnstile, that person ends up in essentially the same place as he or she would, had he or she used the accessible doorway.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The board\u2019s rejection of this compari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>son, where entering through the central porch gives the patron the option of arriving at a place different from the one arrived at by entering through one of the accessible side doors, supports its reasonable determination that differences in use pattern between doorways may signal multiple entrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We are persuaded, as the Appeals Court was, that the board\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of \u201caccess point\u201d is appropriately rooted in the legislative history of G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A, and the mandate of ensuring full accessibility. See <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 521-523. Although Hollister\u2019s reading of the regulations is also a plausible one, it is not the only one, and we \u201cmay not displace [the] board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views.\u201d <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414, 420 (1982). To the extent that the board considered the use and function of each doorway in determining whether the three doorways constituted separate entrances, rather than merely concluding that the combination of an accessible and inaccessible doorway per se constituted a single accessible entrance, the board\u2019s interpretation of the scope of its authority was reasonable and not arbitrary or an abuse of discretion, given the significant differences between the three doorways, as discussed below. See <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 520-521.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Further, the board employed its interpretation of an \u201caccess point\u201d to reach a reasonable conclusion supported by substantial evidence. It heard evidence about each doorway\u2019s particular use and function, and observed meaningful differences in functionality, use, and design that, under a reasonable interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>regulations, rendered each doorway a separate and discrete access point into the store. Most significantly, the board found, based on testimony, photographs, and architectural renderings, that entering through either of the side accessible doorways placed a patron in a location within the store different from the one the patron would be if he or she entered through the central porch. A patron entering through one of the accessible doors would find himself in one of the two clothing sections, with a fifty per cent chance of arriving in the desired section as a first-time visitor, whereas a patron entering through the central porch would be able to make an informed choice as to which section to enter. In this respect, patrons did not arrive in the same place through the various doorways, and therefore those doorways did not provide the same usage pattern. The porch design, the board reasoned, gave able-bodied patrons an advantage in being able to arrive in an optimal interior location. This finding alone is enough to constitute substantial evidence supporting the board\u2019s conclusion that each doorway represented a separate access point. See <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In addition, although the board did not specifically reference the design of the doorways as a basis for its conclusion, the evidence it heard regarding the discrete aesthetic presentation of each doorway likely also informed its determination that the three doorways did not function as a single entrance. Although the regulations are indeed \u201c \u2018use\u2019 rather than \u2018design\u2019 regulations,\u201d <em>Iodice, </em>424 Mass. at 375, design may be a reasonable consideration to the extent that it signals and informs use. The central porch design \u201ccreates an aesthetic which is a valuable part of. . . Hollister\u2019s branding efforts\u201d and is intended \u201cto convey a certain ambiance and appearance that makes the store inviting as a whole.\u201d <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition </em>v. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., </em>835 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1078, 1081 (D. Colo. 2011). But this \u201csurf shack\u201d design is not extended to the accessible side doorways, which instead are disguised as windows. See <em>id. </em>at 1082. The accessible doorways therefore present themselves as a less than fully participatory way to enter the store. Cf. <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition </em>v. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., </em>957 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1276, 1281 (D. Colo. 2013) (\u201cvisual impression is of a main, decorated, primary but inaccessible entrance in the center\u201d that is \u201cqualitatively different [from] or superior\u201d to \u201csmaller, inferior, undecorated accessible entrances to each side\u201d); <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, </em>835 F. Supp. 2d at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>These design distinctions are exacerbated by the fact that the steps to the porch serve no functional purpose. Cf. <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, </em>835 F. Supp. 2d at 1078 (steps leading to porch of Hollister store \u201care purely ornamental\u201d). Especially where, as here, the inaccessible entry way is one of Hollister\u2019s own design, and not a function of any unique, preexisting feature of the site, there is no justification for having such a meaningfully different inaccessible entryway that visually and functionally signals lesser access to the store. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Given the differences in use, treatment, and presentation of the central porch as compared to the accessible side doors, it was reasonable for the board to conclude that these doorways each constituted different access points and therefore separate entrances. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981) (substantial evidence is such evidence \u201cas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). Indeed, this is the same reasoning and result of a Federal District Court decision addressing the same question regarding the compliance of Hollister\u2019s raised porch design with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) design standards. See <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, </em>835 F. Supp. 2d at 1082-1083 (central porch entryways of two Hollister stores violate Title III of ADA because side accessible doors \u201cdo not permit the same pattern of use,\u201d and inaccessible porch design \u201cunnecessarily . . . excludes people using wheelchairs from full enjoyment of the aesthetic for that brand\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See also Colorado <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Cross-Disability Coalition <em>vs. </em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 09-CV-02757, slip op. at 2 (D. Colo. Feb. 26, 2014) (central porch entry ways of 231 Hollister stores violate ADA); <em>Colorado Cross-Disability </em>Coalition, 957 F. Supp. 2d at 1274-1275, 1281. Giving deference to the board\u2019s interpretation of its regulations, we conclude that the board was warranted in finding that each doorway constituted a separate access point. Even though \u201creasonable minds could accept\u201d an alternative conclusion, such minds could similarly find the board\u2019s findings and conclusion plausible and adequately supported, and we therefore will not disturb them. See <em>Iodice, </em>424 Mass. at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We address briefly Hollister\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s decision was based in its consideration of the subjective \u201cexperience\u201d of a disabled store patron, a nebulous concept that creates too much uncertainty for future architectural and design decisions. There may be a fine line between consideration of the objective elements of use and functionality and the more subjective nature of one\u2019s experience with and in the store. However, we need not determine the extent to which the experiences of a person with disabilities may inform the board\u2019s analysis of what constitutes an entrance. The board\u2019s decision here was based on a reasonable interpretation of the applicable regulations and was supported by substantial evidence of the use and functionality of the doorways, demonstrating that the raised porch at the center of the store\u2019s fagade contained a unique design and use pattern that meaningfully distinguished it from the accessible doorways on either side of it.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The board reasonably could conclude from the evidence before it that the three doorways were not integrated but rather constituted separate access points into the store in both form and function.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the board\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sion on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">2. <em>Denial of variance. </em>Hollister also challenges the board\u2019s denial of its request for a variance. It contends that the denial was not supported by substantial evidence because the limited testimony regarding the time savings a disabled patron would have if he or she were able to enter through the central porch and choose which section to enter, rather than entering the wrong section and having to travel to the correct one, did not rise to the level of articulating a \u201csubstantial benefit.\u201d We agree with the Superior Court judge that there was substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Where compliance with the regulations is necessary, an owner or tenant may seek a variance if it believes \u201cthat full compliance with 521 [Code Mass. Regs.] is impracticable.\u201d 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1. Compliance is impracticable where it would be \u201ctechnologically unfeasible\u201d or where compliance \u201cwould result in excessive and unreasonable costs without any substantial benefit to persons with disabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The board denied Hollister\u2019s request for a variance because it concluded that there would be a substantial benefit to persons with disabilities from access to the central porch. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.1. The board based this conclusion primarily on the testimony of a patron with disabilities who stated that the lack of access to both sections of the store from each accessible door made it more difficult for him to shop at Hollister. Specifically, he testified that if he entered through the men\u2019s side and wanted to get to the women\u2019s side, or vice versa, he would \u201cprobably just turn around and leave, or ... go and see if there was another entrance on the other side [of the storefront]\u201d to the section he wanted to access. He noted that other Hollister stores had accessible central entrances that preserved the \u201cfeel\u201d of the porch entrance but allowed disabled patrons to have \u201cthe same experience as the general able-bodied public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is not our role to review the board\u2019s evidence de novo or substitute our own assessment of the evidence\u2019s credibility or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>permissible inferences that may be made. See <em>Medi-Cab of Mass. Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 357, 369 (1987). Given the board\u2019s determination that the patron was a credible witness, it was reasonable for it to rely on such testimony as sufficient support for its conclusion. See <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>418 Mass. 855, 860 (1994); <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 627-628 (1984). Cf. <em>Pyramid Co. of Hadley, </em>403 Mass. at 130 (handicapped persons\u2019 testimony of desire to attend classes, parties, and community functions held on mezzanine level and to supervise children using spaces on that level constituted substantial evidence supporting board\u2019s determination that substantial benefit would be gained by providing elevator access to that level).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Although the board went on to consider the costs of compliance in its decision, the determination that a substantial benefit could be had by persons with disabilities by providing access through the central porch ends the inquiry into whether a variance may be granted. \u201cA cost-benefit analysis is not relevant if [as in this case] the board determines that there would be substantial benefit. Only if there is no substantial benefit does the issue of the cost of complying with the regulation become important.\u201d See <em>Hollister, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 523-524, quoting <em>Pyramid Co. of Hadley, </em>403 Mass. at 131. Accordingly, we need not address Hollister\u2019s claims, whether credible or not, of the excessive cost of modification. The board\u2019s denial of the variance was based on substantial evidence, and we therefore will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\">This includes persons in wheelchairs, or others \u201cwho experience substantial limitations in one or more major life activities, including . . . walking.\u201d 521 Code Mass.

This doorway was nonfunctional on several occasions. To the right of the porch was an emergency exit door that was not used as an entrance. This lack of reliable functionality of the left door, which was the only accessible door at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>time, informed the board\u2019s initial decision and was a partial basis for remand by the Superior Court judge. After the original complaint had been filed but before the board had held its first hearing after remand, Hollister altered the emergency exit door to the right of the porch so it could function as a second accessible door. Hollister also maintains that the problems with the left door have been resolved. On appeal, we assume that there are two functional accessible doors adjacent to the porch entrance and accordingly omit details regarding when one or both of the accessible doors were available, except where relevant. See <em>J.M. Hollister, LLC </em>v. <em>Architectural Access Bd., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 514-516 (2013) (Hollister) (providing greater detail on functionality and availability).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Specifically, Hollister asserted that the multiple doorways on the store\u2019s fagade were essentially one comprehensive entrance, and that the regulations permit an entrance to include inaccessible elements such as stairs, as long as an accessible doorway is also provided. Accordingly, it claimed that the only issue in the complaint was the functionality of the accessible doorway, which had been resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The board determined that compliance was not technologically infeasible, as Hollister had constructed stores with the porch design but without steps in other locations, and that the substantial benefit to persons with disabilities outweighed the cost of compliance, particularly where Hollister had created the noncompliant condition. See G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A; 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1 (2006).

Colo. 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">At the hearing before the board, Hollister presented several examples of locations in Boston where the board had approved entrances consisting of an inaccessible revolving door accompanied by at least one accessible doorway. Hollister argues on appeal that the board should have given these examples precedential value and viewed Hollister\u2019s porch design as analogous to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>multidoor entrances. In rejecting Hollister\u2019s analogy of its raised porch design to a revolving door, however, the board reasonably determined that these examples were not persuasive, as each one of them contained a revolving door at grade level with an adjacent accessible door, compliant with the specific provisions of 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 26.2 (2006). Even if the board did find some merit in Hollister\u2019s analogy to revolving doors, the board was free to reach a different conclusion on the facts presented here, as long as it was not arbitrary or capricious. Here, the board was confronted with a unique design feature, and its decision not to rely on its prior approvals of dissimilar entrances was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Similarly, we are unpersuaded by Hollister\u2019s assertion that the board should have given weight to the fact that ten other building inspectors in Massachusetts believed that this design complied with the regulations. \u201c[T]he board [is] the ultimate arbiter of regulatory compliance.\u201d <em>Iodice, </em>424 Mass. at 374. See G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A. It was therefore within the board\u2019s discretion to either credit or reject the inspectors\u2019 conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Hollister contends that this Federal litigation is not analogous because it involves different rules and legislative history. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) design standard applicable to that litigation in fact closely resembles 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.1 and 25.1. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.406 Appendix A, 1991 Standard for Accessible Design 3.5 (defining \u201centrance\u201d as \u201c[a]ny access point to a building or portion of a building or facility used for the purpose of entering. . . . including] the approach walk, the vertical access leading to the entrance platform, the entrance platform itself, vestibules if provided, the entry door[s] or gate[s], and the hardware of the entry door[s] or gate[s]\u201d). In that case, the parties presented nearly identical arguments for and against a finding of compliance with the ADA design standards as those presented here. <em>Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, </em>835 F. Supp. 2d at 1079-1081. Although we are not bound to follow the Federal court\u2019s reasoning and decision, we consider that litigation useful by way of analogy. The District Court judge concluded that 231 Hollister stores throughout the United States violated the ADA, and required Hollister \u201cto remove, ramp, or close off all of the elevated entry doors by January 1, 2017, at a rate of at least 77 stores each year beginning on January 1, 2014.\u201d Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition vs. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>U.S. Dist.
