See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alebord, </em>467 Mass. 106, 111-114, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2830 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, 467 </em>Mass. 96, 100-105, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 356 (2014). This time we are required to address a question not previously reached, that is, whether prejudice from the deficiency of trial counsel in this respect must be affirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>established as part of the claim or is to be presumed because of the structural nature of the underlying public trial right that trial counsel failed to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On April 20, 2001, a Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of aggravated rape, kidnapping, indecent assault and battery, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant \u2014 represented by new counsel \u2014 filed a timely notice of appeal, and on August 5, 2003, a panel of the Appeals Court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished decision pursuant to that court\u2019s rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1202 (2004). The defendant filed two motions for a new trial in 2003 and 2004, which were denied by the trial judge in a single order on April 15, 2004. The defendant again timely filed a notice of appeal, and a panel of the Appeals Court affirmed the judge\u2019s denial of his two motions for a new trial on May 10, 2005. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In September, 2011, represented by new appellate counsel, the defendant filed his third postaffirmance motion for a new trial, raising, for the first time, a claim that his right to a public trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated when his family members were excluded from the court room during jury empanelment, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the closure. In support of his motion, the defendant presented his own affidavit and affidavits from his mother, his uncle, and his trial and former appellate attorneys. In her affidavit, the defendant\u2019s mother stated that she, her late husband, and her brother were in attendance in the Superior Court in Middlesex County on April 10, 2001, the date of jury selection. At approximately 9:15 a.m., a court officer informed them that they would have to leave the court room. They left the court room, and waited in the lobby. According to the affidavits of the defendant\u2019s mother and uncle, the family members attempted to reenter the court room at approximately 1 p.m. but were prevented from doing so by a court officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Trial counsel averred that he believed that the court room was closed during jury empanelment, as was the practice in the Superior Court in Middlesex County at the time, and that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>not object to the alleged closure. Trial counsel further averred that he did not discuss the matter with the defendant and was not aware at the time of the trial that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extended to jury empanelment. The defendant\u2019s former appellate counsel averred that he had no tactical or strategic reason not to raise the issue of court room closure in any of the defendant\u2019s appeals or prior motions for a new trial, noting that it did not occur to him that closure was an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the defendant\u2019s third motion for a new trial without a hearing, reasoning that because the defendant had not objected to any closure during jury empanelment, he had waived his public trial claim. The judge further determined that removal of the defendant\u2019s family from the court room during jury empanelment did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice entitling the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">On April <em>4, </em>2013, following the release of our decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. 83, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2356 (2013), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>464 Mass. 660, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 248 (2013), the defendant sought reconsideration of the denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing that prejudice under the second prong of the standard regarding ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), must be presumed due to the structural nature of the right to a public trial. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the judge assumed both that a closure during jury empanelment had occurred and that trial counsel\u2019s performance in failing to object to the closure fell below that of an ordinary fallible lawyer. However, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that prejudice must be presumed because of the structural nature of the underlying public trial right. Accordingly, the judge denied the motion, determining both that the defendant was unable to show prejudice resulting from the court room closure and that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We conclude that where the defendant has procedurally waived his Sixth Amendment public trial claim by not raising it at trial, and later raises the claim as one of ineffective assistance of counsel in a collateral attack on his conviction, the defendant is required to show prejudice from counsel\u2019s inadequate performance (that is, a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice) and the presumption of prejudice that would otherwise apply to a preserved claim of structural error does not apply. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number><em>Purvis </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 740-743 (11th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>549 U.S. 1035 (2006); <em>Virgil </em>v. Dretke, 446 F.3d 598, 612 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>Reid </em>v. State, 286 Ga. 484, 487 (2010); and <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>491 Mich. 642, 655-658 (2012), all concluding that structural error alone is not sufficient to warrant presumption of prejudice in context of claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">a. <em>Right to a public trial. </em>It is well settled that the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is structural error. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 263 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 105 (2010). Where a defendant raises a properly preserved claim of structural error, this court will presume prejudice and reversal is automatic. See <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 118-119 (properly preserved claim where counsel objected to court room closure at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Where counsel fails to lodge a timely objection to the closure of the court room, the defendant\u2019s claim of error is deemed to be procedurally waived. See <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. at 102; <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. at 87-88 &amp; n.8. Our case law provides that unpreserved claims of error be reviewed to determine if a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred. See <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. at 89, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). While violation of the right to a public trial is structural error, even structural error \u201cis subject to the doctrine of waiver.\u201d <em>Morganti, supra </em>at 101-102, quoting <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 105-106. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 641 (1997) (stating doctrine of waiver applies equally to constitutional claims). This includes structural error arising through an improper court room closure. See <em>Alebord, </em>467 Mass. at 113; <em>Morganti, supra </em>at 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">To presume prejudice in this context would ignore the distinction, one long recognized by this court, between properly preserved and waived claims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. 728, 735-737 &amp; n.7 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2693 (2012) (applying waiver analysis in case of murder in first degree to unobjected-to closure during jury voir dire and finding substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice not shown); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 832 (2001) (applying waiver analysis, in effect, to unpreserved claim of Sixth Amendment right to public trial). The structural nature of the underlying error does not automatically excuse the defendant from showing prejudice when advancing an unpreserved claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 542 (1976) (holding that showing of actual prejudice necessary to overcome procedural waiver arising from failure to object to structural error at trial). \u201cThe presumption of prejudice which supports the existence of the right is not inconsistent with a holding that actual prejudice must be shown in order to obtain relief from a statutorily provided waiver for failure to assert it in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 233, 245 (1973) (presumption of prejudice associated with claim of racial discrimination in grand jury composition not available when claim first raised in postconviction motion). \u201cTo conclude otherwise would tear the fabric of our well-established waiver jurisprudence that \u2018a defendant must raise a claim of error at the first available opportunity,\u2019 \u201d <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. at 102, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 294 (2002), and would defeat the core purposes of the waiver doctrine: to protect society\u2019s interest in the finality of its judicial decisions, and to promote judicial efficiency. <em>Randolph, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">b. <em>Right to effective assistance of counsel. </em>If an error is waived due to the failure of trial counsel to object, we still may have occasion to review the error in the postconviction context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Alebord, </em>467 Mass. at 113; <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. at 103. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, a defendant also must show that counsel\u2019s deficiency resulted in prejudice, see <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96, which, in the circumstances of counsel\u2019s failure to object to an error at trial, is essentially the same as the substantial risk standard we apply to unpreserved errors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 686-687 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Because of the structural nature of the defendant\u2019s waived Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, the dissent would presume prejudice, even in the context of a collateral attack based on a claim of a counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. But a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not a public trial claim. As discussed above, the defendant\u2019s public trial claim has been procedurally waived. Presuming prejudice in this context ignores the distinct and well-established jurisprudence which governs claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>With respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a presumption of prejudice only in limited circumstances where the essential right to the assistance of counsel itself has been denied. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 692 (1984) (\u201cActual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally presumed to result in prejudice,\u201d as is \u201cstate interference with counsel\u2019s assistance\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659 &amp; n.25 (1984). In <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 692, the United States Supreme Court went on to identify one additional circumstance where \u201ca similar, though more limited, presumption of prejudice\u201d would apply: where \u201ccounsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.\u201d \u201cEven so, the rule is not quite the per se rule of prejudice that exists for the Sixth Amendment claims mentioned above [denial altogether and State interference with counsel]. Prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel \u2018actively represented conflicting interests\u2019 and that \u2018an actual conflict of interest adversely affected [the] lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>quoting <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 350 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">In contrast, in circumstances where ineffectiveness is based on \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, [it will] not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 691. \u201cThe purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691-692. While a jury empanelment closed to spectators (other than jurors) and the defendant\u2019s family may be a structural error, it will rarely have an \u201ceffect on the judgment,\u201d or undermine our \u201creliance on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 64 (1st Cir. 2007), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit presumed prejudice where a defendant advanced a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel\u2019s failure to object to a public trial structural error. The court reasoned that it would \u201cnot ask defendants to do what the Supreme Court has said is impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, to say that requiring a showing of prejudice forecloses the possibility of a remedy \u201cignore[s] \u2014 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>great cost to the public interest in the finality of verdicts \u2014 the established rule that public trial rights may be waived,\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. at 735 n.7, and that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel merit a new trial only where the error may have affected the verdict. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691. We do not agree with the reasoning of <em>Owens </em>in this context, and are more aligned with that of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>451 F.3d at 740-741, which has concluded that aside from the three exceptions noted in <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Cronic, </em>none of which is present here, the United States Supreme Court has instructed that prejudice must be shown in a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>491 Mich. at 673-674 (rejecting reasoning of <em>Owens </em>and adopting reasoning of <em>Purvis, </em>further noting that, \u201c[wjithout distinguishing a properly preserved structural error for which reversal is required from an error claimed as ineffective assistance of counsel, counsel can harbor error as an appellate parachute by failing to object to the closure of trial, thereby depriving the trial court of the opportunity to correct the error at the time it occurs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the above reasons, the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The defendant also filed two motions to revise and revoke his sentence, which were denied by the trial judge and affirmed by a panel of the Appeals Court in an unpublished decision pursuant to that court\u2019s rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Indeed, it would be anomalous if a waived claim reviewed on direct appeal under a substantial risk standard could be recast as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in which prejudice would be presumed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Although it may be difficult to demonstrate prejudice in the context of a closed jury empanelment process, we do not rule out that possibility, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>we recognize that the possibility is greater with respect to trial closures after jury empanelment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b882-7\">Duffly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV3\">(dissenting, with whom Lenk, J., joins). It is, as the court notes, \u201cwell settled that the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is structural,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 857, and that the public trial right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies as much to jury empanelment as to \u201cthe actual proof at trial.\u201d <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>558 U.S. 209, 212 (2010). Today\u2019s decision effectively forecloses vindication of this constitutional right on collateral review, even in cases where trial counsel has rendered constitutionally deficient performance in failing to object when the court room was closed, and neither the defendant nor his counsel knowingly waived his right to a public trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. 83, 88-89, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2356 (2013). Notwithstanding the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>a waiver of the public trial right in this case, the court holds that the defendant is foreclosed from seeking relief because he procedurally waived his claim of error when his trial attorney failed to object, and his appellate counsel did not raise the claim on direct appeal. See <em>id. </em>at 87 n.8 (distinguishing between waiver of right and waiver of claim of error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>397 Mass. 136, 140-142 (1986) (noting distinction between \u201ca procedural waiver of [defendant\u2019s] right to assert a constitutional claim\u201d in postconviction motion, and the knowing and intelligent \u201crelinquishment of the constitutional <em>right\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">As the court notes, the defendant did not raise the claim that his public trial right was violated until his third postconviction motion. The court recognizes that counsel\u2019s failure to object was constitutionally deficient performance, but nonetheless affirms the denial of the defendant\u2019s claim of structural error by invoking concepts of finality and judicial efficiency to support what it describes to be \u201cour well-established waiver jurisprudence that \u2018a defendant must raise a claim of error at the first available opportunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. 96, 102 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 294 (2002). I respectfully disagree that the principles of finality and judicial efficiency must be invoked. Where, as here, the court room was closed without a determination that such closure was justified according to <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46 (1984) <em>(Waller), </em>a defendant has not waived his constitutional right to a public trial, and defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would invoke the principle that \u201cevery right, when withheld, must have a remedy.\u201d <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Under the court\u2019s analysis, henceforth, in any case in which trial counsel fails to object to a court room closure, either because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>of a lack of experience or knowledge, or other \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), a defendant will have no meaningful opportunity to raise such a claim on collateral review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is necessarily so because, in order to obtain relief, a defendant would need to show either (1) that his procedurally waived claim of error resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, which requires a showing of prejudice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 298 (2002), or (2) that his counsel\u2019s representation was constitutionally ineffective, which also requires a showing of prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the very nature of a right to which presumptive prejudice attaches \u2014 such as the right to an open court \u2014 is that a showing of prejudice is not possible. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>Waller, supra </em>at 49 n.9, quoting <em>United States ex rel. Bennett </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>419 F.2d 599, 608 (3d Cir. 1969) (\u201ca requirement that prejudice be shown would \u2018in most cases deprive [the defendant] of the [public-trial] guarantee, for it would be difficult to envisage a case in which he would have evidence available of specific injury\u2019 \u201d). It is nonsensical to impose upon a defendant the requirement to establish that trial counsel\u2019s failure deprived him of an otherwise available substantial line of defense where the structural nature of the public trial right makes such a showing impossible in practice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Requiring that prejudice be shown in these circumstances disregards the fundamental purpose of the right to a public trial. The violation of the public trial right is structural error that \u201crequire[s] automatic reversal without a showing of actual harm,\u201d because it \u201cnecessarily renderfs] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petetabella, </em>459 Mass. 177, 183 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>457 Mass. 152, 163 (2010). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>456 Mass. 94, 118-119 (2010) (where jury selection procedure violated public trial right, error was structural and therefore no inquiry conducted \u201cas to whether it prejudiced the defendant\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. 432, 435 (1969) (reversing conviction based on violation of right to public trial, and holding \u201cshowing of prejudice is not necessary\u201d). This is because the benefits of a public trial, while significant, are nonetheless \u201cfrequently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance, [but] the Framers plainly thought them nonetheless real.\u201d <em>Waller, supra </em>at 49 n.9. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>85 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 496 (2014) (\u201cA closure during jury selection undermines the values of openness because the public loses the opportunity for assurance that those chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>decide the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence will do so fairly\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Downey, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 224, 229 (2010) (\u201cBecause we place such value on the right to public trial and because it is virtually impossible to demonstrate concrete harm flowing from a violation of that right, a violation relieves the defendant of the need to show prejudice in order to obtain a new trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">As structural error, the violation of the right to a public trial is in a category distinct from trial errors, such as the improper admission of evidence, from which specific harm may be seen to flow. Structural errors stand apart from trial errors because structural errors \u201caffect[ ] the framework within which the trial proceeds\u201d and thereby \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards,\u201d whereas trial errors \u201coccur during the presentation of the case to the jury,\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 291, 307-308, 309-310 (1991). Because a structural defect affects the framework in which a trial proceeds, looking for prejudice flowing from structural error is \u201ca speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 150 (2006). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamere, </em>327 Mont. 115, 124 (2005) (structural defects are presumptively prejudicial because they \u201ccannot be qualitatively or quantitatively weighed against the admissible evidence introduced at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The court diminishes the significance of the public trial right when it concludes that finality trumps a defendant\u2019s right to seek a postaffirmance remedy for an unpreserved public trial claim, a conclusion we have not reached for other unpreserved claims of error. Notably, we have granted a new trial on collateral review without requiring a showing of prejudice, twenty years after the conviction, where a defendant raised an unpreserved claim of error implicating a structural defect in jury instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 342, 349 (1995).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And, although a defendant who raises an unpreserved claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>error implicating his public trial right is now effectively foreclosed from collateral review, a defendant who raises an unpreserved trial error retains the possibility of reversal if he can show that the error resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>447 Mass. 161, 163 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 119 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>380 Mass. 821, 826 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmarin, </em>378 Mass. 474, 477 (1979). Permitting relief for unpreserved trial errors and some unpreserved structural errors, but not for errors implicating the public trial right, introduces unjustified disparity into our jurisprudence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. 728, 735 n.7 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2693 (2012) (rejecting option that \u201cwould give less protection to waived constitutional rights than to ordinary claims of unpreserved errors\u201d). Cf. Burns, Insurmountable Obstacles: Structural Errors, Procedural Default, and Ineffective Assistance, 64 Stan. L. Rev. 727, 749-750 (2012) (allowing relief for unpreserved trial errors but foreclosing relief for unpreserved structural errors \u201cwould be absurd if the Court were to come right out and say that this is the rule, given the general agreement. . . that most structural errors are quite serious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The court looks to <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 542 (1976),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 743 (11th Cir.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>denied sub nom. <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>549 U.S. 1035 (2006), for support, but these cases rely on comity concerns in the context of conducting Federal habeas review of a State conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Concerns of comity are wholly inapplicable here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, </em>466 Mass. 422, 433 n.16 (2013) (\u201cComity refers to the [United States] Supreme Court\u2019s policy against excessive interference by Federal habeas courts in State criminal convictions that had become final,\u201d and has \u201clittle application to collateral review by State courts themselves\u201d). Where comity concerns are inapplicable, this court, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and some courts in other jurisdictions have not required a showing of prejudice to reverse a conviction on collateral review based on an unpreserved claim of structural error. See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 64 (1st Cir. 2007); <em>Littlejohn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>73 A.3d 1034, 1043 (D.C. 2013);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 342, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>I agree with the analysis in <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Johnson </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>586 F.3d 439, 447 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 87 (2010); and <em>Littlejohn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>73 A.3d at 1043. Each of these cases rejects the proposition that <em>Strickland </em>requires that a defendant must establish prejudice in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim in all but the three circumstances listed in <em>Strickland. </em>As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stated in <em>Littlejohn </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1043:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of three instances in which the violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is presumptively prejudicial \u2014 (1) actual or constructive denial of counsel; (2) state interference with counsel\u2019s assistance; and (3) counsel operating under a conflict of interest, <em>Strickland, [supra </em>at 692] \u2014 is not necessarily an exclusive list of the rare occasions when prejudice may be presumed. Requiring [a defendant] to prove actual prejudice as a result of trial counsel\u2019s waiver of his public trial right would be inconsistent with the [United States] Supreme Court\u2019s holdings that prejudice is presumed when the constitutional error is a structural defect, one that \u2018infect[s] the entire trial process.\u2019 <em>Brecht </em>v. <em>Abrahamson, </em>[507 U.S. 619, 630 (1993)]; see also <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>[548 U.S. at 148-149]; <em>Sullivan </em>[v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 281 (1993)]; <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>[499 U.S. at 309-310], If it is impossible to identify the prejudice resulting from a structural defect, it is likewise impossible to determine whether counsel\u2019s waiver of such a \u2018basic protection,\u2019 like the public trial guarantee, \u2018had no effect on the judgment.\u2019 <em>Strickland, [supra </em>at 691].\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The court also cites with approval a concern articulated by another State appellate court that \u201ccounsel can harbor error as an appellate parachute by failing to object to the closure of trial, thereby depriving the trial court of the opportunity to correct the error at the time it occurs.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>491 Mich. 642, 673-674 (2012). I do not accept the court\u2019s assumption that a defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who was aware of the removal of the defendant\u2019s family members from the court room, would engage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>in conduct that fails to respect the duty of zealous representation owed to a client. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.3 &amp; comment 1A, 426 Mass. 1313 (1998). Cf. <em>Littlejohn </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1046 &amp; n.2 (Pryor, J., dissenting), citing D.C. R. Prof. C. 1.3 comment 1 (2007). The court\u2019s view rests on the assumption that appellate counsel could establish that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was not a tactical decision. Cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 233, 250 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u201ca prisoner would properly be held to have intentionally relinquished his right to raise the constitutional claim if he failed to raise it for tactical reasons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that prejudice should be presumed where there is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on counsel\u2019s failure to object to a court room closure, and respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">When a court room is closed but a defendant has waived his right to a public trial, there is no violation of the right. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 649-650 (1997). The waiver of a right occurs only where a litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>intentionally relinquishes that right. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. 83, 87, n.8, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2356 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>397 Mass. 136, 140-142 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 224, 229-230 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">There is no suggestion that either the defendant or his counsel intended to relinquish the public trial right because both the defendant and his counsel were unaware that the public trial right applied during jury empanelment. In such circumstances, where it is not consistent with the prevailing professional norms at the time of trial, the failure to object may constitute deficient performance falling below what is to be expected of an ordinary, fallible lawyer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. 96, 103 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>447 Mass. 635, 641 (2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 943 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The court\u2019s decision to foreclose relief for unpreserved claims of error regarding the public trial right is limited to the context of collateral review in which this case arises. The decision rests on an interest in promoting finality, an interest which arises only after a conviction has been affirmed on direct appeal, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 637 (1997), and does not address the question of possible remedies on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In circumstances such as those present here, the standard of review for ineffective assistance claims is not \u201cessentially the same\u201d as the standard of review for claims of unpreserved trial error. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) (new trial where counsel\u2019s deficient performance deprives defendant of otherwise available substantial ground of defense), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 646 (new trial where waived claim of error results in substantial risk of miscarriage of justice). In most circumstances, however, because application of either standard will lead to the same result, we review under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard and, in so doing, obviate the need to conduct a separate review under the <em>Saferian </em>standard. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 686-687 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 31 &amp; n.12 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624 n.4 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Here, by contrast, the circumstances are precisely those in which the substantial risk standard and the <em>Saferian </em>standard diverge. I agree that where a defendant raises a waived claim of error regarding the public trial right without asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must establish a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and will not be entitled to a presumption of prejudice. But I would hold that a defendant is entitled to a presumption of prejudice where a defendant raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and has established that, in failing to object to a court room closure, counsel\u2019s performance fell below that of an ordinary, fallible attorney. The distinction between preserved and waived claims of error is therefore maintained: a defendant who has preserved a claim that his public trial right was violated is entitled to reversal, whereas a defendant who has waived the claim of error is not entitled to reversal unless he establishes that, in failing to object, his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below the standard of an ordinary, fallible lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The court states that it does not rule out the possibility that a defendant could show prejudice resulting from violation of the right to a public trial, <em>ante </em>at note 3, but a showing of prejudice is inconsistent with classification of the public trial right as structural. Moreover, the court does not suggest how a defendant might show such prejudice, and the effect of its holding is that there will be no \u201coccasion to review\u201d unpreserved claims of error predicated on the public trial right on collateral review. No other court that has considered this issue appears to have suggested that a showing of prejudice resulting from a court room closure would be possible. See, e.g., <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 741 (11th Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>549 U.S. 1035 (2006); <em>Reid </em>v. <em>State, </em>286 Ga. 484, 488 (2010); <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>491 Mich. 642 (2012); <em>State </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>784 P.2d 153, 157 (Utah 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">In the context of direct appeal, we have reversed convictions on the basis of unpreserved claims of error where we have recognized that a showing of prejudice would be impossible.

L. Rev. 727, 732 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The court relies on <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 542 (1976) <em>(Francis), </em>to support its statement that \u201c[t]he structural nature of the underlying error does <em>not </em>automatically <em>excuse the </em>defendant <em>from </em>showing prejudice when advancing an unpreserved claim.\u201d In <em>Francis, supra </em>at 537-538, 542, the United States Supreme Court considered a State prisoner\u2019s petition for Federal habeas corpus relief based on a claim of error for which prejudice was presumed; the Court denied relief because the State court had deemed the claim waived pursuant to its own procedural rules. The claim did not concern the public trial right, but, rather, concerned racial bias in the composition of the grand jury. The <em>Francis </em>opinion does not discuss the possibility of ineffective assistance of counsel (indeed the opinion predated <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 [1984]), nor did it grapple with the issue that for certain types of error, it will be impossible for a defendant to show prejudice. See <em>Francis, supra </em>at 552 (Brennan, J., dissenting) <em>(Francis </em>Court\u2019s imposition of requirement to show actual prejudice \u201cwithout the slightest veneer of reasoning\u201d shields the obvious); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 64 n.14 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining limited persuasive value of <em>Francis).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The court also cites <em>Virgil </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>446 F.3d 598 (5th Cir. 2006), which likewise arose in the context of Federal habeas review of a State conviction. I disagree with the court\u2019s view that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded in that case that structural error is insufficient to warrant a presumption of prejudice in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The circuit court determined that trial counsel rendered deficient performance in failing to object to the seating of two jurors who stated they would not be fair and impartial, and that the seating of such jurors sufficed to establish prejudice under the <em>Strickland </em>standard. <em>Id. </em>at 613-614. Having determined that counsel\u2019s errors resulted in prejudice, the circuit court did not conduct a determinative analysis as to whether prejudice may be presumed for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on structural error. The circuit court simply stated, \u201cwe <em>do not hold </em>that a structural error alone is sufficient to warrant a presumption of prejudice in the ineffective assistance of counsel context\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 607.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Even where comity concerns are applicable, some circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals have presumed prejudice on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on counsel\u2019s failure to raise structural error at trial.
