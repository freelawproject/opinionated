Thomas, used a cigarette lighter to set fire to a curtain in the first-floor apartment of a three-story house in Brockton (house). The fire quickly spread from the first floor to the upstairs apartments. Olinda Calderon, a resident in the third-floor apartment, died in the fire, and several residents and guests in the second- and third-floor apartments were injured. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation, arson of a dwelling house, and the attempted murder of thirteen persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the judge erred in denying, except in small part, her motion to suppress the statements she made to police on July 6 and 7, 2006,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arose from the admission in evidence of the defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to counsel at the commencement of her July 6 interview. We conclude that the judge erred in denying the motion to suppress the July 6 interview and the part of the July 7 interview that preceded the defendant\u2019s booking, but correctly denied the motion with respect to the defendant\u2019s postbooking confession. We also conclude that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the convictions of murder in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and attempted murder, but was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the conviction of arson of a dwelling house. We therefore vacate the attempted murder convictions, affirm the conviction of arson of a dwelling house, and, with respect to the conviction of murder in the first degree, give the Commonwealth the option of either accepting a reduction of the verdict to felony-murder in the second degree or having the conviction vacated and proceeding with a new trial on the murder indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Background. </em>Because the sufficiency of the evidence is not at issue, we summarize briefly the evidence at trial. At the time of the fire, the defendant was a twenty-two year old homeless woman. Michelle Johnson rented and resided in the first-floor apartment of the house, which was a \u201cplace to buy [\u2018crack\u2019 cocaine]\u201d and a known \u201cdrug house.\u201d The defendant\u2019s boy friend, Cornelius Brown, and the defendant were among the persons allowed to stay in the apartment with Johnson, but before the fire, Johnson told the defendant to move out of the apartment. The defendant was angry with Johnson for preventing her from living with Brown, and repeatedly threatened to kill Johnson and bum the house down. The defendant returned to the house on multiple occasions and broke the windows of the first-floor apartment by throwing rocks and bricks at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On June 27, 2006, a police officer saw the defendant walking on the porch of the house while holding a small paring knife. The police officer directed her to leave, but she continued to return. On July 3, police officers again saw her outside the house, where she had been arguing with Brown. A neighbor who lived across the street and witnessed the argument observed the defendant break one of the windows of the house and heard her yell, \u201cI\u2019ll be back to torch the place,\u201d and, \u201cIf I\u2019m not going to have a home, you\u2019re not going to have one.\u201d That day, Johnson threw a bottle at the defendant upon finding her sitting on the porch of the house, an act that enraged the defendant, especially when Brown failed to come to her defense. After that incident, the police warned the defendant not to return to the house, but she returned later that evening, and was arrested for trespassing. She was required to appear in court on July 5 to be arraigned on this charge, but defaulted, and a warrant issued for her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On the evening of July 5, the defendant visited the home of her friend, Veronica Copeland. The defendant was upset and high from smoking crack cocaine, drinking alcohol, and taking Klonopin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>medication. At or around midnight, the defendant drove Copeland\u2019s vehicle to the house without her permission, but Copeland followed her there and drove her back to Copeland\u2019s home. At 12:30 a.m. on July 6, the defendant telephoned Johnson and told her that she hated her, that she thought Johnson was engaging in a sexual relationship with Brown, and that she was going to \u201cmess [her] up.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant later took a bicycle from Copeland\u2019s home and rode back to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Later that morning, the neighbor who lived across the street from the house was awakened by a traffic accident that occurred outside the house at approximately 4:50 a.m. At daybreak, the neighbor saw the defendant approach the house on foot and reach her hand into the second window on the first floor of the left side of the house. The neighbor then saw a reddish-orange glow from the first-floor windows, went outside, and saw the defendant running away from the house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The fire spread quickly through the three apartments. All who were on the first floor escaped without injury, but the family on the second floor and their two guests were trapped by the flames. The adults threw the children out of a window into the waiting arms of a good Samaritan who had stopped to provide assistance, and later jumped out of the window themselves, sustaining serious injuries when they hit the ground. The four residents of the third-floor apartment also were trapped. Three people, including a one month old baby girl, were rescued by fire fighters and survived; the fourth, Calderon, the mother of the baby, was pulled by a fire fighter from the bathroom where she had sought refuge but died at the hospital from smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The police questioned the defendant on July 6 and 7, 2006, and arrested her during the interrogation on July 7. The video recordings of these interviews were admitted in evidence and played in their entirety at trial. On July 6 and initially on July 7, the defendant denied setting the fire, but after she was arrested and booked on the charges of murder and arson of a dwelling house, she admitted that she had \u201cset the fire\u201d with \u201cjust a lighter\u201d by placing the flame on the curtain in \u201cthe second window.\u201d The defendant said that she did not know why she did it, but that her \u201cintentions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>were never to hurt anybody.\u201d Her description of her conduct was consistent with the observations of the neighbor who had seen her reach her hand into a window of the house, and with the fire investigation, which determined that the cause of the fire was incendiary, that the origin of the fire was the rear bedroom of the house, and that no accelerant had been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant moved to suppress the statements she made on July 6 and 7, claiming violation of her right against self-incrimination and her right to counsel under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. A judge in the Superior Court, who was not the trial judge, conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion, and made the following relevant findings of fact, which we supplement where necessary with evidence in the record that is uncontroverted and that was implicitly credited by the motion judge, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008), and with the video recordings of the interviews of the defendant, which were admitted in evidence at the motion hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On the morning of July 6, the Brockton police department and the State police began investigating the fire as a possible arson. They soon learned that the defendant had been in a feud with a resident of the house. Brockton police Detective Michael Schaaf, who was assigned that day to \u201cwarrant apprehension,\u201d was asked to locate her. Detective Schaaf knew the defendant, and had arrested her for outstanding warrants on seven prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The defendant knew that she had an outstanding default warrant arising from her arrest for trespassing at the house on July 3, because she had failed to appear for her arraignment on July 5. She also believed that the police were looking for her as a suspect in connection with the fire that morning. Accompanied by Copeland, she went to the Brockton District Court to clear up her warrant and obtain an attorney. At approximately 12:50 p.m. on July 6, she was in the court house lobby near the Department of Probation office when Detective Schaaf approached her and told her that detectives wanted to speak with her at the police station about the fire. The defendant told him that she had an arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>warrant she was trying to clear up, and the detective replied that the police would \u201ctake care of\u2019 the warrant for her. The defendant agreed to go to the station with him. He did not place the defendant under arrest, handcuff her, or frisk her for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">a. <em>July 6 interview. </em>The defendant was taken to an interview room at the police station, where she was met by State police Trooper John Sylva and Brockton police Detective Dominic Persampieri at 1:53 p.m. The defendant agreed to have her interview recorded, and a video recording was made of the interview. Trooper Sylva read the Miranda warnings form to the defendant and showed her the printed warnings as he read them. After asking her if she understood these rights, the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand .... If I said anything, \u2018okay, don\u2019t want to talk to you guys,\u2019 \u2019cause that wouldn\u2019t happen, right?\u201d Trooper Sylva replied, \u201cWell, that\u2019s your right. If you want to contact a lawyer, you can always have a lawyer present when you talk to us.\u201d The defendant then asked, \u201cAnd I\u2019d have to sit here and wait for a lawyer, and probably be held and all that, right?\u201d Trooper Sylva said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. You do have ... an outstanding warrant.\u201d The defendant said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean.\u201d Trooper Sylva replied, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s a separate matter. You were arrested because you had a warrant.\u201d The defendant told him that she had not been arrested, stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here in cuffs.\u201d She said, \u201cSchaaf came to get me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The following conversation then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">Trooper Sylva: \u201c[Bjefore we proceed any further, I just want you to decide whether you want to speak with us regarding an incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">Defendant: \u201cI\u2019d rather have a lawyer, because . . . I\u2019m accused [of] starting a fire ... [a] major fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">Trooper Sylva: \u201c[W]e didn\u2019t bring anything up to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">Defendant: \u201cNo, I\u2019m bringing it up, \u2019cause I know what I\u2019m here for. . . . And I know what I done, but . . . I\u2019m not a fire-starter. I did not do that, man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">Trooper Sylva: \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying to me is that you do not want to . . . talk to us, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">Defendant: \u201cI want to talk, but I don\u2019t wanna talk unless I got somebody present who . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Detective Persampieri: \u201cDo you want an attorney? Yes or no?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak4\">Defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">Detective Persampieri: \u201cOkay. End ... of conversation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">After this invocation of her right to an attorney, Detective Persampieri left the room, leaving the door open, and the defendant asked, \u201cAm I being held, or do I have bail?\u201d Trooper Sylva replied that that would be decided by the courts because the warrant had to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Detective Persampieri then reentered the room. He stood at the table where the defendant was seated and, facing the camera, asked, \u201cIs that off?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He then looked down at the defendant and told her, \u201c[U]nderstand one thing. Once you leave here, . . . [wje\u2019re gonna do our investigation, and it\u2019s gonna get a lot hotter. . . . [W]hat we\u2019re trying to tell you, we\u2019re gonna give you the opportunity to tell us your side of the story. Okay?\u201d The defendant said, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s why I wanted to stay here,\u201d but, before leaving the room again, the detective interrupted her and said, \u201cSorry. You already lawyered up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The defendant remained seated at the table and stated, \u201cI\u2019m real confused here.\u201d Brockton police Detective Jackie Congdon, who was nearby but off camera, asked her why she was confused. The defendant became visibly upset and said that she had never been in this position before, where she was being accused of starting a fire. The detective asked, \u201cIf you\u2019re not an arsonist, then you\u2019d have no problem with us taking that shirt from you?\u201d The defendant became visibly upset and said that she had no problem with giving her shirt to the police, adding, \u201cYou can have anything. You can touch anything on me.\u201d Detective Congdon then said, \u201cYou had your chance, you just lawyered up.\u201d The conversation continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">Defendant: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. . . well, but I don\u2019t ... I, I mean that if I could go back so there\u2019s no way I can say no at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">There\u2019s no way I can say, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m gonna give my story?\u2019 \u2019[Cjause I\u2019m confused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">Detective Congdon: \u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">Defendant: \u201cI want to tell my story, but I\u2019m not sure, do you understand what I\u2019m trying to say .... I\u2019ve never been in this position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Detective Congdon: \u201cWell, we can\u2019t talk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Defendant: \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if I need lawyer help or not. And now that he ... what did he, he just said now, I have my chance to tell my story. I, I would rather do it like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">Detective Congdon: \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re asking .... So you want to give up your right to have a lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Defendant: \u201cYes. \u2019Cause I don\u2019t know what .... All this confusion .... I\u2019m confused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Detective Congdon asked if the defendant would rather have her (Detective Congdon) in the interview, and the defendant said she would. Off camera, Detective Congdon then told Trooper Sylva and Detective Persampieri that the defendant wanted to talk with her. Detective Persampieri asked, \u201cShe just wants you?\u201d referring to Detective Congdon. The defendant stated, \u201cI just said I would feel comfortable with her being around,\u201d and added, \u201cWhen you said I had my chance, though, when you said that I had my . . . .\u201d Detective Persampieri interrupted her and asked, \u201cDo you want to talk with us?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Trooper Sylva and Detective Persampieri then returned to the room, and Detective Congdon told the defendant that she would be outside the room if the defendant needed anything. Trooper Sylva again read her the Miranda rights, and the defendant signed the waiver form. In the ensuing conversation, the defendant denied setting the fire, but made many incriminating admissions regarding her whereabouts in the hours before and immediately after the fire, the details of her feud with Johnson (including her admission that she smashed the windows of the house), the intensity of her animosity toward Johnson, her tumultuous romantic relationship with Brown and her jealousy regarding his purported sexual infidelity, and her disappointment that he had not sided with her in the feud with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The interview continued until 4:40 p.m. When the interview ended, Trooper Sylva stated, \u201cWe gotta put you through the system.\u201d The defendant asked, \u201cI should be able to go right back to the court house right now, right?\u201d Trooper Sylva told her the court house was closing, and he did not know if there was time to get her back there. The defendant was held in custody at the police station overnight on the default warrant for the July 3 trespass charge, and was not brought to court until the next morning, at which time she was released on personal recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>We review de novo any findings of the motion judge that were based entirely on the documentary evidence, i.e., the recorded interviews of the defendant. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>We accept other findings that were based on testimony at the evidentiary hearing and do not disturb them where they are not clearly erroneous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. 199, 205 (2011). However, we \u201cmake an independent determination as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The defendant clearly and unequivocally invoked her right to counsel at the beginning of the interview, when she declared that she did not want to answer questions without an attorney present. The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 481-482 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cIn <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966),] the Court determined that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 prohibition against compelled self-incrimination required that custodial interrogation be preceded by advice to the putative defendant that he has the right to remain silent and also the right to the presence of an attorney. . . . The Court also indicated the procedures to be followed subsequent to the warnings. If the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u2018the interrogation must cease.\u2019 If he requests counsel, \u2018the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 474.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The Court held that \u201cwhen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 484. \u201c[A]n accused, . . . having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-485.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The motion judge concluded that the prohibition in <em>Edwards </em>did not apply because the defendant was not in custody when she invoked her right to counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. \u201cIn assessing whether a defendant was in \u2018custody\u2019 for purposes of the Miranda require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ments, \u2018[t]he crucial question is whether, considering all the circumstances, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he was in custody. . . . Thus, if the defendant reasonably believed that he was not free to leave, the interrogation occurred while the defendant was in custody, and Miranda warnings were required.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. 597, 609 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 173 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, </em>422 Mass. 10, 13 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">When the defendant was taken from the court house to the police station for questioning, the defendant knew that a default warrant had issued for her arrest because she had failed to appear at her arraignment. She informed Detective Schaaf that she was trying to address the outstanding warrant. A reasonable person in that position would recognize that, when there is an outstanding warrant for a person\u2019s arrest, and when the person named in the warrant is at a police station in the company of detectives who know there is such a warrant, that person is not free to leave until she is brought before a judicial officer and released on bail or personal recognizance. The motion judge found that the defendant was not in custody until Trooper Sylva told her after she invoked her right to counsel that her warrant had to be addressed. But we conclude that a reasonable person in that position would have known that the warrant had to be addressed without being told so by a police officer, and would also have known that she could not be released until it had. Although the determination of custody rests on what a reasonable person in that position would believe, rather than on the subjective understanding of the interrogating police officer or the person being questioned, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>448 Mass. 304, 309 (2007), it is noteworthy that the police offcers who were questioning the defendant and the defendant herself understood that she was not free to leave until the warrant had been addressed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The motion judge appears to have rested his finding that the defendant was not in custody in large part on her insistence that she had not been arrested by Detective Schaaf and her statement, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here in cuffs.\u201d However, this does not suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>she believed (or, more importantly, that a reasonable person in her position would believe) that she was free to leave or that the police would not arrest her if she attempted to leave. Nor does it suggest that she went to the police station voluntarily. In fact, when Trooper Sylva asked her, \u201cYou came voluntarily?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo, Schaaf came to get me.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The motion judge also found that, \u201c[ejven if the defendant was in custody at the time she asked to speak with a lawyer, the <em>Edwards </em>rule was not violated,\u201d because \u201c[t]he defendant initiated her conversation with Detective Congdon after the other detectives had terminated the interview and left the room.\u201d While it is true that the defendant initiated a conversation with Detective Congdon by saying, \u201cI\u2019m real confused here,\u201d it is also true that the defendant stated her confusion only after Detective Persampieri told her, \u201cOnce you leave here,... [wje\u2019re gonna do our investigation, and it\u2019s gonna get a lot hotter. . . . [Wje\u2019re gonna give you the opportunity to tell us your side of the story,\u201d but, \u201cSorry. You . . . lawyered up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Detective Persampieri\u2019s statements were improper for two reasons.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, they were an attempt to persuade her to change her mind about her decision to invoke her right to counsel seconds after she had made that invocation. The invocation of the right to counsel, like the invocation of the right to silence, is part of the \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d that must be \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d by law enforcement. <em>Michigan </em>v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 103-104 (1975), quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474, 479. The police may not fail to honor the right of a person in custody to cut off questioning \u201cby persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind.\u201d <em>Mosley, supra </em>at 102, 105-106. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 112 (2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 352 (2012), quoting <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 534 n.5 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment) (\u201cwhere the initial request to invoke the right to remain silent is clear..., \u2018the police may not create ambiguity in a defendant\u2019s desire by continuing to question him or her about it\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Second, Detective Persampieri\u2019s failure scrupulously to honor the defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to counsel was aggravated by his statements suggesting that, by invoking her right to counsel and thereby ending the interview, she was losing her opportunity to tell her side of the story. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 267 (2004), we criticized an interrogation technique in which the police told the defendant that this would be his \u201conly opportunity\u201d to offer an explanation as to why he hit the victim. In <em>Novo, </em>the police persisted in \u201cthis now-or-never theme,\u201d and went on to tell the defendant that, if he did not give them a reason for his conduct, \u201ca jury [were] never going to hear a reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 268. We concluded that this misrepresentation of the defendant\u2019s right to testify at trial was an \u201cegregious intrusion on rights that art. 12 declares to be fundamental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268-269. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 268 (2013) (\u201cdetectives\u2019 message that this was the defendant\u2019s \u2018last chance\u2019 to tell his story was a plain misstatement of the defendant\u2019s rights to present a defense\u201d). Here, the detective did not expressly tell the defendant that, by having \u201clawyered up,\u201d she was losing her chance to tell her story to the jury. But we conclude that the message he implicitly communicated to her was unfair and misleading even if she understood him to mean that she was losing her chance to tell her story to law enforcement officers. We recognize that we stated in <em>Novo, supra </em>at 269 n.5, that the \u201cofficers in [that] case might have properly (and truthfully) told [the defendant], \u2018This is your only chance to talk to us,\u2019 or, \u2018This is your only opportunity to tell your story to us so that we can help you.\u2019 \u201d On further reflection, we declare now that these statements, too, are improper where a suspect has invoked her right to counsel. There is nothing that would bar a suspect, after consulting with counsel, from deciding to speak with the police, and there is no sound reason the police would refuse such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Detective Congdon\u2019s conversation with the defendant added to the defendant\u2019s confusion that Detective Persampieri\u2019s words had elicited. After the defendant told her she did not start fires and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>agreed to the detective\u2019s request to hand over her shirt, Detective Congdon said, \u201cYou had your chance, you just lawyered up,\u201d reiterating Detective Persampieri\u2019s warning that she had lost her \u201cchance\u201d to explain what happened by invoking her right to counsel. The potency of Detective Persampieri\u2019s improper persuasion was apparent from the words the defendant spoke as she decided whether to revisit her invocation of counsel: \u201cI want to tell my story,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know if I need lawyer help or not,\u201d and \u201che just said now, I have my chance to tell my story,\u201d so \u201cI would rather do it like that.\u201d In other words, she reasoned that she knew she wanted to tell her story but she was not sure whether she needed the assistance of a lawyer, so she decided to tell her story without counsel lest she lose her opportunity to do so. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. 262, 273 (1994) (police did not engage in \u201cany type of prodding designed to elicit inculpatory statements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u201cWhen a defendant invokes his right to counsel, all subsequent statements are inadmissible unless counsel is provided or the Commonwealth can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cinitiate[d] further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police . . . and thereby waived his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 151 (2011), quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485. Where, as here, the defendant\u2019s initiation of conversation with a detective was triggered by another detective\u2019s attempt to persuade her that she was making a mistake by \u201clawyer[ing] up,\u201d and that, by doing so, she was losing her chance to tell her version of what happened, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant waived her right to counsel. Because the police officers here did not scrupulously honor the defendant\u2019s right to cut off questioning until she had the benefit of counsel, and instead sought to persuade her to change her mind by suggesting that \u201clawyering up\u201d was costing her the opportunity to tell her side of the story, we conclude that the continuation of the questioning on July 6 violated the <em>Edwards </em>rule and that the statements the defendant made that day in response to that questioning should have been suppressed. See <em>Hoyt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">b. <em>July 7 interviews. </em>The motion judge found that, at the arraignment on the trespass charge on the morning of July 7, counsel was appointed for the defendant on that charge and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>was released on personal recognizance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That day, the police learned that Calderon had died from her injuries in the fire and that a neighbor had identified the defendant as the person the neighbor saw putting a hand into a broken window at the house. Detective Schaaf was again directed to find the defendant, and he located her in Brockton at approximately 3 p.m. He told the defendant that the police wanted to speak with her again at the station. The defendant was \u201ca little upset\u201d and \u201cannoyed\u201d about returning to the station, but she was \u201ccompliant\u201d and allowed Detective Schaaf to drive her there. The defendant waited nearly three hours at the station with officers by her side before she was interviewed again by Trooper Sylva and Detective Persampieri at approximately 6 p.m. There, she was again given the Miranda warnings and again waived her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Trooper Sylva told the defendant that \u201c[sjomebody died in that fire\u201d and that they had \u201ceyewitness accounts of what happened.\u201d He told her about \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d and urged her to present her side of the story. When Detective Persampieri asked her to tell them what happened, she said she had already told them what happened, and stated, \u201cI\u2019m not changing nothing.\u201d When asked by Trooper Sylva, \u201cYou\u2019re going stick with the same story you told us yesterday . . . ?\u201d she answered, \u201cYeah.\u201d In the approximately thirty minutes before she was arrested and booked on the charges of murder and arson of a dwelling house, she did not change her story and continued to deny setting the fire.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The interrogation concluded at approximately 6:25 p.m., after which the defendant was handcuffed and taken downstairs for booking. Neither Trooper Sylva nor Detective Persampieri accompanied her to booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Booking began at 6:27 p.m. State police Trooper Scott McGrath, who was not involved in the defendant\u2019s investigation, was present with the defendant during part of the booking procedure. While the defendant was being booked, she turned to the trooper and told him, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person.\u201d The judge found that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>was a spontaneous statement by the defendant. The trooper replied that he did not think she was a bad person, and told her that, if she wanted to return upstairs and speak with Trooper Sylva and Detective Persampieri, she could. He asked her if she wanted to explain to them what happened, and the defendant said, \u201cI do want to speak with them again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">At 6:49 p.m., the defendant returned to the interview room and met again with Trooper Sylva and Detective Persampieri. After she again was read her Miranda rights and waived them, Trooper Sylva asked, \u201cLet\u2019s hear the real story. What happened?\u201d The defendant then admitted that she set the fire at the house. She explained that she set fire to a curtain in the window on the left side of the house, using \u201c[jjust a lighter\u201d and then went to a friend\u2019s house to tell her the house was burning. She said she had no \u201cintentions of it getting that big,\u201d and that she never had meant to hurt anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The motion judge found that the entirety of the July 7 interview was custodial, and that the defendant made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of her Miranda rights. He also found that, apart from the four-minute segment of the interview during which she was praying, her statements were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge also found that, even if there had been an <em>Edwards </em>violation in the July 6 interview, there was no such violation in the July 7 interview. To reach this conclusion, the judge determined, first, that the <em>Edwards </em>rule did not bar the police from initiating the July 7 interview, and, second, that any <em>Edwards </em>violation on July 6 did not taint any part of the July 7 interview. We come to a different view and conclude that the July 7 prebooking interview must be suppressed because it was conducted in violation of the <em>Edwards </em>rule, as that rule was later interpreted in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98 (2010), but the July 7 postbooking confession need not be suppressed because it was initiated by the defendant and was free from any taint arising from either the July 6 or the July 7 <em>Edwards </em>violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">i. <em>July </em>7 <em>prebooking interview. </em>In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the motion judge ruled that after a defendant invokes her right to counsel, the <em>Edwards </em>rule requires suppression of a subsequent, police-initiated statement only where the defendant is in continuous custody from the time of the invocation to the time of the police initiation of interrogation. At the time of his decision on February 27, 2009, this was a correct statement of law under our controlling precedent. See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Galford, </em>413 Mass. 364, 370-371 (1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1065 (1993) (under Federal law, \u201cwhere there is a break in custody, <em>Edwards </em>does not require that a subsequent statement be excluded,\u201d because \u201c[w]hen a defendant is released from custody, the coercive effect of custody disappears\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge then determined that the <em>Edwards </em>rule did not apply to the July 7 interview because there had been a break in the defendant\u2019s custody between her release by the District Court on the morning of July 7 and her return to the police station with Detective Schaaf later that day at approximately 3 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">However, during the defendant\u2019s trial, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Shatter, supra, </em>which addressed whether the <em>Edwards </em>rule applies after a break in custody. In <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. at 100-101, the defendant, who was in prison on an unrelated conviction, was questioned by police regarding a sexual abuse allegation. The defendant invoked his right to counsel, which ended the interview. Two and one-half years later, the police again interviewed the defendant in prison regarding these same allegations; this time, the defendant waived his Miranda rights and spoke with police without counsel being present. <em>Id. </em>at 101. In affirming the motion judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Supreme Court established a bright-line rule that, when there is a custodial invocation of the right to counsel followed by a break in custody, the <em>Edwards </em>rule applies for a period of fourteen days from the break in custody. <em>Id. </em>at 110. The Court determined that a fourteen-day period would provide \u201cplenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Here, where the police initiated the prebooking interview on July 7, only one day after the defendant had invoked her right to counsel and on the afternoon of her release from custody that morning, it is plain that the interview violated <em>Edwards </em>if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>bright-line rule established in <em>Shatzer </em>applies to cases pending on direct review or not yet final when <em>Shatzer </em>was decided. We conclude that the new rule declared in <em>Shatzer </em>regarding the application of <em>Edwards </em>applies on direct review in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328 (1987), the Supreme Court declared that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d See <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 304 (1989). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>466 Mass. 676, 679 (2013) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that new decisional law must be applied to criminal prosecutions that are not yet final when the decision is issued\u201d). The Commonwealth acknowledges that <em>Shatzer </em>was decided while the defendant was on trial and that its new rule is being considered in the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, but claims that the rule should not be applied here because the Supreme Court intended it only to be applied to interrogations that commenced after the issuance of the opinion. The Court did not declare in <em>Shatzer </em>that its fourteen-day bright-line rule was to be applied only to future interrogations, but the Commonwealth argues that its intent to do so can be inferred from the opinion. The Commonwealth notes that the Court in <em>Shatzer </em>stated that the <em>Edwards </em>rule itself \u201cis not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed prophylaxis\u201d whose \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d is to preserve the integrity of a defendant\u2019s choice to speak with police only in the presence of counsel, but with the \u201cincidental effect\u201d of conserving judicial resources that would otherwise be expended in making difficult determinations of voluntariness. <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. at 105-106. And the Commonwealth also points out that the Court declared that it was taking the \u201cunusual\u201d step of setting forth \u201cprecise time limits governing police action,\u201d because \u201claw enforcement officers need to know, with certainty and beforehand, when renewed interrogation is lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We recognize that the law enforcement officers who questioned the defendant on July 7, 2006, could not have known, \u201cwith certainty and beforehand,\u201d that they must wait at least fourteen days after a break in custody before initiating questioning of a suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>who had invoked her right to counsel under <em>Edwards. </em>But we do not agree with the Commonwealth that the Supreme Court intended the rule to be applied only to interrogations that occurred subsequent to its opinion in <em>Shatzer </em>where it did not so declare and where it did not suggest that the fourteen-day rule would not have applied to the defendant in <em>Shatzer </em>had his renewed interrogation occurred within that time frame. <em>Id. </em>at 117 (\u201cBecause Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at interrogation, <em>Edwards </em>does not mandate suppression of his March 2006 statements\u201d). Indeed, the Supreme Court applied the <em>Edwards </em>rule to a case pending on direct appeal when <em>Edwards </em>was decided. See <em>Shea </em>v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 51, 59 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Numerous appellate courts on direct review and trial courts deciding motions to suppress have applied the <em>Shatzer </em>rule to interrogations that were conducted before the <em>Shatzer </em>opinion was issued. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guzman, </em>603 F.3d 99, 106 (1st Cir. 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Linder, </em>759 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1143 (D.S.D. 2010); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wessells, </em>209 N.J. 395, 413 (2012). See also United States <em>vs. </em>McWhorter, U.S. Ct. App., Nos. 10-5939, 11-6228 (6th Cir. Feb. 20, 2013); United States vs. Samuel, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 09-CR-128A(Sr) (W.D.N.Y. July 14, 2010). We know of no case where any court has limited the application of <em>Shatzer </em>to interrogations conducted after the case was decided, and the Commonwealth has cited none.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Consequently, we conclude that the July 7 prebooking interview was conducted in violation of the <em>Edwards </em>rule, as interpreted in <em>Shatzer, </em>where the interview was conducted only one day after the defendant had invoked her right to counsel and only a few hours after she had been released from custody. The prebooking interview, therefore, must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">ii. <em>July 7 postbooking interview. </em>The July 7 postbooking interview was also conducted in violation of <em>Edwards </em>unless the defendant herself \u201cinitiate[d] further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police\u201d during booking by telling Trooper McGrath, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person.\u201d See <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485. In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1045 (1983) (plurality opinion), the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant who had invoked his right to counsel initiated communication with the police when he asked a police officer, \u201cWell, what is going to happen to me now?\u201d Justice Rehnquist, in a plurality opinion joined by three other justices, held that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>initiate a communication under <em>Edwards, </em>a defendant need only \u201crepresent a desire ... to open up a more generalized discussion relating directly or indirectly to the investigation,\u201d such that the defendant\u2019s communication \u201ccould reasonably have been interpreted by the officer as relating generally to the investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1045-1046. The plurality concluded that the defendant\u2019s question satisfied this standard. <em>Id. </em>Justice Powell concurred in the judgment but rejected the need for any initiation standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1050-1051. Justice Marshall, in a dissenting opinion joined by three other justices, declared that \u201c[a] waiver [of the right to counsel] can be established . . . only when the accused himself reopens the dialogue about the subject matter of the investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054. The plurality and dissenting justices, however, agreed that the initiation question is only \u201cthe first step of a two-step analysis,\u201d and that, if the defendant is found to have initiated the post-invocation conversation, the police may re-interrogate only if the defendant also knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives the right to counsel after receiving the Miranda warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 1044-1045, 1054 n.2. See <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 486 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Our cases appear to have adopted something akin to the initiation standard articulated in the plurality opinion. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>445 Mass. 734, 739 (2006), we declared, \u201cIn the area of <em>Edwards </em>issues, we closely follow Federal law.\u201d We then agreed with the Appeals Court decision that concluded that the defendant had initiated a postinvocation communication, <em>id., </em>where \u201cthe defendant\u2019s subsequent statement to [a police officer] that he thought he was in a lot of trouble, and his twice repeated inquiry whether he needed counsel, evinced a desire for more generalized conversation at least sufficient to permit further inquiry about whether the defendant continued to stand by his earlier invocation of his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 238, 245 (2002). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>416 Mass. 364, 371 (1993), we found a defendant\u2019s question that was nearly identical to that asked in <em>Bradshaw </em>(\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me next?\u201d) to have initiated further communication. Other ambiguous or tangentially related statements have also been considered initiations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bins, </em>465 Mass. 348, 354, 362 (2013) (defendant initiated postinvocation communication by asking if officers were members of Mormon Church, where defendant\u2019s wife, who was victim, was Mormon); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>152, 157-158 (1997) (defendant saying, \u201cI admit it,\u201d to police officer sitting across from him was sufficient initiation of further conversation). Here, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person,\u201d although ambiguous, was sufficient to initiate further discussion with police, because it reasonably could be interpreted as relating generally to the investigation and to reflect a desire to initiate conversation relevant to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u201cSince there was no violation of the <em>Edwards </em>rule in this [instance], the next inquiry [i]s ... \u2018whether the purported waiver was knowing and intelligent and found to be so under the totality of the circumstances, including the necessary fact that the accused, not the police, reopened the dialogue with the authorities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1046, quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 486 n.9. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>426 Mass. 290, 295-296 (1997). The motion judge so found, and his finding is well supported by the evidence. Trooper McGrath did not interrogate the defendant immediately after her spontaneous statement, but instead told her that she could talk to the detectives if she wanted. She replied, \u201cI do want to speak with them again.\u201d She was then read the Miranda warnings, and signed the waiver. Although she was tired and cried at times, the motion judge determined that she was calm and thinking clearly and her answers showed clear focus on the detectives\u2019 questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Having found that the defendant initiated the communication with the police during booking and that her subsequent statements were made after a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver, we consider whether the July 7 postbooking statements were tainted by the <em>Edwards </em>violations that occurred during the July 6 and July 7 prebooking interviews. An <em>Edwards </em>violation is also a <em>Miranda </em>violation. See <em>Montejo </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>556 U.S. 778, 794 (2009) (describing <em>Edwards </em>as \u201cprophylactic protection of the Miranda right\u201d); <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 482 <em>(\u201cMiranda </em>thus declared that an accused has a Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation\u201d). In contrast with Federal constitutional law, under our constitutional law, we \u201cpresume that a statement made following the violation of a suspect\u2019s Miranda rights is tainted,\u201d and require the prosecution to \u201cshow more than the belated administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in order to dispel that taint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>412 Mass. 823, 836 (1992). A statement obtained in violation of <em>Edwards, </em>and thus also in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cby definition \u2018coerced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Lavaris, </em>99 Wash. 2d 851, 857 (1983). The presumption of taint under our constitutional law arises from the recognition that, where the police procure a statement from a suspect in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>a subsequent statement may be the product of the initial coercion even where the suspect knowingly and voluntarily waives her right to silence and to counsel, if the custodial interrogation was essentially continuous or if the suspect believes that it would be futile to invoke her rights because she incriminated herself in the first statement. See <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. at 153; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>420 Mass. 569, 580-581 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u201cThis presumption may be overcome by showing that either: (1) after the illegally obtained statement, there was a break in the stream of events that sufficiently insulated the <em>post-Miranda </em>statement from the tainted one; or (2) the illegally obtained statement did not incriminate the defendant, or, as it is more colloquially put, the cat was not out of the bag.\u201d <em>Prater, supra </em>at 580, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Osachuk, </em>418 Mass. 229, 235 (1994). \u201c[W]hether one or both lines of analysis is required before a confession is admitted turns on the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 792, 799-800 (1997), quoting <em>Prater, supra </em>at 580 n.10. \u201cThe focus and ultimate goal of undertaking either or both lines of analysis is a determination of the voluntariness of the later confession. If the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements were not a product of coercion, either by coercive external forces or primarily by a sense of futility that he has already incriminated himself with the first statement,\u201d then suppression of the subsequent statement is not required. <em>Prater, supra </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Here, we conclude that the presumption of taint cannot be overcome by a break in the stream of events alone. Only approximately twenty minutes passed between the prebooking <em>Edwards </em>violation and the subsequent interrogation. The defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person,\u201d although not a direct response to the prebooking interrogation, at least echoes the content of the interrogation, which ended shortly after Trooper Sylva told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201cWhen you get charged, if you get convicted, people are gonna say \u2018this is what she meant to do.\u2019 Do you wanna be thought of that way, do you wanna be thought of trying to throw a kid out the window?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The presumption of taint in this case, however, is overcome by the \u201ccat-out-of-the-bag line of analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 686 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). A subsequent statement is inadmissible as the direct product of an earlier coerced statement \u201cif, in giving the statement, the defendant was motivated by the belief that, after a prior coerced statement, his effort to withhold further information would be futile and he had nothing to lose by repetition or amplification of the earlier statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, having vigorously denied in both previous interrogations that she had set the fire, the defendant had <em>not </em>let the cat out of the bag when she returned to the interview room after her booking with the intent to reveal that she had set the fire. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>375 Mass. 472, 482 (1978) (cat was not out of bag where defendant only admitted in initial suppressed statement that he had been in Boston with another suspect but admitted in subsequent statement to his involvement in murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Apart from the \u201ccat-out-of-the-bag line of analysis,\u201d there are other reasons why the defendant\u2019s initiation of communication during her booking on July 7 was not the tainted product of coercion arising from the <em>Edwards </em>violation. We credit the motion judge\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s statement was her own \u201cspontaneous\u201d comment, and was not made in response to anything that could reasonably be construed as continued interrogation. The defendant made the statement during booking in an area separate from where the interrogation had been conducted and in the presence of a different set of law enforcement officers. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the end of the July 7 prebooking interview were less coercive compared to the circumstances surrounding the end of the initial interview on July 6. On July 6, the initial interview ended with Detective Persampieri berating the defendant for having \u201clawyered up\u201d by invoking her right to counsel; on July 7, the interview ended when it became clear she was not going to change the story she had told the previous day. Moreover, the <em>Edwards </em>violation on July 6 was intentional; the defendant had invoked her right to counsel moments before Detective Persampieri restarted the interrogation. On July 7, the <em>Edwards </em>violation was not intentional; it arose from the retroactive application of the <em>Shatzer </em>decision. Consequently, the potency of the coercion arising from the <em>Edwards </em>violation during the July 7 prebooking interrogation was far less than that arising from the July 6 <em>Edwards </em>violation, and the like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552a\">*552a</page-number>lihood that her initiation was a product of coercion was also far less.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Where the defendant initiated her communication at booking with a trooper who had not participated in her interrogation, did so in a room separate from where she had been interrogated, and agreed to recommence the questioning so that she could admit to what she had earlier so consistently denied, we conclude that her postbooking Miranda waiver was voluntary and was not the product of coercion or otherwise tainted by the July 6 earlier violations of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the statements made by the defendant during the prebooking interview of July 7 should have been suppressed, but that the statements she made during the postbooking interview were properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">2. <em>Harmless error analysis. </em>Having determined that all but the postbooking interview should have been suppressed, we turn to whether the erroneous admission of these statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>463 Mass. 273, 287 (2012). In making this determination, \u201cwe consider \u2018the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case; the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; who introduced the issue at trial; the frequency of the reference; whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; the availability or effect of curative instructions; and the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, </em>447 Mass. 546, 553 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Essential to the jury\u2019s verdict was determining whether (1) the defendant intentionally set the fire; (2) the setting of the fire caused the death of Calderon; and (3) the defendant intended by setting the fire to kill Johnson.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The jury, through their guilty verdicts, necessarily concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally set the fire and that the fire caused Calderon\u2019s death. In view of the evidence at trial, especially the defendant\u2019s confession to setting the fire during the postbooking interview, which was consistent with the neighbor\u2019s observations of the defendant moments before the house went up in flames and the fire investigator\u2019s opinion regarding the cause and origin of the fire, the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s July 6 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552b\">*552b</page-number>July 7 prebooking statements could not reasonably have affected these two conclusions. These findings alone (along with the undisputed fact that the house was a dwelling) were sufficient to support guilty verdicts of arson of a dwelling house and, with respect to the indictment charging murder, of the lesser crime of felony-murder in the second degree, with arson of a dwelling house as the predicate felony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The erroneous admission of the statements, therefore, was harmless as to these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We are not persuaded, however, that the erroneous admission of the statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the third question: whether the defendant intended to kill Johnson. The jury\u2019s finding that the defendant intended to kill Johnson was necessary to its guilty finding of murder on the theory of deliberate premeditation<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and its guilty findings on the thirteen indictments charging attempted murder, all of which rested on a finding of a transferred intent to kill. There was sufficient evidence, apart from the erroneously admitted statements of the defendant, to permit a reasonable jury to infer an intent to kill from the defendant\u2019s earlier threats to kill Johnson, the persistent feud between them, and the time the fire was set, which was shortly after 5:30 a.m., when the residents of the house presumably were in bed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>399 Mass. 785, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552c\">*552c</page-number>788 (1987). But the evidence supporting a finding of an intent to kill was not overwhelming, and the defendant\u2019s manner of setting the fire (using a cigarette lighter to set fire to the curtain in one window of the house, without adding any accelerant and without making any apparent effort to block egress from the first-floor apartment) was not reasonably likely to result in Johnson\u2019s death. In these circumstances, we cannot conclude with the required confidence that admission of the defendant\u2019s statements, made over the course of more than three hours of interrogation, where she spoke of her hatred of Johnson, her breaking of the windows in the house, her anger at Johnson for taunting her with Brown\u2019s supposed sexual infidelity, and her failure to use her cellular telephone to call 911 for assistance even after she heard the screams of those trapped by the fire, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant intended to kill Johnson, and therefore harmless to their guilty verdicts on the indictments charging murder and attempted murder. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19, 27-32 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The convictions of murder in the first degree and of attempted murder cannot stand for the reasons we have explained. We vacate the attempted murder convictions and remand them for a new trial. We affirm the verdict of arson of a dwelling house. Because the jury necessarily found the required elements of felony-murder in the second degree, based on their verdicts of murder and of arson of a dwelling house, and because the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to these required elements, the Commonwealth shall have the option of either having the conviction of murder in the first degree vacated and proceeding with a new trial on the murder indictment, or accepting a reduction of the verdict to felony-murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Within four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552d\">*552d</page-number>teen days of the issuance of this opinion, the Commonwealth shall inform this court whether it will move to have the defendant sentenced on the lesser offense of felony-murder in the second degree or whether it will retry the defendant for murder in the first degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rutkowski, </em>459 Mass. 794, 800 (2011), and cases cited. We will issue an appropriate rescript to the Superior Court after the Commonwealth informs us of its decision. If the Commonwealth opts to move for sentencing on the lesser offense of felony-murder in the second degree, the conviction of arson of a dwelling house would of course have to be dismissed as duplicative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 275-276 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>459 Mass. 480, cert. denied, 132 S.
