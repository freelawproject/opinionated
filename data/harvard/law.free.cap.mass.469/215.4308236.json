L. c. 164, \u00a7 <em>69PA </em>(\u00a7 69F4), approved the petition of Brockton Power Company LLC (Brockton Power or company), to build and operate a 350-megawatt combined-cycle energy generating facility (facility or project) powered by natural gas and ultra-low sulfur distillate (ULSD) in the city of Brockton (city). As approved by the board, the facility would use wastewater from the city\u2019s advanced wastewater reclamation facility (AWRF) for its cooling tower. In a consolidated appeal by three of the interveners, we affirmed the board\u2019s decision. See <em>Brockton </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd. (No. 1), ante </em>196 (2014) <em>(Brockton [No. 1 ]), </em>decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">On April 9, 2010, while the consolidated appeal was pending, Brockton Power submitted a project change filing (PCF) to the board, seeking approval of three changes to its project. In the PCF, Brockton Power sought to (1) change the source of the facility\u2019s cooling tower water from the AWRF to the Brockton municipal water supply (BMWS); (2) eliminate the use of ULSD as an alternative fuel and rely solely on natural gas as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>facility\u2019s fuel; and (3) make certain changes in the design of the facility. After additional public comment, extensive discovery, testimony, and six days of evidentiary hearings that the board considered as a \u201ccontinuation of the [original [proceeding,\u201d the board issued its PCF decision, denying Brockton Power\u2019s proposal to use BMWS but approving the two other project changes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brockton Power appealed from the board\u2019s denial of the PCF with respect to the facility\u2019s water source,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the city appealed from the board\u2019s approval of the design and fuel changes. A single justice of this court reserved and reported the appeals to the full court. We affirm the board\u2019s final decision with respect to both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The scope of our review of the board\u2019s PCF decision is the same as in <em>Brockton (No. 1), supra, </em>and is set forth in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board\u2019s evidentiary rulings are entitled to deference, and the appellants bear the burden of showing that the board\u2019s decision is invalid. <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 51 (2006) <em>(Alliance I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">1. <em>Board\u2019s authority to consider PCF as part of original proceeding. </em>In its August 7, 2009, final decision, the board required Brockton Power to notify it of \u201cany changes other than minor variations to the proposal so that the [board] may decide whether to inquire further into a particular issue.\u201d In addition to this general requirement, noting \u201cthe uncertainty . . . around the availability of the Brockton AWRF water supply,\u201d the board directed Brockton Power to \u201cwork with the [city] regarding use of [the city\u2019s] AWRF water, and to provide a report to the [board] with respect to the outcome of such efforts.\u201d In the event that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Brockton Power determined not to use the AWRF water and instead \u201cto use potable [municipal] water for the majority of the water requirements of its proposed facility,\u201d the board directed the company to \u201cprovide a project change filing to the [board], together with a detailed analysis focused on those issues that are germane to the use of potable water, including opportunities for water conservation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Consistent with this directive, on April 9, 2010, Brockton Power submitted its PCF to the board seeking approval of a change in the source of the facility\u2019s water supply for the cooling tower, approval of the nonuse of ULSD as an alternate fuel, and approval of building design changes. Over the objection of interveners, who argued that the PCF should be treated as a new petition, the board, as previously described, held evidentiary hearings on the PCF and issued a decision rejecting the proposed change in source of water supply for the cooling tower, but approving the two other changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Under \u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1, </em>fifth and sixth pars., the board may approve, reject in whole or in part, or conditionally approve a petition for an electrical generating facility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute provides that \u201c[i]n the event of rejection or conditional approval, the applicant may, within 180 days, submit an amended petition. Public and evidentiary hearings on the amended petition shall be held on the same terms and conditions applicable to the original petition.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1, </em>sixth par. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The city contends that Brockton Power\u2019s PCF was an \u201camended petition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>69P\u00c1, </em>sixth par., and because it was submitted on April 9, 2010, 245 days after the board issued its original decision, the board did not have the authority to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>it as part of the original proceeding \u2014 the window for filing an amended petition had already closed. According to the city, the board should have reviewed the PCF as a new petition, which would have required readjudication of the full range of issues the board considered in its original decision issued on August 7, 2009. The city\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u201cWe accord substantial discretion to an agency to interpret the statute it is charged with enforcing . . . .\u201d <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>457 Mass. 663, 681 (2010). Moreover, \u201cadministrative agencies have broad discretion over procedural matters before them.\u201d <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>406 Mass. 217, 227 (1989) <em>(Zachs). </em>We defer to an agency\u2019s procedural rulings and review them for \u201cerror of law or abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is so in particular when the ruling concerns whether to reopen a proceeding or an administrative record. See <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils. (No. 2), </em>461 Mass. 190, 193-194 &amp; n.7 (2011); <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 420 (2001) <em>(Box Pond).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The board determined that Brockton Power\u2019s PCF was not an \u201camended petition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 69F4, sixth par. As interpreted by the board, the \u201camended petition\u201d provision is limited to an amended filing submitted by a project proponent within six months after the board has issued a final decision rejecting the original petition or imposing conditions from which the proponent seeks relief. The board contends that its power under \u00a7 69B4, fifth and sixth pars., to approve a petition with conditions, combined with its ability to \u201cissue orders with respect to any matter over which it has jurisdiction,\u201d see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, provides it with more than sufficient authority to include in a final decision an order requiring the project proponent to bring back to the board for potential review any proposed changes to the project that may affect the basis on which it was originally approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The board\u2019s interpretation of its \u201cstatutory mandate will be disturbed only if the interpretation is patently wrong, unreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious.\u201d <em>Box Pond, </em>435 Mass. at 416, quoting <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 17 (2000). Where, as here, the relevant statutes are silent on the means of enforcing compliance with its orders, the board has broad discretion to establish appropriate procedures. See <em>Zachs, </em>406 Mass. at 227-228. An administrative agency may, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>here, \u201cadopt policies through adjudication as well as through rulemaking.\u201d <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass. at 51, quoting <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981). The board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 69T4, fifth and sixth pars., is a reasonable one to which we accord deference, and the procedure the board adopted to review potentially material changes to Brockton Power\u2019s project does not constitute an abuse of its discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">2. <em>Water source. </em>The board in its original final decision approved Brockton Power\u2019s proposed use of water from the city\u2019s AWRF for the facility\u2019s cooling tower. Because the city refused to supply recycled wastewater from the AWRF for the facility, Brockton Power submitted a PCF based on the use of water from BMWS, which supplies potable water to the city. The board concluded that the environmental impacts associated with the Brockton Power\u2019s use of BMWS water failed to \u201cminimize the environmental impacts consistent with the minimization of costs associated with the mitigation, control, and reduction of the environmental impacts of the proposed generating facility.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69\u00bc, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Brockton Power argues that the board\u2019s analysis of environmental impacts intruded on the authority of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and was unsupported by substantial evidence. We disagree and conclude that Brockton Power has not met its burden of showing that the board\u2019s decision is invalid. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The record reflects the following facts. The city draws its water supply from the Silver Lake system, the Brockton Reservoir, the Hubbard Avenue well, and, beginning in 2008, a desalination plant owned and operated by Aquaria, LLC (Aquaria), in Dighton.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The city\u2019s permits issued under the Water Management Act (WMA), G. L. c. 21G, authorize withdrawals of 11.94 million gallons per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>day (mgd) from the Silver Lake system and Brockton Reservoir.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the city is authorized to purchase up to 4.07 mgd from Aquaria, which draws water from the Taunton River.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In 1986, subsequent to a prolonged drought, the predecessor agency of the DEP issued an administrative order and emergency declaration that, among other requirements, directed the city to control water demand and withdrawals, and to develop new water sources. Thereafter, in 1995, an administrative consent order (ACO) replaced the emergency declaration. Pursuant to the ACO, the city reestablished its water commission and, among other measures, prepared a comprehensive water management plan concerning its water supply. In 1997, a modification to the ACO also established a \u201csafe yield\u201d of 10.33 mgd for the city from its then existing sources, which did not yet include the Aquaria plant. The ACO provides that in the event the city\u2019s water withdrawals exceed 11.3 mgd or 110 per cent of the \u201csafe yield,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> whichever is larger, the excess withdrawal will \u201cconstitute a request for the imposition of a [declaration of [w]ater [ejmergency.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From 1996 to 2010, the city\u2019s average annual water use was relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>constant, at approximately 10 mgd. In 2014, the city is estimated to require between 10.15 and 11.44 mgd of water from all sources. The ACO, and the safe yield limits, remain in effect.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As proposed to be modified by the PCF, the facility\u2019s cooling tower will require 1.75 mgd of water at full capacity on a typical day, or 1.1 mgd on an average annual basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> During the summer electrical peak period, when the Silver Lake system is the most stressed, the facility is expected to use water at the rate of 2.1 mgd, roughly twice its estimated annual average rate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Brockton Power contends that BMWS readily can supply the volume of potable water necessary for the facility\u2019s cooling tower, essentially because, in Brockton Power\u2019s view, \u201cmost (if not all) of the incremental water needed to supply [the facility] will come from Aquaria rather than the city\u2019s historic system.\u201d The board disagreed, noting that the city had never had to manage the supply demand of a water customer the size of the Brockton Power facility, that the facility would account for more than ten per cent of the city\u2019s current water demand, and that despite greater flexibility in water withdrawal allocations due to Aquaria, \u201csome, and possibly even a significant portion, of the [facility\u2019s] municipal water could come from Silver Lake.\u201d Noting that the city\u2019s water supply problems have resulted in significant environmental impacts to the Silver Lake system over the years and that Brockton Power had not provided evidence concerning the additional environmental impacts on that system that might result from Brockton Power\u2019s increased consumption for the project, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the board concluded that Brockton Power had not met its burden to show that the environmental impacts of the proposed change would be minimized consistent with the minimization of related costs, as required by \u00a7 69J14, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">On appeal, Brockton Power contends that the board impermissibly intruded into the DEP\u2019s statutory and regulatory authority as expressed in the ACO\u2019s threshold for triggering a declaration of water emergency for the city. Brockton Power argues that the DEP\u2019s \u201cdetermination of safe yield as the basis for the 1995 ACO limit of 11.3 [mgd] specifically included minimization and balancing of environmental protection factors\u201d to which the board was obligated to defer in conducting its review of the PCF. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In evaluating a claim that the board\u2019s determination is arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence, we \u201cgive[ ] great deference to the board\u2019s expertise and experience.\u201d <em>Alliance </em>I, 448 Mass. at 51. \u201cIn determining whether an agency decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must consider the record as a whole and reverse the agency\u2019s decision if \u2018the cumulative weight of the evidence tends substantially toward opposite inferences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; </em>Energy, 436 Mass. 233, 237 (2002), quoting <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 391 (1999). Here, Brockton Power has not met its burden of showing that board\u2019s decision was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 <em>69JVa, </em>fifth par., the board is the agency charged with determining whether a project proponent\u2019s petition is an accurate and complete description of the environmental impacts of the proposed facility, and also minimizes environmental impacts consistent with the minimization of costs associated with mitigation, control, and reduction of environmental impacts. \u201cA permit issued by the board is only the first of many permits and licenses that will be required of a developer of a generating facility, and no other State agency may issue a construction permit for a generating facility until it has first been approved by the board.\u201d <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 377, 380 (2001) <em>(Andover). </em>The Legislature has provided for complementary but independent roles for the board and the DEP. Just as the board does not delegate or abdicate its statutory responsibility by recognizing the authority and expertise of the DEP over water management issues, see <em>id. </em>at 381, the board\u2019s independent exercise of its statutory authority does not intrude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>upon DEP\u2019s authority over issues relating to municipal water supplies under the WMA, G. L. c. 21G, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In short, the board\u2019s and the DEP\u2019s mandates are not identical although they touch on many of the same environmental concerns; \u201csensible administrative coordination\u201d between the two agencies is necessary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Andover, </em>435 Mass. at 382. The board\u2019s approval of a petition to construct an energy facility will not necessarily satisfy the DEP\u2019s requirements for a permit for that facility under the WMA. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 380-381 (discussing different roles of board and DEP in relation to review of air emissions). Likewise, a DEP permit issued to a municipality under the WMA is not equivalent to a determination that a proposed facility would minimize environmental impacts as required by \u00a7 69J14, nor does the existence of such a permit compel the board to grant a petition under that statute. Far from intruding on the DEP\u2019s authority, the board would have abdicated its statutory duties if it had based its decision on the proposed water source change wholly on the DEP\u2019s municipal water withdrawal determinations under the WMA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Moreover, the board\u2019s determination was supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>stantial evidence. In its PCF, Brockton Power contended that because the city was already withdrawing close to the limit of its ACO threshold from its traditional sources, the incremental water volume required by the facility would primarily come from the Aquaria plant, which provided a significant new source of potable water for the city. Consequently, Brockton Power urged, despite the city\u2019s historical water supply challenges, the facility would not have a negative effect on the environment of the Silver Lake system. As the board recognized, however, the city\u2019s water conservation efforts and stable population forecast made it likely that the city\u2019s withdrawals would remain under the ACO threshold. Moreover, Brockton Power had no control over the origins of the municipal water required by the facility, and given the city\u2019s view of the Aquaria plant as a supplemental source of its water needs, the volume required by the PCF might come entirely or at least in part from the Silver Lake system. Given the evidence that the city\u2019s municipal water withdrawals continue to have a significant environmental impact on the Silver Lake system, the board concluded that Brockton Power had not met its burden of proving that the environmental impacts of the incremental potable water usage from BMWS had been minimized consistent the requirements of \u00a7 691%, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Brockton Power complains that the board did not analyze sufficiently the environmental impacts of the additional withdrawals anticipated by the PCF on the Silver Lake system, but this appears to have been the result of the position the company itself took before the board: the PCF filing proceeded on the assumption that most or all of the increased water required by the facility would come from the Aquaria plant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is apparent that the board did analyze and consider the effect of the proposed water use on the city\u2019s traditional water sources, including two studies and expert testimony indicating that the city\u2019s withdrawals have a continued impact on the environment of the Silver Lake system by degrading freshwater mussel habitat and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>increasing environmental stress on the Jones River, the major tributary of Silver Lake. Moreover, contrary to Brockton Power\u2019s assertion, the board considered the city\u2019s water conservation progress in light of continuing environmental challenges to the Silver Lake system and the facility\u2019s projected water needs.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Although the board\u2019s denial of the PCF with respect to BMWS appears to preclude construction of the facility as currently proposed, we briefly review the city\u2019s appeal of the board\u2019s approval of the two other proposed changes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">3. <em>Elimination of ULSD capacity. </em>As initially approved by the board, the facility would use ULSD as an alternative fuel for up to sixty days per year. In its PCF filing, Brockton Power proposed to construct the facility with natural gas-only generators, eliminating the facility\u2019s capacity to use ULSD.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> According to Brockton Power, a gas-only plant would reduce air emissions, visual impacts, most ULSD deliveries, and the facility\u2019s water requirements, while the expansion of gas supplies in the Northeast would guarantee the reliability of the facility\u2019s energy sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ply. The board found that a gas-only plant would \u201creduce the environmental impacts, consistent with the minimization of costs associated with the mitigation, control, and reduction of the environmental impacts\u201d of the facility, as required by \u00a7 69114, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On appeal, the city primarily asserts deficiencies with respect to the air emission findings in the board\u2019s original final decision.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As stated previously, in reviewing a PCF, the board need not consider issues that have already been decided in the original decision. The board\u2019s PCF decision analyzed the PCF for accuracy and completeness and \u201ccompared the environmental impacts of the facility as originally approved with the environmental impacts of the project as changed.\u201d This approach is reasonable and consistent with the board\u2019s statutory mandate. See <em>Zachs, </em>406 Mass. at 227 (\u201cadministrative agencies have broad discretion over procedural aspects of matters before them\u201d). Our review of the city\u2019s appeal is limited to new issues raised by the PCF. See <em>Box </em>Pond, 435 Mass. at 419-420 (rejecting attempt to relitigate issues already decided in underlying proceeding). With respect to the elimination of ULSD fuel, we conclude that Brockton Power\u2019s PCF was accurate and complete, and \u201cminimize [d] the environmental impacts consistent with the minimization of costs associated with the mitigation, control, and reduction of the environmental impacts.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J14, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The record indicates that with the elimination of ULSD, the emissions of all criteria pollutants will be reduced from the level estimated in the original petition, which the board has already approved (and we have upheld).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, there is no basis upon which the board could have concluded that the PCF would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>not minimize environmental impacts, as required by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691%, fifth par.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The city has not met its burden of showing that the board\u2019s decision is invalid, unsupported by substantial evidence, or an abuse of discretion. See <em>Alliance </em>I, 448 Mass. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The city also argues that the board erred by underestimating the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from the facility by basing its analysis on Brockton Power\u2019s allegedly inaccurate estimates of plant \u201cstart-up and shut-down\u201d events.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In its PCF decision, the board noted that the city and Brockton Power disagreed about the modeling of the CO emissions. Without analyzing the dispute, the board noted Brockton Power\u2019s lower figures and stated that the facility would be subject to \u201cenforceable annual and hourly limits ... set out in [the DEP\u2019s] Conditional Air Plan Approval.\u201d Brockton Power\u2019s CO emissions estimate, 98.5 tpy, represents 8.6 per cent of the NAAQS threshold for one-hour CO, and 18.9 per cent of the NAAQS threshold for eight-hour CO. Although the city\u2019s estimate of 138.8 tpy is higher than Brockton Power\u2019s, it is still well below the NAAQS limit for this pollutant. The board is entitled to rely on the NAAQS thresholds to determine whether a project proposal has minimized the environmental impacts pursuant to its review. See <em>Brockton (No. 1), supra </em>at 207-208.

In its PCF, however, Brockton Power proposed three changes to the facility as approved in the underlying decision, which, in its view, would make the facility compliant with the city\u2019s zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although the board took no position on whether the modifications would meet the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, it analyzed the changes with respect to noise and visual impacts, and concluded that the changes minimized the facility\u2019s environmental impacts as required by G.

This argument is without merit. In contrast to the minimization of visual and noise impacts, compliance with local zoning is not a precondition for the approval of a siting petition under \u00a7 <em>69PA. </em>The board\u2019s determination that zoning issues were \u201coutside the scope\u201d of its \u00a7 <em>69PA </em>review is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the board\u2019s PCF decision in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The city, Brockton Power, various residents of the city and the town of West Bridgewater represented by Alternatives for Communities and Environment, Inc., and the Taunton River Watershed Alliance intervened in the project change filing (PCF) proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by Massachusetts Rivers Alliance, Charles River Watershed Association, Jones River Watershed Association, North and South Rivers Watershed Association, and Taunton River Watershed Alliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69P, provides that the court\u2019s review is limited to \u201cwhether the decision of the board is in conformity with the constitution of the commonwealth and the constitution of the United States, was made in accordance with the procedures established under [G.

Each state or local government agency is directed to provide such information and recommendations as may be requested by the board.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 69H, second par., provides that the board membership include \u201cthe secretary of energy and environmental affairs, who shall serve as chairman,... the commissioner of the department of environmental protection, ... or the designees of any of the foregoing . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Although Brockton Power correctly notes that environmental protection principles, including water conservation, are an integral component of DEP\u2019s water management authority, it does not follow that the AGO threshold limit of 11.3 mgd (or 110 per cent of the system\u2019s safe yield at the time of the AGO) is \u201cfully protective\u201d of the environmental concerns that the board must consider under \u00a7 69J14, fifth par. Indeed, other than the DEP\u2019s general mandate to consider environmental effects of water withdrawals under G. L. c. 21G, \u00a7 7, there is no evidence that the AGO specifically considers the environmental effects of the safe yield threshold. Rather, the focus of the AGO is to \u201censure an ample supply of potable water is available to [the city].\u201d The safe yield established by the AGO merely sets a threshold at which a declaration of water emergency will be imposed on the city if the twelve month average exceeds the designated amount; it does not purport to establish a level of water withdrawals that is protective of the city\u2019s traditional water sources, such as the Silver Lake system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In its PCF decision, the board noted: \u201cThe [c]ompany did not provide information on or analysis of the different environmental impacts on the Silver Lake system that would result from the [cjity\u2019s water consumption with the [\u0440] roject\u2019s use of [Brockton municipal water supply (BMWS)] water as compared to the [c]ity\u2019s water consumption without the [p]roject. Rather the [\u0441] ompany restricted its argument to the unsubstantiated and, in fact, highly questionable, claim that its cooling tower water would predominately come from Aquaria. Without analysis specific to the Silver Lake system, the environmental impacts of the [p]roject change cannot be reliably assessed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Brockton Power\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit. The board need not address or make findings with respect to all the evidence in the record. See <em>Box Pond, </em>435 Mass. at 418. The board\u2019s initial approval of 0.257 mgd of BMWS water for sanitary and process use by the facility does not compel the conclusion that the proposed use of 1.1 mgd for the facility\u2019s cooling tower minimized environmental impacts as required by \u00a7 <em>69PA. </em>Further, the board did not deviate impermissibly from its precedent. Although the board previously has granted siting permits for energy facilities utilizing municipal water for their cooling towers, the board\u2019s decision on the PCF here discussed and distinguished these precedents based on the evidence of environmental threats to the Silver Lake system contained in the record. See <em>Tofias </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 340, 349 (2001), quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>416 Mass. 668, 673 (1993) (\u201c \u2018reasoned consistency\u2019. . . means only \u2018that any change from an established pattern of conduct must be explained\u2019 \u201d). Finally, Brockton Power asserts also that the board\u2019s decision interfered with its right to obtain potable water from the BMWS in a nondiscriminatory manner. Because of the projected quantity of water that Brockton Power will need for the facility\u2019s cooling tower, discussed <em>infra, </em>the company is not situated similarly to other users of the system. See <em>Rounds </em>v. <em>Board of Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019rs, </em>347 Mass. 40, 44 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The board concluded, \u201cThe evidence in this case demonstrated that the three proposed [pjroject changes are not interrelated in such a way that implementation of one [pjroject change without implementation of one, or both, of the other two changes is prevented. Accordingly, our findings stated above are made considering each proposed change on a stand-alone basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The PCF did not propose modifying the facility\u2019s use of three \u201cblack-start\u201d generators powered by ultra-low sulfur distillate, used for restarting the turbine when power is not available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">For example, the city argues that the board erred by relying on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to evaluate the facility\u2019s estimated emissions, and by using Logan Airport meteorological data. We address these issues in <em>Brockton </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd. (No. 1), ante </em>196 (2014) <em>(Brockon [No. 1 ]), </em>also decided today. In addition, the city alleges that the board erred by not considering an alternative turbine and cooling tower design. However, the board was under no obligation to examine design alternatives in the context of a review of the PCF for a facility that it had already approved. See <em>Box </em>Pond, 435 Mass. at 419-420. Finally, the city argues that the board failed to apply the Environmental Justice policy (EJ policy) to the PCF. We also discuss the EJ policy in <em>Brockton (No. 1), supra. </em>In this appeal, the city does not claim that the board failed to implement the procedural protections of the EJ policy in relation to the PCF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Brockton Power\u2019s estimated percentage reductions based on a comparison of the emission estimates in the proposal to those in the original final decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>are as follows: nitrogen dioxide (twenty-nine per cent); carbon monoxide (ten per cent); particulate matter up to ten micrometers in diameter (thirty-nine per cent); particulate matter up to 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) (forty-two per cent); sulfur dioxide (twenty-three per cent); and volatile organic compounds (thirty-eight per cent). A smaller portion of this reduction is due to updated estimates (with respect to the proportion of particulate matter classified as PM2 5) and improved aerodynamic downwash resulting from changes in the design features in the PCF.
