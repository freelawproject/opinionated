The prosecutor represented to the witness and the trial judge that the Commonwealth had no intention of pursuing such a prosecution, but when the witness, advised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>his attorney, refused to answer, the judge directed the witness to do so. When the witness continued to refuse, the judge found the witness in summary criminal contempt and imposed a sentence of ninety days\u2019 incarceration, which he stayed pending resolution of the witness\u2019s interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In considering the witness\u2019s appeal, we are confronted with the question whether the judgment of contempt should not have entered because, regardless of the Commonwealth\u2019s intention, the compelled admission was a violation of the witness\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We conclude that, in these circumstances, the witness validly invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, that his compelled responses to such questioning did not constitute a waiver of the privilege, and that the judgment of summary contempt should not have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>On May 2, 2012, the defendant was arraigned on a charge of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, as a result of an incident between the defendant and his girl friend that had taken place in his friend Mark Sheehan\u2019s apartment at approximately 10 a.m. that morning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">On August 1, 2012, the day that trial was scheduled to begin, the Commonwealth indicated its intent to call Sheehan as a witness, and the judge appointed counsel to represent Sheehan with respect to a potential assertion of a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Sheehan\u2019s counsel reported that Sheehan did indeed have a Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify, because, based on his answers to questions expected to be posed to him, the testimony could expose him to criminal charges of possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to violate the drug laws. Counsel stated that Sheehan intended to assert that privilege. Following a brief in camera hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge ruled that the invocation of the privilege was not valid because Sheehan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>had not shown that he faced a real risk that his answers to questions would \u201ctend to indicate involvement in illegal activity, as opposed to a mere imaginary, remote, or speculative possibility of prosecution.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 502 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The jury-waived trial commenced, and the Commonwealth called Sheehan as its first witness. On direct examination, the prosecutor did not pose any questions on Sheehan\u2019s use of illegal drugs during the evening prior to the incident. On cross-examination, defense counsel first asked Sheehan about his use of alcohol that evening, and then inquired as to Sheehan\u2019s use of illegal drugs. In response, Sheehan invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. When the judge nonetheless instructed him to respond to defense counsel\u2019s questions concerning whether he had used illegal drugs on the night in question, and what type of drugs, Sheehan replied that he had used cocaine. When defense counsel asked Sheehan how much cocaine he had used, Sheehan\u2019s counsel objected, and the objection was overruled. On his counsel\u2019s advice, Sheehan thereafter continued to invoke his privilege and declined to respond to counsel\u2019s questions on the amount of cocaine Sheehan had used, or to any further questions on drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The judge admonished Sheehan that his refusal could result in immediate criminal sanctions. After a brief recess, the judge explained that refusal to answer questions based on a mistaken assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege would be summarily punished as criminal contempt. He then inquired into the possibility of immunizing Sheehan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After another brief recess during which the prosecutor consulted with his office, the prosecutor reported that no formal offer of immunity could be made. The prosecutor stated also, however, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s something we have an interest in pursuing at this time.\u201d He then proffered a written statement in which he represented that should Sheehan testify \u201cto the use of controlled substances under [G. L. c. 94C] on that occasion the Commonwealth has no present, nor future interest in the prosecution of . . . Sheehan for such activity,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>that Sheehan\u2019s \u201ctestimony alone that he consumed a controlled substance on that occasion is not enough to bring a formal prosecution against. . . Sheehan for that activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Sheehan\u2019s counsel informed the judge that she had advised her client of his privilege not to testify in response to questions regarding illicit drug use, and that her client would continue to invoke that privilege; counsel sought a stay of any criminal sanction, and stated that if it were determined on appeal that Sheehan had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege, he would testify immediately and purge the contempt. The judge once again warned that Sheehan risked, on a finding of criminal contempt, an immediate sanction of incarceration, and inquired whether that changed counsel\u2019s position. Sheehan\u2019s counsel informed the court that her client was \u201casserting his Fifth Amendment right not to testify, understanding that... he may be jailed for doing so.\u201d At that point, the judge told Sheehan directly that his continued refusal to answer the question regarding drug use was \u201cimpermissible, and that contempt sanctions may be imposed, and that that may include criminal sanctions, and that that may include a penalty of up to [three] months incarceration, or [a] $500 fine.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Crim. P. 43, 378 Mass. 919 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The first question posed by defense counsel on resuming his cross-examination was whether on the morning of May 2 Sheehan had been using cocaine, to which Sheehan responded by invoking his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. The judge thereupon found Sheehan in summary criminal contempt for failure to answer questions based on a mistaken claim of the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Amendment privilege,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ordered that he be incarcerated for ninety days, and stayed the sentence pending the resolution of the interlocutory appeal. The criminal trial itself was also stayed during the pendency of the appeal. Sheehan\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied. Sheehan was allowed to intervene in the criminal proceeding, and he appealed the judgment of contempt to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe right of a witness not to incriminate himself is secured by both the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. Commonwealth, 369 Mass. 183, 187 (1975). Although \u201cart. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides broader protection from self-incrimination than does the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 827, 832 n.6 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. 848, 858-859 (2000), \u201c[sjince the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 (1964), which held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to a witness testifying in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>State court the protection of the Fifth Amendment, we have applied Federal standards in determining whether a claim of privilege is justified.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 81 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201cThe proscription of the Fifth Amendment that \u2018[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u2019 may be invoked whenever a witness reasonably believes that the testimony could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 832, citing <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 444-445 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979). Because the privilege against self-incrimination is \u201ca fundamental principle of our system of justice,\u201d it \u201cis to be construed liberally in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>388 Mass. 453, 455 (1983). Accordingly, \u201ca refusal to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds must be upheld unless it is \u2018perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] cannot possibly have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Here, there was a more than adequate basis from which to determine that the anticipated testimony would have been an admission of violations of the drug laws that would tend to incriminate Sheehan, that the testimony could lead to other evidence that might have been used in a criminal prosecution, and therefore that invocation of the privilege not to testify was justified. The incriminatory potential of the testimony was apparent from the nature of the specific questions intended to be propounded, concerning Sheehan\u2019s drug use and his ability to perceive and remember the incident; from this it was evident that there was a \u201creal risk that his answers to questions [would] tend to indicate his involvement in illegal activity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 502 (1979). See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 84, quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 486-487 (to sustain privilege \u201cit need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it was asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">That the substance was not available to be tested would not, in and of itself, preclude prosecution for possession of a controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>substance approximately three months prior to the admission, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987) (\u201cProof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence\u201d), and, in any event, such testing would not be required in a prosecution for conspiracy to violate the drug laws. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 288 n.5 (1979) (\u201cAnswering the questions concerning a conversation about drugs could lead to prosecution for conspiracy to violate the drug laws, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40, or for the substantive offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Moreover, assuming, as the Commonwealth argues, that the confession to possession or use of an illicit substance is not alone sufficient to support a conviction, we nonetheless apply broad and \u201chighly protective\u201d standards to determine whether a claim of privilege is justified. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 502. Any admission by Sheehan to drug use on the night in question might have been used in questioning others concerning Sheehan\u2019s drug use on that night, or to provide leads for a subsequent criminal investigation. \u201cThe privilege \u2018not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction . . . but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, supra </em>at 456, quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 486. See, e.g., <em>National Fed\u2019n of Fed. Employees </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>983 F.2d 286, 292 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (\u201cAdmitting the use of illegal drugs, at least use so recent that the statute[ ] of limitations [has] not run, would doubtless be incriminating\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koehler, </em>614 Pa. 159, 213 (2012) (concluding trial judge correctly informed witness she had Fifth Amendment privilege not to answer questions regarding her drug use at time of incident about which she was testifying). Whether, as the judge believed, Sheehan may have had an additional motive not to testify was irrelevant where the circumstances otherwise support the determination that his responses would tend to incriminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Nor was Sheehan\u2019s invocation rendered invalid because of the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth did not intend to prosecute him on the basis of his testimony regarding the use of illicit drugs on the night in question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 503 n.3 (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s denial of an intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>prosecute a witness is not sufficient to defeat an assertion of the privilege\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, supra </em>at 459, and cases cited. We have not embraced a rule that \u201cwould require the trial court, in each case, to assess the practical possibility that prosecution would result from incriminatory answers.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranti, </em>253 F.2d 135, 139 (2d Cir. 1958). In any event, \u201c[t]his is not a case where recalcitrant witnesses have been granted immunity and then continued to refuse to testify.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 188-189.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">We also reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, advanced for the first time on appeal, that Sheehan waived his privilege when he answered two questions posed by defense counsel on cross-examination. Sheehan\u2019s answers were given in response to the judge\u2019s instruction that he was required to answer, and came after Sheehan had invoked his privilege prior to trial, and repeatedly during trial, immediately before the judge instructed him that he must respond. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, supra </em>at 458-459. In these circumstances, Sheehan\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not so freely and voluntarily given as to effect a waiver of his privilege on later questioning.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 193. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 259 (2002);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Com<em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Koonce, </em>418 Mass. 367, 378 (1994). Sheehan\u2019s testimony \u201ccould hardly be considered voluntary; he had sought to claim his privilege against self-incrimination and [the trial] judge had ruled that he had no such privilege.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>ente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 318 n.33 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1181 (2009) (witness did not waive privilege by testifying before grand jury where judge ruled he had no such privilege).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">\n<em>Judgment of contempt vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Mark Sheehan telephoned police after he had been awakened by the defendant yelling, \u201cCall the police; call the police,\u201d amid a confrontation between the defendant and his girl friend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">When the judge initially asked counsel to describe the substance of Sheehan\u2019s claim in open court, counsel requested an in camera hearing because she had informed her client that his statements to her would remain confidential; the judge declined to conduct the hearing in camera. Upon further questioning, counsel then informed the judge, without detail, that Sheehan\u2019s statements would involve an admission to illegal drug use, which could be used to impeach him. After counsel explained the criminal charges she believed might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>implicated, the judge conducted a brief in camera hearing concerning the substance of Sheehan\u2019s potential testimony, as presented by his counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Later in the proceedings, the judge informed the parties that, upon further inquiry, it appeared that immunity was not available in the District Court. The judge was correct. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 520-522 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Counsel for Sheehan again objected, stating that she understood the matter to be in the nature of civil, not criminal, contempt, because the witness intended to purge himself of contempt upon a determination by an appellate court that his invocation was not valid. The judge disagreed, noting that the failure could be considered criminal contempt where the witness refused in the middle of trial to answer a question as to which the court had ruled he had no valid privilege and had ordered the witness to testify. When the judge repeated his warning to the witness that continued refusal could result in a finding of criminal contempt \u201cthat would expose [the witness] to incarceration, beginning forthwith, of up to [ninety] days in a [h]ouse of [correction or a $500 fine,\u201d the witness stated: \u201cYour Honor, what I don\u2019t understand is, as a[n] American, why I cannot exercise a constitutional right.\u201d Responding to further statements made by the judge, the witness indicated that he respected that there was a dispute regarding the question and understood the sanctions he faced, whereupon cross-examination resumed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On a form captioned \u201cCriminal Contempt, Summary Judgment,\u201d the judge checked off the following as the bases for the summary action: \u201cThe conduct occurred during court proceedings and in the judge\u2019s sight or hearing\u201d; \u201cContemnor had been warned\u201d; \u201cPunishment does not exceed three months!\u2019] imprisonment or $500 fine\u201d; and \u201cImmediate adjudication of contempt was necessary to prevent disorder or disruption in courtroom.\u201d In the block on the form requesting a description of the conduct, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cMr. Sheehan is a Comm. witness in an A&amp;B prosecution. Counsel was apptd to represent him in connection w/ a possible 5th Amendment privilege. His atty stated at side bar and later in camera that the privilege was his potential prosecution for possession of cocaine and/or conspiracy to violate drug laws. Reason she claimed was that [the witness] would testify that he had been using cocaine at the time of the alleged A&amp;B. Court ruled that was insufficient basis and the invocation of the privilege was denied. Ordered to testify by the court, he refused three times and was found in contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">In a footnote, the judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">\u201cMr. Sheehan was friends w/ def. and was a reluctant witness. Ct. was concerned his claim of drug use was a fabrication for trial and lacked credibility and was being used as a vehicle to facilitate a path to acquittal for his friend, the [defendant], so that the evidence of drug use was so imaginary, remote or speculative that it should not serve as the basis for invocation of 5th Amendment privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Even had the District Court judge had the authority to issue an immunity order, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights requires that an immunized witness be granted transactional immunity, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>protects a witness from being prosecuted not only by an individual assistant district attorney or by a district attorney\u2019s office, but also by any State prosecutorial authority. See <em>Vaccari, petitioner, </em>460 Mass. 756, 759-761 &amp; n.5 (2011). An assertion by an assistant district attorney for a single county could not suffice to meet this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 259 (2002), we described the doctrine of waiver by prior testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of waiver by prior testimony ... is based on two pragmatic ramifications of the witness\u2019s prior voluntary, but potentially incriminating, testimony. One is that \u2018when a witness has freely testified as to incriminating facts, continued testimony as to details would no longer tend to incriminate.\u2019 <em>[Taylor </em>v. Commonwealth, 369 Mass. 183, 190 (1975)]. The second rationale given in support of the doctrine of waiver by testimony is that \u2018allowing the testimony to remain in a witness-selected posture would result in serious, unjust distortion; and the witness, having chosen to answer when he could have remained silent, \u201ccannot be allowed to state such facts only as he pleases to state, and to withhold other facts.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>10 Gray 472, 476 (1858).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because of our decision that the judgment of contempt should not have entered, we need not reach the intervener\u2019s argument that civil, rather than criminal, contempt would have been applicable in these circumstances. We emphasize, however, that \u201cwe give wide latitude to persons claiming privilege under the Fifth Amendment in order to give meaning to the privilege.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 9 n.11 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
