Sullivan, was convicted of attempted kidnapping, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6, and of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to from three to five years in the State prison on his conviction of attempted kidnapping, and he was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation on his conviction of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex, to commence on and after the attempted kidnapping sentence. On appeal, the defendant argued that (1) the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to prove every element of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) his motion to vacate the attempted kidnapping conviction was wrongly denied; and (3) his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment on the indictment charging attempted kidnapping, concluding that the Commonwealth had proved all the required elements of the offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 26, 28-30, 32 (2013). On the indictment charging accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex, the Appeals Court reversed the judgment, set aside the verdict, and entered judgment for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 30-32. It concluded that because the Commonwealth had not demonstrated that the defendant\u2019s conduct involved \u201csexually explicit language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>or acts,\u201d the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201coffensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review, limited to issues pertaining to the defendant\u2019s conviction of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to those issues, we affirm the judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts as they properly could have been found by the jury are concisely set forth in the decision of the Appeals Court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. at 27-28. We reiterate the essential details.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">At approximately 9:30 p.m. on September 28, 2007, R.M. was walking alone on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge. She was returning to her dormitory on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus after a tae kwon do class. The operator of a motor vehicle traveling on Massachusetts Avenue, whom R.M. later identified from a photographic array as the defendant, swerved toward her and stopped on the side of the road. R.M. thought that he was going to ask for directions, so she took a step toward the vehicle. The defendant rolled down the window and said, \u201cHey little girl, you look so tired. Come on over. Talk to me. Let\u2019s, you know, let\u2019s talk.\u201d R.M. described the pitch of his voice as \u201cmuch higher than his normal tone of voice, more like, well, what you use to bribe someone.\u201d She stepped back from the vehicle and started walking away because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have anything to do with that situation.\u201d The defendant then got out of his vehicle while the engine was still running, and he walked toward R.M., asking her to come over and speak with him. R.M. declined to engage him in conversation and attempted to move away. The defendant came closer, causing R.M. to angle her body to avoid touching him. Eventually, R.M. managed to continue on her way, the defendant returned to his vehicle, and he drove away. The encounter, however, did not end there.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Apparently changing his mind about heading toward Boston, the defendant suddenly reversed his direction and followed R.M. in his vehicle as she turned onto Landsdowne Street, which at the time was dimly lit and devoid of other pedestrians. When he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>caught up to her, the defendant stopped abruptly and got out of his vehicle a second time. With the engine running and the car door open, he approached so closely that R.M. was aware of an unpleasant odor emanating from his body. The defendant sounded angry, and he demanded that R.M. \u201cget in his car.\u201d Although he did not touch R.M., the defendant made a gesture like he wanted to put his arm around her shoulder and guide her toward his car. At this point, R.M. was \u201cvery scared.\u201d She moved away from the defendant, turning sideways on the sidewalk so she could \u201cscootch\u201d between the defendant and a wall that was behind her without touching him. As R.M. walked past the defendant, he started to follow her. R.M. then began reciting to herself the license plate number of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. At that point, the defendant \u201cstormed off,\u201d got into his car, and left the scene. R.M. ran straight to her dormitory feeling \u201creally, really, really scared,\u201d and the police were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Because the defendant has challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). A conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone, and the inferences drawn by a jury from the relevant evidence \u201cneed only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 487 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980). The existence of conflicting evidence does not mandate a required finding of not guilty, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>453 Mass. 653, 662 (2009), and we do not weigh supporting evidence against conflicting evidence when considering whether the jury could have found each element of the charged crime. See <em>id. </em>at 660, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1, states, in relevant part: \u201c[Pjersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex . . . may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the statute, \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdisorderly\u201d are separate and distinct elements, and the Commonwealth must prove both beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy its evidentiary burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>321 Mass. 294, 296 (1947). Moreover, \u201cthe Commonwealth has to prove that the defendant\u2019s behavior was offensive and disorderly to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. 778, 781 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 235 (2001). This is an objective standard. Cf. <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474-475, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) (\u201cwhether a reasonable woman seeking abortion services would be threatened, intimidated, or coerced by the defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d is objective standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">As to the first element of the crime, we have said that \u201coffensive\u201d acts or language \u201care those that cause \u2018displeasure, anger or resentment; esp., repugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. at 781, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1113 (8th ed. 2004) (defendant\u2019s act of grabbing victim from behind \u201creally tight\u201d around shoulders, at mutual place of business while she was helping customers, when viewed in context of defendant\u2019s other workplace behavior toward victim, was offensive within meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 10 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra </em>(fact finder could conclude that defendant\u2019s act of calling out to victim while passing within arm\u2019s reach, grabbing genital area of trousers, and mimicking masturbation constituted conduct \u201crepugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2003) (evidence sufficient to support conviction of accosting or annoying person of opposite sex where defendant used sexually explicit language toward teenage girls, stepped out of vehicle, and pulled down pants, causing girls to fear that defendant would hurt them). Thus, \u201coffensive\u201d acts or language cause a complainant to feel displeasure, anger, resentment, or the like, and such acts or language would be considered indecent or immoral by a reasonable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We interpret the \u201coffensive\u201d acts or language element of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>c. 272, \u00a7 53, as requiring proof of sexual conduct or language, either explicit or implicit. Explicit behavior is self-explanatory. By implicit sexual conduct or language, we mean that which a reasonable person would construe as having sexual connotations. Our construction of the statute flows from the fact that the proscribed acts or language must be directed at a \u201cperson[ ] of the opposite sex,\u201d thereby suggesting a sexual component to the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 274 (2004), citing <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983) (recognizing that primary source of legislative intent is plain language of statute). This sexual component defines the character of the wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Our interpretation is supported by the sexually dangerous person statute, which, in 2004, added the crime of accosting or annoying persons of the opposite sex to the definition of \u201c[s]exual offense.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 2004, c. 66, \u00a7 5. To conclude that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, also encompasses nonsexual behavior would result in absurd and unfair consequences. For example, a defendant convicted of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex based on acts or language that were <em>not </em>sexual could nonetheless face civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person due to the classification of this crime as a \u201csexual offense\u201d under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Irene, </em>462 Mass. 600, 610, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 487 (2012), quoting <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>400 Mass. 444, 453 (1987) (\u201cStatutes that relate to the same subject matter are not to be construed \u2018in a way that produces absurd or unreasonable results when a sensible construction is readily available\u2019 \u201d). That the Legislature classified the crime of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex as a sexual offense under the sexually dangerous person statute supports our conclusion that the Legislature intended the crime of accosting or annoying to require proof of sexual conduct or language.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As to the second element of the crime, \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts or language \u201care those that involve fighting or threatening, violent or tumultuous behavior, or that create a hazardous or physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose of the actor, whether the resulting harm is suffered in public by the public or in private by an individual.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. at 779, 781-783 (defendant\u2019s workplace behavior in forcing unwanted attention on victim, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>peatedly asking for dates, approaching too closely so their bodies would graze, occasionally touching her back, and grabbing victim while saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d was physically offensive and, therefore, disorderly within meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546, 548 (1996) (removing victim\u2019s window screen and engaging in voyeurism, which has sexual connotations, created physically offensive condition that supported defendant\u2019s conviction of \u201cbeing a disorderly person\u201d). With respect to the creation of a \u201cphysically offensive\u201d condition under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, \u201cphysical contact with a victim\u2019s person is not necessary to render one\u2019s actions physically offensive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 9, 18 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, supra. </em>However, a defendant must create a condition that would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent physical harm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 920. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra </em>(defendant\u2019s conduct in making or hanging flyers containing sexually explicit language directed at female student did not create physically offensive condition); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra </em>at 16, 18-19 (defendant\u2019s words and actions did not create physically offensive condition where defendant did not attempt to go near complainant, restrict her movement, follow her, or otherwise create physical offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As to \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts or language that are threatening, we have recognized that \u201c[sjexually explicit language, when directed at particular individuals in settings in which such communications are inappropriate and likely to cause severe distress, may be inherently threatening.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 234-235 (defendant\u2019s act of posting flyers in high school containing sexually explicit and aggressive language directed at female student was threatening and, therefore, disorderly within meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53). Further, we have explained that \u201clanguage properly may be understood and treated as a threat even in the absence of an explicit statement of an intention to harm the victim as long as circumstances support the victim\u2019s fearful or apprehensive response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 10 (defendant\u2019s spontaneous suggestion of sexual activity delivered at close quarters but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>involving physical contact supported finding that defendant had engaged in threatening behavior). When assessing whether acts or language creates a physically offensive condition or is threatening, \u201ccontext is critical.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 16. See <em>Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/ Willamette, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Coalition of Life Activists, </em>23 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1194 (D. Or. 1998) (whether \u201cstatement [is] innocent or threatening must be determined from the context in which it was made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We conclude that, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found the elements of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677. First, with respect to \u201coffensive\u201d acts or language, the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interactions with R.M. were such that a reasonable person would be upset, as R.M. was, and could legitimately construe the defendant\u2019s behavior as implicitly suggesting an imminent sexual assault. R.M. was a young woman walking back to her dormitory alone around 9:30 p.m. on a September evening. When she initially encountered the defendant, he called her \u201clittle girl\u201d and beckoned her to his car, using a high pitched tone of voice, so they could \u201ctalk.\u201d Not wanting to have anything to do with the defendant, R.M. started to walk away, but the defendant got out of his vehicle and pursued R.M., continuing to say, \u201cHey little girl, come on over,\u201d until he was finally standing within an arm\u2019s length of her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the defendant\u2019s entreaties proved unsuccessful, he returned to his vehicle and drove away, but then he reversed direction and proceeded to follow R.M. as she turned onto a dimly lit street devoid of other pedestrians. The defendant caught up to R.M., got out of his vehicle but left the door open and the engine running, approached R.M. so closely that she was aware of an unpleasant odor emanating from his body, and angrily demanded that she \u201cget in his car.\u201d Given everything that transpired, a jury properly could have found that the defendant\u2019s acts or language were \u201coffensive\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Next, with respect to \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts or language, the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interactions with R.M. were such that a reasonable person would construe the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>behavior as creating a \u201cphysically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233. Although the defendant did not touch R.M., his conduct \u201cfairly bristled with menace.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 10. In addition to the acts and language already described, including the defendant\u2019s aggressive vehicular pursuit of R.M., the defendant physically approached R.M., who was right in front of a wall, so closely that she was forced to turn and angle her body away from him in order to avoid touching him. While in such close proximity to R.M., the defendant was angry and demanding, and he gestured as if to place his arm around her shoulders and steer her toward his car. When R.M. managed to continue on her way, the defendant followed her until he heard R.M. reciting the license plate number of his vehicle, at which point he stormed off and drove away from the scene. R.M. then ran straight to her dormitory feeling \u201creally, really, really scared.\u201d When considering the entirety of the encounter between the defendant and R.M., a jury properly could have found that the defendant\u2019s acts or language were \u201cdisorderly\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>Pertaining to his conviction of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the defendant also contends that the performance of his trial counsel was deficient in two respects. Both arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Counsel is ineffective when his or her performance falls \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinarily fallible lawyer,\u201d and the substandard performance \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel typically should be raised, as they were here, in a motion for a new trial, where \u201can appropriate factual record can be developed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>448 Mass. 286, 289 (2007). See note 4, <em>supra. </em>We review the denial of a motion for a new trial \u201conly to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.... When, as here, the motion judge did not preside at trial, ... we regard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). A defendant seeking a new trial based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel bears the burden of establishing both prongs of the <em>Saferian </em>test. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>437 Mass. 204, 210 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The defendant first argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to dismiss the charge of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex on the ground that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, is unconstitutionally vague. In the defendant\u2019s view, the statute establishes no meaningful, objective standard for what conduct might be deemed \u201caccosting\u201d or \u201cannoying.\u201d Instead, he continues, what an individual considers to be accosting or annoying behavior depends entirely on that person\u2019s subjective sensitivities. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">It is well established that due process requires that criminal statutes that are not \u201csufficiently explicit to give clear warning as to proscribed activities\u201d be declared unconstitutional. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>464 Mass. 245, 248-249 (2013), and cases cited. However, \u201clegislative language need not be afforded \u2018mathematical precision\u2019 in order to pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 372 (1978). A statute is not vague \u201cif it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard so that men of common intelligence will know its meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, supra. </em>A sufficiently definite warning about what conduct has been made criminal \u201cmay be achieved by the common law meaning or statutory history of particular terms.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 300 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">As the motion judge correctly determined, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, is not unconstitutionally vague because in order for accosting or annoying behavior to be criminal, it must be both \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdisorderly,\u201d and those terms have been defined and explained in our jurisprudence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. at 781-783; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 231-235. Put slightly differently, an individual who has engaged in offensive and disorderly acts or language toward a person of the opposite sex has accosted or annoyed that person. We conclude that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, in a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The defendant also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the judge\u2019s instruction on \u201caccosting.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the judge limited the definition of a \u201cdisorderly act\u201d to the last prong of the definition set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233, namely \u201cbehavior that creates a physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose.\u201d In so doing, the defendant continues, the judge essentially equated the \u201cdisorderly\u201d element of the crime, with the \u201coffensive\u201d element, even though they are separate elements and the Commonwealth has to prove both beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy its evidentiary burden. The defendant asserts that the incomplete definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d prejudiced his defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Although the judge did not give the entire definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts or language as articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra, </em>he gave the portion of the definition that was applicable to the evidence presented at trial. As we have discussed, the defendant\u2019s interactions with R.M. were such that a reasonable person would construe the defendant\u2019s behavior as creating a \u201cphysically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge\u2019s failure to itemize all the alternative theories of the crime that had no application to this case was not error. We conclude that the defendant has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the judge\u2019s instruction on \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of conviction on the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>charging accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex under G.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty on the three indictments. The judge denied the motion. The defendant again moved for required findings of not guilty at the conclusion of all the evidence. The judge took no action on the motion. After the jury\u2019s verdicts, the defendant filed a motion for required findings of not guilty on the two charges of which he was found guilty. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">After filing his notice of appeal, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. He also filed a motion to vacate his conviction of attempted kidnapping on the ground that it was legally inconsistent with his acquittal on the charge of assault with intent to commit a felony. A judge in the Superior Court (who was not the trial judge because he had retired) denied both motions. The Appeals Court consolidated the defendant\u2019s direct appeal with his appeal from the denials of his postconviction motions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>84 Mass.

The Government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this confrontation was by conduct on the part of [the defendant] that was offensive and disorderly to a reasonable person. An offensive act causes real displeasure, anger, or resentment, and is repugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral. Not all noxious or disturbing remarks are criminal threats. The law does not punish boorish behavior per se. It must be an offensive act, as I have defined it, or a disorderly act, namely behavior that creates a physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose whether the resulting harm, if there is harm, is suffered in public by the public or in private by an individual. It\u2019s not necessary that the offensive acts take place in private. On the other hand, the statute, the law, criminalizes offenses and disorderly conduct, or language as I have defined that, that has a personal and private rather than a necessarily public impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">\u201cIt is up to you to consider all of the circumstances with respect to all three of the indictments, all of the circumstances when you\u2019re contemplating what the defendant\u2019s intent was, all of the circumstances when you are considering, with respect to \u2018accosting,\u2019 whether the behavior was, as I have said, oafish and gross, or whether on the other hand it was offensive and disorderly to a reasonable person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
