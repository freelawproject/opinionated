Several weeks earlier, Boston police officers had executed a search warrant for Figgs\u2019s apartment in connection with a criminal investigation of her brother, Damon Nunes, and had discovered, among other things, two plastic bags of marijuana, a .380 caliber Ruger pistol, and five rounds of ammunition. Figgs appealed the proposed termination. Following an informal hearing on February 22, 2012, a hearing officer, by decision dated August 6, 2012, upheld the termination of Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On August 24, 2012, Figgs filed a verified complaint in the Housing Court for injunctive and declaratory relief. She sought to enjoin the BHA from terminating her Section 8 housing subsidy on the ground that the informal hearing failed to satisfy her procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and she sought a declaration that the bases for her termination were insufficient. In response, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the BHA filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On March 19, 2013, a judge reversed the decision of the hearing officer, and he ordered the BHA to reinstate Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy back to November 22, 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The BHA appealed the judge\u2019s decision, the case was entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred it to this court on our own motion. We conclude that, notwithstanding the enactment of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, which decriminalized the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, the BHA properly terminated Figgs\u2019s participation in the Section 8 program due to evidence of other criminal activity in her rental premises, which constituted a serious lease violation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Housing Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Figgs and her three minor children are the authorized occupants of a subsidized apartment on Woolson Street in the Mattapan section of Boston. Nunes would visit her there and, on occasion, would babysit her children. Pursuant to paragraph 10(a) of her lease, Figgs agreed \u201cto refrain from engaging in and to cause Household member(s), guest(s), or any person under any Household member\u2019s control to refrain from engaging in any criminal or illegal activity in the rental Premises.\u201d BHA model lease \u00a7 10(a). As a participant in the Section 8 program, Figgs also signed a document entitled \u201cFamily Obligations of the Housing Choice Voucher Program,\u201d which stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>among its provisions, that \u201c[t]he family may not commit any serious or repeated violation of the lease.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By signing this document, she certified that she understood her obligations under the Section 8 program, and that her failure to comply with these obligations \u201cmay result in the termination of [her] participation in the program.\u201d According to Figgs, prior to the commencement of the underlying proceedings, she had been a participant in the Section 8 program for approximately ten years without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On October 18, 2011, members of the Boston police department initiated an investigation into Nunes after a confidential informant (Cl) told officers that the Cl had observed a black .380 caliber firearm in Nunes\u2019s bedroom at the apartment where Figgs lived with her children. The Cl believed that Nunes also lived there. The Cl told officers that Nunes had been in possession of this firearm \u201cfor some time,\u201d and that Nunes had been known on occasion to hide the firearm on the back porch of the apartment outside his bedroom window. As part of the investigation, officers independently observed Nunes entering and leaving the house in which the apartment was located several times over the course of approximately one week. Detective Rodney Best then applied for and obtained from a judge in the Superior Court a search warrant for Figgs\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On the evening of October 24, members of the Boston police department assigned to the youth violence strike force detained Nunes outside Figgs\u2019s apartment and executed the search warrant. The apartment was unoccupied at the time of the search. From the room that they understood to be Nunes\u2019s bedroom, officers recovered two bags of a leafy green substance believed to be marijuana,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> $653 in cash, a box of sandwich bags, a Massachusetts photographic identification card of Nunes, a Rhode Island medical card for Nunes, a red cellular telephone, and an \u201ciPod,\u201d a portable media player.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The police incident report did not indicate the amount or weight of the marijuana. In a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>bedroom, officers found a Massachusetts electronic bank transfer (EBT) card. They also recovered a sneaker from the back porch of the apartment, inside of which was a .380 caliber Ruger pistol that contained five rounds of ammunition. Nunes was arrested and charged with possession of a class D substance with intent to distribute, commission of this offense within a school zone, unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition, and improper storage of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On November 22, the BHA notified Figgs of its intent to terminate her participation in the Section 8 housing program. Among the stated reasons for the proposed termination were \u201c[s]erious or repeated violations of the lease,\u201d specifically paragraph 10(a), committed on October 24 when police discovered marijuana and a loaded firearm in her apartment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As authority for its decision, the BHA relied on 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(e) (2010) (obligation not to commit serious violation of lease), and 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(l)(i) (2010) (authority to terminate assistance for violation of any family obligation). Figgs appealed the proposed termination and requested an informal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Following a hearing on February 22, 2012, at which Figgs was represented by counsel and presented evidence on her own behalf, a hearing officer upheld the BHA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He stated that the police reports contained \u201csubstantial indicia of reliability to warrant a finding that Mr. Nunes was involved in crimes of drugs and unlawful possession of [a] firearm in [Figgs\u2019s] apartment.\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that the firearm was found on the back porch, he continued, that area was still part of the apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Given Figgs\u2019s acknowledgement that Nunes was permitted to go to her apartment, the hearing officer found that Nunes was Figgs\u2019s invitee and, as such, was under her control when he engaged in criminal activities in her apartment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on these findings, the hearing officer concluded that Figgs had violated paragraph 10(a) of her lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The hearing officer next considered whether the lease violation was \u201cserious,\u201d such that it warranted Figgs\u2019s termination from the Section 8 program. The hearing officer said that Nunes was involved in an activity that threatened the safety of others because a firearm containing five rounds of ammunition was recovered in the apartment. Moreover, he continued, the quantity of marijuana, the drug paraphernalia, the large amount of cash, and the firearm permitted an inference not only that Nunes was in possession of drugs, but also that he intended to distribute or sell drugs in the apartment and to use the apartment as a storage place for his firearm. The hearing officer determined that the BHA had sufficient grounds to propose termination of Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy for a serious lease violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Finally, in accordance with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2) (2010), the hearing officer considered whether there were mitigating circumstances that would warrant an outcome other than Figgs\u2019s termination from the Section 8 program. He stated that Figgs\u2019s claimed lack of knowledge about Nunes\u2019s behavior and her positive history as a Section 8 tenant did not offset the seriousness of the criminal activities in her apartment. The hearing officer found that Figgs had failed to exercise proper control in her apartment, which would have forestalled such criminal activities in the first place. He also found that because Figgs was not disabled, had graduated from a computer technology program, and was actively looking for employment, her termination from the Section 8 program would not cause a severe hardship to her family. Accordingly, the hearing officer concluded that termination of Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy was proper in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>her serious lease violation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In reversing the hearing officer\u2019s decision and entering judgment in favor of Figgs, the Housing Court judge concluded that the hearing officer committed legal errors that adversely affected Figgs\u2019s material rights. The judge determined that there was insufficient reliable evidence in the administrative record to support an inference that Nunes either engaged in drug-related criminal activity in Figgs\u2019s apartment or kept an illegal firearm and ammunition there. With regard to the marijuana, he pointed out that the police officers did not include in their written reports any observations or findings about its weight or amount. In the judge\u2019s view, this was a critical omission because under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, \u201cpossession of one ounce or less of marihuana shall only be a civil offense,\u201d not a crime. The judge stated that without evidence that the marijuana collectively weighed more than one ounce, there was no basis for the hearing officer to conclude that Nunes had engaged in the crime of possession of a class D substance. Moreover, he continued, there was no evidence that Nunes intended to distribute marijuana to others. The judge concluded that the hearing officer made a legal error in determining that Figgs had committed a serious violation of paragraph 10(a) of her lease \u201cbased upon illegal drug activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">With regard to the firearm and ammunition, the judge stated that the hearing officer relied primarily on the hearsay statements of the Cl, as set forth in the search warrant affidavit, to support his finding that Nunes kept a pistol in Figgs\u2019s apartment. The judge pointed out that, apart from such statements, there was no testimony from anyone who saw a firearm in Figgs\u2019s apartment, who saw Nunes with a firearm, or who saw Nunes place a firearm on the porch of the apartment. Further, the judge continued, there was no evidence that the second-floor porch was part of the apartment leased to Figgs, or that she had exclusive access to it. The judge concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s reliance on the Cl\u2019s hearsay statements constituted legal error because the statements were not supported by substantial indicia of reliability and, therefore, were not sufficient to support the termination of Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>2. <em>Standard of review. </em>The function of a civil action in the nature of certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, is \u201cto relieve aggrieved parties from the injustice arising from errors of law committed in proceedings affecting their justiciable rights when no other means of relief are open.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior </em>Court, 222 Mass. 542, 544 (1916). Certiorari also has been described as \u201ca limited procedure reserved for correction of substantial errors of law apparent on the record created before a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>448 Mass. 565, 575-576 (2007). \u201cTo obtain certiorari review of an administrative decision, the following three elements must be present: (1) a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding, (2) from which there is no other reasonably adequate remedy, and (3) a substantial injury or injustice arising from the proceeding under review.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Indeck </em>v. <em>Clients\u2019 Sec. Bd., </em>450 Mass. 379, 385 &amp; n.12 (2008). See <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>461 Mass. 451, 456-457 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It is well established that \u201cthe standard of review [under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4,] may vary according to the nature of the action for which review is sought.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Hingham, </em>462 Mass. 779, 792 (2012), quoting <em>Forsyth Sch. for Dental Hygienists </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>404 Mass. 211, 217 (1989). See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 49 (1977). Ordinarily, where the action being reviewed is a decision made in an adjudicatory proceeding where evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>is presented and due process protections are afforded, a court applies the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Black Rose, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 501, 504-505 (2001); <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 924-925 (1980); <em>Durbin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Kingston, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5-6 &amp; n.7 (2004). See also A.J. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 1917, at 501 n.55 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2013). Therefore, we consider whether the Housing Court judge correctly ruled that the hearing officer committed legal errors that adversely affected Figgs\u2019s material rights. As part of this inquiry, we examine the record to determine whether the hearing officer\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Congress has declared that it is a policy of the United States to \u201cpromote the goal of providing decent and affordable housing for all citizens through the efforts and encouragement of Federal, State, and local governments, and by the independent and collective actions of private citizens, organizations, and the private sector.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(4) (2012). To facilitate the achievement of this goal, Congress has further declared that the United States will \u201cassist States and political subdivisions of States to address the shortage of housing affordable to low-income families.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(1)(B) (2012). Through the Section 8 program, \u201cassistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing\u201d for the purposes of \u201caiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(l)(A) (Secretary of HUD may provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>financial support to public housing agencies for tenant-based assistance using established payment standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Congress has authorized the Secretary of HUD to \u201cmake such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out his functions, powers, and duties.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3535(d) (2012). Accordingly, the Secretary promulgated 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.1-982.643 (1995) as \u201ca unified statement of program requirements for the tenant-based housing assistance programs under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1437f).\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.2(a) (1999). The BHA, which administers the Section 8 program on behalf of HUD, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>was required to adopt \u201ca written administrative plan that establishes local policies for administration of the program in accordance with HUD [regulations and] requirements.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.54(a) (2001). See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.54(b) (2001). The BHA Administrative Plan for Section 8 Programs (rev. 2011) (BHA administrative plan) provides that it may, in its discretion, terminate a housing subsidy where the participant \u201chas violated any Family obligation under the [Section 8] program by action or failure to act as listed in section 13.5.2 or as set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551.\u201d BHA administrative plan \u00a7 13.3.9. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(l)(i) (BHA \u201cmay at any time . . . terminate program assistance for a participant. . . [i]f the family violates any family obligations under the program\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">More specifically, as pertinent here, \u00a7 13.5.2(d) of the BHA administrative plan states that \u201c[t]he Family may not commit any serious or repeated violation of the Lease.\u201d Similarly, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(e) provides that \u201c[t]he family may not commit any serious or repeated violation of the lease.\u201d Paragraph 10(a) of the lease signed by Figgs on January 25, 2011, states that she agrees \u201cto refrain from engaging in and to cause Household member(s), guest(s), or any person under any Household member\u2019s control to refrain from engaging in <em>any criminal or illegal activity </em>in the rental Premises\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In this appeal, the BHA first contends that the judge improperly relied on G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, rather than on Federal law, to decide that Nunes had <em>not </em>engaged in any criminal activity vis-a-vis the marijuana. As such, the BHA continues, the judge wrongly concluded that the hearing officer erred in finding that Figgs had committed a serious lease violation, predicated on Nunes\u2019s drug activity, that warranted her termination from the Section 8 program. Figgs counters by arguing that G. L. c. 94C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u00a7 32L, serves a vital function in assessing the severity of a lease violation. We begin our analysis by considering whether Nunes was engaged in any \u201ccriminal or illegal activity\u201d in Figgs\u2019s apartment, focusing first on the marijuana and subsequently on the firearm. To the extent that we conclude that Nunes did engage in such activity, we then consider whether the hearing officer erred in determining that it constituted a serious lease violation warranting the termination of Figgs\u2019s housing subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On November 4, 2008, Massachusetts voters approved St. 2008, c. 387, pursuant to the provisions of art. 48, The Initiative, Part V, \u00a7 1, as amended by art. 81, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 509 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. 459, 464 (2011). This initiative, entitled \u201cAn Act establishing a sensible State marihuana policy,\u201d was codified at G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N. See St. 2008, c. 387. It changed the status of possession of one ounce or less of marijuana from a criminal offense to a civil infraction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L. Notwithstanding the passage of this initiative, \u201c[possession of one ounce or less of marijuana with intent to distribute continues to be a crime, and the Commonwealth may prosecute it as such, but only where an intent to distribute is supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Humberto H., </em>466 Mass. 562, 570 (2013). See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The hearing officer found that Figgs violated paragraph 10(a) of her lease, in part, because Boston police officers, when executing the search warrant for her apartment, found two plastic bags of marijuana and \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in a bedroom used by Nunes. The hearing officer determined that Nunes was a person under Figgs\u2019s control when he engaged in drug activity in her apartment. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Significantly, no evidence was presented to the hearing officer regarding the weight of the marijuana. Nonetheless, Nunes was charged with possession of a class D substance with intent to distribute, which is a crime, irrespective of the actual weight of the marijuana. The hearing officer stated that two bags of marijuana, a box of sandwich bags <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(which was found not in the kitchen but in the bedroom), $653 in cash, and a firearm permitted an inference not only that Nunes possessed the drugs, but also that he intended to distribute or sell them from Figgs\u2019s apartment. We conclude that the hearing officer properly could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Figgs violated paragraph 10(a) of her lease because Nunes was engaged in criminal drug activity in her apartment. BHA model lease \u00a7 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We recognize that a significant rationale for the Housing Court judge\u2019s reversal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision was the fact that there was no evidence regarding the weight of the marijuana. When this fact was considered in the context of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, decriminalizing the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, the judge determined that there was no basis for the hearing officer to conclude that Nunes had engaged in the \u201ccrime\u201d of possession of a class D substance. Given the judge\u2019s additional determination that there was no evidence that Nunes intended to distribute marijuana to others, the judge concluded that the hearing officer erred in finding a lease violation predicated on drug activity. In light of our conclusion in the present appeal that there was substantial evidence of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, we do not decide whether possession of one ounce or less of marijuana alone would be sufficient to constitute an \u201cillegal activity in the rental Premises\u201d in violation of paragraph 10(a) of Figgs\u2019s lease. BHA model lease \u00a7 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Next, we consider whether Nunes unlawfully possessed a firearm and ammunition in Figgs\u2019s apartment. The BHA contends that, contrary to the judge\u2019s conclusion, the hearing officer did not err in relying on the hearsay statements of a Cl because they contained sufficient indicia of reliability. Further, the BHA continues, when such statements were evaluated in conjunction with other evidence presented at the informal hearing, the hearing officer properly could conclude that Nunes kept a loaded firearm in the rental premises. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As the BHA acknowledges, the hearing officer relied, in substantial part, on the hearsay statements of a Cl that were contained in the search warrant affidavit of Detective Best. Pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(5) (2000), evidence \u201cmay be considered [by a hearing officer] without regard to admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings.\u201d See BHA administrative plan \u00a7 13.7.5(f). In <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>453 Mass. 614, 624-625 (2009), we read this regulation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cspecific reference to the inapplicability of formal rules of evidence as support for the conclusion that there is no categorical prohibition of hearsay\u201d at a hearing on the termination of a tenant\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy. After analyzing the due process implications of relying on such evidence, we held that \u201chearsay evidence may form the basis of a [public housing authority\u2019s] decision to terminate Section 8 assistance so long as that evidence contains substantial indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627. See <em>Gammons </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Community Dev., </em>502 F. Supp. 2d 161, 165-166 (D. Mass. 2007) (hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative proceedings, such as Section 8 hearing, where relevant). See also <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10800 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>459 Mass. 603, 638 (2011) (\u201cIn the context of administrative proceedings, hearsay evidence bearing indicia of reliability constitutes admissible and substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In the present case, the Cl told officers that he had observed a black .380 caliber firearm in Nunes\u2019s bedroom at Figgs\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Cl further told officers that Nunes had been in possession of this weapon for some time, and that Nunes had been known on occasion to hide the firearm on the back porch of the apartment outside his bedroom window.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As part of their investigation, officers independently observed Nunes entering and leaving the house in which Figgs\u2019s apartment was located several times over the course of approximately one week. Based on all the information set forth in Detective Best\u2019s affidavit,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a Superior Court judge issued a search warrant, finding that there was probable cause to believe that an illegal firearm would be found in Figgs\u2019s apartment, either on the person or in the pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>session of Nunes. Once officers executed the search warrant, they found the loaded firearm on the back porch of the apartment, just as the Cl had told them. The hearsay statements of the Cl bore sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant their consideration by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Apart from these hearsay statements, the hearing officer also relied on police incident reports stating that, once officers searched Figgs\u2019s apartment and recovered the loaded pistol, Nunes was arrested and charged with, among other things, unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>453 Mass. at 627 (police report offering detailed factual account based on personal observations of detective was sufficiently reliable to serve as basis for termination decision). In totality, the hearing officer properly could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Nunes unlawfully possessed a firearm and ammunition in Figgs\u2019s apartment. Unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition are criminal offenses. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On the basis of the police officers\u2019 discovery of both evidence of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and a loaded firearm in Figgs\u2019s apartment, the hearing officer properly concluded that Figgs violated paragraph 10(a) of her lease because Nunes, a person under her control, had engaged in criminal activity in the rental premises. The judge below erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We now turn our attention to the question whether the hearing officer abused his discretion in determining that such activity by Nunes constituted a serious lease violation warranting Figgs\u2019s termination from the Section 8 program. Absent an eviction, which did not occur in this case, Federal law does not mandate a tenant\u2019s termination from the Section 8 program for a serious lease violation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rather, a public housing authority <em>may </em>termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>nate a Section 8 housing subsidy if the family violates any of the family obligations set forth under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551, which include the obligation to \u201cnot commit any serious or repeated violation of the lease.\u201d See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(l)(i). See also BHA administrative plan \u00a7 13.3.9. The termination decision rests within the discretion of the BHA. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>453 Mass. at 630-631; <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 103, 111-112 (2006). See also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>450 Mass. at 638 n.20, quoting <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Housing Auth. of Camden, </em>278 F. Supp. 2d 365, 371 (D.N.J. 2003) (housing authorities not required under law, nor encouraged by HUD, to terminate assistance in every circumstance where basis for termination exists). When deciding whether to terminate a family\u2019s participation in the Section 8 program because of action or failure to act by a family member, \u201c[t]he PHA may consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i) (2010). Another circumstance that may be relevant in a termination decision, depending on the nature of the particular case, is the fact that Massachusetts has decriminalized the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Review under an abuse of discretion standard requires that we \u201clook for decisions based on \u2018whimsy, caprice, or arbitrary or idiosyncratic notions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 670 (2012), quoting <em>Bucchiere </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>396 Mass. 639, 642 (1986). We do not disturb a decision \u201csimply because [we] might have reached a different result; the standard of review is not substituted judgment.\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>supra, </em>quoting <em>Bucchiere </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 641. As we already have described, the hearing officer evaluated the nature of the criminal activity by Nunes in Figgs\u2019s apartment, as well as mitigating circumstances that could point away from the termination of Figgs\u2019s Section 8 housing subsidy. Contrast <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>450 Mass. at 636-637. We conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings as to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Accordingly, the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in determining that Figgs had committed a serious lease violation warranting her termination from the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the Housing Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8), HUD \u201cpays rental subsidies so eligible families can afford decent, safe and sanitary housing.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(a)(1) (1999). See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>453 Mass. 614, 615 n.2 (2009); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>450 Mass. 626, 626 n.l (2008); <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous.

HUD provides housing assistance funds to the PHA. HUD also provides funds for PHA administration of the programs.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(a)(1).

L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. In light of his decision regarding the certiorari claim, the judge did not address the injunction or due process claims. In her brief in this appeal, Figgs has not raised any due process claims. It appears from the record that Figgs received proper notice of the BHA\u2019s intent to terminate her Section 8 housing subsidy, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.554(a) (1999); was afforded an informal hearing conducted by an impartial decision maker, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a)(l)(v), (e)(4)(i) (2000); was represented by counsel at the hearing, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(3) (2000); was given an opportunity to present evidence and question witnesses, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(5) (2000); and was issued a written decision stating the reasons for the decision, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(6) (2000), and explaining the hearing officer\u2019s assessment of mitigating facts, see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i) (2010).

The hearing officer found that, because the evidence was insufficient to prove that Nunes was living in Figgs\u2019s apartment, these two grounds for termination lacked merit.
