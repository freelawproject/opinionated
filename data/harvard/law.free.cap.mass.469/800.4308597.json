G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par. If the unpaid party receives a judgment for any amount due and payable by the insurer, it also may recover its costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The primary question before us is whether an unpaid party who has brought suit and thereafter refused the insurer\u2019s tender of amounts due and payable, made prior to the entry of judgment, may proceed with the suit and, if successful, obtain a judgment for those amounts as well as its costs and attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that it may proceed with the action under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Barron Chiropractic &amp; Rehabilitation, PC. (Barron), provided chiropractic services to Nicole Jean-Pierre following her automobile accident on August 20, 2008. Jean-Pierre was injured while driving a vehicle insured by the defendant Norfolk &amp; Dedham Group (Norfolk) pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, which requires compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance, including PIP benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 34A, 34M.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Norfolk received notice of the accident on August 22, 2008, and, on October 10, 2008, received Jean-Pierre\u2019s application for PIP benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, pursuant to its contractual right under the terms of Jean-Pierre\u2019s insurance policy, as well as language in the PIP provision, Norfolk requested that Jean-Pierre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>undergo an independent medical examination (IME)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by Kevin Morgan, a licensed chiropractor of its selection. On October 27, 2008, Morgan submitted his IME report to Norfolk. The report stated that, while treatments up to the date of the IME had been appropriate, Jean-Pierre had reached \u201cmaximum therapeutic benefit.\u201d Based on this report, Norfolk concluded that treatments Barron provided Jean-Pierre after the date of the IME were unreasonable and unnecessary. A few days thereafter, Norfolk provided Jean-Pierre\u2019s counsel with a copy of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Approximately nine months later, on July 27, 2009, Norfolk received a response to Morgan\u2019s IME report from Scott Hayden, a licensed chiropractor and a Barron employee. Hayden disagreed with Morgan\u2019s conclusion that Jean-Pierre had reached a medical end result at the time of the IME, stating instead that proper rehabilitation had required nine treatment visits after that date. On August 17, 2009, Morgan sent Norfolk an addendum to his initial IME report, indicating that Hayden\u2019s rebuttal had not altered his assessment of Jean-Pierre\u2019s care, and stating further that subsequent care offered by Barron, while \u201cwithin acceptable care guidelines\u201d and \u201creasonable and necessary,\u201d appeared aimed largely at preexisting conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">As an additional component of its investigation of Jean-Pierre\u2019s claim, Norfolk sent Barron\u2019s billing statements to BME Gateway (BME), an independent third party, for financial analysis. BME uses a computer database to determine whether a medical provider has sought fees that are usual, customary, and reasonable within a particular geographic region.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Barron submitted a bill to Norfolk seeking $3,940 in payment for its treatment of Jean-Pierre. Upon review, Norfolk concluded that it was not liable for the entirety of this requested amount. Based on BME\u2019s assessment, Norfolk deducted $64.05 from Barron\u2019s bill, allowing only $3,875.95 on that ground. In reliance on Morgan\u2019s IME report, Norfolk also limited its payment to service provided prior to the date of the IME, declining to pay a further $1,480 in charges for treatment occurring after October 27, 2008. In total, Norfolk determined that it was liable for only $2,395.95 of Barron\u2019s submitted fees, resulting in a disputed amount of $1,544.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>On November 25, 2009, more than one year after Jean-Pierre had submitted her application for PIP benefits, Barron filed a complaint in the District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Barron sought payment of $1,544.05, plus interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M; multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, for alleged unfair or deceptive practices regarding Jean-Pierre\u2019s insurance claim; and multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11, for violations of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), which prohibits insurers from engaging in unfair settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">At some point prior to trial, Norfolk learned that Morgan\u2019s fee to appear as an expert witness was $500 per hour, with a minimum of five hours to be billed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although still maintaining that it did not owe Barron any additional payments, Norfolk determined that its anticipated litigation costs would exceed the amount of the disputed medical fees by a substantial sum. Accordingly, on September 28, 2010, six days prior to the second scheduled trial date,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Norfolk sent Barron a check for $1,544.05 with an attached check stub that stated \u201cfull and final settlement for Nicole Jean Pierre.\u201d Norfolk included a letter stating that its payment was made pursuant to <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88 (2001) <em>(Fasdone)-, </em>the letter requested that Barron sign an acknowledgment of the receipt of final payment and file a stipulation of dismissal in the District Court as to its claims under the PIP provision. On October 12, 2010, Barron\u2019s counsel returned the check to Norfolk\u2019s counsel with a letter stating, \u201cYour client\u2019s offer of settlement is rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Norfolk then filed a motion for summary judgment as to both the G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, and G. L. c. 93A claims, supported by an affidavit from its claims supervisor, as well as by relevant medical records and BME\u2019s financial analysis. Barron filed an opposition, but neither alleged that any issues of material fact remained in dispute, nor included any counter affidavits or other documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>indicating any factual dispute. A District Court judge granted Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and on Barron\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division of the District Court affirmed the judgment. Barron appealed, and we granted Norfolk\u2019s subsequent application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. Dawes, 369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976). If the moving party, in its pleadings and supporting documentation pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002), asserts the absence of any triable issue, the nonmoving party must respond and make specific allegations sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Drakopoulos </em>v. <em>U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>465 Mass. 775, 777-778 (2013). <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 16-17 (1989). Bare assertions made in the nonmoving party\u2019s opposition will not defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>446 Mass. 814, 821 (2006). Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974) (\u201cA party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading\u201d). We review the disposition of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Barron contends that summary judgment was inappropriate as to its claim under \u00a7 34M. Because Barron declined Norfolk\u2019s late tender, made on the eve of trial, it remained an \u201cunpaid party\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 34M, and was entitled to seek a judgment for benefits due and payable. Relying on <em>Fascione, supra, </em>Norfolk maintains that it was entitled to summary judgment once it tendered a complete payment of benefits owed, notwithstanding Barron\u2019s rejection of that tender. Because we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that Barron was permitted to refuse Norfolk\u2019s tender and pursue its suit, the order granting Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, claim must be vacated and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Barron also contests the entry of summary judgment for Norfolk as to the G. L. c. 93A claims. In its opposition to Norfolk\u2019s motion, however, Barron did not allege the existence of any factual disputes and submitted no documentation that might reveal such disputes. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e) (\u201c[A]n adverse party [to a motion for summary judgment] . . . must set forth specific facts [in its affidavits and pleadings] showing that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>a genuine issue for trial\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the order granting Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">a. <em>Claim under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. </em>The PIP provision, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, specifies that an \u201cunpaid party,\u201d that is, a claimant whose PIP benefits remain unpaid for more than thirty days after those benefits become \u201cdue and payable,\u201d shall have the right to bring an action in contract against an insurer to recover those benefits, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs should the unpaid party prevail.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under common-law principles of contract, which we have deemed applicable to \u201caction[s] in contract\u201d under \u00a7 34M, see <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Premier Ins. Co., </em>446 Mass. 689, 691 (2006) <em>(Boehm), </em>a plaintiff may reject a defendant\u2019s disputed tender of payment, made after the date set for payment has expired, and litigate its breach of contract claim to completion. Here, Norfolk attempted to tender the disputed $1,544.05 nearly one year after Barron had commenced its contract action, and just six days prior to trial. We conclude that Barron properly could reject this tender, forgo the certainty it offered, and opt instead to pursue recovery not only of the disputed unpaid PIP benefits, but also of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs provided by the PIP provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">To construe this provision, we \u201clook first to the text of the statute.\u201d <em>Boehm, supra </em>at 690. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., provides that suits brought to recover PIP benefits shall sound in contract, noting that an unpaid claimant \u201cshall be deemed a party to a contract with the insurer\u201d and may bring an \u201caction in contract\u201d to obtain any benefits held to be due and payable. Given these unambiguous statutory references to actions in contract, we have held that a \u00a7 34M suit brought to procure unpaid PIP benefits is governed generally by ordinary contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>principles.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Boehm, supra </em>at 689, we considered whether G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, conferred the right to a jury trial. In concluding that PIP claimants were so entitled, we emphasized that an unpaid claimant \u201chas a \u2018right\u2019 to seek recovery through \u2018an action in contract,\u2019 \u201d deeming this text \u201cdeterminative of the issue at bar.\u201d <em>Boehm, supra </em>at 691, quoting G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par. At common law, we noted, parties to contract actions \u201cenjoyed the right to a jury trial,\u201d and \u201cthe Legislature is presumed \u2018to know the preexisting law and the decisions of this court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boehm, supra, </em>quoting <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 313 (1949).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201cHad the Legislature intended to treat contract actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 34M, fourth par., differently from the ordinary contract action, it could have said so explicitly as it did in the very next paragraph, which directs insurers to resolve disagreements concerning subrogation through arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\"><em>Boehm, supra. </em>\u201cThat \u00a7 34M does not explicitly refer to the right to a jury trial,\u201d we concluded, \u201cis of no consequence.\u201d <em>Boehm, supra </em>at 691-692. The Legislature\u2019s explicit determination that an unpaid PIP claimant may file a contract suit \u201ccarries with it the principle[s]\u201d of the common law of contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 692. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, 392 </em>Mass. 688, 690 (1984) (statute must be construed as consistent with common law absent clear contrary legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Principles of contract law are \u201cdispositive\u201d of the present case, just as they were of the question addressed in <em>Boehm. </em>At common law, tender of a sum owed under a contract is valid only when made prior to the parties\u2019 agreed-upon date for payment, even if that tender is for the entire disputed sum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There can \u201cbe no \u2018tender\u2019 in the legal meaning of the word if the offer was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>after the day fixed for payment had passed and the contract to pay had been broken.\u201d <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>290 Mass. 423, 426 (1935). See <em>City Bank </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>3 Pick. 414, 418 (1826) (\u201cthe plea of tender is bad, the tender not having been made until the day after the debt became due against the defendants\u201d); 17B C.J.S. Contracts, Tender of Performance \u00a7 729 (2011) (\u201cIn order to be valid, a tender of payment on a contract must be timely ...\u201d); M.G. Perlin &amp; S.H. Blum, Procedural Forms Annotated \u00a7 54:230, Tender (6th ed. 2009) (tender invalid if made after payment date).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">A party who receives an invalid late tender is not obliged to accept it. See <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Wall, supra </em>at 427 (plaintiff permitted to reject tender made on first day of trial for breach of contract and pursue his claim to judgment); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>160 Mass. 278, 280 (1894) (plaintiff who accepted complete tender after filing breach of contract suit \u201ccould have preserved his right to interest by way of damages, and also to costs, by declining to accept the payment\u201d); <em>Loitherstein </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 91, 92 (1980) (defendant\u2019s late tender, which plaintiff rejected, did not extinguish plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages due to breach). Where a defendant attempts to tender payment after it has already breached the contract, \u201cthe rights of the parties depend, not on a tender, but on the acceptance of a payment which discharged the cause of action.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harrington, supra </em>at 280. Even if a plaintiff receives a tender of payment in full for a disputed sum, as here, \u201can underlying debt may not be discharged unless payment is accepted.\u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>391 Mass. 321, 326 (1984). Late tender alone therefore does not preclude a plaintiff from filing a claim for breach or pursuing a then-pending suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Here, Norfolk\u2019s tender of $1,544.05 was made past the deadline set forth in the PIP provision. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34M, establishes the date of breach relevant to unpaid PIP benefits, providing that, where \u201cbenefits due and payable remain unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>for more than thirty days, any unpaid party . . . shall therefore have a right to commence an action in contract.\u201d After the expiration of that thirty-day period, Barron had yet to receive $1,544.05 in medical fees which it maintains were \u201cdue and payable.\u201d Norfolk sent its check for that amount to Barron on September 28, 2010, nearly two years after Jean-Pierre first notified Norfolk of her claim for PIP benefits, and nearly one year after Barron filed suit seeking payment of the disputed balance. The \u201cday fixed for payment had passed,\u201d <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Wall, supra </em>at 426, and after that point, \u201ca tender cannot be effectual to bar the action for damages.\u201d <em>Suffolk Bank </em>v. <em>Worcester Bank, </em>5 Pick. 106, 108 (1827) (where there had been no tender at time contract suit commenced, \u201cthe tender afterwards cannot avail in defence of the action\u201d). Norfolk\u2019s tender therefore was improper under principles of common law, and Barron was permitted to reject it and seek an award of the PIP benefits it maintained were \u201cdue and payable,\u201d as well as its attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Norfolk maintains nonetheless that, under our decision in <em>Fascione, </em>its tender of payment was sufficient to discharge all of its obligations to Barron, and that the allowance of its motion for summary judgment was proper.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This argument misapprehends the relevance of <em>Fascione </em>to the circumstances here. In <em>Fascione, supra </em>at 89, an insurer inadvertently failed to pay the full amount of a PIP claimant\u2019s benefits, and tendered the remaining payment after the claimant had filed suit under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, to recover the amounts due. We held that the claimant, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>accepted the insurer\u2019s tender and was fully compensated for her medical expenses, was not thereafter permitted to seek costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and interest under \u00a7 34M. <em>Fascione, supra </em>at 89-90, 92-94. A claimant may only receive costs and attorney\u2019s fees upon obtaining \u201ca judgment for any amount due and payable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The phrase \u201cany amount due and payable,\u201d we concluded, encompassed only PIP benefits themselves, and did not include interest. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93. Because the claimant had accepted the insurer\u2019s full payment of her PIP expenses, she could not recover a judgment for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><em>Fascione </em>affords no basis upon which to conclude that a PIP claimant, having filed an action in contract against an insurer for its delayed payment of benefits, is obliged to accept late tender and thus relinquish its suit. We held in that case that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, provides no further remedy to a claimant who has accepted an insurer\u2019s late, but complete, tender of payment; this in no way was intended to suggest that a claimant may not reject such tender in an effort to obtain the attorney\u2019s fees and costs mandated by \u00a7 34M. Indeed, our analysis relied on the claimant\u2019s acceptance of the insurer\u2019s reimbursement, which removed any basis for a judgment in favor of the claimant by compensating her for all \u201camount[s] due and payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Moreover, to interpret <em>Fascione </em>as Norfolk suggests would contravene the fee-shifting provision of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, thereby enabling insurers to delay their payment of benefits without consequence. The Legislature was \u201caware of the long delays in getting financial aid to the injured person\u201d when it enacted the PIP provision. <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 20 (1971). Accordingly, the thirty-day payment period, in conjunction with the provision for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, together protect \u201cthe right and need of all accident victims to simple and speedy justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. Since a cause of action lies against an insurer who fails to pay PIP benefits within the statutory period, and since the insurer will be liable for attorney\u2019s fees and costs if a claimant obtains a judgment for the unpaid amount, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, encourages the prompt payment of benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>But these incentives would diminish if an insurer could disregard the thirty-day deadline yet nevertheless evade liability for attorney\u2019s fees and costs by tendering benefits at will after a suit has commenced. Under Norfolk\u2019s approach, the timeframe for prompt payment established by the Legislature would have little effect, since an insurer\u2019s delay would engender no more serious consequence than the payment of the very benefits sought from it at the outset. See <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969) (\u201cAn intention to enact a barren and ineffective provision is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The provision for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs would be similarly toothless. When an insurer\u2019s payment of PIP benefits, as here, is made on the eve of trial, a claimant may well have incurred substantial expenses. If, as Norfolk suggests, a claimant were required to accept such late tender, she would be bound to forgo the recovery of those expenses whenever an insurer offered belated reimbursement of a disputed sum. See <em>Pine </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>404 Mass. 411, 416 (1989) (\u201cIf an offer of the statutory minimum amount of damages were all that could be expected by plaintiffs, there would be no need for provision in the law for the award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). Moreover, a contract suit under \u00a7 34M is only necessary, in the first instance, if an insurer fails to reimburse a claimant by the statutory deadline. Under Norfolk\u2019s approach, far from reducing the amount of litigation, \u00a7 34M would provide incentives for insurers to delay payment until their insureds filed suit to collect amounts owed; on a date of its choosing, an insurer then unilaterally could terminate litigation prompted only by its own delay. \u201c[Ejquity will not permit\u201d such a result, which would allow an insurer to \u201cdefeat a remedy which except for his misconduct would not be available.\u201d <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1038, 1039 (1984), quoting <em>Deitrick </em>v. <em>Greaney, </em>309 U.S. 190, 196 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In sum, an insurer\u2019s late tender of PIP benefits, made after a claimant has filed suit and which the claimant declines to accept, does not entitle an insurer to summary judgment. To be sure, an insurer may opt to tender payment of outstanding PIP benefits after the filing of a suit, and if a claimant accepts that tender, the action under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, will be extinguished. See <em>Fas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>done, supra </em>at 91. But the mere tender of such late payment will not, in itself, inoculate an insurer against liability for attorney\u2019s fees and costs if the claimant opts to refuse tender and subsequently obtains a judgment for PIP benefits. Here, because Barron rejected Norfolk\u2019s tendered check for $1,544.05, it remained an \u201cunpaid party,\u201d and Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, claim should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">b. <em>Claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11. </em>Barron contends also that the judge erred in allowing Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To determine whether a business practice is unfair under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, we assess \u201c(1) whether the practice ... is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; [and] (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\u201d <em>PMP Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In the circumstances of this case, there was no error in allowing Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claims. Norfolk\u2019s motion stated that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the propriety of Norfolk\u2019s dealings under G. L. c. 93A, and indicated that Norfolk acted, at all times, in accordance with appropriate business judgments. In support of its motion, Norfolk included a detailed affidavit by one of its senior claims supervisors outlining its conduct in handling Jean-Pierre\u2019s claim for PIP benefits. According to the affidavit, Norfolk relied in good faith on the IME report in deciding to limit payment to dates of medical service prior to October 27, 2008, and relied similarly on BME\u2019s fee analysis in reducing Barron\u2019s submitted bills by $64.05. See <em>Duclersaint </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, </em>427 Mass. 809, 814 (1998); <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Y.C.N. Transp. Co., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 215 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In its opposition to Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Barron did not allege that material facts were in dispute, stating only that \u201c[n]othing in Norfolk\u2019s submission demonstrates that no genuine issue of fact remains on the G. L. c. 93A claims. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the plaintiff has no burden of rebuttal.\u201d Nor did the opposition include counter affidavits or any other countervailing documentation that might have demonstrated the existence of genuine issues of material fact. Although Barron had alluded in its initial complaint to Norfolk\u2019s purported bad faith, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not \u201csimply rest on his pleadings.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976). See <em>LaLonde </em>v. <em>Eissner, </em>405 Mass. 207, 209-210 (1989) (granting summary judgment for defendant where plaintiffs did not dispute any relevant material fact). Cf. Rule 9A(a)(2) of the Rules of the Superior Court (2014) (\u201cAffidavits and other documents setting forth or offering evidence of facts on which the opposition is based shall be served with the memorandum in opposition [to a motion for summary judgment]\u201d). Having failed to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), Barron was not entitled to trial on its G. L. c. 93A claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing judgment for Norfolk on count 1, the G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, claim, is vacated and set aside, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on that claim. The entry of judgment for Norfolk on counts two and three, the claims under G. L. c. 93A, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Personal injury protection (PIP) benefits consist of \u201call reasonable expenses incurred within two years from the date of [the] accident for necessary medical, surgical, x-ray, and dental services\u201d and, for employed persons, \u201cany amounts actually lost by reason of inability to work and earn wages or salary or their equivalent.\u201d G.

L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, third par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We have construed the term \u201cunpaid party\u201d in G.

The medical provider may thus \u201cstep into the shoes of the insured and bring an action in contract to recover PIP benefits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In its pretrial memorandum, dated May 11, 2010, Norfolk indicated that Morgan was expected to testify as to the substance of his independent medical examination and report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The trial initially was scheduled for August 3, 2010, but was rescheduled at the parties\u2019 request for October 4, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Specifically, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\">8Personal injury protection benefits ... shall be due and payable as loss accrues, upon receipt of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of expenses and loss incurred .... In any case where benefits due and payable remain unpaid for more than thirty days, any unpaid party shall be deemed a party to a contract with the insurer responsible for payment and shall therefore have a right to commence an action in contract for payment of amounts therein determined to be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter .... If the unpaid party recovers a judgment for any amount due and payable by the insurer, the court shall assess against the insurer in addition thereto costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Barron contends also that it was entitled to reject Norfolk\u2019s efforts at late tender pursuant to the tender statute, G. L. c. 232A, \u00a7 1. Since we conclude that common-law contract principles govern here, we do not address this argument. See <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88, 90 n.l (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Norfolk never conceded its liability for $1,544.05 of Barron\u2019s requested fees. Nevertheless, in light of the litigation costs it might incur should the case proceed to trial, Norfolk contends that it made a business decision to tender this disputed amount. In conjunction with payments already made, the tendered payment, if accepted, would have compensated Barron for all of the PIP benefits it sought, not including interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">To be sure, a plaintiff also is entitled to accept and thereby validate an otherwise improper late tender. Such acceptance removes the \u201cfoundation of [a potential contract] suit\u201d and necessitates the dismissal of a suit already commenced. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>160 Mass. 278, 280 (1894) (plaintiff who accepted tender made after suit had commenced not entitled to damages in form of interest and costs). See <em>Hamlen </em>v. <em>Rednalloh Co., </em>291 Mass. 119, 126-127 (1935) (plaintiff could not recover costs after accepting late payment in full with interest); <em>Paul Revere Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Castle, </em>231 Mass. 129, 132 (1918) (\u201cwhen the plaintiff accepted the principal in full payment the right to recover the interest.. . was extinguished\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The parties\u2019 disagreement as to the import of <em>Fascione, supra, </em>reflects differences in decisions of the Appellate Division of the District Court. Certain of those decisions have interpreted <em>Fascione </em>to mean that an insurer\u2019s tender of a full PIP payment, made after a claimant filed suit but before judgment has entered, will extinguish the G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, claim even where the claimant rejects such tender. See, e.g., Essex Chiropractic Office, LLC vs. Plymouth Rock Assur. Corp., Mass. Dist. Ct. App. Div., No. 08-ADMS-10032 (Dec. 17, 2008) (\u201cit would be an absurd result if a medical provider were able to defeat the holding of <em>Fascione </em>merely by rejecting the tender of full payment of a PIP claim\u2019\u2019); Kratzer vs. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., Mass. Dist. Ct. App. Div., No. 9834 (May 28, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Other Appellate Division decisions, however, have concluded that \u201c[njothing in <em>Fascione </em>dictates that a tender of the balance due under the \u00a7 34M claim must necessarily stop that part of the litigation in its tracks and require a judgment of zero damages.\u201d Metro West Med. Assocs., Inc. vs. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., Mass. Dist. Ct. App. Div., No. 10-ADMS-10009 (June 29, 2010). See Olympic Physical Therapy vs. ELCO Admin. Servs., Mass. Dist. Ct. App. Div., 10-ADMS-10017 (Aug. 17, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\">This, in turn, is intended to lessen the expense of compulsory automobile insurance for all Massachusetts drivers, by reducing the number of claims that insurers will choose to litigate.

L. c. 93A, one based on Norfolk\u2019s asserted failure to adhere to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, and one stemming from Norfolk\u2019s purported unfair claim settlement practices as defined by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) <em>(b), </em>(d), (e), (f), (g), and (n). As did the Appellate Division, we assess both claims together.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
