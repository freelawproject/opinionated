The information also alleged three prior convictions of felony against appellant Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">A jury trial was duly waived and the issues submitted by stipulation on the transcript of the preliminary examination. Defendant was adjudged guilty and the charges of the three prior convictions were found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">It is contended on appeal \u201cThat no testimony <em>were </em>adduced from any of the police officers that would prove or show that the appellant \u2018entered\u2019 the stores, or committed the burglarys so falsely alleged in the information by the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cThat the convictions are based upon the false averment of \u2018enter\u2019 in the information; the wilful and knowing use of \u2018perjured testimony\u2019 ,of the district attorney and must be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">There is no merit to the appeal. Defendant and co-defendant were caught by the officers burglarizing two stores about 2:30 a.m. That the evidence supports the judgment there can be no question. Who are principals in the commission of a crime as defined by section 31 of the Penal Code refutes all of appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1953, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 5, 1953.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
