The court awarded her $2,000 in a lump sum \u201cas and for plaintiff\u2019s future maintenance\u201d and imposed a lien upon appellant\u2019s separate property to secure its payment. Appellant attacks only the portion of the decree creating the lien, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">\u201cIt is Appellant\u2019s contention that the lien affixed by the Court on Appellant\u2019s real property where there were no Minor Children the issue of said Marriage, the lien was unwarranted and improper and cannot be supported as a matter of Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Appellant cites as his only authorities Civil Code section 142, and <em>Baldwin </em>v. Baldwin, 28 Cal.2d 406, 412-413 [170 P.2d 670]. The citations do not support the argument. In the Baldwin case the court quoted that portion of Civil Code, section 142, which provides that where \u201cthere are no children, and either party has a separate estate sufficient for his or her proper support, no allowance shall be made from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>separate estate of the other party. \u2019 \u2019 While there are no children of this marriage the court expressly found \u201cthat plaintiff has no separate estate.\u201d One of the conditions of section 142 above quoted is therefore not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The applicable rule is thus stated in <em>Money </em>v. <em>Money, </em>60 Cal.App. 759, 761-762 [214 P. 250] : \u201cOur supreme court has definitely determined also that in an action for divorce where the court . . . makes provision for the future support of the wife, the judgment may require the payment of a sum in gross, and provide, as security for the payment thereof, that a lien be enforced against the separate property of the husband.\u201d (See, also, <em>Sanguinetti </em>v. <em>Sanguinetti, </em>9 Cal.2d 95, 102 [69 P.2d 845, 111 A.L.R. 342] and cases there cited; <em>Scheibe </em>v. <em>Scheibe, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 336, 343 [134 P.2d 835].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Goodell, Acting P. J., and Jones, J. pro tem., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
