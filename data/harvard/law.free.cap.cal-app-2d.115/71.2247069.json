At the expiration of two years no proper placement program had been developed for petitioner and it was determined by the authority that the interests of the petitioner and the public would not be served by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>immediate release of petitioner on parole. Petitioner\u2019s case was reviewed by the medical authorities from time to time and on February 26, 1952, the action of January 29, 1951, granting parole was rescinded. On September 24, 1952, following several hearings, further consideration of release on parole was postponed for one calendar year. The action taken in each instance was based on extensive medical examinations and reports of a disturbed mental condition suffered by petitioner which fully justified rescission of the order granting parole and the further detention of petitioner for observation and treatment. No legal ground exists for petitioner\u2019s release on habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
