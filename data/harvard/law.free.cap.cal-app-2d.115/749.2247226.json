The questions of (a) constitutionality of section 739 of the Penal Code, and (b) the jurisdiction of the trial court were matters which could properly have been raised upon an appeal from the judgment and are not matters which are reviewable in a proceeding for the issuance of a writ of error <em>coram nobis.
