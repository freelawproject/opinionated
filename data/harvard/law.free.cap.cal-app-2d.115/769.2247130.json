The judgment rendered therein, in favor of plaintiff, was affirmed upon appeal by this court. <em>(Howarth </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 266 [183 P.2d 670].) The opinion in that case sets forth at length the terms of the agreement and they need not be restated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">An examination of the previous opinion of this court and appellant\u2019s brief herein, discloses that appellant\u2019s attack upon the judgment appealed from is based upon the identical grounds assigned upon his appeal from the judgment in the previous action, and all of which were decided adversely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>him by the court. Under the circumstances no detailed consideration thereof is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Briefly stated, appellant\u2019s primary contention is that the agreement sued upon was incorporated and merged in the decree granted by the District Court in and for Tooele County, Utah, in the divorce action between the parties, and as corollary thereto (a) that the payments under said agreement were in the nature of alimony and hence subject to modification by the Utah court, and (b) any attempt by a California court to enforce payment thereof constitutes a violation of the full faith and credit clause of the federal Constitution. In the previous action between the parties heretofore adverted to, the Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles decided each of these contentions adversely to appellant, and, as stated, upon appeal this judgment was affirmed.  Hence appellant is estopped from relitigating the same questions in the instant proceeding. \u201cA judgment for the plaintiff on one installment is not a bar to an action for a subsequently accruing installment; it is, however, a conclusive adjudication as against the defendant of everything determined therein, including the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the contract and his right to maintain an action thereon.\u201d (15 Cal.Jur., p. 156, \u00a7202, and cases there cited.) Moreover, were we at liberty to reexamine the questions sought to be presented, we see no reason to depart from the views expressed with reference thereto upon the prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Doran, Acting P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 2,1953.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
