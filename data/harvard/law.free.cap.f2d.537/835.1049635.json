A <em>Miranda </em>warning was required, he contends, because he was a \u201cputative defendant\u201d at the time he gave the grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">We held our decision on this issue pending the Supreme Court\u2019s review of our decision in <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>496 F.2d 1050 (5th Cir. 1974), because the <em>Mandujano </em>case involved the same issue as presented here by Yeager. On May 19, 1976, the Supreme Court reversed <em>Mandujano, </em>holding that in a perjury prosecution a defendant may not use the privilege against self-incrimination as the basis for suppressing the very grand jury testimony that prompted the perjury charge. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>- U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976). The defendant in <em>Mandujano </em>was not entitled to suppression of his grand jury testimony even though he may have been a \u201cputative defendant\u201d and was not given a full <em>Miranda </em>warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-27\">[A] witness sworn to tell the truth before a duly constituted grand jury will not be heard to call for suppression of false statements made to that jury. . Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that respondent was indeed a \u201cputative defendant,\u201d that fact would have no bearing on the validity of a conviction for testifying falsely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-28\">-U.S.-, 96 S.Ct. at 1789, 48 L.Ed.2d at 226. <em>Mandujano </em>controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-30\">We have examined Yeager\u2019s remaining contentions and have found them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-31\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-32\">. <em>Miranda v.
