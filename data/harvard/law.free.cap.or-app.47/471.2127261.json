J.</author>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">This is a jurisdictional inquiry submitted by the Multnomah County District Court pursuant to ORS 46.063.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">This case began as a forcible entry and detain-er (FED) action brought by plaintiff to gain possession from defendant Burtchaell and others of 11 houseboat moorage sites on land owned by the State of Oregon and located near the Sellwood Bridge on the Willamette River in Portland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant Burtchaell filed an answer, counterclaims and a third-party complaint seeking damages in excess of the jurisdiction of the district court. The matter was transferred to circuit court in reliance on ORS 46.070; the circuit court struck the counterclaims and returned the matter to district court. This review was then requested to determine whether jurisdiction should rest with the district court or the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">ORS 46.070 provides that cases may be transferred from district court to circuit court if the amount of the counterclaim exceeds the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We applied ORS 46.070 in <em>Brood v. Davis, </em>44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Or App 261, 605 P2d 749 (1980), an action for replevin. In that case, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction was based upon ORS 46.060(1)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We there stated that ORS 46.070 requires that a case be transferred to circuit court if the cause \"* * * is one in which a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim in excess of the jurisdictional amount, has moved that the cause be transferred to circuit court and has tendered the transfer fee.\u201d 44 Or App at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">In the present case the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is based upon ORS 46.060(1)(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rather than ORS 46.060(l)(b). For the purpose of determining the applicability of ORS 46.070 and <em>Brood v. Davis, </em>we perceive no significance in the distinction between the two subsections. ORS 46.070 applies to FED cases such as this one which are not brought under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>91.810(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jurisdiction in this case rests with the circuit court upon compliance with the statutory formula for transfer as interpreted in <em>Brood v. Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">Remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\"> OES 46.063(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\"(1) In any case where there is a dispute as to whether jurisdiction is in district court or some other court, the court before which the matter is pending shall refer the question to the Court of Appeals which shall decide the question of jurisdiction in a summary manner.
