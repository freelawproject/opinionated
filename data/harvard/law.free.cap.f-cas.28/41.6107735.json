BENJAMIN JOHNSON, District Judge, holding the. circuit court, the jury found them \u201cguilty of an assault and battery, but not with the intent to kill.\u201d The defendants moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that there was no law of the United States to punish an assault with intent to kill, or an assault and battery committed in the Indian country.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-12\">F.

Assault with intent to kill, if committed on the \u201chigh seas\u201d or within any place within the admiralty jurisdiction, and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, is undoubtedly punishable in the courts of the United States, by fine and imprisonment, and confinement to hard labor. That is the only law on the subject, and it has no application to this case. Gordon, Dig. 939. Judgment arrested, and defendants discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
