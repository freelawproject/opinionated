Roane, district attorney of the United States, on the ground that he was ready to produce evidence before the court that the defendant had committed the crime of murder. And thereupon the court overruled the motion of the defendant for his discharge from custody, and the district attorney introduced a witness, who proved that the defendant had been guilty of the homicide of a citizen of the United States, in the district of country occupied by the Osage Nation of Indians, and therefore, upon motion of the district attorney, it was ordered by the court that the defendant be remanded to the custody of the marshal, to be imprisoned until he shall be discharged according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-22\">YELL, J., dissented from this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
