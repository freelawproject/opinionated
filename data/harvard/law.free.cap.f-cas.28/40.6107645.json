BENJAMIN JOHNSON, District Judge, holding the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-19\">The jury found the defendant guilty in manner and form as alleged in the indictment, and he filed a motion in arrest of judgment, on the principal ground that there was no law of congress punishing robbery committed on land, and that the court had no jurisdiction of. the offence; and this motion was argued by the counsel respectively.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-20\">William C.

Cocke, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b42-22\">THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"A9a\">(JOHNSON, District Judge)</author>\n<p id=\"As\">said, it was not to be doubted that the only authority which this court had to try and punish offences was derived from acts of congress; for although the courts of the United States might, in the absence of statutory provisions, look to the common law for rules to guide them in the exercise of their powers, in criminal as well as civil causes, yet it is to the statutes of the United States, enacted in pursuance of the constitution, that these courts must resort to determine what constitutes an offence against the United States, and whether committed on the land or the \u201chigh seas.\u201d The United States have no unwritten criminal code, to which resort can be had as a source of jurisdiction, but as was said in U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch [11 U. S.] 32, 2 Pet. Cond. Rep. 406. \u201cthe legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence,\u201d before cognizance can be taken of it. Referring' to the statutes of the United States to ascertain what offences on land are punishable, it will be perceived that they are few, and that the crime of robbery is not among them. This is an indictment for robbery. Of larceny, this court has cognizance (Gord. Dig. 939); and although it is true that every robbery includes a larceny, yet it would be quite impossible to uphold this proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>on that \u25a0 ground, because the indictment is for the crime of robbery as such, and the finding of the jury, responsive to it, is that the defendant is guilty in manner and form as charged in the indictment. There is no alternative after verdict but to treat it as a \u25a0case of robbery. Doubtless the party might have been legally indicted and found guilty of larceny; but of robbery, as such, this \u2022court has no jurisdiction, and judgment must be arrested. Judgment arrested.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AUH\">[NOTE.
