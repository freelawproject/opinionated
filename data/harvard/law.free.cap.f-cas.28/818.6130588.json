The bark had sailed from Havana bound to New York, and the day after she sailed her master was taken sick with the yellow fever and died. Her mate also died and one seaman, leaving the vessel without anyone on board who understood navigation. The bark fell in with an English vessel, bound up the coast. The vessel could not spare a navigator, but told the John Potter to keep along in her wake, which was done. On the 22nd of August the George Law hove in sight, whereupon a signal of distress was set on the bark, and the steamer ran down to her, and learning her condition, put on board of her the third mate. Mr. Wendell, to navigate her to New York. The mate was himself attacked by fever, and was severely ill, but succeeded in bringing the vessel to New York in safety. It was a question whether the fever which he had was the yellow or Chagres fever. The bark and her cargo was worth about $10.000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b820-15\">Clark &amp; Rapallo, for libelants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b820-16\">Beebe &amp; Donohue, for claimants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b820-17\">INGERSOLL, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ArHc\">said he did not think the question as to the kind of fever of much importance in determining the amount which should be paid to the mate. He knew that the bark was infected with the yellow fever, and that he was endangering his health by going on board, and he exposed himself to that peril for the benefit of the claimants. If he had the seeds of the Chagres fever in him, and was sick of that, he voluntarily deprived himself of all the medical aid which he could have on board the steamer, and that his service, therefore, was a very meritorious one, and should be recompensed as such. That the service rendered by the ship was technically a salvage service, but a very slight one. She was only delayed about half an hour; and owing to the absence of the third mate, there was some little inconvenience and extra labor imposed on the other officers of the steamer, but none on the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Under all the circumstances, a decree may be entered for the libelants for $1,000\u2014to be divided as follows: To Mr. Wendell, the third, mate, $700; to the captain of the George Law, $65; to the first mate, $35; to the owners, $200.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
