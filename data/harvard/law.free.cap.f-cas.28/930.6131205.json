The second, that being insolvent, he had made a sale of his stock of goods to a creditor with intent to give him a preference. And third, that he had made a sale of his stock of goods with intent to defraud his creditors. Valliquette filed an answer to the petition, denying the commission of any of the acts of bankruptcy alleged in the petition, and demanded a jury trial.</p><p id=\"b932-17\">X'he trial came on to be heard before HALL, District Judge, and a jury at the November term of the district court, and the petitioners, to sustain this case, called Reynolds, the person who bought Valliquette out, and he testified that some two weeks before the sale he had applied to Valliquette to buy him out, and Valliquette refused to sell; that two-weeks later Valliquette sent him word that he had concluded to go into some other business and would sell out. Reynolds was not then a creditor, but finding that Valliquette was owing several parties debts not due, he applied to these creditors, with Valliquette\u2019\u00bb' consent, and arranged that such creditors should take his notes instead 'of Valliquette\u2019s, and give him time.</p><p id=\"b933-3\">There was no evidence offered that Valli-quette was insolvent at the time of this transaction, and no evidence of intent to defraud or to give Reynolds a preference other than the inference, if any, which could be drawn from the transaction.</p><p id=\"b933-6\">The court adjourned over night, and examined the question, and in the morning charged the jury that the position assumed by the petitioners\u2019 counsel was untenable, and directed a verdict in favor of the respondent.</p><p id=\"b932-18\"> [Reprinted by permission.]</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
