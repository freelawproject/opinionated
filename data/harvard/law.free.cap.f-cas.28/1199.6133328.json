It would be nothing more than hearsay evidence, which shall not affect the plaintiff. You may prove him incompetent from acts, or from facts that are capable of being seen and judged of; but you cannot show his interest by anything he has said. It might be that he would say a thing of that kind barely to prevent a party from having the benefit of his testimony.</p>\n<author id=\"b1202-4\">McNAIRY, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAFG\">said he was not perfectly satisfied with the opinion of his Brother TODD. The objection to the introduction of the witness upon a division of the court would fail; it was. therefore, unnecessary for him to give any opinion upon the subject, but he said it would seem strange, at first view, that if a witness should say that he was to have five hundred dollars of the income to be recovered by the plaintiff, this should not render him incompetent. The acts and facts spoken of may exist only in the knowledge of the witnesses and the party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
