We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err when it determined that the Department had made reasonable efforts to provide reunification services?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated C.S.\u2019s parental rights?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b63 J.O. was bom in 2007. His mother is C.S. J.O. was removed from C.S.\u2019s care twice as a result of C.S.\u2019s criminal conduct, and C.S.\u2019s parental rights to J.O. were eventually terminated on January 20, 2015. Both the facts and proceedings related to J.O.\u2019s care and custody and the facts and proceedings related to C.S.\u2019s criminal conduct are relevant to this case, though only the case terminating C.S.\u2019s parental rights is currently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">C.S.\u2019s Criminal History</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">\u00b64 In 2010, C.S. was serving a suspended sentence for issuing bad checks. When she was discovered in possession of drug paraphernalia and after she tested positive for several drugs, including opiates, methamphetamine, and morphine, the District Court revoked her sentence. C.S. was committed to the Department of Corrections for five years. While incarcerated, C.S. was placed at Passages Treatment Center, where she completed drug and alcohol counseling. C.S. was then placed at a pre-release center until October 2011, at which time she was conditionally released.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">\u00b65 On May 3,2013, C.S. was again discovered in possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia. She had been found passed out in the parking lot of a casino. C.S.\u2019s probation officer authorized a search of C.S.\u2019s person and her car, and police officers discovered methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">\u00b66 Asa result, C.S.\u2019s conditional release from her issuing bad checks sentence was terminated at a May 29, 2013 hearing. C.S. was also charged with and convicted of possession of dangerous drags and possession of drag paraphernalia. On March 4, 2014, she was sentenced to several terms of years set to run concurrently with her issuing bad checks sentence. C.S. was then sent to Passages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Assessment and Sanction Center in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b67 At Passages, C.S. received a chemical dependency evaluation, and the evaluators recommended that C.S. attend Elkhom Treatment Center and then a pre-release center. C.S. submitted an application to the Elkhom program in May 2014. Her application was rejected, however, based on letters that she wrote to the screening committee informing it that she did not need treatment and that she would refuse to cooperate with treatment if admitted. Her referral to pre-release was also rejected. The rejection included a comment that C.S. posed an unacceptable level of risk. Based on her rejection from Elkhom and pre-release, C.S. was transferred to the Montana Women\u2019s Prison in August 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Facts Related to the Care and Custody of J.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b68 Throughout C.S.\u2019s incarcerations, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (the Department) worked with C.S. to protect J.O. Following C.S.\u2019s 2010 incarceration, the Department placed J.O. in foster care and then in the care of his paternal aunt, D.H., who lived in Nevada. Following C.S.\u2019s release from custody and after she completed drug and alcohol counseling, the Department reunited J.O. and C.S. After monitoring J.O.\u2019s welfare, continuing to provide services to J.O. and C.S. for several months, and observing C.S.\u2019s compliance with her treatment plan, the Department moved to dismiss its petition to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights. The District Court granted the motion on October 17,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b69 Following C.S.\u2019s May 3, 2013 arrest and incarceration, the Department resumed working with C.S. and J.O. Initially, the Department and C.S. entered a voluntary protective services agreement. However, when C.S.\u2019s chosen caregivers were no longer able to look after J.O., the Department filed a petition for emergency protective services, temporary legal custody of J.O., and adjudication of J.O. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u00b610 Following an intervention conference, C.S. stipulated to adjudication of J.O. as a youth in need of care and to the Department receiving temporary legal custody of J.O. She also stipulated to the Department\u2019s plan to return J.O. to D.H.\u2019s care while it retained temporary legal custody. On June 26, 2013, following C.S.\u2019s stipulations, the District Court adjudicated J.O. a youth in need of care and granted the Department temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b611 Soon thereafter, the Department placed J.O. with D.H. In D.H.\u2019s care, J.O.\u2019s emotional and physical health began to improve. He received emergency treatment to his teeth, which were seriously decayed, and he began meeting with Jeffrey Davis, a licensed social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>worker and child and family counselor. Unprompted, J.O. began referring to D.H. and her husband as his mother and father, and he expressed his desire to stay in Nevada and to be adopted by D.H. and her husband. When J.O. was given the opportunity to do so he chose not to communicate via letter or telephone with C.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b612 On August 14,2013, the District Court approved a treatment plan for C.S., which had been developed by the Department. The plan primarily required C.S. to address her chemical dependency issues and to develop her parenting abilities. C.S. stipulated that the plan was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b613 At some point prior to September 19, 2013, C.S. applied for placement at the Carole Graham Home. The Carole Graham Home is a residential program for substance abusing women and their children. C.S. hoped that her placement there would allow her to be reunited with J.O. However, the Carole Graham Home denied C.S.\u2019s application, writing that \u201c[C.S.] may not be a good fit for our program because [the Department] is not in support of reunification between [C.S.] and [ J.O.] at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b614 On July 2, 2014, after C.S. was convicted of possession of dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia, the Department petitioned to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights. Following a hearing, the District Court granted the petition. It found that C.S. had subjected J.O. to aggravated circumstances and that as a result the Department was not required to make reasonable efforts at providing preservation or reunification services. Nevertheless, it also decided that the Department had provided reasonable services to C.S. It then decided that termination of C.S.\u2019s parental rights was justified on two grounds. First, it decided to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights because she had subjected J.O. to aggravated circumstances. Second, it decided to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights based on C.S.\u2019s failure to comply with her treatment plan and its finding that the condition rendering C.S. unfit was unlikely to change in a reasonable time. C.S. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for abuse of discretion. <em>In re L.N., </em>2014 MT 187, \u00b6 12, 375 Mont. 480, 329 P.3d 598. We review the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law for correctness. <em>L.N., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u00b616 <em>1. Did the District Court err when it determined that the Department had made reasonable efforts to provide reunification </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>services?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b617  C.S. argues that the Department did not provide reasonable reunification services and that the District Court erred when it decided otherwise. She also argues that the District Court erred by deciding that reunification services were not necessary. We hold that the District Court did not err when it decided that the Department provided reasonable reunification services. For this reason, we do not address C.S.\u2019s argument concerning whether reunification services were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b618 Section 41-3-423(1), MCA, requires the Department to \u201cmake reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of removal of a child from the child\u2019s home and to reunify families that have been separated by the state.\u201d It specifies that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">Reasonable efforts include but are not limited to voluntary protective services agreements, development of individual written case plans specifying state efforts to reunify families, placement in the least disruptive setting possible, provision of services pursuant to a case plan, and periodic review of each case to ensure timely progress toward reunification or permanent placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">Section 41-3-423(1), MCA, also states that \u201c[i]n determining preservation or reunification services to be provided and in making reasonable efforts at providing preservation or reunification services, the child\u2019s health and safety are of paramount concern.\u201d In fact, protection of children\u2019s health and safety is the primary purpose of Title 41, Chapter 3, MCA. Section 41-3-101(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b619 Here, the Department provided many preservation and reunification services to J.O. and C.S. before C.S.\u2019s parental rights were ultimately terminated. After J.O. was removed from C.S.\u2019s care in 2010, the Department worked with C.S. to place J.O. with a family member, and it eventually accomplished this goal by placing J.O. with D.H. It also provided a treatment plan for C.S. When C.S. completed that treatment plan, it reunited J.O. and C.S. It then continued to provide C.S. with services and trainings while also monitoring J.O.\u2019s welfare. After several months without incident, it decided that reunification had been successful and dismissed its suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b620 FollowingC.S.\u2019s arrest and incarceration in 2013, the Department continued to provide reunification and preservation services to C.S. Rather than immediately removing J.O. from C.S.\u2019s care, it entered a voluntary protective services agreement with C.S. Pursuant to that agreement, J.O. was left in the care of C.S.\u2019s housemate and J.O.\u2019s babysitter. Only once these parties could no longer care for J.O. did the Department decide to place J.O. in foster care and then in the care of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>D.H. It determined that placement with D.H. was the least disruptive setting possible, considering that J.O. had already lived with D.H. dining his first removal, that D.H. was a family member, and that C.S. consented to this arrangement. After removing J.O. and placing him in D.H.\u2019s care, the Department worked with C.S. to develop a treatment plan so that she might address her parenting and drug related issues and eventually be reunited with J.O. C.S. agreed to this treatment plan, stipulating that it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b621 The District Court decided that these services constituted reasonable efforts at providing preservation and reunification services. We agree. As the District Court concluded, the Department entered voluntary protective services agreements, written case plans, and placed J.O. in the least disruptive setting possible. By the plain language of \u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA, reasonable efforts may comprise such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b622 C.S., however, believes the Department failed to provide reasonable reunification services in two ways. First, she claims that the Department prevented her placement for treatment in the Carole Graham Home. Second, she claims that the Department prevented phone contact between her and J.O. Nevertheless, we hold that the Department made reasonable efforts at providing reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b623 C.S. contends that if she was placed in the Carole Graham Home that J.O. could have continued to live with her. She argues, therefore, that the Carole Graham Home would have been the least disruptive placement and that the Department failed to make reasonable reunification efforts by preventing her placement there. According to C.S., the Department prevented her placement at the Carole Graham Home by stating around the time of C.S.\u2019s application that C.S. was not ready for reunification with J.O. Ostensibly the Department\u2019s statement was the only thing that prevented C.S.\u2019s placement there.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">\u00b624 Even if we take the foregoing to be true, we do not agree that the Department failed to make reasonable efforts at providing reunification. When C.S. asked for placement with J.O. at the Carole Graham Home, she was not simply asking for reasonable reunification services. Instead, she was asking for J.O. to be placed in her care. She was asking for actual reunification. The Department denied this request because C.S. had not made progress on her treatment plan. Indeed, she had failed to comply with substantial portions of the plan. By failing to comply with the treatment plan, she had failed to satisfy the conditions that C.S., the Department, and the District Court had agreed were necessary for the safe return of J.O. to C.S. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>102(30) and -443(2)(b), MCA. As the health and safety of J.O. was the Department\u2019s paramount concern and as C.S. had not demonstrated that J.O. could be safely returned to her care, it was reasonable for the Department to oppose reunification at the time of C.S.\u2019s request. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA. The Department did not fail to make reasonable efforts at providing reunification services by opposing C.S.\u2019s placement.</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">\u00b625 The Department also did not fail to provide reasonable reunification services when it did not provide phone contact between J.O. and C.S. C.S. argues that the lack of phone contact with J.O. was improper given that her treatment plan required \u201ctherapeutic contact\u201d with J.O. However, the Department was not required to provide every conceivable reunification or preservation service to C.S. It was instead required to make <em>reasonable efforts </em>at providing reunification services while recognizing that the health and safety of the child are its paramount concerns. Section 41-3-423(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b626 Here, J.O.\u2019s counselor, Davis, observed that J.O. had nightmares and was unable to focus in school after speaking with his father on the telephone. J.O. also became uncomfortable when discussing his parents or when anyone referred to C.S. as his mother. When given access to letters from his mother, J.O. became uncomfortable and had no interest in reading them. Based on these observations and in the interests of J.O.\u2019s emotional health, Davis recommended that J.O. be given the choice of whether or not to have any phone contact with C.S. Given this choice, J.O. never chose to speak with C.S. on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">\u00b627 In light of the concerns Davis identified regarding J.O.\u2019s health and safety, and in light of the other services it did provide, the Department was not required to provide C.S. with phone contact with J.O. in order to make reasonable efforts at providing reunification services. It bears repeating that J.O.\u2019s health and safety were the Department\u2019s paramount concerns. The Department did not need to provide reunification services that would put J.O.\u2019s health or safety at risk. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA; <em>In re B.S., </em>2009 MT 98, \u00b6 32, 350 Mont. 86, 206 P.3d 565 (\u201c[T]he statutes give priority to the best interests of the child as the primary and paramount statutory standard for termination... . The best interests of the child take precedence over parental rights, and the need for permanent placement in a loving and stable home supersedes the parents\u2019 interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b628 Moreover, even if the Department could have done more to facilitate therapeutic contact between C.S. and J.O., the fact remains that C.S. failed to comply with other tasks in the treatment plan. Phone contact with J.O. was not the only task standing in the way of their reunification. As we concluded above, one of the ways the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Department made reasonable efforts to provide reunification services was by entering written case plans, including a treatment plan, with C.S. Compliance with her treatment plan was ultimately C.S.\u2019s responsibility. <em>See In re L.W.K., </em>236 Mont. 14, 19, 767 P.2d 1338, 1342 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b629  We hold that the District Court did not err when it decided that the Department made reasonable efforts to provide reunification services. For this reason, we do not address C.S.\u2019s additional argument regarding the District Court\u2019s decision that reunification services need not be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b630 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated C.S.\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b631 The District Court found that the grounds for termination identified in \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and -609(l)(f), MCA, were met, and it terminated C.S.\u2019s parental rights to J.O. for this reason. C.S. argues that several findings of fact justifying this decision were not supported by substantial evidence and were, therefore, clearly erroneous. We disagree. We hold that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, had been satisfied. As this statute and these findings provided an independently sufficient basis for the District Court to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights, we do not consider C.S.\u2019s arguments concerning \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA. <em>In re I.T., </em>2015 MT 43, \u00b6 16, 378 Mont. 239, 343 P.3d 1192; <em>In re S.T., </em>2008 MT 19, \u00b6 15, 341 Mont. 176, 176 P.3d 1054; <em>see </em>\u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b632 According to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, a court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence ... that... the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist: (i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and (ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">When making this determination, \u201cthe court shall consider but is not limited to the following: ... (c) excessive use of ... a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child; and (d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.\u201d Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">\u00b633 C.S. does not dispute that J.O. is an adjudicated youth in need of care or that either she has not complied with her court-approved treatment plan or the treatment plan has been unsuccessful. Instead, she only argues that there was not substantial evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>District Court\u2019s finding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b634 In <em>In re C.B. </em>, 2014 MT 4, 373 Mont. 204, 316 P.3d 177, we affirmed a district court\u2019s decision that a mother\u2019s drug problems rendered her unfit and were unlikely to change within a reasonable time. C.B., \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. We reasoned that the drug problems had existed for over twelve years and that the mother had failed to address them, and had even affirmatively resisted addressing them, despite being presented with the opportunity to do so. <em>C.B., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b635 Similarly, C.S. has drug problems that have persisted for years and that she has failed to address despite opportunities to receive treatment. As the District Court noted, C.S. was found in possession of dangerous drugs, including morphine and methamphetamine, in 2010 and 2013. Both incidents led to her arrest and incarceration, and between 2013 and the time the District Court terminated C.S.\u2019s parental rights she was continuously incarcerated. During this time, C.S. was given the opportunity to address her drug problems. Yet, she sabotaged every treatment opportunity by stating in her letters to the treatment program screening committees that she did not need treatment and would refuse to cooperate with treatment programs. Based on these facts and their similarities with <em>In re C.B., </em>there was substantial evidence for the District Court to find that C.S.\u2019s excessive use of a dangerous drug and her long term confinement \u2014 the conditions rendering her unfit \u2014 were unlikely to change in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b636  Thus, the District Court\u2019s findingthatthe conditions rendering C.S. unfit were unlikely to change was not clearly erroneous. Based on this finding and the District Court\u2019s uncontested findings, the District Court was authorized by \u00a7 41-3-609(1X0, MCA, to terminate C.S.\u2019s parental rights. As it complied with this statute, it did not abuse its discretion by terminating C.S.\u2019s parental rights. <em>See In re J.C., </em>2003 MT 369, \u00b6 18, 319 Mont. 112, 82 P.3d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b637 The District Court decided that the Department made reasonable efforts to provide C.S. with reunification services. This finding was not clearly erroneous. The District Court terminated C.S.\u2019s parental rights based on the authority of \u00a7 41-3-609(1X0, MCA. We disagree with C.S.\u2019s argument that one of the findings upon which this decision was based \u2014 that the condition rendering C.S. unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time \u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>C.S. made arguments to this Court that we do not address because our decisions on the arguments that we do address provide a sufficient basis upon which to affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.
