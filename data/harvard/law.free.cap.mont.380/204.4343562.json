McClue, on behalf of himself and his deceased wife, Carol J. McClue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the decisions of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court excluding expert testimony and granting summary judgment to Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois. McClue raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the causation testimony of Dr. John Sabow;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the causation testimony of Dr. Decontee Jimmeh-Fletcher.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\u00b62 We reverse on the first issue but affirm on the second. We reverse the <em>entry </em>of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">\u00b63 In January 2009, Carol was involved in a serious car accident. In 2011, neurologists Sherry Reid, M.D., and Decontee Jimmeh-Fletcher, M.D., both diagnosed Carol with bulbar ALS. Carol died from the illness in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">\u00b64 At the time of the car accident, Carol had Underinsured Motorist (UIM) insurance coverage through Safeco. After the diagnosis, McClue submitted claims to Safeco for UIM benefits for damages associated with Carol\u2019s ALS. Safeco denied those claims, taking the position that the car accident did not cause Carol to develop ALS. In 2011 and 2012, McClue commenced actions against both the driver of the other vehicle in the car crash \u2014 who later settled and was dismissed \u2014 and Safeco. McClue asserted that Safeco breached the insurance contract by failing to provide UIM benefits for Carol\u2019s ALS.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b65 McClue planned to present testimony from both Dr. JimmehFletcher and John Sabow, M.D. \u2014 a neurologist McClue retained in connection with this action \u2014 at trial. Both were deposed. Dr. JimmehFletcher opined that trauma could contribute to the development of ALS, but did not state that Carol\u2019s ALS was caused by the car accident. Dr. Sabow, on the other hand, opined that the car accident caused tissue damage in Carol\u2019s cervical spine and lower brainstem and that this tissue damage was more probably than not the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of Carol\u2019s ALS.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b66 After the depositions, Safeco filed motions in limine to exclude testimony from both doctors at trial. The District Court granted the motions. Safeco then moved for summary judgment because, without the expert testimony, McClue did not have admissible evidence to establish that the car crash caused Carol\u2019s ALS. Reserving the right to appeal the rulings in limine, McClue did not oppose summary judgment, and the District Court granted Safeco\u2019s motion. McClue now appeals the exclusion of expert testimony and the resulting entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b67 The parties dispute the standard of review that applies to the District Court\u2019s exclusions of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b68 Indisputably, we review an entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Also indisputably, we generally review an evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>Harris v. Hanson, </em>2009 MT 13, \u00b6 18, 349 Mont. 29, 201 P.3d 151. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(cX3); <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. This determination is based on viewing \u201cfacts that would be admissible in evidence,\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1), in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, <em>Malpeli v. State, </em>2012 MT 181, \u00b6 12, 366 Mont. 69, 285 P.3d 509. Rulings on the admissibility of evidence thus sometimes implicate summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b69 After the District Court ruled that the proffered expert testimony was not admissible, it determined that there was no evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. In this situation, McClue argues that our summary judgment standard should swallow the normal standard for evidentiary rulings, and that we shouldreviewthe exclusion of expert testimony de novo. Safeco asserts that we should keep the standards separate and review the exclusion of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00b610 Safeco finds support in <em>Beehler v. E. Radiological Assocs., P.C., </em>2012 MT 260, 367 Mont. 21, 289 P.3d 131. In <em>Beehler, </em>the defendants filed motions in limine to exclude expert testimony necessary for the plaintiffs to establish essential elements of their claim. The district court granted the motion. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 5. The defendants concurrently moved for summary judgment, arguing that, without expert testimony on essential elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, judgment was appropriate as a matter of law. The district court granted that motion too. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 6. We reviewed the district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b611 McClue counters with decisions suggesting that we review evidentiary rulings in the context of summary judgment de novo. <em>E.g., Smith v. Farmers Union Mat. Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 216, \u00b6 15,361 Mont. 516, 260 P.3d 163 (\u201cWe review evidentiary rulings made in the context of a summary judgment proceeding de novo, and need not defer to the judgments and decisions of the district court, in order to determine whether evidentiary requirements for summary judgment have been satisfied.\u201d) (citing <em>In re Estate of Harmon, </em>2011 MT 84A, \u00b6 14, 360 Mont. 150, 253 P.3d 821); <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 53, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (\u201c[I]n the context of summary judgment, a decision to categorically exclude certain evidence from consideration is not a discretionary function akin to admitting or excluding evidence at trial. Rather this determination is a conclusion of law which we must review de novo, just as we review all other aspects of the decision to grant summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 41, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639 (\u201c[W]e have never held that evidentiary rulings going directly to the propriety of summary judgment are also reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Instead, under our case law, strict compliance with Rule 56(e) is required, and we review de novo whether the evidentiary requirements of Rule 56(e) have been satisfied.\u201d). These cases invoke de novo review primarily \u201cin order to determine whether the evidentiary requirements for summary judgment have been satisfied.\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b612 In considering the correct standard to apply to the evidentiary rulings that contributed to entry of summary judgment in this case, our focus is not on whether particular evidence was appropriate for consideration by the trial court in ruling on the summary judgment motion, but on the standard by which to review the exclusion of expert testimony that left the plaintiff unable to present a prima fade case. Several points bear on our resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b613 First, in <em>Beehler </em>and other cases, we have applied an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>discretion standard in almost identical circumstances. <em>E.g., Beehler, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Butler v. Domin, </em>2000 MT 312, \u00b6\u00b6 10-23, 302 Mont. 452, 15 P.3d 1189. Second, in cases dating back at least seven decades, we have situated rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony within the discretion of trial courts, vowing not to disturb such rulings \u201cin the absence of a showing of abuse.\u201d <em>E.g., Harris, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Graham v. Rolandson, </em>150 Mont. 270, 285, 435 P.2d 263, 271 (1967); <em>Nesbitt v. City of Butte, </em>118 Mont. 84, 93, 163 P.2d 251, 256 (1945). Finally, most appeals courts apply an abuse of discretion standard to rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony even when those rulings implicate summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Flesner v. Bayer AG, </em>596 F.3d 884, 889 (8th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to exclude testimony for purposes of determining whether there exists an issue of material fact.\u201d) (citing <em>GE v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S. Ct. 512, 517 (1997) (rejecting the application of de novo review to the exclusion of expert testimony that was \u201coutcome-determinative\u201d to a summary judgment ruling)); <em>Benson v. N. Gopher Enters., Inc., </em>455 N.W.2d 444, 445-46 (Minn. 1990) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion the exclusion of expert testimony leading to summary judgment). This is consistent with the general reasoning that, while an order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo, \u201cany determination underlying the order granting summary judgment is reviewed under the standard appropriate to that determination.\u201d <em>Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr., </em>159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467 (2008). Most courts hold that exclusion of expert testimony, like other evidentiary rulings, is within the discretion of trial courts. <em>See, e.g., Estate of Barabin v. AstenJohnson, Inc., </em>740 F.3d 457, 460 (9th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b614  Based on the foregoing, we will review the District Court\u2019s rulings excluding McClue\u2019s proffered expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. Following those determinations, we will review the remaining entry of summary judgment de novo. To the extent that the expert testimony ruling is based purely on an interpretation of the evidentiary rules, however, we will review that interpretation, like any other question of law, for correctness. <em>In re T. W., </em>2006 MT 153, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 454, 139 P.3d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the causation testimony of Dr. Sabow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b616 M. R. Evid. 702 permits \u201ca witness qualified as an expert by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to testify \u201cin the form of an opinion or otherwise\u201d if \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d This rule requires testing an expert\u2019s reliability against \u201c(1) whether the expert field is reliable, (2) whether the expert is qualified, and (3) whether the qualified expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Clifford, 2005 MT 219, \u00b6 28, 328 Mont. 300, 121 P.3d 489. A district court must determine whether the field is reliable and whether the expert is qualified, but \u201c[t]he last question is for the finder of fact <em>\u201dBeehler, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">\u00b617 McClue sought to introduce Dr. Sabow as an expert witness at trial to testify that the auto accident caused Carol\u2019s ALS. Dr. Sabow is a board-certified neurologist with over forty years of experience in neurology and particular expertise in ALS. In a report and deposition, he testified that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d that the localization of Carol\u2019s ALS symptoms in the same area of her body where she sustained whiplash from the car accident meant that the crash triggered the ALS. But he also testified in his deposition that \u201cthere are no neurologists that can designate themselves as experts in determining the causation of ALS\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t know the exact cause\u201d of neurodegenerative diseases. \u00b618 In excluding Dr. Sabow\u2019s testimony, the District Court focused on his statements that called into question the reliability of his determination that the accident was the proximate cause of Carol\u2019s ALS. The District Court noted that the motion to exclude presented \u201ca novel dilemma\u201d because \u201cDr. Sabow has testified inconsistently that although the cause of ALS is unknown, the cause of Carol\u2019s ALS was trauma she sustained during the [ajccident.\u201d The court stated, \u201cGenerally, Safeco\u2019s motion... would be governed by... the proposition that the question of whether Dr. Sabow has reliably applied the current principles of the field of neurology to the facts of the case is a question for the jury.\u201d But the court then employed a quote from a secondary source stating that, for an expert witness to testify in a negligence action, \u201cthe trial court must be satisfied that the witness\u2019s testimony is not speculative or guesswork and the expert must state his or her opinion with conviction and belief.\u201d 2 Thomas A. Moore, <em>Evidence in Negligence Cases </em>\u00a7 13.5.1.2 (Practicing Law Institute 2011). The court determined that Dr. Sabow\u2019s contradictory statements \u201cundermine[d] his competence to opine and the credibility of his opinion,\u201d so he was \u201cnot qualified\u201d to testify as an expert witness under M. R. Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b619 Montana has not adopted any of the recent versions of Federal Rule of Evidence (F. R. Evid.) 702, which sets the standard for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>admission of expert testimony in many jurisdictions. As currently written, both F. R. Evid. 702 and M. R. Evid. 702 state that a witness who is \u201cqualified as an expert\u201d may testify if her \u201cknowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.\u201d F. R. Evid. 702(a); M. R. Evid. 702. That is where the Montana rule stops. F. R. Evid. 702, however, further conditions admission on whether, \u201c(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of rehable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\u201d F. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b620 According to the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to the Federal Rules of Evidence, F. R. Evid. 702 incorporated the latter requirements in response to <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), and <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167 (1999). <em>Daubert </em>emphasized a trial court\u2019s \u201cgate-keeping\u201d role and suggested that a trial court should determine whether expert testimony is admissible based on whether the testimony is grounded in \u201ca theory or technique\u201d that \u201ccan be (and has been) tested,\u201d that has been \u201csubjected to peer review and publication,\u201d and that \u201cenjoys \u2018general acceptance\u2019 within the \u2018relevant scientific community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 149, 119 S. Ct. at 1175 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-94,113 S. Ct. at <em>2796-97). Kumho Tire </em>held that the <em>Daubert </em>factors apply to essentially all proffered expert testimony. <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 141, 119 S. Ct. at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b621 In contrast to its status in the federal system, <em>Daubert </em>is not generally applicable in Montana. In <em>State v. Moore, </em>268 Mont. 20, 885 P.2d 457 (1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gollehon, </em>274 Mont. 116, 121, 906 P.2d 697, 701 (1995), we observed that <em>Daubert </em>was consistent with our previous precedent \u201cconcerning the admission of expert testimony of novel scientific evidence,\u201d and we adopted <em>Daubert </em>\u201cfor the admission of scientific expert testimony.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont. at 42, 885 P.2d at 471. We later clarified, however, that <em>Daubert </em>does not apply to all expert testimony; instead, it applies only to \u201cnovel scientific evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Cline, </em>275 Mont. 46, 55, 909 P.2d 1171, 1177 (1996); <em>see Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 69, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75 (reasoning that because \u201cthe H6N test is not novel scientific evidence,\u201d a district court \u201cneed not employ\u201d <em>Daubert </em>to determine the admissibility of the test results).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b622 The District Court purported to apply M. R. Evid. 702 in excluding Dr. Sabow\u2019s testimony. Safeco has not argued that Dr. Sabow\u2019s testimony is based on novel scientific evidence, and does not suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that <em>Daubert </em>should be invoked to determine its admissibility. Indeed, we have noted that <em>Daubert </em>is used to assess whether the expert field is reliable, the first factor in our expert testimony jurisprudence. <em>Clifford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. When the District Court assessed the reliability of the <em>opinion </em>that Dr. Sabow offered, it ventured to the third factor, misinterpreting its role. Under M. R. Evid. 702, the District Court needed simply to determine \u201cwhether the expert field is reliable\u201d and \u201cwhether the expert is qualified,\u201d leaving to the juiy \u201cwhether the qualified expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b623 District courts should \u201cconstrue liberally the rules of evidence so as to admit all relevant expert testimony.\u201d <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 17, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194). Our standard recognizes that admissible expert evidence should come in, even if that evidence may be characterized as \u201cshaky.\u201d The expert\u2019s testimony then is open for attack through \u201cthe traditional and appropriate\u201d methods: \u201cvigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Clifford, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S. Ct. at 2798).</p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">\u00b624 Safeco attempts to save the District Court\u2019s ruling by focusing on the second factor. Safeco argues that Dr. Sabow is not an expert in the field and is not qualified to render the opinion to which he intends to testify. Safeco defines the field as causation of ALS. <em>Beehler </em>involved a similar argument. The issue in that case was whether a radiologist\u2019s failure to wear a mask while performing a myelogram negligently caused Katherine Beehler\u2019s spinal meningitis and subsequent death. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 4. The trial court excluded testimony from a doctor who was an expert in infection prevention on the ground that he was not an expert in the fields of radiology and myelograms. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 23. We rejected such a narrow definition of the relevant field, instead recognizing that there was a sufficient \u201cintersection\u201d between the field in which the doctor was qualified and the subject of the claim. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b625 A \u201cfield\u201d of expertise is \u201can area, category, or division wherein a particular activity or pursuit is carried out.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>845 (Philip B. Gove ed., 1961). Our standard for expert testimony contemplates that an expert\u2019s field will encompass the particular area about which he or she will testify; but the field is not coextensive with its application to the particular facts of the case. For example, <em>in Harris, </em>the expert was a pathologist. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 37. His testimony, challenged on appeal, was that the plaintiffs \u201cparticular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>cancer would be invisible on x-ray and that it had been present for ten years prior to [her diagnosis].\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 14. Noting that \u201c[p]athology is a recognized field of scientific study,\u201d we pointed to the expert\u2019s significant \u201cknowledge and experience in the study of breast cancer, including how it develops, how it is detected and how it is treated.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 37. We concluded that whether the expert \u201cgathered and examined sufficient facts, and correctly applied the facts to reach his opinions, was a question for the jury to decide after cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and application of the law.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b626  Dr. Sabow is a neurologist. He has specific expertise in ALS, a neurological disease. Dr. Sabow testified that he has evaluated ALS as much as \u201cprobably the top twenty or thirty neurologists in the entire United States,\u201d and that he falls within \u201cthe upper neurologic group that knows more about [the] caus[e] and effect of ALS than probably 90 percent of neurologists.\u201d The issue in dispute is whether the car crash caused Carol\u2019s ALS. Based on his expertise in the relevant field of neurology, Dr. Sabow has opined on the neurological relationship between Carol\u2019s traumatic injury and her ALS; that is the application of the principles of neurology to the facts in the case. Safeco\u2019s attempt to render Dr. Sabow unqualified by defining the relevant field as the specific causation of ALS is unavailing. To undermine the weight of his opinions at trial, Safeco may cross-examine Dr. Sabow regarding his admission that the exact cause of ALS is unknown, but that admission does not render Dr. Sabow\u2019s testimony inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 702. <em>See also Norris v. Fritz, </em>2012 MT 27, \u00b6 46, 364 Mont. 63, 270 P.3d 79 (holding that an expert\u2019s inability to explain why a medical condition occurs did not prevent him from \u201cpossessing expertise on the necessary medical treatment when the condition occurs,\u201d and limits of his expertise were instead a proper subject for cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the causation testimony of Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b628 Upon Safeco\u2019s motion, the District Court excluded the testimony of Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher as to causation. Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher is a neurologist who offered Carol a second opinion confirming her ALS diagnosis. By agreement, the parties perpetuated Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcheris testimony for trial through deposition. In her deposition, Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher consistently spoke about trauma as a \u201crisk factor\u201d that \u201ccan certainly contribute\u201d to neurodegeneration. She agreed, however, that \u201cno medical literature has established that ALS is caused by trauma,\u201d and she agreed that she would not have told Carol that the2009 car accident caused her ALS. The District Court excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher\u2019s testimony on the cause of Carol\u2019s ALS after determining that Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher did not testify with the requisite level of certainty that the car accident caused Carol\u2019s ALS.</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">\u00b629 \u201c[E]xpert testimony is required when the issue presented is sufficiently beyond the common experience of the trier of fact and the expert testimony will assist the trier of fact in determining the issue or understanding the evidence.\u201d <em>Hinkle ex rel. Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. No. </em>37, 2004 MT 175, \u00b6 35, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1239. In cases in which expert medical testimony is required to establish a necessary element of a claim, we have held that the expert must testify with a \u201creasonable medical certainty.\u201d <em>Estate of Wilson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410 (quoting <em>Dallas v. Burlington N., Inc., </em>212 Mont. 514, 522-23, 689 P.3d 273, 277 (1984)). For instance, <em>in Hinkle, </em>it was necessary for the plaintiff to produce expert testimony on how alleged torts caused him to develop a number of ailments. <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 35. The plaintiff sought to meet his burden by producing the testimony of a doctor who testified that the torts \u201ccould have had something to do with\u201d the subsequent ailments. <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 38 (emphasis removed). We upheld the exclusion of this testimony and the entry of summary judgment that the exclusion necessitated. <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 38. \u201cA medical expert\u2019s opinion is admissible if it is based on an opinion that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the alleged wrongdoing caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 13). <em>See also Dallas, </em>212 Mont. at 523, 689 P.2d at 277 (\u201cWe are striving for... a probability rather than a possibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b630 Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher did not testify \u2014 either explicitly or implicitly \u2014 that it is more likely than not that the car crash caused Carol\u2019s ALS. The closest Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher came to so testifying was when she was asked a hypothetical question about whether a car crash similar to the one Carol experienced \u201ccan result in trauma that affects the neurons\u201d in the bulbar region of the brain where Carol developed ALS. Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher testified that it could. Under <em>Hinkle, </em>the District Court correctly determined that this \u201ccould have\u201d testimony, <em>see Hinkle, </em>\u00b6 38, was not sufficient for Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher to testify on the car accident\u2019s causation of Carol\u2019s ALS.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b631  The District Court did not purport to exclude Dr. JimmehFletcher\u2019s testimony for all purposes, however, and neither do we. Safeco has signaled its plans to impeach Dr. Sabow\u2019s credibility on the stand on the ground that his opinion on the link between trauma and ALS is not supported by science and is outside the mainstream of the scientific community. Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher testified with certainty on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>how current studies show a link between trauma and neurodegeneration (\"the medical opinion within the neurology community [is] that trauma can contribute to nerve degeneration\u201d). The District Court retains discretion to allow Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher\u2019s testimony in rebuttal, if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b632 We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling barring McClue from using Dr. Jimmeh-Fletcher\u2019s testimony to establish causation in this case. We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling that Dr. Sabow is not qualified to present expert testimony in the trial of this case. The District Court entered summary judgment based on the lack of any admissible expert evidence establishing causation. Reviewing the entry of summary judgment de novo and viewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to McClue, we conclude that the entry of summary judgment was error. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-16\"> Carol died while this action was pending.
