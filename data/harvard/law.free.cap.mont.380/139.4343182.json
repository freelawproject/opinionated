Anderson. Zinvest asserts Carbon County properly complied with all statutory requirements when issuing the tax deed, challenging the District Court\u2019s determination that the county failed to strictly comply with those requirements. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>affirm, addressing the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the Carbon County Treasurer properly comply with the procedural requirements of the tax deed statutes ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b63 Donna Anderson is the owner of improved property located at 23 Hayden Lane, Fromberg, Carbon County, described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">Tract 1 of Certificate of Survey No. 2041 FT, Carbon County, Montana, according to the official plat therof on file and of record in the office of the Clerk and Recorder of said County under Document No. 306963.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Anderson failed to pay taxes assessed for the property and on July 16, 2009, the Carbon County Treasurer conducted a tax lien sale for the property. The tax lien failed to sell, so the county acquired it pursuant to \u00a7 15-17-214(1), MCA (\u201c[i]f no person pays the delinquent taxes... on the first day of the tax lien sale, the county is considered to be the purchaser\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b64 On August 30, 2011, Zinvest mailed a Notice of Pending Assignment to Anderson to inform her of its intent to purchase the lien from the county if the taxes were not paid within two weeks. Following Anderson\u2019s failure to pay, Zinvest paid the taxes and accompanying costs to purchase the lien. The Carbon County Treasurer issued an Assignment of Tax Sale Certificate to Zinvest and notified Anderson of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">\u00b65 After obtaining a properly title guarantee pursuant to \u00a7 15-18-212(4Xa), MCA, Zinvest sent a \u201cNotice that a Tax Deed May be Issued\u201d on June 7,2012, to Anderson, a third-parly occupant of the properly, and the Carbon County Treasurer. Zinvest filed proof of notice with the Carbon County Clerk and Recorder, and on August 14,2012, after the redemption period ended and Anderson had failed pay the delinquent taxes, Zinvest applied for a tax deed, which was issued by the Carbon County Treasurer. Zinvest recorded the deed on August 14,2012, and initiated a quiet title action. Zinvest\u2019s complaint was served upon Anderson on December 16,2013, after which she filed her appearance and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">\u00b66 In February 2014, Zinvest and Anderson filed competing motions for summary judgment that contested whether the County Treasurer had complied with the requirements of the tax deed statutes. On April 10,2014, the District Court granted Zinvest\u2019s motion, noting Anderson had \u201cfail[ed] to provide any affidavits, sworn testimony, recorded or certified documents, or any other admissible evidence in support of [her] contentions.\u201d Anderson filed a motion to alter or amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>judgment, at which point the court learned it had entered its original judgment without benefit of Anderson\u2019s reply brief, which had been filed but not supplied to the court. Because the reply brief included attached evidence supporting Anderson\u2019s assertions that the tax deed statutes had not been properly followed, the court vacated its original judgment and granted her motion for summary judgment. Additional facts are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Showell v. Brosten, </em>2008 MT 261, \u00b6 9, 345 Mont. 108, 189 P.3d 1210. If there are no genuine issues of material fact, we must determine whether a district court correctly concluded the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Showell, </em>\u00b6 9. In addition, a statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether a district court has correctly interpreted the law. <em>Bitterroot River Protection Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., </em>2008 MT 377, \u00b6 70, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the Carbon County Treasurer properly comply with the procedural requirements of the tax deed statutes ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b69 When a property owner has become delinquent in paying property taxes, the tax due is a lien against the property assessed, subject to a tax lien sale after notice of the delinquency is given to the owner. Sections 15-16-403, 15-17-211, MCA. If payment of the delinquent taxes and costs does not occur on the first day of the sale, the county is deemed to be the purchaser of the tax lien. Section 15-17-214(1), MCA. Following a sale, the county treasurer \u201cshall identify and list all property tax liens that were sold\u201d and also \u201crecord that the county is the purchaser of all property remaining unsold... .\u201d Section 15-17-214(2Xa), MCA. Under \u00a7 15-17-214(2)(b), MCA, the record of the property liens acquired by the county may be made by either \u201ca separate tax lien sale certificate of each property or by reference to the property as recorded in the list\u201d of tax delinquent properties required by \u00a7 15-16-301, MCA. Section 15-17-212(1), MCA, itemizes the information that must he included in a tax lien sale certificate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Isern v. Summerfield, </em>1998 MT 45, \u00b6 13, 287 Mont. 461, 956 P.2d 28, we described the \u201calternative procedure\u201d of recording county purchases as \u201cinvolv[ing] production of a list of all property remaining unsold at the tax deed sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b610 The District Court reasoned that \u00a7 15-17-212, MCA, while generally describing what information must be contained in a tax sale certificate issued to a purchaser of a lien, does not explicitly address the procedure to be followed where the county is deemed to be the purchaser. The court held that such transactions must comply with the procedures in \u00a7 15-17-214, MCA, which requires the county to record its interest in the property by way of a tax lien sale certificate or another list. The court found that, while the property interest vests in the county by operation of law, a record of that acquisition was nonetheless statutorilyrequired,reasoningthat\u201c[t]he requirement for recordation of a Tax Sale Certificate or other record of the county\u2019s acquisition of its interest in the property is not perfunctory, it is important because it completes the chain of title on the record.\u201d Determining that there was no evidence that either a tax lien sale certificate or a proper alternative list had been recorded by the county, the court entered judgment in favor of Anderson, concludingthe county had failed to \u201cpunctiliously comply\u201d with all statutory and procedural requirements of the tax deed statutes, citing <em>Isem, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b611 At issue here are two documents prepared and signed by the Carbon County Treasurer: 1) an untitled document purporting to represent that Anderson\u2019s property had been struck off <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Carbon County, dated July 17, 2009, with attached listing (Untitled Document); and 2) an Assignment of Tax Sale Certificate dated September 19, 2011, from the County to Zinvest. The Untitled Document states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>I, JANE SWANSON-WEBB, the Treasurer of the County of Carbon, State of Montana, do herby [sic] certify that at the sede of lands pursuant to the tax assessment for the year 2008, in the County of Carbon and which sale was held on the 16th day of July, 2009, for the purpose of liquidating assessment of <em>the attached described parcel of land, </em>situated in the County of Carbon, State of Montana, was duly offered for sale; that there was no purchaser in good faith for the same as provided by law and no person or purchaser offered to take the same and pay the taxes, costs, and charges due as aforesaid. Accordingly, <em>the whole amount of the property assessed and described as attached </em>was struck off to the County of Carbon as purchaser thereof and the same still remaining unredeemed, and on the 16th day of July, 2009 having paid unto the Treasury of such County, the amount for which the same was bid, together with all subsequent delinquent taxes, penalties, costs and interest amount in all to $1,581.44. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Attached to the Untitled Document was a document entitled \u201cCARBON COUNTY-Uncollected Taxes with Delinquents with Leg\u00e1is.\u201d The Untitled Document referred to a singular \u201cattached described parcel of land\u201d for which taxes, penalties, costs and interest in the total amount of $1,581.44 were owed, but the attached document listed seven properties, one of which was identified under the name of Donna L. Anderson, for which taxes, penalty and interest in the amount of $1,304.10 was listed. The Untitled Document also stated that \u201cthe whole amount of the property assessed and described as attached\u201d was struck off to the County for payment of $1,581.44, yet the seven properties on the attached document listed a greater total amount of delinquent taxes, penalties and interest. The Untitled Document continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Now, therefore, in consideration thereof and pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided, I do hereby assign and set over the right, title, and interest of the County of Carbon, State of Montana, acquired in such lands under and by virtue of the sale to Zinvest, LLC....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b612 The second document, entitled Assignment of Tax Sale Certificate, was prepared on September 19,2011, and included a legal description of Anderson\u2019s property. The assignment certified that a tax lien sale had been held in 2009, the hen had failed to sell, and \u201cthe county was listed as the purchaser as required by 15-17-214, MCA.\u201d As of this date, the delinquency amounted to $4,410.47, and Carbon County was assigning all its rights, title, and interest \u201cto proceed to obtain a tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>deed to the property or receive payment in case of redemption\u201d to Zinvest.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b613 Zinvest argues that the Untitled Document and attached listing of properties, including Anderson\u2019s, satisfied the procedural requirements under subsection -214(2Xb)for recording tax liens struck off to the county. Zinvest further argues that the second document satisfied the tax lien sale certificate requirements of subsection -212 and that the District Court was confused about the role of this document due to the mistaken reference in its title to <em>\u201cAssignment of </em>Tax Sale Certificate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b614 There are a number of flaws in Zinvest\u2019s positions. First, although the Untitled Document does state that \u201cproperty assessed and described as attached\u201d was \u201cstruck off\u201d to the County, it also refers to a singular \u201cattached described parcel of land\u201d on which $1,581.44 was apparently owed. Thus, it is not clear if the document is attempting to refer to one property or to multiple properties. If to one, the $1,581.44 does not correspond to the amount listed as owed for Anderson\u2019s property on the attached listing, and a calculation demonstrating that connection is not provided. Nor is Anderson\u2019s property individually identified in the Untitled Document. If to multiple, then the $1,581.44 does not correspond to the total owed for all the listed properties. Further, if this is the document recording the County as purchaser, it confusingly purports to also transfer the property to Zinvest, again, without clearly identifying the property transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b615 As to the second document, Zinvest argues that, despite the \u201cAssignment of\u201d language in the title, it is actually a Tax Sale Certificate that satisfies the requirements of subsection -212. However, Zinvest was not the purchaser at the tax lien sale and thus was not entitled to receive a tax lien sale certificate. As the second document states, \u201cthere was no purchaser of the property tax lien\u201d and \u201cthe county was listed as purchaser.\u201d This document is an assignment of the County\u2019s interest in a tax lien after it has taken the interest as purchaser, pursuant to \u00a7 15-17-323, MCA (\u201cA tax lien sale certificate or other official record in which the county is listed as the purchaser must be assigned by the county treasurer to any person who... pays to the county the amount of the delinquent taxes, including penalties, interest, and costs....\u201d). In apparent recognition of the problem with its argument, after arguing in its opening brief and before the District Court that \u201c[n]o one purchased the lien at the tax sale, so Carbon County acquired the lien,\u201d Zinvest has changed its argument in its reply brief, arguing that \u201cZinvest, however, was the purchaser at the tax sale....\u201d That would appear to re-posture the Untitled Document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>as a tax lien sale certificate, and the second document as a true assignment, as it states. However, the Untitled Document fails to include several of the items of information required for tax lien sale certificates under subsection -212, and thus cannot satisfy the requirements for such a document. In any event, the record does not support the factual contention that Zinvest was a purchaser at the tax lien sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b616 We have \u201cfirmly maintained the position that procedural requirements set forth in tax deed statutes must be strictly observed.\u201d <em>Isern, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Lowery v. Garfield Cnty., </em>122 Mont. 571, 208 P.2d 478 (1949); <em>Hudson v. McDonald, </em>229 Mont. 426, 747 P.2d 221 (1987); <em>Spain-Morrow Ranch, Inc. v. West, </em>264 Mont. 441, 872 P.2d 330 (1994); <em>Tax Lien Services v. Hall, </em>277 Mont. 126, 919 P.2d 396 (1996)). Such exacting scrutiny is a necessity, as tax deed sales involve a citizen\u2019s right to property being challenged by the government and can result in the loss of property at well below its full value. As the District Court noted in this case, we thus require \u201cpunctilious compliance with all statutory and procedural requirements\u201d because of the interests at stake. <em>Isern, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b617  As explained herein, the documents used in this transaction contain a number of errors that violated the tax deed statutes and created considerable confusion in the property titling process.
