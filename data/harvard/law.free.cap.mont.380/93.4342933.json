(Golden Triangle). After recovering workers\u2019 compensation insurance benefits in the amount of $207,147, Stokes brought a civil action against his employer, Golden Triangle, seeking additional deimages for injuries he sustained during the course of his employment. Stokes contended Golden Triangle was an uninsured employer under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), thereby permitting him to pursue a civil claim against Golden Triemgle. The District Court determined that Golden Triangle was an insured employer under the Act and entitled to tort immunity pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b62 We affirm and address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that Golden Triangle was entitled to tort immunity pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u00b64 Golden Triangle is a Montana corporation that does business as First National Pawn in Great Falls. FNP, Inc. (FNP) is a corporation that owns and controls pawn shops in Billings and Bozeman. Golden Triangle and FNP have the same shareholders, but are separate corporate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\u00b65 On June 11,2009, PayneWest Insurance Company (PayneWest), an insurance broker, submitted an application to Employers Compensation Insurance Company (ECIC), requesting workers\u2019 compensation insurance on behalf of FNP and Golden Triangle. Nathan Allie (Allie), an insurance agent for PayneWest, handled the account and facilitated preparation of the application. The application listed FNP as the sole named applicant, but provided Golden Triangle\u2019s premises as an additional location; listed Golden Triangle\u2019s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN); and included Golden Triangle\u2019s payroll information. Allie testified that by providing Golden Triangle\u2019s information, principally its FEIN, the application was clear that Golden Triangle was requesting insurance as an additional named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">\u00b66 Allie received a quote back from ECIC and prepared a Workers\u2019 Compensation Summary (Summary) for Steve Costin, an employee of FNP and Golden Triangle, to allow Costin to decide whether to insure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the corporations through ECIC. The Summary identified both FNP and Golden Triangle under the Schedule of Named Insureds, and stated that an entity must be named in the insurance policy to receive coverage. After reviewing the Summary, Costin approved insuring through ECIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b67 On June 26, 2009, PayneWest issued an Insurance Binder. The Binder listed FNP as the first named insured, Usted Golden Triangle as an additional named insured, and stated the Binder would be cancelled when replaced by a policy. Alhe testified that PayneWest issued the Insurance Binder to inform FNP and Golden Triangle of the purchased coverage for the upcoming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b68 On June 29,2009, ECIC issued workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy no. EIG115294800 (hereinafter, the Policy). The Policy fisted FNP as a named insured, but did not designate Golden Triangle as a named insured or otherwise reference Golden Triangle or Golden Triangle\u2019s premises. However, the Policy used Golden Triangle\u2019s payroll to calculate the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b69 In addition to the Policy, PayneWest retained what Alfie described as an electronic copy of the Policy. Attached to the electronic copy was a Schedule of Supplementary Names, which identified Golden Triangle as an additional named insured. Alfie testified that the Schedule of Supplementary Names was created from the information submitted on the application and that it matched the application submitted to ECIC. Alfie testified that, because Golden Triangle was a named insured in the Schedule of Supplementary Names, it was a covered insured, regardless of whether the Policy itself expressly identified Golden Triangle. He also testified that PayneWest had authority under its contract with ECIC to bind ECIC and that PayneWest uses the electronic copy to decide whether an entity is insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b610 On February 18, 2010, while in the course and scope of his employment with Golden Triangle, Stokes suffered serious injuries when a large column of ice, which had formed on an outside comer of the building where Stokes worked, fell and hit Stokes on the head. The same day, Golden Triangle sent a First Report of Injury to ECIC, identifying FNP as Stokes\u2019 employer. Stokes filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with ECIC. ECIC accepted the claim and, as of June 4, 2013, made payments in the amount of $207,147. Gina Douglas, an underwriter for ECIC, testified that Golden Triangle was a covered insured under the Policy, the benefit payments were made on behalf of Golden Triangle, and ECIC would not have made the payments had Golden Triangle not been a covered insured under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u00b611 Following an inquiry by the State of Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Division regarding Stokes\u2019 claim, ECIC reviewed the Policy. ECIC determined that, while Golden Triangle was a covered insured under the Policy, Golden Triangle was inadvertently not expressly identified on the Policy. Consequently, ECIC issued a policy endorsement to clarify that Golden Triangle was a covered insured. Golden Triangle\u2019s premium remained unchanged after the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b612 On November 1,2012, Stokes brought the present action against Golden Triangle. Stokes alleged that Golden Triangle was an uninsured employer at the time of the accident. Golden Triangle submitted a motion to dismiss, which the District Court converted into a motion for summary judgment and, after entertaining argument by the parties, issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of Golden Triangle. The court determined that, given the affidavits and documents submitted by Golden Triangle, \"there is no dispute in the record regarding whether or not Golden Triangle was an intended insured under [the] Policy.\u201d The District Court concluded that Golden Triangle was an insured employer under the Act and therefore was entitled to claim immunity pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as the district court. <em>Steichen v. Talcott Props., LLC, </em>2013 MT 2, \u00b6 7, 368 Mont. 169, 292 P.3d 458. Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that Golden Triangle was entitled to tort immunity pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b615 \u201cHie Montana Constitution sets forth the basis for the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provision.\u201d <em>Walters v. Flathead Concrete Prods., </em>2011 MT 45, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913. Article II, Section 16 provides, in part, that \"[n]o person shall be deprived of this full legal redress for injury incurred in employment for which another person may be liable except as to fellow employees and his immediate employer who hired him if such immediate employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>provides coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of this state.\u201d This constitutional provision \u201cis implemented by Section 39-71-411, MCA.\u201d <em>Adsem v. </em>Roske, 224 Mont. 269, 271, 728 P.2d 1352, 1353 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b616 Section 39-71-411, MCA, of the Act grants insured employers tort immunity from negligence actions brought by their employees when the complained of injury is work related, providing that an insured employer \u201cis not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act....\u201d However, uninsured employers are not entitled to the benefit of tort immunity. Section 39-71-508(lXb), MCA, permits an employee who suffers an injury while working for an \u201cuninsured employer^ to \u201cpursue all remedies\u201d against the employer, including but not limited to \u201ca damage action against the employer.\u201d An \u201cuninsured employer\u201d is defined as an \u201cemployer who has not properly complied with the provisions of39-71-401.\u201d Section 39-71-501, MCA. In turn, \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, requires that an employer \u201celect to be bound\u201d by the provisions of a workers\u2019 compensation insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b617 Stokes argues the District Court erred by concluding that Golden Triangle was an insured employer. He argues Golden Triangle was not a covered insured under the Policy, reasoning that the Policy \u201calone created ECIC\u2019s obligation to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance\u201d and \u201c[bjecause the Policy did not mention Golden Triangle, it did not insure Golden Triangle.\u201d Stokes suggests that the insurance benefits he received were conveyed to him because FNP, not Golden Triangle, was insured under the Policy. He asserts Golden Triangle is \u201ca distinct corporation, separate from FNP\u201d and \u201c[cjompliance with the requirement to elect to be bound to a plan that provides workers\u2019 compensation insurance can only be satisfied when an employer actually obtains insurance, not by having another entity insure its employees.\u201d Stokes contends this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Total Mechanical Heating &amp; Air Conditioning v. Employment Rels. Div., </em>2002 MT 55, 309 Mont. 84, 50 P.3d 108, and <em>Dahl v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>1999 MT 168, 295 Mont. 173, 983 P.2d 363, are controlling and require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b618 We have explained that \u201can insurance policy, like any other contract, must be given that interpretation which is reasonable and which is consonant with the manifest object and intent of the parties.\u201d <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 27, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260 (citation and brackets omitted). Under general principles of contract law, insurance policies are to be construed \u201cstrictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b619  Golden Triangle and ECIC agree that Golden Triangle was a covered insured under the Policy. Only Stokes, a third-party, disputes Golden Triangle\u2019s status, asking this Court to disregard the stated intent of the parties to their contract. However, the stated intent of Golden Triangle and ECIC is supported in the record. First, the Policy used Golden Triangle\u2019s payroll to calculate the premium. In doing so, the Policy contemplated that coverage to Golden Triangle\u2019s employees would be provided. Although Stokes maintains the Policy used Golden Triangle\u2019s payroll because Golden Triangle misrepresented its employees as FNP\u2019s employees in the application, the record refutes his contention. The application submitted to ECIC provided Golden Triangle\u2019s information, including Golden Triangle\u2019s FEIN. Allie testified the information made clear to ECIC that Golden Triangle was requesting insurance as a covered insured, and ECIC agreed that they were not misled. Second, the associated documents, including the Insurance Binder, Schedule of Supplementary Names, and the Summary, all named Golden Triangle as a covered insured. Third, the premiums remained unchanged after ECIC issued the corrected endorsement stating that Golden Triangle was a covered insured at the time of the accident. Fourth, Douglas testified that ECIC\u2019s failure to expressly name Golden Triangle was inadvertent and Golden Triangle had always been a covered insured under the Polity. Lastly, ECIC paid, and Stokes accepted, benefits under the Policy in Golden Triangle\u2019s name. Although Stokes suggests that the benefits were paid in FNP\u2019s name, noting the misidentification of his employer in the First Report of Injury, there is no credible evidence showing ECIC mistakenly paid the benefits on behalf of FNP. Rather, Douglas testified the benefits were paid on behalf of Golden Triangle, not FNP, and ECIC would have not made the payments if Golden Triangle had not been a covered insured. Therefore, given the evidence of intent to insure, we agree with the District Court that Golden Triangle was a covered insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b620 Stokes argues that our decisions in <em>Total Mechanical </em>and <em>Dahl </em>require a different conclusion. We disagree. In <em>Total Mechanical, </em>the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF) determined that Human Dynamics Corporation (Dynamics) was uninsured and imposed penalties accordingly. <em>Total Mechanical, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17,29. Dynamics had claimed it was insured under a policy issued by Credit General Insurance Company (CGIC), but the UEF disagreed and listed several concerns, the primarily concern being the policy did not name Dynamics as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>insured. <em>Total Mechanical, </em>\u00b6\u00b66,36. We affirmed UEF\u2019s determination, concludingthere was no \u201ccredible evidence that Dynamics was actually insured under the CGIC policy.\u201d <em>Total Mechanical, </em>\u00b6 40. We explained that Dynamics had failed to produce a \u201ccorrected endorsement from CGIC, or any other confirmatory documentation of coverage\u201d and the \u201conly \u2018proof offered by Dynamics was the unpersuasive, self-serving testimony of Dynamics\u2019 president.\u201d <em>Total Mechanical, </em>\u00b6 40. Here, in contrast, the credible evidence shows Golden Triangle was actually insured under the Policy. Unlike Dynamics, Golden Triangle produced documents demonstrating proof of insurance, including a corrected endorsement issued by ECIC. Therefore, <em>Total Mechanical </em>is distinguishable in that Golden Triangle has offered ample proof of insurance rather than unpersuasive, self-serving testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Dahl, </em>the owner of a concrete business, Dwight Dahl, contracted with Olsten\u2019s Temporary Services (Olsten), a temporary service contractor, to provide him with concrete workers and to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for his employees. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 5. After completing an audit, the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund concluded that Dahl was an uninsured employer because the proper entity was not insuring the workers. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 7. Dahl conceded he did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance in his own name, but maintained that nothing in the Act required him to do so. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 9. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court agreed, concluding that since Dahl\u2019s employees were insured under Olsten\u2019s insurance policy, Dahl was not an uninsured employer. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 9. This Court reversed, holding the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by failing to conclude that \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, required Dahl to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance in his own name. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 17. We explained that, because \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, \u201cclearly and unambiguously requires the \u2018employer\u2019 to elect to be bound,\u201d it is not enough that a separate entity has obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the employer\u2019s employees. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 16. We reasoned the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, requires the <em>\u201cemployer </em>[to] procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance ... for its employees.\u201d <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 16 (emphasis in original). Here, Golden Triangle has, unlike Dahl, actually obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees. While Golden Triangle was not expressly named in the Policy at the time of iiy'ury, Golden Triangle has established that this was an inadvertent administrative error and that it was a covered insured under the Policy. Therefore, <em>Dahl </em>is likewise distinguishable in that Golden Triangle has in fact obtained insurance coverage in its own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00b622 Stokes also argues that Golden Triangle failed to comply with \u00a7 39-71-433, MCA, which governs the purchase of workers\u2019 compensation coverage by a group of two or more employer entities and was thus an uninsured employer under our decision in <em>Buerkley v. Aspen Meadows </em>Ltd. <em>Pshp., </em>1999 MT 97, 294 Mont. 263, 980 P.2d 1046. Noting the statute provides that \u201c[t]wo or more business entities <em>may </em>join together to form a group,\u201d Golden Triangle responds that compliance with \u00a7 39-71-433, MCA, is optional, but this is a misreading of the statute. Participation in an employer group is optional, but compliance with the statute by such groups is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b623 In <em>Buerkley, </em>we held that the defendants were uninsured employers because they \u201chad not properly complied with the enrollment requirement of \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA,\u201d for their workers\u2019 compensation insurance plan. <em>Buerkley, </em>\u00b6 13. Assuming, arguendo, that Golden Triangle failed to comply with the group purchase requirements of \u00a7 39-71-433, MCA, the facts here establish that Golden Triangle did comply with \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, by \u201celecting] to be bound by the provisions of compensation plan No. 1,2, or 3,\u201d which is all that \u00a7 39-71-501, MCA, requires to be an insured employer and thereby receive tort immunity under \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. <em>Buerkley </em>is therefore distinguishable and does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b624  In sum, the evidence presented before the District Court shows that, although ECIC inadvertently failed to identify Golden Triangle in the Policy, ECIC and Golden Triangle intended Golden Triangle to be a covered insured under the Policy and ECIC paid out insurance benefits in accordance therewith. We conclude the District Court did not err in concluding that Golden Triangle was an insured employer under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and therefore was entitled to tort immunity pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
