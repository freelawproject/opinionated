(Worldwide). We reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of CHSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee was lienable as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that the subcontractor\u2019s fee was lienable as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b65 On August 24, 2007, Dick Construction Company (Dick), predecessor in interest to Worldwide, entered into a cost-plus contract with Spanish Peaks Lodge, LLC (Spanish Peaks) to serve as the general contractor for the construction of Spanish Peaks Lodge Resort (Resort) near Big Sky. Pursuant to the contract, Spanish Peaks was to reimburse Dick for the actual costs of construction plus a contractor\u2019s fee of <em>5% </em>of the total cost of the project and <em>5% </em>on self-performed work. The parties capped the total price for the Resort at $130,483,926, which resulted in a contractor\u2019s fee of $6,915,195. Under the terms of the contract, Spanish Peaks was to pay the contractor\u2019s fee in installments as the work progressed, and Dick was entitled to the entire fee in the event the contract was terminated, based upon an estimate of the cost of the work that remained to be completed. To bankroll the project, Spanish Peaks procured financing through Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. (Citigroup), predecessor in interest to CHSP, and Citigroup took a $130 million mortgage against all of Spanish Peaks\u2019 development properly, including the Resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\u00b66 In the fall of2008, during the economic recession, Spanish Peaks suspended work and ceased making the requisite payments to Dick in breach of the parties\u2019 contract. By that point, Dick had invoiced approximately $21 million to Spanish Peaks in materials and labor and had been paid $1,438,968 of the total $6,915,195 contractor\u2019s fee. Spanish Peaks thus owed Dick the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee, or $5,476,277, under the terms of the contract. Spanish Peaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>thereafter filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the Resort was never finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b67 Dick filed a construction hen claiming the amount of $10,500,000. Included in the lien was the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee as well as the amount Dick owed to a subcontractor, Allied Steel, Inc. (Allied Steel), in the amount of $661,767. Allied Steel also filed its own construction hen for unpaid services and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b68 Allied Steel initiated this action against Spanish Peaks, Dick, and Citigroup seeking foreclosure of its construction hen, a money judgment, and a determination of priority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dick filed a cross-claim against Citigroup likewise seeking a determination of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b69 Allied Steel, Spanish Peaks, and Dick entered into a settlement agreement. The agreement provided a lull and final settlement of Allied Steel\u2019s claims against Dick and Spanish Peaks. The agreement provided for Spanish Peaks to pay $500,000 to Dick and for Dick to then pay the $500,000 to AUied Steel. In consideration for the compensation, AUied Steel released and relinquished aU claims against Dick and Spanish Peaks. AUied Steel assigned aU of its claims against Dick and Spanish Peaks to Dick. AUied Steel was then dismissed from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b610 Thereafter, Worldwide purchased the assets of Dick, including Dick\u2019s hen, at a public auction and CHSP purchased the mortgage. Consequently, Worldwide and CHSP became the real parties in interest to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b611 On April 24,2013, the District Court issued an order concluding that Worldwide\u2019s construction hen had priority over CHSFs mortgage. However, the court noted \u201cthe dollar amount that is the basis of the lien is legitimately in dispute.\u201d The court granted summary judgment with respect to priority, but denied summary judgment with respect to the amount of Worldwide\u2019s hen.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b612 On November 5, 2013, CHSP and Worldwide reached a partial settlement, memoriaHzed in a second settlement agreement. Under the terms of the second agreement, Worldwide was paid $2.7 milHon, and Worldwide released all claims against CHSP, except for its claims concerning its right to Hen the unpaid contractor\u2019s fee and the amount of AlHed Steel\u2019s subcontractor\u2019s Hen. On those issues, Worldwide and CHSP filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted Worldwide\u2019s motion, concluding that the unpaid portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>contractor\u2019s fee and the subcontractor\u2019s fee were both secured by Worldwide in the amount of $5,476,277 and $661,767, respectively, and lienable as a matter of law. \u00b613 CHSP appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as the district court. <em>Steichen v. Talcott Props., LLC, </em>2013 MT 2, \u00b6 7, 368 Mont. 169, 292 P.3d 458. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b615 The district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a matter of law, which we review de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation is correct. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b616 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee was lienable as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b617 A construction lien, formerly known as a mechanic\u2019s lien, is \u201c \u2018a creature of statute, remedied in nature, with its foundation in equity and natural justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matos v. Rohrer, </em>203 Mont. 162, 174, 661 P.2d 443, 450 (1983) (quoting <em>Beck v. Hanson, </em>180 Mont. 82, 87, 589 P.2d 141, 144 (1979)). Under the lien statutes, \u201cit is not the contract for erecting or repairing the building which creates the lien, but it is the use of the materials furnished and the work and labor expended by the contractor ....\u201d <em>Smith v. Gunniss, </em>115 Mont. 362, 375, 144 P.2d 186, 189 (1944) (citing <em>Van Stone </em>v. <em>Stillwell &amp; Bierce Mfg. Co., </em>142 U.S. 128, 134, 12 S. Ct. 181, 183); <em>see also Hammer v. Chapin, </em>256 F. Supp. 818, 819-820 (D. Mont. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b618 The statutes governing construction liens are codified in Title 71, chapter 3, part 5 of the Montana Code Annotated. Section 71-3-526(1), MCA, entitles a \u201cperson who has furnished services or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract\u201d to a construction lien for the \u201cunpaid part of the person\u2019s contract price.\u201d In turn, \u00a7 71-3-522, MCA, defines \u201ccontract price\u201d as the \u201camount agreed upon by the contracting parties for performing services and furnishing materials covered by the contract, increased or diminished by: (i) the price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>change orders or extras; (ii) any amounts attributable to altered specifications; or (iii) a breach of contract, including but not limited to defects in workmanship or materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b619 CHSP challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee was lienable. CHSP offers that it is an undisputed fact that the unpaid fee represents compensation for \u201cwork not actually performed,\u201d and argues that only \u201cprofit and overhead on <em>work actually performed\u201d </em>is lienable under \u00a771-3-522, MCA, reasoning that this interpretation is \u201cconsistent with the underlying historical purpose of the construction lien statutes to compensate those who have made actual improvements to real property.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00b620 Worldwide counters that CHSP misinterprets the construction lien statutes and mischaracterizes the unpaid fee. Citing the language in \u00a7 71-3-526, MCA, entitling a contractor \u201cto a lien for the unpaid part of the person\u2019s contract price,\u201d Worldwide argues that the law \u201cunambiguously entitles [it] to secure its entire unpaid contract price with its lien.\u201d Worldwide offers that the \u201cunpaid part of the parties\u2019 contract price dictates the lien amount\u201d and that \u201cthe contract price is controlling.\u201d Worldwide also argues that, contrary to CHSFs statement that it is undisputed that the unpaid contractor\u2019s fee was for unperformed work, Worldwide has \u201cnever agreed the Fee was for work not performed,\u201d and that the record establishes that the fee compensated Dick for the services it did provide on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b621 We construe a statute by \u201creading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u2018without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 25, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819 (quoting <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003). \u201cStatutory construction is a \u2018holistic endeavor\u2019 and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object.\u201d <em>Stockman Bank of Mont. v. Mon-Kota, Inc., </em>2008 MT 74, \u00b6 31, 342 Mont. 115, 180 P.3d 1125 (citing <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>426) (internal brackets omitted). The duly of this Court is to \u201cread and construe each statute as a whole\u201d so that we may \u201cgive effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AuL\">\u00b622 In light of Worldwide\u2019s argument that it is entitled to broadly claim \u201cthe entire contract price,\u201d it should first be clarified that the lien statutes permit claims for \u201cthe amount agreed upon by the contracting parties for performing <em>services </em>and furnishing <em>materials </em>covered by the contract.\u201d Section 71-3-522(3)(a), MCA (emphasis added). By using this language, the Legislature was authorizing liens only for the unpaid amounts of services and materials provided under a construction contract, and not other items. While most construction contracts may primarily provide for services and materials, it is clear that the Legislature did not tie authority to lien to the total amount of the construction contract, but to the unpaid amounts for services and materials provided therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b623 Further, CHSFs argument that construction liens are limited to services that are actually performed and materials that are actually furnished is well supported by the text, structure, and purpose of the lien statutes. As noted above, \u00a7 71-3-522(3)(a), MCA, defines \u201ccontract price\u201d as the amounts the contracting parties have agreed to \u201cfor <em>performing </em>services and <em>furnishing </em>materials.\u201d Section 71-3-526, MCA, permits a person to hen the \u201cunpaid part\u201d of the contract price, but \u201csubject to the provisions of 71-3-524.\u201d In turn, \u00a7 71-3-524, MCA, limits lienable materials to those that: (1) \u201care supplied with the intent that they be used in the course of construction of or incorporated into the improvement\u201d; and (2) are \u201cincorporated in the improvement or consumed as normal wastage in construction operations\u201d; \u201cspecifically fabricated for incorporation into the improvement\u201d; or \u201cused for the construction or operation of machinery or equipment used in the course of construction and not remaining in the improvement.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 71-3-524, MCA, expressly prohibits a contractor from including within its lien amounts for a claim of materials that the contractor has not furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b624 Further, the requisite procedures for perfection of a construction lien contemplate work the contractor has completed. Section 71-3-532, MCA, governing the content of the notice of right to claim, provides: \u201cThe notice of the right to claim a lien must be in writing and state that it is a notice of a right to claim a lien against real estate for services or materials <em>furnished </em>in connection with improvement of the real estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Likewise, \u00a7 71-3-535(3)(e), MCA, the filing requirement provision, requires that a person provide \u201ca description of the services or materials <em>provided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00b625 Lastly, the purpose of the construction lien is to protect the equitable interest of those whose labor or materials have enhanced the value of the property. 56 C.J.S. <em>Mechanics\u2019Liens </em>\u00a7 3 (2\u00d3Q7). They are \u201cdesigned to give security to those who, by their labor, skill, and materials, add value to property.\u201d <em>Davis v. </em>Alvord, 94 U.S. 545, 547, 24 L. Ed. 283, 284 (1877). We have explained that: \u201cOur hen statutes are remedial. They are for the express purpose of providing for the payment of the claims of builders, mechanics and materialmen out of the property to which their work and material have contributed an increased value.\u201d <em>Smith v. Gunniss, </em>115 Mont. 362, 376, 144 P.2d 186, 189 (1943); <em>see also Van </em>Stone, 142 U.S. at 136, 12 S. Ct. at 183 (\u201cit is <em>the use of the materials furnished and the work and labor expended </em>by the contractor, whereby the building becomes a part of the freehold, that gives the material man and laborer his hen under the statute\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, the purpose of the construction hen statutes is advanced only so far as the statutes allow a person to hen for the amount the person has contributed to the property, and it would be wholly inconsistent with the statutes\u2019 purposes to permit a person to hen for uncompleted work.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b626 CHSP concedes that Worldwide could hen for the contractor\u2019s fee on work done prior to termination of the contract. Further, CHSP is correct that, even though Worldwide is contractually entitled to payment of a contractor\u2019s fee based upon a reasonable estimate of the cost of the work that would have been performed, the construction hen statutes do not permit Worldwide to claim a hen for a fee related to such unperformed work.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b627 Worldwide argues that it never conceded that the unpaid contractor\u2019s fee represented compensation for unperformed work, and that the fee should be considered compensation for performed work. Worldwide offers that \u201c[t]here is, in fact, no evidence that the reasonable value of all the services and materials Dick provided does not include the Fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b628  We conclude that the record estabhshes the opposite position. The construction contract between Dick and Spanish Peaks provided that, in the event of termination, the calculation of the contractor\u2019s fee would include \u201ca reasonable estimate of the Cost of the Work for <em>the Work not actually completed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, under the plain terms of contract, the unpaid fee that Worldwide is now seeking to lien was calculated based upon work \u201cnot actually completed.\u201d Dick\u2019s counsel, Ray Crothers, admitted this was the correct interpretation of the contract. When asked whether \u201cthe 5 and-a-half million included in Dick\u2019s construction lien is for the contractor\u2019s fee on work not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>actually completed,\u201d Crothers responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d In District Court, Worldwide conceded that \u201cDick agreed to take a Contractor\u2019s Fee of only <em>5% </em>because the Spanish Peaks Contract allowed for it to still receive the Fee on its unperformed work in the event the Spanish Peaks Contract was terminated.\u201d We conclude that there is no dispute of fact that the unpaid portion of the contractor\u2019s fee represents compensation for work that was not completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b629 In reaching these conclusions, we underscore the difference between what Dick could have recovered in a breach of contract action against Spanish Peaks, and what recovery is permissible in a construction lien situation. Under the language of the cost-plus contract between Dick and Spanish Peaks, Dick was entitled to the entire contractor\u2019s fee in the event the contract was terminated. Once Spanish Peaks went into bankruptcy, however, Dick was compelled to pursue foreclosure of its construction lien against Citigroup, a non-party to the construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b630  For the reasons stated herein, we hold the District Court erred by holding that the unpaid contractor\u2019s fee claimed by Worldwide was properly lienable under the lien statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b631 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that the subcontractor\u2019s fee was lienable as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b632 CHSP argues the District Court also erred by holding that the subcontractor\u2019s fee remained lienable after Allied Steel settled its claim. Worldwide counters that it is entitled to lien the subcontractor\u2019s fee on two grounds: first, as assignee of the lien and, second, as a general contractor claiming its subcontractor\u2019s lien as part of its own contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b633 \u201cThis Court has long held that an assignment does not create a new lien.\u201d <em>Watts v. HSBC Bank United States Tr., </em>2013 MT 233, \u00b6 11, 371 Mont. 295, 308 P.3d 57. Instead, an assignee \u201cstands in the shoes of the assignor.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Credit Serv. Co. v. Crasco, </em>2011 MT 211, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 487, 264 P.3d 1061). \u201cThe assignee obtains no greater rights against the account debtor than the assignor.\u201d <em>Credit Serv., </em>\u00b6 17. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Allied Steel received compensation for its claim, and, in consideration, Allied Steel relinquished all claims against Spanish Peaks, thereby extinguishing its construction lien. Thus, Worldwide cannot claim a construction lien by way of assignment because Allied Steel had no lien to assign.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b634  Worldwide next argues that, as the general contractor, it appropriately included the subcontractor\u2019s fee in its lien because Spanish Peaks owes Worldwide the debt under the contract. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u00a7 71-3-526(2), MCA, provides that a \u201cperson\u2019s lien is reduced by the sum of the liens of persons claiming construction hens through that person.\u201d Pursuant to the statute, Worldwide\u2019s hen must be reduced by the amount of Allied Steel\u2019s hen as Allied Steel is a person claiming a construction hen through it. Therefore, because Allied Steel settled its hen in full, Worldwide cannot, as a general contractor, include within its hen the amounts formerly owed to Allied Steel. We therefore conclude the District Court erred by holding the subcontractor\u2019s fee was henahle.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\u00b635 We hold that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Worldwide. We reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of Worldwide and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of CHSP on the two issues here presented.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-4\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> Numerous other parties had also filed liens on the project and were named in the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> While \u00a7 71-3-522, MCA, speaks in terms of \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cmaterials,\u201d CHSP makes no argument that <em>profits </em>are beyond the scope of the statute. Instead, CHSP presupposes that profits are included within the terms \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cmaterials\u201d and thus are properly lienable so long as the services and materials concomitant with the profits are lienable, although this is not explicitly stated within the text of \u00a7 71-3-522, MCA. We note that at least one authority takes the position that \u201c[o]n a cost-plus contract, only the cost of labor and materials qualifies for lien purposes because the statute makes no provision for profits on this type of contract.\u201d 56 C. J.S. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Liens </em>\u00a7 198 (2007). Nonetheless, we address the issues here as argued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
