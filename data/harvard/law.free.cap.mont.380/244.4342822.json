We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b62 During the pendency of this case, Maloney was also involved in concurrent prosecutions or disciplinary proceedings in Jefferson County and in Butte-Silver Bow DUI Court. The disposition of those proceedings is relevant to our speedy trial and due process analyses. Therefore, we will first describe the facts of the instant case and then explain the circumstances of the concurrent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">\u00b63 On April 2,2013, Maloney was arrested following an incident at his house in Butte-Silver Bow County where he made a number of suicidal threats while intoxicated. Maloney\u2019s children were at the house at the time and contacted their mother, who alerted law enforcement. Following the arrival of law enforcement officers, Maloney\u2019s children and brother left the house, leaving Maloney alone inside. The children informed the officers that Maloney was armed. The officers attempted to convince Maloney to exit the house, hut he refused and threatened to kill himself if officers approached. Later, Maloney fired a shot through the wall of his house which struck an officer, causing minor injuries. Eventually, Maloney agreed to exit the house. When he did so he had a knife enibedded in his abdomen. The officers arrested Maloney.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">\u00b64 That same day, April 2, 2013, Maloney was charged in Butte-Silver Bow County Justice Court with five counts of felony criminal endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, and two counts of felony assault on a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">\u00b65 An information was filed in Butte-Silver Bow County District Court on May 1, 2013. Trial was scheduled for October 7, 2013. On August 27,2013, Maloney filed a motion to re-schedule the trial date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>due to a conflict. Maloney requested the trial take place at the \u201cearliest possible date\u201d after October 7, 2013. The District Court re-scheduled the trial for November 18, 2013. On November 8, 2013, Maloney pleaded guilty to one count of criminal endangerment and one count of assaulting a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b66 On November 15, 2013, the court ordered a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared. The PSI was assigned to a probation officer in Lewis and Clark County, who requested documents from the State including the case file, victims\u2019 contact information and victim impact statements. The State provided the requested documents to the probation officer in January 2014. In February and March, 2014, Maloney provided the probation officer with two letters of support. An Affidavit of Pecuniaiy Loss dated April 17,2014, was provided to the probation officer for the purposes of determining restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b67 On April 25,2014, the probation officer delivered the prepared PSI to the State\u2019s prosecutors. On May 5, 2014, the State filed a motion asking the court to set a sentencing hearing. That same day, Maloney filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. The District Court denied Maloney\u2019s motion in an order dated June 2,2014. On July 17, 2014, the District Court sentenced Maloney to a total of 30 years with five years suspended. Maloney appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Concurrent Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b68 On March 26,2013, approximately one week before his arrest in the instant case, Maloney was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), Fourth Offense, in Jefferson County. He was released on bond on March 27,2013. At the time of the Jefferson County offense, Maloney was participating in Butte-Silver Bow DUI Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b69 Following the Jefferson County charge and the April 2, 2013 incident in the instant case, the DUI Court issued a warrant for Maloney\u2019s arrest. He was held without bond until his sentencing on May 17, 2013. He was sentenced to six months incarceration at the Butte-Silver Bow Detention Center with 38 days credit for time served. On February 26, 2014, the Fifth Judicial District Court in Jefferson County sentenced Maloney to thirteen months incarcerated followed by a five year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b610 Serving these sentences concurrently, Maloney was incarcerated or scheduled to be incarcerated from April 9,2013 through November 9, 2014. Thus, his scheduled incarceration in the concurrent proceedings encompassed almost the entire duration of the relevant procedural portion of the instant case \u2014 pre-sentencing\u2014which began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>with his April 2, 2013 arrest and ended with his July 17, 2014 sentencing. Throughout the time Maloney argues his rights were being violated by prosecutorial delay, he was serving time for other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b611 Maloney presents the question of whether his right to a speedy trial was violated by pre-trial and pre-sentencing delays. However, as discussed below, we recently adopted a new standard for analyzing post-trial, pre-sentencing delays that is distinct from our pre-trial delay analysis. We therefore reframe the issues presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">1. Was <em>Maloney\u2019s right to a speedy trial violated as a result of excessive pre-trial delays caused by the </em>State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\n<em>2. Was Maloney\u2019s right to due process violated as a result of excessive post-trial, pre-sentencing delays caused by the State?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo for correctness. <em>State v. Betterman, </em>2015 MT 39, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 182, 342 P.3d 971. We will affirm a district court if it reached the correct result, even if it reached that result for an incorrect reason. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u00b613 In <em>State v. Mooney, </em>2006 MT 121, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 249, 137 P.3d 532 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 102, n.9, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815), we held that the right to a speedy trial continues through sentencing. Later, <em>in. Ariegwe, </em>we laid out in detail a four factor balancing test that courts should use to analyze whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial had been violated. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. The four factors consisted of: 1) the length of the delay, 2) the reasons for the delay, 3) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and 4) prejudice to the accused caused by the delay. In its order denying Maloney\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court applied this four-part analysis and concluded that Maloney\u2019s speedy trial right had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">\u00b614 Subsequentto the District Courtissuingits order, we reconsidered the question of whether the right to a speedy trial applies to the period of time between the disposition of a case and sentencing. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-24. We concluded that the right to a speedy trial does not apply to the sentencing period, thus overruling <em>Mooney. Betterman, </em>\u00b6 25. Instead, we held that due process protects a defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>unreasonable delay in sentencing. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 27. We went on to articulate a balancing test for due process violations in sentencing delay, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">if a sentencing delay is purposeful and oppressive, then we must determine that there has been a constitutional due process violation. The determination of whether a delay is oppressive incorporates considerations of whether the defendant has suffered prejudice and the degree and nature of that prejudice. Neither factor is to be considered dispositive. Though the reasons for a delay may be less than purposeful, or the prejudice caused by the delay less than oppressive, there may still be a constitutional violation when these two considerations are balanced against one another. Each case requires an independent analysis with consideration of all of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b615 The District Court issued its order based on <em>Mooney </em>and <em>Ariegwe </em>on June 2,2014. Maloney filed his opening brief on appeal on January 5,2015. On February 10,2015, we published our <em>Betterman </em>opinion. On March 31, 2015, the State filed its appellee brief, addressing the case in the context of <em>Betterman. </em>A rule affecting criminal procedure is retroactively applied to cases pending on direct review. <em>State v. Reichmand, </em>2010 MT 228, \u00b6 12, 358 Mont. 68, 243 P.3d 423. Because this case was pending on direct review when <em>Betterman </em>was decided, our holding in <em>Betterman </em>retroactively applies. Furthermore, we note that Maloney did not seek to supplement his opening brief after we released our <em>Betterman </em>decision. Presumably this was due to the fact that the factors we enunciated in <em>Betterman </em>for analyzing a due process violation for sentencing delay (whether the delay was purposeful and oppressive, including consideration of prejudice to the defendant) are substantially similar to the four factor balancing test for speedy trial violation set forth in <em>Ariegwe </em>and relied upon by the District Court (the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and prejudice to the accused caused by the delay). Given the record and relevant legal standards, we are able to analyze Maloney\u2019s claim under the <em>Betterman </em>test based on his arguments advanced for the <em>Ariegwe </em>test without further briefing or fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b616 Having determined that <em>Betterman </em>applies, we now face a two-part inquiry. First, we examine whether Maloney\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated due to post-arrest, pre-conviction delay. Second, we consider whether Maloney\u2019s right to due process was violated due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>post-conviction, pre-sentencing delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b617 <em>1. Was Maloney\u2019s right to a speedy trial violated as a result of excessive pre-trial delays caused by the State ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b618 The four factors a court must consider when determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated are: a) the length of the delay, b) the reasons for the delay, c) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and d) prejudice to the accused caused by the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. The District Court considered each issue and concluded that Maloney\u2019s speedy trial right had not been violated. However, the District Court applied these factors to the entire delay \u2014 from arrest to sentencing \u2014 not the narrower delay between arrest and disposition that is the proper subject of a speedy trial analysis. We will therefore address each factor in turn, focusing our inquiry on the time between the date the State arrested Maloney and the date of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">a) The Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b619  Delay in bringing a defendant to trial is measured from the date of accusation to the date the case is disposed of, either by the beginning of trial or by plea. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 43. The first step in determining whether a defendant\u2019s speedy trial right has been violated is to determine whether that delay was more than 200 days. We have held that 200 days is a threshold. If the delay was less than 200 days, then no further analysis is necessary to conclude that the right to a speedy trial has not been violated. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 107. If the delay was more than 200 days we must consider and balance all four speedy trial factors. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 107. The longer the delay past the 200 day mark, the stronger the presumption of prejudice to the defendant, and the greater the burden on the State to justify the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 107.</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">\u00b620 Maloney was arrested and charged on April 2,2013. His trial was originally scheduled for October 7,2013,188 days later. The trial date was continued at Maloney\u2019s behest until November 18,2013. However, Maloney pleaded guilty on November 8, 2013, 220 days after he was arrested. Because his guilty plea marked the disposition of the case, pre-trial delay must be calculated to that day. The 220 day delay exceeds the 200 day threshold for speedy trial analysis. We therefore proceed to consider the remaining factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">b) The Reasons for the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b621 Under this factor, a court must identify each period of delay and attribute that delay to the appropriate party. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. All delays not demonstratively caused by the defendant are attributed to the State. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. Institutional reasons for delay, such as crowded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>court dockets, weigh less heavily against the State than lack of diligence or bad faith delay tactics. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b622 Maloney does not contest the fact that, of the 220 days between arrest and pleading, 32 of those days are attributable to his motion to continue the trial date. Maloney contends that the remaining 188 days are attributable to the State, but does not sirgue that the State was not diligent or acted in bad faith during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">c) The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">\u00b623 Under this third factor, a court considers the defendant\u2019s conduct with respect to the delays, specifically as regards the defendant\u2019s objection or acquiescence to pre-trial delays. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. A court must examine such circumstances as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">the timeliness, persistence, and sincerity of the objections, the reasons for the acquiescence, whether the accused was represented by counsel, the accused\u2019s pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right), and so forth. The sum of this evaluation \u2014 i.e., the totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial \u2014 is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial, which in turn informs the inquiry into whether there has been a deprivation of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\"><em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. In making this examination, a court should not presume that the defendant did not wish to have a speedy trial solely because he or she acquiesced to delays or did not object early and often. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b624 There is little in the record to indicate Maloney\u2019s responses to the delays prior to his guilty plea. Maloney points out that, in moving the District Court for a continuance, he requested the trial be rescheduled for the soonest possible date. Thus, on the one hand Maloney was consenting to extend the duration of the pre-trial period, while on the other hand requesting the court to make the extension as brief as possible. \u201c[CJonduct evidencing a sincere desire to be brought to trial promptly weighs in favor of the accused in the overall balancing, whereas conduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against the accused in the overall balancing.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 85. Maloney\u2019s pretrial conduct falls squarely in the middle and does not weigh strongly one way or the other. We are satisfied, however, that Maloney did not actively demonstrate an intent to waive his right to a speedy trial. Courts \u201cshould not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental <em>rights.\u201dAriegwe, </em>\u00b6 83 (quoting Barker <em>v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 525-526, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2189 (1972)). Furthermore, the State does not argue that Maloney waived his speedy trial right. Based on the record, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>appears Maloney neither waived his right to a speedy trial nor was particularly active in enforcing that right before filing his motion to dismiss just prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">d) Prejudice to the Accused Caused by the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"Ap5\">\u00b625 The fourth prong of the speedy trial test requires a court to consider whether the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay. This question must be resolved in light of the interests the speedy trial right is designed to protect. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 86. The United States Supreme Court has identified three interests fundamental to speedy trial protection: i) prevention of oppressive pretrial incarceration, ii) minimization of anxiety and concern of the accused, and iii) preservation of the accused\u2019s ability to mount an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 88 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193). We will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">i) Oppressive Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b626 Maloney argues that his pretrial incarceration was oppressive both for the length of time involved and because he was unable to participate in the Warm Springs Addiction Treatment and Change (WATCh) program while incarcerated in the Butte-Silver Bow Corrections Facility. Maloney also points out that we have referred to time in jail as \u201cdead time\u201d and catalogued some of the detrimental effects of incarceration, including loss of employment, disruption of family life, and idleness. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b627 The District Court found that Maloney\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not oppressive because Maloney was earning time served for his six month DUI Court sentence while awaiting trial in this matter. We agree with the District Court. A speedier trial would not have meant Maloney\u2019s release. Furthermore, we note, as did the District Court, that Maloney was receiving chemical dependency treatment while incarcerated. Maloney speculates that the WATCh program would serve him better. However, speculative claims are insufficient to establish prejudice. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">ii) Minimization of Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b628 Here, Maloney essentially restates his arguments regarding oppressive incarceration. He argues that he was in need of alcohol and mental health treatment, that the treatment provided to him was insufficient, and that as a result of the trial delay he suffered anxiety and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u00b629 We reiterate that speculative claims are insufficient to establish prejudice. Maloney admits that he presented no evidence on this issue at the hearing on Ids motion to dismiss. Rather, he asks us to infer his anxiety and concern. This we are unable to do given the record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>us, especially considering that Maloney was, while awaiting trial, serving a six month sentence from the DUI Court with a thirteen month sentence from Jefferson County to follow. Without further evidence on the record we cannot infer from the circumstances that Maloney\u2019s concern and anxiety over the pre-trial delay amounted to prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">iii) Preservation of Accused\u2019s Defense</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">\u00b630 The District Court properly found that, because Maloney pleaded guilty, pre-trial delay did not prejudice his ability to mount a defense. Maloney does not contest this finding,</p>\n<p id=\"ARS\">e) Balance of Speedy Trial Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b631  On balancing the factors above we agree with the District Court that the State did not violate Maloney\u2019s right to a speedy trial. We find the length of the delay and the reasons for the delay to be most compelling in reaching this conclusion. Specifically, we consider it very significant that, had Maloney himself not moved for a continuance, trial would have occurred within the 200 day threshold and there would have been no need for a full speedy trial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b632 Furthermore, though we recognize that Maloney did not waive his right to a speedy trial, nothing in the record evidences a particular urgency on Maloney\u2019s part which would weigh in favor of finding that he was prejudiced by a delay of 20 days beyond the speedy trial threshold, especially when the delay was due in part to his own continuance. Finally, the record does not support Maloney\u2019s claims of prejudice through oppressive incarceration or undue anxiety and concern. Primarily this is due to the fact that Maloney was scheduled to be incarcerated up to and well beyond the trial date, and while incarcerated Maloney was being credited with time served. Maloney\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced because he was prevented from entering the WATCh program is overly speculative. Maloney presented no evidence as to why the available chemical dependency program was deficient or why WATCh would be a more satisfactory alternative. While we applaud Maloney\u2019s desire to receive treatment, his wish to participate in a different treatment program alone is insufficient to show prejudice such that we could conclude that his right to a speedy trial was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b633 <em>2. Was Maloney\u2019s right to due process violated as a result of excessive post-trial, pre-sentencing delays caused by the State?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b634 Having determined that the pre-trial delay was insufficient to support Maloney\u2019s claim that his speedy trial rights were violated, we turn to the question of whether his due process rights were violated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the delay in sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b635 In <em>Betterman </em>we explained that in order to determine whether a sentencing delay violates due process, we balance two factors. First, whether the delay was purposeful. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 32. Second, whether the delay prejudiced the defendant such that it was oppressive. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b636 Here, because the facts in <em>Betterman </em>closely align with the facts in this case, we will rely on that opinion as a useful template for analysis. In <em>Betterman, </em>the defendant, Betterman, pleaded guilty to a bail jumping charge on April 19, 2012. At the time he was serving a multi-year sentence for felony partner-family member assault. Betterman was finally sentenced 434 days later, on June 27,2013. He moved the District Court to dismiss the case for lack of a speedy trial. The court denied the motion and Betterman appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ADc\">\u00b637 We first considered whether the delay was purposeful. We concluded that all but a very small number of days of delay must be attributed to the State, and that the delays were institutional in nature, rather than intentional or done in bad faith. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 33. We cautioned, however, that even though the delays were institutional, 434 days of sentencing delay was an unacceptable overreach on the part of the State. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b638 We then considered whether Betterman was prejudiced by the delay. Betterman argued that he was prejudiced because a quicker sentencing would have provided him access to various correctional programs and services. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 35. We concluded, however, that such claims were overly speculative and did not have a sufficient causal link to Betterman\u2019s sentencing delay for us to conclude that the delay caused him prejudice. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 35. We stated that any prejudice resulting from the delayed sentencing was not \u201csubstantial and demonstrable.\u201d <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 36. We also noted that the fact that Betterman was already serving time for a different crime and would have been in jail whether or not the sentencing had been faster weighed against his claim of prejudice. <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b639 Balancing the two factors, we determined that Betterman\u2019s delayed sentencing, though unacceptably long, did not prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Betterman sufficiently to constitute a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b640 Maloney\u2019s situation is similar to Betterman\u2019s. Maloney pleaded guilty on November 18, 2013 and was sentenced on July 17, 2014. Maloney\u2019s sentencing delay, therefore, was 241 days. Though not as long as Betterman\u2019s sentencing delay, 241 days strikes us as excessive. However, nothing in the record indicates that the delay was peipetuated intentionally or in bad faith. The delay appears to have been entirely institutional, and mostly comprised of waiting for completion of the PSI report. The record indicates that the State\u2019s attorneys provided information to the probation officer preparing the PSI promptly. Even attributing the entirety of the delay to the State, as <em>in. Betterman, </em>the delay appears to have been of the unintentional, institutional variety.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b641 As for prejudice, Maloney\u2019s claims of prejudice closely mirror Betterman\u2019s. Maloney claims that the sentencing delay prevented him from participating in the WATCh program and from receiving other mental health services. Maloney did, however, have access to treatment while awaiting sentencing. As in <em>Betterman, </em>the supposed prejudice in this case is overly speculative to be substantial and demonstrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b642 Like Betterman, Maloney also argues that the sentencing delay increased his anxiety and concern to an extent that supports a finding of prejudice. We have stated, \u201cthe anxiety of an accused is not to be equated for constitutional purposes with anxiety suffered by one who is convicted, in jail, unquestionably going to serve a sentence, and only waiting to learn how long that sentence will be.\u201d <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 35. We find that to be the case especially when the accused was concurrently serving time for another offence, as was Maloney. Based on the facts before us we cannot conclude that Maloney\u2019s anxiety rose to the level of substantial and demonstrative prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b643  Because Maloney was not substantially and demonstrably prejudiced by the sentencing delay, and because the sentencing delay was not purposeful, we conclude that Maloney\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the post-conviction, pre-sentence delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\u00b644 The State did not violate Maloney\u2019s right to a speedy trial through excessive pre-trial delay. Furthermore, the State did not violate Maloney\u2019s due process rights through sentencing delay. Though the sentencing delay was perhaps excessive, Maloney did not suffer substantial and demonstrative prejudice as a result of the delay. Despite the fact that the District Court\u2019s analysis was rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>incorrect by <em>ouxBetterman </em>decision, the court\u2019s conclusion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">NOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b646 Justice Shea initially joined this Opinion. It came to our attention after originally publishing the Opinion on July 28,2015, that Justice Shea\u2019s sister worked on this case as a Silver Bow County Attorney, and that Justice Shea should not have taken part in deciding this case. Pursuant to an order in this case dated July 30,2015, we withdrew the July 28, 2015 version of our Opinion. We reissue it now as a four Justice panel of the Court. The four Justices reconfirm the holdings of this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> We recognized in <em>Betterman, </em>\u00b6 28, that reasonable timeliness of sentencing is a due process guarantee expressed by the Montana Legislature in several statutory provisions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-18-101(3)(a), 46-18-102(3)(a), and 46-18-115, MCA. Maloney, however, has failed to raise a statutory claim under code provisions mandating that a defendant be sentenced in a \u201ctimely\u201d manner, without \u201cunreasonable delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b275-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A2j\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b647 I concur in the Court\u2019s result and analysis. I write separately because I believe much of the analysis is unnecessary. In cases such as this \u2014 where the total delay is greater than 200 days but it is uncontested that the delay attributable to the State is less than 200 days \u2014 I would conclude it is unnecessary to carry out the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis beyond the second factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\u00b648 In <em>Ariegwe, </em>we held that 200 days is a threshold for a speedy trial analysis and, if the delay is less than 200 days, no further analysis is necessary. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 107. If the delay is more than 200 days, we move on to the second factor and assess the reasons for the delay. All delays not demonstrably caused by the defendant are attributed to the State. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. In this case, Maloney conceded, \u201cthat, of the 220 days between arrest and pleading, 32 of those days are attributable to his motion to continue the trial date. Maloney contends that the remaining 188 days are attributable to the State, but does not argue that the State was not diligent or acted in bad faith during that period.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. Once Maloney conceded that the State was responsible for less than 200 days of the delay, any analysis considering his response to the delay or any prejudice he may have suffered from the delay, as would otherwise be required by the third and fourth <em>Ariegwe </em>factors, becomes moot. I therefore would not require the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">\u00b649 The 200-day threshold triggering a speedy trial analysis is nothing more than that \u2014 a threshold; it\u2019s not the Rubicon. Just because a defendant crosses the threshold in factor one does not preclude him from crossing back in factor two. In cases in which that occurs, I contend an analysis of the remaining <em>Ariegwe </em>factors is superfluous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
