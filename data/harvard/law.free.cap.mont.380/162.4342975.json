We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b62 Murray raises one issue on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANe\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in dismissing Murray's declaratory relief action for lacking a justiciable controversy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u00b63 Murray is a resident of Gallatin County who ran unsuccessfully for House District No. 69 during the primary election in June 2010. Jonathan Motl is the current Montana Commissioner of Political Practices (COPP).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u00b64 On December 18,2013, COPP issued a decision finding sufficient evidence that Murray had violated Montana\u2019s campaign practices laws and that civil adjudication of the violations was warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following day, COPP forwarded the sufficiency decision to the Lewis and Clark County Attorney for consideration. On December 24,2013, the county attorney waived his right to participate in the action, citing \u00a7 13-37-124(2), MCA, which then authorized the COPP to pursue an appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">\u00b65 On January 17, 2014, Murray filed an Action for Declaratory Relief in the Gallatin County District Court. Murray sought a determination that Motl, in his capacity as the COPP, violated \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, by referring the sufficiency decision to the Lewis and Clark County Attorney, rather than the Gallatin County Attorney. On February 28,2014, the COPP filed a complaint against Murray in the Lewis and Clark County District Court alleging the various campaign finance and practice violations identified in the sufficiency decision. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>refer to the February28,2014 complaint as the \u201cEnforcement Action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00b66 On March 5, 2014, the COPP filed an answer to Murray\u2019s complaint in the Gallatin County District Court, as well as a notice that the COPP had filed the Enforcement Action in Lewis and Clark County District Court. On March 14,2014, the COPP filed a motion for summary judgment on Murray\u2019s declaratory relief action in Gallatin County. Murray responded on April 7,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b67 On September 22,2014, the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in Gallatin County dismissed Murray\u2019s declaratory relief action for lack of a justiciable controversy and declined to rule on the COPP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Noting its authority under M. R. Evid. 202, the court took judicial notice of the pending proceedings in the First Judicial District Court and concluded that Murray already had \u201can adequate alternative remedy available to him in that he may assert \u2014 and may already have asserted \u2014 the issues sought to be declared here as a defense,\u201d in the Enforcement Action. The court also concluded that any decision it might make would not bind the First Judicial District Court and would otherwise result in an advisory opinion. It declined to exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b68 Murray appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b69 This Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s determination that declaratory relief is not necessary or proper unless the court abused its discretion. <em>Miller v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2007 MT 85, \u00b6 5, 337 Mont. 67, 155 P.3d 1278. However, we review the court\u2019s interpretations of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court erred in dismissing Murray\u2019s declaratory relief action for lacking a justiciable controversy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u00b611 The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA), \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-101 through -313, MCA, is remedial with a purpose of settling and affording \u201crelieffrom uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. \u201cCourts of record within their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>respective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could he claimed.\u201d Section 27-8-201, MCA. \u201cAny person... whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute ... may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d Section 27-8-202, MCA. A court may, however, \u201crefuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment or decree where such judgment or decree, if rendered or entered, would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d Section 27-8-206, MCA; see <em>also In re Dewar, </em>169 Mont. 437, 444, 548 P.2d 149, 153-54 (1976) (\u201cThe purpose of declaratory relief is to liquidate uncertainties and controversies which might result in future litigation and to adjudicate rights of parties who have not otherwise been given an opportunity to have those rights determined. However, it is not the true purpose of the declaratory judgment to provide a substitute for other regular actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b612 This Court has adopted two principles in regards to declaratory judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">First, even though all of the necessary elements of jurisdiction exist, the district court is not required to exercise that jurisdiction. Secondly, a motion to dismiss a declaratory judgment rests with the sound discretion of the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Brisendine v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>253 Mont. 361, 364, 833 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1992) (internal citations omitted). As stated in <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 7, and previous case law, \u201c[i]t is necessary for a justiciable controversy to exist before a court may exercise jurisdiction under\u201d the UDJA. <em>See also Northfield Ins. Co. v. Mont. Ass\u2019n of Cntys, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813 (\u201cliberal interpretation of the [UDJA] is tempered by the necessity that a justiciable controversy exist before courts exercise jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b613 In order to determine whether a justiciable controversy exists, a court applies the following test consisting of three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests. Second, the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion. Third, [it] must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>parties in interest, or lacking these qualities be of such overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuP\"><em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b614 Murray argues that the District Court erred in relying upon the subsequently filed Enforcement Action to determine that no justiciable controversy exists in his Gallatin County declaratory relief action. Murray contends that he meets the criteria for establishing a justiciable controversy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b615  As noted above, the District Court concluded that Murray has an adequate alternative remedy available to him in Lewis and Clark County because Murray may assert the issues raised in his declaratory action as a defense in that action. Murray\u2019s argument that the relief he seeks is separate and distinct from the relief afforded in the Enforcement Action is unavailing. The root of Murray\u2019s request is his contention that \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, obligates the COPP to refer the violation findings to the Gallatin County Attorney in the Enforcement Action instead of the Lewis and Clark County Attorney. Murray may assert this defense in the Enforcement Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b616 Moreover, even if the Eighteenth Judicial District Court rendered a decision, the decision would not \u201ceffectively operate\u201d and bind any other judicial district, including the First Judicial District, nor would a decision \u201cterminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-8-206, MCA; <em>see also Miller, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>see also Northfield, </em>\u00b6 27 (\u201cwhile a declaratory judgment need not resolve all issues between the parties, it must resolve those issues addressed in a manner that will have the effect of a final adjudication\u201d). Such a decision would be merely an advisory opinion, which the parties concede is impermissible. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6 <em>8; Northfield, </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201ccourts have no jurisdiction to issue\u201d advisory opinions).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b617  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Murray\u2019s declaratory relief action. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\"> The above referenced decision, <em>Washburn v.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2007 MT 85, \u00b6 7, 337 Mont. 67, 155 P.3d 1278; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Mont. Ass\u2019n of Cntys, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8,301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813; <em>Brisendine v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>253 Mont. 361, 364, 833 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1992). Proceeding with a declaratory judgment action in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court would not bind the First Judicial District Court, and there would continue to remain uncertainty and controversy as to the proper county in which to file notice of the commissioner's sufficiency findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b619 Although parties have attempted to raise the issue many times, the proper county in which to file notice pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, has yet to be determined by this Court. At each turn, a different statutory roadblock is raised \u2014 the venue statute, rules pertaining to intervention, or provisions allowing district courts discretion to refuse to render judgment pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute. Normally, it would not be so difficult to bring a matter before this Court, especially given the singularity of the issue presented and the familiarity of the litigants with that issue. I suspect the difficulty may be attributable, in part, to the uniqueness of the statute we will perhaps be allowed to interpret, some day, for the benefit of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b620 Suffice it to say, while Murray has the right to a judicial determination of the proper county for filing notice by the commissioner, he does not have the ability, under this particular statute, to insist on which court makes that determination. This is true because the commissioner, as the initiator of the enforcement proceeding, chooses the county in which to file \u2014 subject to challenges which may be raised by the candidate in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b621 It is evident that this will be the only manner in which the issue will be decided by this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
