We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the OTCs are not required to collect and remit taxes on OTC fees under the Lodging Facility Use Tax.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>2.

Whether this Court\u2019s decision should be applied retroactively.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\u00b63 Appellees Priceline.com, Inc.; Travelweb, LLC; Trip Network, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; Expedia, Inc.; Hotels.com, LP; Hotwire, Inc.; Travelocity.com, LP; Site59.com, LLC; and other unnamed entities (\u201cDoes 1 through 1000\u201d) are OTCs that provide online travel information and secure reservations for travelers for lodging and car rental services in Montana. The OTCs use a \u201cMerchant Model,\u201d whereby they negotiate with suppliers for a wholesale rate on rooms or rental vehicles, then charge customers a higher amount. The difference between the cost to the customer and the wholesale rate paid by the OTC includes taxes on the wholesale rate and an amount retained by the OTC as compensation for its services (\u201cOTC fees\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The OTCs collect tax on the wholesale rate and pass the collected tax on to the hotel or rental agency, which in turn remits it to the Department. Currently, the OTCs do not directly remit taxes to the Department, and they do not collect tax on OTC fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\u00b64 In June and July 2010, the Department sent letters to several OTCs, stating, \u201cIt has come to our attention that you may not be registered with the Montana Department of Revenue and/or collecting the 4% Lodging Facility Use Tax, the <em>3% </em>Lodging Facility Sales Tax[,] and/or the 4% Rental Vehicle Sales Tax.\u201d Hie OTCs responded that they had no obligation to register with the Department or to collect the requested taxes. On November 8, 2010, the Department filed suit against the OTCs, arguing that the OTC fees are taxable under both the Lodging Facility Use Tax and the Sales Tax. The OTCs responded by denying responsibility to collect tax on OTC fees received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>customers, and contending that they are not taxpayers with regard to the Lodging Facility Use Tax or Sales Tax. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b65 On March 6,2014, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the OTCs, holding that the plain language of the Lodging Facility Use Tax and Sales Tax statutes contains no basis on which to tax OTC fees. The Department appealed the District Court\u2019s order. The Multistate Tax Commission filed an amicus brief in support of the Department, and the Montana Chamber of Commerce and the Montana Taxpayers Association together filed an amicus brief in support of the OTCs. On April 10,2015, the Court heard oral argument from the parties. On May 15, 2015, the parties filed supplemental briefs on whether the Court must construe and apply the two statutes together. The OTCs requested that, if this Court determines that either statute applies to the OTC fees, we apply our decision prospectively only.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b66 We review summary judgment orders de novo. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149.

Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>City of Missoula v.

Whether the District Court erred in determining that the OTCs are not required to collect and remit taxes on OTC fees under the Lodging Facility Use Tax.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u00b68 In 1987, the Montana Legislature adopted the Lodging Facility Use Tax, \u00a7\u00a7 15-65-101 through 136, MCA, imposing \u201con the user of a facility a tax at a rate equal to 4% of the accommodation charge collected by the facility.\u201d Section 15-65-111(1), MCA. Section 15-65-101(1), MCA, defines \u201caccommodation charge\u201d as \u201cthe fee charged by the owner or operator of a facility for use of the facility for lodging....\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The Lodging Facility Use Tax provides, \u201cThe owner or operator of a facility shall collect the tax....\u201d Section 15-65-112(1), MCA. A \u201cfacility\u201d is \"a building containing individual sleeping rooms or suites providing overnight lodging facilities to the general public for compensation.\u201d Section 15-65-101(4)(a). The statute does not provide a definition for \u201cowner or operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b69 In 2003, the Department promulgated an administrative rule defining \u201cowner or operator\u201d as \u201cany person or organization who rents a lodging facility to the public and is ultimately responsible for the financial affairs of the facility. Such person may be an individual, corporation, partnership, estate, trust, association, joint venture or other unincorporated group or entity.\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.14.101(9) (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Department contends that we should apply this definition and adhere to the Wyoming Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Travelocity.com, LP v. Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>329 P.3d 131 (Wyo. 2014). In <em>Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>the Wyoming Supreme Court determined that the OTCs were \u201cvendors\u201d under a Wyoming statute requiring vendors to collect and remit taxes to the Wyoming Department of Revenue. Wyo. <em>Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>329 P.3d at 139, 143 (citing Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-15-103(c)). Wyoming\u2019s tax code defined \u201cvendor\u201d as \u201cany person engaged in the business of selling at retail or wholesale tangible personal property, admissions or services....\u201d <em>Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>329 P.3d at 139 (quoting Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-15-101(a)(xv)). The Wyoming Supreme Court determined that the OTCs were vendors because they \u201ccontrol the financial aspects of the [retail] transaction completely.\u201d <em>Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>329 P.3d at 143. However, the Department itself defined \u201cowner or operator\u201d as an individual or entity who is \u201cultimately responsible for the financial affairs of the <em>facility.\u201d </em>Admin. R. M. 42.14.101(9) (2003) (emphasis added). The OTCs do not participate in the day-to-day bookkeeping of a facility, make management decisions, or decide how a facility will spend its revenue. In short, they are not responsible for the financial affairs of a facility. Accordingly, the OTCs are not owners or operators under the Department\u2019s administrative definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b610 In the absence of a statutory definition for \u201cowner or operator,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>courts in other jurisdictions have applied the dictionary definition. <em>E.g., Pitt Cnty. v. Hotels.Com, LP, </em>553 F.3d 308, 313 (4th Cir. 2009) (\u201cOperator\u201d means \u201ca person who actively operates a business ... whether as owner, lessor, or employee,\u201d and \u201coperate\u201d means \u201cto manage and put or keep in operation whether with personal effort or not.\u201d) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1580-81 (2002)); <em>City of Branson v. Hotels.com, LP, </em>396 S.W.3d 378, 383 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013) (defining\u201coperate\u201d as \u201c[t]o run or control the functioning of... [,]\u201d and \u201coperator\u201d as \u201c[t]he owner or director of a business or industrial concern\u201d) (quoting <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>920-21 (1975)) (changes in original). The OTCs do not fit within the dictionary definition of \u201cowners or operators.\u201d They do not possess, run, control, manage, or direct the functioning of a hotel or rental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b611  The plain language of the Lodging Facility Use Tax provides no basis for taxing OTC fees. The OTCs are not required to collect or remit the Lodging Facility Use Tax on OTC fees. Because we resolve this issue on the plain language of the statute, statutory interpretation rules dictate that no further interpretation of the Lodging Facility Use Tax is required. <em>Dodson, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b612 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the OTCs are not required to collect and remit taxes on OTC fees under the Sales Tax on accommodations and campgrounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b613 In 2003, Montana adopted the Sales Tax, imposing a sales tax of \u201c3% on accommodations and campgrounds,\u201d and \u201c4% on the base rental charge for rental vehicles.\u201d Section 15-68-102(1), MCA. Under \u00a7 15-68-102(2), MCA, \u201cThe sales tax is imposed on the purchaser and must be collected by the seller and paid to the [Department by the seller. ... The sales tax must be applied to the sales price.\u201d A \u201cseller\u201d is a person who \u201cmakes sales, leases, or rentals of personal property or services.\u201d Section 15-68-101(16), MCA. A \u201cpurchaser\u201d is \u201ca person to whom a sale of personal property is made or to whom a service is furnished.\u201d Section 15-68-101(10), MCA. The \u201csales price\u201d is the \u201ctotal amount or consideration ... for which personal property or services are sold, leased, or rented or valued in money ... .\u201d Section 15-68-101(14Xa), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b614 The OTCs argue that the Sales Tax and the Lodging Facility Use Tax have the same scope, so the two statutes must \u201csink\u201d together. To support their position, the OTCs cite the Department\u2019s administrative rule, which provides: \u201c \u2018Sales price\u2019 as defined in [\u00a7] 15-68-101, MCA[,] is synonymous with the term \u2018accommodation charge\u2019 as defined in [\u00a7] 15-65-101, MCA.\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.14.101(15) (2010). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>administrative rule first was promulgated in 2010, and it did not take effect until after the Department filed suit. Further, this Court is not bound to an agency\u2019s definition of a statutory term. <em>See Denke v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 418, \u00b6 39, 347 Mont. 322, 198 P.3d 284 (stating that Montana courts review an agency\u2019s interpretation of law for correctness). The Sales Tax contains no language indicating that the sales price of an accommodation or rental vehicle is the fee charged by the owner or operator. Instead, the statute dictates that \u201csellers\u201d must collect tax from \u201cpurchasers.\u201d Section 15-68-102(2), MCA. Unlike the Lodging Facility Use Tax, the Sales Tax specifically provides for taxing services valued in money. The statute defines service as \u201can activity that is engaged in for another person for consideration and that is distinguished from the sale or lease of property.\u201d Section 15-68-101(17)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b615 Neither party disputes that the OTCs charge hotel customers a fee for the services they provide, separate from the wholesale rate that the OTCs pay the hotel for a room. The OTCs\u2019 receipt of payment from customers for booking hotel rooms unambiguously is \u201can activity that is engaged in for another person for consideration,\u201d \u00a7 15-68- 101(17Xa), MCA, which the OTCs themselves distinguish from the sale or lease of property. While the statutory definitions of \u201csale\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d distinguish the sale of property from a service, the statute clearly taxes both transactions. Although, at oral argument, the OTCs contended that the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cservice\u201d was in error, the Department pointed out that \u201cservice\u201d appears over forty times in the Sales Tax statute. Accordingly, the Department\u2019s administrative interpretation that \u201csales price\u201d is synonymous with \u201caccommodation charge\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b616  This determination leads us to further conclude that the Lodging Facility Use Tax and the Sales Tax are inconsistent and incompatible. Ihe statutes, created sixteen years apart, tax two separate transactions. The Lodging Facility Use Tax taxes the user of a facility on the amount that an \u201cowner or operator\u201d of the \u201cfacility\u201d charges for a room. Because the OTCs are not owners or operators of facilities, their fees are not subject to the Lodging and Facility Use Tax. By contrast, the Sales Tax taxes the purchaser on the sales price of an accommodation or rental vehicle, which specifically includes the value of services. Accordingly, the statutes need not be construed <em>in pari materia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00b617  The plain meaning of the Sales Tax requires taxing OTC fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It also requires the OTCs, who are \u201csellers\u201d because they \u201cmake[] sales ... of services,\u201d to collect and remit to the Department taxes on those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b618 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the OTCs are not required to collect and remit taxes on OTC fees under the Sales Tax on rental vehicles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b619 The OTCs argue that they are not liable for the Sales Tax on rental vehicles because the tax is applied to the \u201cbase rental charge for vehicles.\u201d The OTCs rely on the canon of statutory interpretation <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>which holds that the expression or inclusion one thing implies the exclusion of another, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>701 (Brian A. Gamer ed., 10th ed. 2014), to argue that the list of charges included under the definition of \u201cbase rental charge\u201d (time of use of the rental vehicle and mileage, personal accident insurance, additional or underage drivers, and accessory equipment) is exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b620 This Court \u201cconstrue[s] a statute by reading and interpreting the statute as a whole, without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature,\u201d <em>MC, Inc. v. Cascade City-Cnty. Bd. of Health, </em>2015 MT 52, \u00b6 14, 378 Mont. 267, 343 P.3d 1208 (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 25, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>819; <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201cif possible, \u2018giv[ing] effect to all\u2019 of its provisions.\u201d <em>MC, </em>Inc., \u00b6 17 (quoting \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA). Section 15-68-102(2), MCA, requires that the sales tax shall be applied to the \u201csales price.\u201d Interpreting \u201cbase rental charge\u201d differently than \u201csales price\u201d would create an internal contradiction in the statute. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 15-68-102(l)(b), MCA (imposing a \u201csales tax\u201d of \u201c4% tax on the base rental charge for rental vehicles\u201d), <em>with </em>\u00a7 15-68-102(2), MCA (\u201cThe sales tax must be applied to the sales price.\u201d). Accordingly, Montana law governing statutory interpretation dictates that \u201cbase rental charge\u201d and \u201csedes price\u201d be read as synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b621  Further, the definition of \u201cbase rental charge\u201d contains a list of charges that the term does <em>not </em>include (discounts, airport fees, fuel, intercity drop charges, and government-imposed taxes). Section 15-68-101(3Xb), MCA. This list is also subject to the statutory canon of interpretation <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. </em>Reading \u201cbase rental charge\u201d as synonymous with \u201csales price\u201d resolves the issue of whether the list of charges included or the list of charges excluded is exclusive. As discussed above, the Sales Tax dictates that the \u201csales price\u201d includes OTC fees. Accordingly, the list of charges included in the base rental charge cannot be exclusive. The Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cbase rental charge\u201d does not change the Sales Tax\u2019s requirement that the OTCs, as sellers, collect and remit to the Department taxes on OTC fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b622 <em>4. Whether this Court\u2019s decision should be applied retroactively.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">\u00b623 In their supplemental brief, the OTCs request non-retroactive application of our decision, arguing that the imposition of any back sales tax would be inequitable because the Department did not take action to collect the tax prior to 2010, and the OTCs will be unable to seek reimbursement from past customers. Under the Sales Tax, \u201cAll sales tax... required to be collected... constitute^] a debt owed to this state by the person required to collect the sales tax ... [,]\u201d \u00a7 15-68-110(4), MCA, and \u201cMiability for the payment of the sales tax... is not extinguished until the taxO ha[s] been paid to the [D]epartment,\u201d \u00a7 15-68-501(1), MCA. As discussed above, the plain language of the Sales Tax includes OTC fees. An analysis of whether to apply our decision retroactively or prospectively under <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S. Ct. 349 (1971), is inapplicable to the present dispute because the Department is entitled to unpaid back sales taxes on OTC fees, just as it would be entitled to collect any other debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u00b624 The OTCs argue that it would be inequitable to apply the Sales Tax retroactively because they relied on the Department\u2019s guidance, rules, and forms in considering the Lodging Tax and Sales Tax coextensive. This argument has merit as applied to the enforcement of the Sales Tax prior to the Department filing suit. However, from the time that the Department filed suit against the OTCs, alleging that they were liable for collecting the Sales Tax, the OTCs were unambiguously on notice that the Department considered them liable for collection of the Sales Tax. The OTCs were also aware that, pursuant to \u00a7 15-68-110(4), MCA, the Sales Tax is a debt owed to the Department. The fact that the OTCs elected not to collect the Sales Tax in the ensuing years after being placed on notice by the Department\u2019s lawsuit does not relieve them of this debt. <em>See Expedia, Inc. v. District of Columbia, </em>Nos. 14-CV-308 &amp; 14-CV-309, 2015 D.C. App. LEXIS 288, at *40, 45 (D.C. July23,2015) (retroactively applying a sales tax to OTC fees, despite the OTCs\u2019 argument that the District of Columbia\u2019s claims were prevented by laches, because the OTCs were on notice that the tax might apply to them). The OTCs\u2019 situation is not appreciably different from any other debtor who contests the validity of a debt, allows the debt to continue to accumulate during the pendency of the litigation to establish the validity of the debt, and then argues it should be absolved of the accumulated debt after the debt is determined to be valid.

However, the statutory language of the Sales Tax, \u00a7\u00a7 15-68-101 through 820, MCA, is ambiguous as to whether an OTC performs a \u201cservice for consideration,\u201d and reference to legislative history is therefore required. Because the legislative history clearly establishes that OTCs were not intended to be part of the tax base, I would not apply the Sales Tax to OTCs. Finally, where two constructions of a tax statute are possible, the question of whether a particular tax applies should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b628 It is well established that \u201cwhen the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing for this Court to construe.\u201d <em>Cherry Lane Farms v. Carter, </em>153 Mont. 240, 249, 456 P.2d 296 (1969); <em>In re Kesl\u2019s Estate, </em>117 Mont. 377, 161 P.2d 641 (1945). This Court \u201cmust read and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result \u2018and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner Enters., Inc. v. Lewis &amp; Clark Cnty. Bd. of Health, </em>286 Mont. 256, 271-72, 950 P.2d 733, 742 (1998) (quoting <em>Christenot v. State, </em>272 Mont. 396, 401, 901 P.2d 545, 548 (1995)). Statutes \u201cdo not exist in a vacuum. They must be read in relationship to one another to effectuate the intent of the statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Overland, </em>274 Mont. 21, 28, 905 P.2d 1088, 1092 (1995). When more than one statute applies to a given situation, such construction, if possible, is to be adopted as will give effect to all. <em>Schuman v. Bestrom, </em>214 Mont. 410, 415, 693 P.2d 536, 538 (1985). \u00b629 The primary operative language of the Sales Tax statute states that a \u201csales tax is imposed on the purchaser and must be collected by the seller\u201d and \u201capplied to the sales price.\u201d Section 15-68-102(2), MCA. The tax is imposed on \u201csales of the following property or services: (a) 3% on accommodations and campgrounds; (b) <em>4% </em>on the base rental charge for rental vehicles.\u201d Section 15-68-102(1), MCA. In order to ascertain exactly what the legislature intended to be taxed, we must resort to the definitions of the terms in these two sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b630 \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 or \u2018selling\u2019 means the transfer of property for consideration or the performance of a <em>service </em>for consideration.\u201d Section 15-68-101(13), MCA (emphasis added). The OTCs <em>are </em>not alleged to be the ones actually maintaining the accommodation and transferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>possession or control of the hotel rooms, but they do perform a service related to the transfer of property. The OTCs act as intermediaries to assist hotels and rental car companies in the transferring of property by way of booking leases, rentals, and sales. We must therefore also look to the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in order to ascertain whether the OTCs are performing a service that comes within the definition of a \u201csale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b631 \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 means an activity that is engaged in for another person for consideration and <em>that is distinguished from the sale or lease of property\u201d </em>Section 15-68-101(17)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Within this definition of \u201cservice,\u201d the word \u201csale,\u201d again, directs us back to \u201cservice for consideration\u201d contained in \u00a7 15-68-101(13), MCA. \u201cLease,\u201d \u201cleasing,\u201d or \u201crental\u201d \u201cmeans any transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property for a fixed or indeterminate term of consideration.\u201d Section 15-68-101(6)(a), MCA. Although the OTCs, because of their third-party intermediary position relating to the sale or lease of property, may be excepted from the service definition by way of being \u201cdistinguished,\u201d such a construction is not entirely clear upon the face of the statute. Whether the legislature intended OTCs to be part of the tax base is further obscured by other language in the Sales Tax statute, such as the definition of \u201csales price,\u201d which may not include a deduction for \u201ccharges by the seller for any services necessary to complete the sale, other than delivery and installation charges,\u201d \u00a7 15-68-101(14)(a), MCA, and the definition of \u201cseller,\u201d which \u201cmeans a person that makes sales, leases, or rentals of personal property or services,\u201d \u00a7 15-68-101(16), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b632 Moreover, both chapters 65 and 68 apply to the same subject matter \u2014 accommodations and campgrounds \u2014 and must be read in relationship to one another. <em>Skinner </em>Enters., 286 Mont. at 272, 950 P.2d at 742. For example, the definitions of \u201caccommodations\u201d in the Sales Tax and \u201cfacility\u201d in the Lodging Facility Use Tax are nearly identical. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-68-101(1), and -102(l)(a)-(b), with \u00a7\u00a7 15-65-101(1), (4)(a), and -111(1), MCA. Additionally, the tax base for the Sales Tax, as set forth in \u00a7 15-68-102(1), MCA, applies to \u201caccommodations,\u201d which overlaps with the \u201caccommodation charge\u201d and \u201cfacility\u201d definitions of the Lodging Facility Use Tax. As both the Lodging Facility Use Tax and Sales Tax statutes have the same subject matter, they must be construed consistently together and with a construction, if possible, which gives effect to each statute. In light of our conclusion in Issue One that OTCs are not required to collect and remit the Lodging Tax, and given that the Sales Tax is far from clear as to whether OTCs provide a \u201cservice,\u201d I would conclude that the Sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Tax statute is ambiguous and the Court must resort to legislative histoiy in order to ascertain legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b633 Montana\u2019s Lodging Facility Use Tax was established in 1987 to impose upon hotel users a tax to be collected by \u201c[t]he owner or operator of [the] facility ....\u201d Section 15-65-112(1), MCA; 1987 Mont. Laws 1557. In 2003, the Sales Tax was enacted as part of the Montana Economic Development Tax Act (Act) introduced by Senate Bill 407. 2003 Mont. Laws 2196. The Act was aimed at reducing individual income tax rates and providing for a \u201climited\u201d sales tax on \u201ccertain property and services.\u201d 2003 Mont. Laws 2196. During the 2003 session, the Legislature narrowed the scope of the sales tax provision initially proposed and, ultimately, the Sales Tax covered only accommodations, campgrounds, and rental cars. S.B. 407, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 2003). We observed in <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 15, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929, that amendments made during a bill\u2019s consideration can be analyzed to determine the intent of the legislature. \u201c \u2018One of the most readily available extrinsic aids to the interpretation of statutes is the action of the legislature on amendments which are proposed to be made during the course of consideration in the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting 2A Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 48:18 (7th ed. 2007)). The Fiscal Note to Senate Bill 407 described the Sales Tax as a \u201cbill [that] would impose a 3% tax on accommodations and campgrounds in addition to the existing accommodations tax[.]\u201d Fiscal Note, S.B. 407, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 2003). The legislative history of Senate Bill407thus establishes that the Montana Legislature did not intend to create a general sales tax, but rather to create a new sales tax on rental cars and increase the tax on accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b634 In 2007, by request of the Department of Revenue, House Bill 147 was introduced with a proposal to add intermediaries, like the OTCs, to both the Lodging Facility Use Tax and the Sales Tax and make them subject to filing, collection, and reporting responsibilities. H.B. 147, 60th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 2007). Specifically, the Department sought to amend both statutes because of its long-standing interpretation that the two taxes should be enforced as one. <em>See </em>Admin. R. Mont. 42.14.101(6). House Bill 147 would have substantially revised the existing Lodging Facility Use Tax and Sales Tax to include the services of intermediaries like the OTCs. H.B. 147,60th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 2007). However, the Legislature rejected House Bill 147 and the Department\u2019s attempt to expand taxes to the OTCs. In my view, the legislative histories of Senate Bill 407 and House Bill 147 demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the intent of the Montana Legislature to create and preserve a limited sales tax in Montana which does not include intermediaries such as the OTCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b635 Even if the legislative history were not determinative, it has long been the settled rule that, in considering a tax statute that is susceptible to two constructions, any reasonable doubt as to the persons or property intended to be subject to a particular tax should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the taxing authority. <em>Cherry Lane </em>Farms, 153 Mont. at 249, 456 P.2d at 301. It is impermissible for courts to expand a tax by implication. <em>In re Estate of Armstrong, </em>133 Mont. 328, 331-32, 323 P.2d 595,597 (1958); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (office of a judge is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b636 For the foregoing reasons, both the Lodging Facility Use Tax and Sales Tax are inapplicable to third-party intermediaries like the OTCs. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court in its entirety.</p>\n<judges id=\"b385-6\">JUSTICE RICE joins the concurrence and dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
