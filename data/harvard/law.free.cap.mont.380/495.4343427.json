Opportunity is a rural community a few miles east of a former copper smelter operated by the Anaconda Company. Appellee Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) is the successor in interest to the Anaconda Company. During smelting operations, which took place between 1884 and 1980, the smelter emitted smoke and fumes containing arsenic and other toxic materials. Particles of these materials settled on the surrounding lands. The area is now classified as a Superfund site. Appellants filed this action April 17,2008, seeking damages for the cost of restoring their properties to their original state. ARCO moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds, arguing that the conduct complained of ceased almost 30 years prior to the filing of the complaint. Appellants responded that the continued presence of contaminants on their property constitutes a continuing tort and falls within an exception to the statute of limitations. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of ARCO on all claims, finding that Appellants\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u00b62 Appellants present the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\n<em>1. Whether application of the continuing tort doctrine requires evidence of the continued migration of contaminants.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\n<em>2. Whether genuine questions of material fact exist regarding the reasonableness of abating the contamination on Appellants\u2019 properties.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">\n<em>3. Whether the continuing tort doctrine applies to Appellants\u2019 claims other than nuisance and trespass.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">\n<em>4. Whether the facts constituting Appellants\u2019claims were concealed or self-concealing, or whether ARCO took action preventing Appellants from learning those facts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b63 The Anaconda Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> opened its first copper smelter in 1884, twenty-six miles west of the mining town of Butte. At the time of its opening, the Anaconda smelter was the largest in the area, with plans already underway to double its capacity. To house workers for this immense enterprise, the town of Anaconda was founded adjacent to the smelter works. A second smelter was completed in 1888, and the combined facility was capable of processing6,000tons of copper ore per day. In 1902, with the existing works already becoming obsolete, a new smelter was constructed with an eventual capacity of more than 8,000 tons per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b64 Smelting copper ore involves the application of heat to break the chemical bonds between the desired copper and minerals in the surrounding rock, including sulfur, iron, and arsenic. Soon after operations began at the new works in 1902, nearby farmers and ranchers began to complain that arsenic released from the smelter was killing their livestock. The Anaconda Company paid for the damaged livestock and took remedial measures at the smelter. Individual smokestacks were replaced by a system of flues designed to let the smoke cool, allowing harmful particles to condense and settle to a fine dust, before being discharged through a single main stack. The height of the main stack was increased to 300 feet to allow the smoke to be discharged higher in the atmosphere, where any remaining harmful materials would be dissipated over a wider area.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b65 The farmers\u2019 and ranchers\u2019 concerns about harm to their crops and livestock from arsenic deposited on their lands were not alleviated by these measures. In 1905, Fred Bliss, representing the Deer Lodge Valley Farmers\u2019 Association, filed suit against the Anaconda Company. The United States also filed suit regarding damage to federally-owned property caused by smelter emissions. As a result of negotiations stemming from that suit, a three-member commission was instituted to study the emissions problem and make recommendations for remedial action. Among other improvements, the \u201cSmoke Commission\u201d recommended construction of a new 585-foot main stack to propel emissions even higher into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b66 As part of the efforts to settle lawsuits brought by Bliss and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>others, the Anaconda Company obtained smoke and tailings easements allowing the deposition of smelter waste on the subject properties, including many of those now owned by Appellants. The Anaconda Company also purchased significant amounts of land near the smelter. On this land, the Anaconda Company set out to establish a rural housing community for smelter workers, called Opportunity. The Anaconda Company\u2019s aim in founding Opportunity was twofold: to attract stable, loyal, and reliable employees; and to quiet concerns about smelter emissions by showcasing a bucolic community situated directly beneath the plume. The Anaconda Company transferred the land that would become Opportunity to the Deer Lodge Valley Farms Company \u2014 run by Anaconda Company officers \u2014 with language in the deed reserving to the Anaconda Company an easement allowing the deposition of smelter waste on the land. The easement was then incorporated by reference into the deeds transferred to new Opportunity homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b67 In 1977, the Anaconda Company was purchased by ARCO. The smelter ceased operations in 1980. The Anaconda Smelter Superfimd Site was established in 1983 under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). All of Appellants\u2019 properties he within the Superfimd site, which covers an area of more than 300 square miles. The Environmental Protection Agency organized several public meetings as remediation plans were developed. The environmental contamination in the area was the subject of extensive newspaper coverage. Children in Anaconda provided urine samples to be tested for arsenic exposure. Soil and groundwater sampling and testing was conducted on many properties in Opportunity, including some of those owned by Appellants, beginning in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b68 Appellants filed this action on April 17, 2008, stating causes of action for negligence, public nuisance, private nuisance, trespass, strict liability for the conduct of an abnormally dangerous activity, constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, and wrongful occupation of real property. Appellants sought damages for the frill cost of restoring their properties to their original, uncontaminated state. On September 12, 2013, ARCO moved for summary judgment on all claims on the grounds they were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. ARCO argued that Appellants had known about the possible contamination of their properties for years, if not decades, and thus could have brought suit earlier. ARCO also argued that Appellants\u2019 claims should not be considered continuing torts, because the contamination was not reasonably abatable and Appellants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>produced no evidence that it continued to migrate. Moreover, ARCO claimed the continuing tort doctrine was applicable only to claims for trespass and nuisance, and could not save Appellants\u2019 remaining claims from the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b69 In response, Appellants argued that ARCO had previously represented that Opportunity was free of contamination, preventing Appellants from investigating the actual extent of harm to their properties. Appellants further argued that the migration of contaminants is not required to establish a continuing tort, and that remediation plans proposed by their experts demonstrated that the contamination could be reasonably abated. Finally, Appellants argued that the continuing tort doctrine could be applied to their claims of negligence, strict liability, wrongful occupation, and unjust enrichment in addition to their claims of nuisance and trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b610 ARCO also moved for summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 negligence claim, on the grounds that Appellants had failed to disclose expert witness testimony defining the applicable standard of care; on Appellants\u2019 claim for restoration damages, on the grounds that Appellants\u2019 proposed remediation of the site was barred by CERCLA; on all claims concerning Appellants\u2019 properties subject to smoke and tailings easements; on Appellants\u2019 unjust enrichment, constructive fraud, strict liability, and wrongful occupation claims, on grounds specific to each; and on Appellants\u2019 claims for trespass and nuisance, on the grounds that Appellants suffered no actual property damage as a result of the contamination. The District Court heard arguments on the pending summary judgment motions on November 18 and20,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"AxR\">\u00b611 On December 17, 2013, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of ARGO on all claims, finding they were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. The District Court concluded that due to widespread awareness about contamination from the smelter and the availability of environmental testing, Appellants should have known the facts constituting their claims earlier. The District Court also concluded that application of the continuing tort doctrine requires evidence of continued migration of contaminants, which the District Court found Appellants had failed to produce. The District Court also concluded that Appellants had not identified facts showing that their proposed abatement was reasonable, further precluding application of the continuing tort doctrine. Finding the statute of limitations issue dispositive with respect to all claims, the District Court did not address the remaining motions for summary judgment. The District Court ordered dismissal of the entire action, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) criteria as the district court. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. <em>56(c); Estate of Willson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 13, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410. Summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists. <em>Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 507, 155 P.3d 1241 <em>(quoting Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 71, 304 Mont. 356, 22 P.3d 631). The moving party must \u201c \u2018exclude any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact\u2019 by making a \u2018clear showing as to what the truth is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37 (quoting <em>Toombs v. Getter Trucking, Inc., </em>256 Mont. 282, 284, 846 P.2d 265, 266 (1993)). If there is any doubt as to whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b613 Statutes of limitations promote basic fairness. <em>Burley v. BNSFRy. Co., </em>2012 MT 28, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 77, 273 P.3d 825. They suppress stale claims, <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 16, ensuring that the responding party has a reasonable opportunity to mount an effective defense, <em>Mont. Pole &amp; Treating Plant v. I.F. Laucks &amp; Co., </em>993 F.2d 676, 678 (9th Cir. 1993). Statutes of limitations compel the exercise of a right of action within a reasonable time, because excessive delay \u201cis clearly not conducive to a fall presentation of the evidence nor a search for the truth.\u201d <em>E.W. v. D.C.H., </em>231 Mont. 481, 484, 754 P.2d 817, 819 (1988), <em>superseded by statute, </em>\u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, <em>as recognized in Cosgriffe v. Cosgriffe, </em>262 Mont. 175, 177-78, 864 P.2d 776, 777-78 (1993). Generally, a claim accrues and the limitations period begins to run when all elements of the claim or cause of action exist, including damages. Section 27-2-102, MCA; <em>Uhler v. Doak, </em>268 Mont. 191, 196, 885 P.2d 1297, 1300 (1994). At times, however, principles of fairness require us to recognize exceptions to this rule. <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 678. Appellants argue that two such exceptions apply to their claims: the continuing tort doctrine and the discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b614 Before addressing these exceptions, we note the following statutes of limitations applicable to Appellants\u2019 claims: For an action based on fraud, including constructive fraud, two years, \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Deschamps v. Treasure State Trailer Court, Ltd., </em>2010 MT 74, \u00b6 33, 356 Mont. 1, 230 P.3d 800; for injury to property, including nuisance and trespass, two years, \u00a7 27-2-207, MCA; for unjust enrichment, three years, \u00a7 27-2-202, MCA; IV. <em>Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 41, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450; and for general tort actions, including negligence and strict liability, three years, \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 complaint was filed April 17,2008. Absent an exception to the applicable limitations periods, and applying the longer three-year period for purposes of this analysis, Appellants\u2019 claims are time-barred if they accrued earlier than April 17,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether application of the continuing tort doctrine requires evidence of the continued migration of contaminants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b616 A nuisance is defined, in relevant part, as \u201c[ajnything that is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... .\u201d Section 27-30-101(1), MCA; <em>Graveley Ranch v. Scherping, </em>240 Mont. 20, 22-23, 782 P.2d 371, 373 (1989). A trespass is an intrusion on a party\u2019s right to exclusive possession of his or her property. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Tally Bissell Neighbors, Inc. v. Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, LLC, </em>2010 MT 63, \u00b6 38, 355 Mont. 387, 228 P.3d 1134). Injuries to property, includingnuisance and trespass, have a limitations period of two years. Section 27-2-207, MCA; <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 16. Both nuisance and trespass, however, may constitute continuing torts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u00b617 A continuing tort is one that is \u201cnot capable of being captured by a definition of time and place of injury because it is an active, progressive and continuing occurrence. It is taking place at all times.\u201d <em>Floyd v. City of Butte, </em>147 Mont. 305, 312, 412 P.2d 823, 826 (1966). The continuing tort exception may be applied to injuries that are ongoing or in some way recurring. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 14 (continuing tort doctrine \u201capplies to a temporary injury that gives rise to a new cause of action each time that it repeats.\u201d). For example, in <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>batteries left on the defendants\u2019 properly discharged lead onto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>neighboring ranch, poisoning several of their cattle. <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 21, 782 P.2d at 372. The leaching of lead from the batteries onto plaintiffs\u2019 properly was a condition that would continue until the batteries were removed, while the death of cattle from exposure to lead was an injury that periodically recurred. We held that the nuisance was \u201ccontinuing until it is abated; the statute does not begin to run until the batteries are removed and the toxic residue cleaned....\u201d <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375. Further, if the nuisance was not abated, we noted that \u201ca new cause of action may arise each time a cow becomes ill or dies as a result of lead poisoning.\u201d <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b618  Although we refer here to the \u201ccontinuing tort doctrine,\u201d the simple fact that the condition constituting a nuisance or trespass continues to exist does not itself suffice to toll the statute of hmitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The continuing tort doctrine requires us to consider whether a nuisance or trespass is temporary or permanent in character. A permanent nuisance or trespass is \u201cone where the situation has \u2018stabilized\u2019 and the permanent damage is Reasonably certain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haugen Trust v. Warner, </em>204 Mont. 508, 513, 665 P.2d 1132, 1135 (1983) <em>(quoting Blasdel v. Mont. Power Co., </em>196 Mont. 417, 640 P.2d 889 (1982)). If a nuisance or trespass is permanent, the limitations period begins to run \u201cfrom the completion of the structure or thing which constitutes or causes the nuisance,\u201d and all damages caused by the nuisance or trespass must be recovered in a single action. <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 23, 782 P.2d at 373. When damages for a permanent nuisance or trespass are assessed once and for all, then the plaintiff will be permitted to recover both past and prospective damages. The continuing tort doctrine does not toll the statute of limitations in cases of a permanent nuisance or trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"AIjR\">\u00b619 When we refer to a continuing nuisance or trespass for purposes of the continuing tort doctrine, we are actually referring to atemporary nuisance or trespass. The terms \u201ccontinuing\u201d and \u201ctemporary\u201d are often used synonymously or interchangeably by courts. <em>See, e.g., Hoery v. United States, </em>64 P.3d 214, 217-18 (Colo. 2003). If a nuisance \u201cis terminable, it cannot be deemed a permanent nuisance,\u201d and is therefore considered temporaiy. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 514, 665 P.2d at 1135. If a nuisance or trespass is temporary, its repetition or continuance \u201cgives rise to a new cause of action, and recovery may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>had for damages accruing within the statutory period next preceding the commencement of the <em>action...Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 23, 782 P.2d at 373 (quoting <em>Walton v. City of Bozeman, </em>179 Mont. 351, 356, 588 P.2d 518, 521 (1978)). Thus, the injured party may maintain successive actions for damages incurred during the statutory period prior to the filing of each complaint. <em>Shors v. Branch, </em>221 Mont. 390, 397, 720 P.2d 239, 243 (1986); <em>see also Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp., </em>912 P.2d 1220, 1230 (Cal. 1996). Prospective damages are unavailable when the injury is continuous and recovery is limited to actual injury suffered prior to commencement of each action.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b620 These distinctions could create particular problems for the parties. For example, if the defendant is willing and able to abate the nuisance it may be unfair to award prospective damages on the presumption that the nuisance will continue. On the other hand, if it appears improbable that the nuisance can or will be abated, or if the plaintiff is willing that the nuisance continue provided compensation is paid for past and future injuries, then it may be unreasonable to leave the plaintiff to the troublesome remedy of successive actions. Thus, when distinguishing between permanent and continuing nuisances, each case must be determined upon its own peculiar circumstances by applying the considerations of abatability. As determined in <em>Burley, </em>fundamental considerations underlying abatability include the cost of abatement, the type of property affected, the severity of contamination, and the length of time necessary to remediate the contamination. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 89. By maintaining a focus on whether the ii\\juiy can be discontinued or abated, we remain true to these basic principles of recovery for damages due to successive injuries. Necessarily, this will require consideration of whether the contamination has stabilized or continues to migrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Burley, </em>we addressed a certified question from the United States District Court for the District of Montana asking how the continuing tort doctrine would apply to \u201cproperty damage claims of nuisance and/or trespass resulting from contamination which has stabilized, continues to migrate, and is not readily or easily abatable.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1-2. In <em>Burley, </em>as here, operations at a former industrial site \u2014 in that case, a rail yard-resulted in the discharge of toxic pollutants which contaminated the soil of neighboring properties. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 5. Like the Anaconda smelter, the rail yard closed in the 1980s, and thus no further contaminants were being generated or discharged by the time the neighboring landowners brought suit in 2007. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5,8. In this case, as in <em>Burley, </em>there appears to be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>dispute that \u201cthe overall concentration of pollutants in the underground plume no longer [is] increasing.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>f 20. We held that \u201c[contamination that has stabilized in terms of quantity or concentration, but continues to migrate will toll the statute of limitations until the harm no longer reasonably can be abated.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 4. As requested in the certified question, we addressed the elements of stabilization, migration, and abatability, but nevertheless maintained a focus on reasonable abatability as the dispositive factor in determining whether a tort is permanent or temporary. \u201cThe fact that the nuisance at issue could be abated in some fashion permeates this Court\u2019s historical nuisance cases.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 74. Here, we will likewise address stabilization and migration, but will not deviate from the central principle, stated in <em>Burley, </em>that reasonable abatability defines whether a tort is permanent or temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b622 Courts have employed different analytical approaches when addressing the role of migration in application of the continuing tort doctrine. The approaches vary depending on whether the focus of inquiry is on the conduct of the tortfeasor or the nature of the injury suffered by the property owner. One approach holds that the statute of limitations begins to run at the time the defendant stops engaging in the offensive activity and is no longer adding to the contamination, even if the contamination remains present and continues to migrate. <em>Village of Milford v. K-H Holding Corp., </em>390 F.3d 926, 933 (6th Cir. 2004). Another holds that a trespass or nuisance continues after the defendant has stopped engaging in the offensive activity only if the contamination continues to migrate, seeping onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties within the limitations period preceding the complaint. <em>Taygeta Corp. v. Varian Assocs., </em>763 N.E.2d 1053, 1064-65 (Mass. 2002). Yet another group of cases has found that migration was present and would establish a continuing tort, but did not conclusively analyze whether a continuing tort could be established in the absence of either migration or continuing activity. <em>Arcade Water District v. United States, </em>940 F.2d 1265, 1268 (9th Cir. 1991); <em>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers v. Aera Energy, LLC, </em>153 Cal. App. 4th 583, 584 (2007). Although these cases addressed migration and continuing activity, they held that reasonable abatability was ultimately the defining characteristic of a continuing tort. <em>Arcade, </em>940 F.2d at 1268; <em>Starrh, </em>153 Cal. App. 4th at 596. The final approach holds that a trespass or nuisance continues for as long as the contamination remains on the plaintiff\u2019s property and can be abated, even if the contamination is stable and non-migrating. <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 215; <em>Bradley v.

In contrast, where \u201cdamage is not yet permanent,\u201d the nuisance is of a \u201ctemporary and continuance character and gives rise to a separate cause of action each time it causes <em>damage.\u201d Haugen, </em>204 Mont. at 514, 665 P.2d at 1135; 39 Am.

We rejected the reasoning that the defendant\u2019s cessation of the contaminating activity should trigger the limitations period, and held that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s <em>failure </em>to stop the continuing migration of a nuisance onto a plaintiffs property, where it reasonably can be stopped, constitutes a continuing property invasion.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73 (emphasis in original). We recognized that \u201c[a]ll of the nuisances at issues in these cases would remain, or in other words, be permanent, without some outside action to abate.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41. In adopting the injury-based approach to classification of a trespass or nuisance, we focused on the nature of the injury to the land: if the trespass causes a \u201cpermanent\u201d injury to the land, then the trespass is not continuing; if, however, the injury is \u201cabatable,\u201d then the trespass is a continuing one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b624 Based on the formulation of the certified question from the U.S. District Court, we assumed that contamination from the rail yard continued to migrate onto the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 12. Therefore, we placed <em>Arcade, </em>940 F.2d at 1265, <em>Starrh, </em>153 Cal. App. 4th at 583, <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 214, and <em>Bradley v.

While <em>Burley </em>made clear that migrating contamination would constitute a continuing tort if reasonably abatable, it did not specifically address whether non-migrating contamination would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b625 ARCO argues that this Court should adopt the rule, expressed in Taygeta, that a continuing trespass or nuisance depends on the continuing migration of contamination. In <em>Taygeta, </em>763 N.E.2d at 1056, an electronics manufacturer discharged industrial chemicals onto the ground and into a stream running through its property. The manufacturer also used an underground storage tank that was discovered to have leaked chemicals into the surrounding soil. A treatment system was installed, but contaminated groundwater continued to flow onto neighboring properties. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the mere continued presence of contamination would not establish a continuing tort, because \u201c \u2018a continuing trespass or nuisance must be based on recurring tortious or unlawful conduct and is not established by the continuation of harm caused by previous but terminated tortious or unlawful conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taygeta, </em>763 N.E.2d at 1065 (quoting <em>Carpenter v. Texaco, Inc., </em>646 N.E.2d 398, 399 (Mass. 1995)). A claim based on continuing seepage or migration, however, presented a different circumstance because it involved a series of continuing encroachments on the plaintiffs property. <em>Taygeta, </em>763 N.E.2d at 1065. The court permitted a continuing nuisance claim \"based on the continuing seepage of pollutants that is still occurring within the statute of limitations.\u201d In <em>Taygeta, </em>however, the court imposed no requirement on the property owner to timely pursue a claim. The court found a continuing nuisance because the contamination continued to migrate even though the nuisance was not reasonably abatable and damages were ascertainable. Under <em>Burley, </em>a reasonably abatable nuisance with ascertainable damages must be considered permanent and thus commencing the limitations period for the filing of a claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACU\">\u00b626 Appellants argue that we should instead adopt the approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>stated in <em>Hoery </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>which hold that a trespass or nuisance continues for as long as the offending substance remains on the property and can be abated. In <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 216, the United States disposed of toxic chemicals, including trichloroethylene (TCE), which created underground plumes of toxic pollution extending for several miles beyond the military base where the chemicals were used. The plume continued to migrate even after operations involving the toxic chemicals were stopped. The plaintiffs irrigation well was contaminated, and the Supreme Court of Colorado noted that \u201cTCE remains on Hoer/s property and enters his groundwater and soil on a daily basis, unabated by the United States.\u201d <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 216. The court observed that \u201c[flor continuing intrusions \u2014 either by way of trespass or nuisance \u2014 each repetition or continuance amounts to another wrong, giving rise to a new cause of action.\u201d <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 218 (citing Fowler V. Harper et al., <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 1.7 (3d ed. 1996)). Reasoning that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s invasion continues if he fails to stop the invasion and remove the harmful condition,\u201d the court held that the ongoing presence and the continuing migration of contaminants each constituted a separate continuing tort. <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 218, 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Bradley, </em>709 P.2d at 791, the Supreme Court of Washington held that a \u201ctrespass continues until the intruding substance is removed\u201d in the context of an operational copper smelter that continued to generate particulate emissions, which continued to be deposited on the plaintiffs property. Relying on the Restatement definition of a continuing trespass as \u201can unprivileged remaining on land in another\u2019s possession,\u201d the court did not consider continued activity or migration to be significant factors, and did not engage in further analysisNradiey, 709 P.2dat791 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 158 cmt. m (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b628 We concluded in <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73, that \u201c[t]he fact that a nuisance continues to migrate constitutes an important factor under Montana law in evaluating whether the pollution should be treated as a continuing trespass or nuisance.\u201d Although we considered migration an important factor, we in no way stated that it was a dispositive one. Reviewing our case law, we observed again and again the overriding importance of the question of abatability. In <em>Shors v. Branch, </em>221 Mont. 390, 720 P.2d 239 (1986), a locked gate prevented plaintiffs\u2019 use of their easement rights. We found a continuing tort on the basis that the condition was easily abated by removingthe gate. <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 244. In <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 70, we observed that the tort was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>continuing in <em>Shors </em>despite the fact that it \u201cinvolved a permanent structure that did not move.\u201d <em>In Knight v. City of Missoula, </em>252 Mont. at 245, 827 P.2d at 1278, a newly constructed dirt road increased noise, traffic, and dust on plaintiffs\u2019 property. The dust increased seasonally, but we observed in <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 70, that \u201c[t]his fact played little role in the Court\u2019s determination that the nuisance was of a continuing and temporary nature.\u201d Instead, we found that the nuisance created by the dirt road was continuing because the city could abate it by such means as paving the road. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 70; <em>Knight, </em>252 Mont. at 245, 827 P.2d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b629 <em>Shors </em>and <em>Knight </em>did not involve migration. We went onto discuss several cases that did involve periodic flooding, rising water, and migrating contamination. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 71. We noted that with only one exception, \u201cthe Court classified each nuisance as continuing and temporary until abated [and] further noted in each instance that the nuisance could be abated through some sort of \u2018curative action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 71. In <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375, although lead continued to leach from the discarded batteries, we did not rely on the fact of migration when we held that the nuisance would continue until it was abated. In <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 510, 665 P.2d at 1133, ornamental ponds constructed in a subdivision caused periodic floodingin the basement of a residence. The homeowners were able to abate the flooding by installing a culvert cap, but their neighbors later removed the cap, at which time the flooding resumed. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 511, 665 P.2d at 1133-34. We observed that the nuisance created by the removal of the cap was temporary both because the damage caused by the flooding varied \u201cfrom occurrence to occurrence\u201d and because the nuisance was abatable. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513-14, 665 P.2d at 1135. In <em>Walton v. City of Bozeman, </em>179 Mont. 351, 588 P.2d 518 (1978), the city constructed a storm sewer and relocated an irrigation ditch, causing flooding on the plaintiffs land. We held that \u201cthe damages caused here were a continuing nuisance and as such were within the applicable statute of limitations, because at all times, the City could have abated the nuisance by taking curative action. Since the nuisance was so terminable, it cannot be deemed to be a permanent nuisance ... .\u201d <em>Walton, </em>179 Mont. at 356, 588 P.2d at 521. <em>In Nelson v. C &amp; C Plywood Corp., </em>154 Mont. 414, 465 P.2d 314 (1970), a plywood manufacturer discharged glue waste into a drainage ditch, which contaminated the water supply of the adjacent farm. We held that the nuisance was temporary because it was terminable. <em>Nelson, </em>154 Mont. at 435, 465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>P.2d at 325 <em>(quotingHarrisonville v. W.S. Dickey Clay Mfg. </em>Co, 289 U.S. 334, 53 S. Ct. 602 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b630 The only case in which we have found a continuing properly invasion without reference to its abatability is <em>Blasdel. </em>In that case, plaintiffs\u2019 farm was damaged when construction of the Kerr Dam on Flathead Lake caused the water table to rise. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 419, 640 P.2d at 891. The dam was completed in 1939, and plaintiffs first noticed damage to their land in 1941. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 420, 640 P.2d at 892. For a number of years after, however, the water table continued to fluctuate. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 at 422, 640 P.2d at 892. The water table did not stabilize until 1960, at which time plaintiffs filed suit. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 at 422, 640 P.2d at 892. We concluded that the injury was temporary until the water table stabilized, at which point it became permanent. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 426, 640 P.2d at 894. Abatement of the injury was never addressed in <em>Blasdel, </em>an inverse condemnation case, because \u201cinverse condemnation by its very nature contemplates a permanent taking of property.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 24. More importantly, however, our inquiry in <em>Blasdel </em>concerned the nature of the injury to the property owners, recognizing that the \u201csource of the entire claim\u201d was the \u201coverflow due to rises in the level of the river,\u201d which we identified as a continuing event. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont at 425, 640 P.2d at 894. While the dam itself was permanent, the relevant issue for statute of limitations purposes was determining when the rising groundwater had stabilized sufficiently to assess the permanent injury for purposes of the condemnation proceedings. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 425-26, 640 P.2d at 894. \u201cIt made little sense to require Blasdels to file an inverse condemnation action until they could determine the extent of the taking of their property worked by the rising groundwater tables caused by the Kerr Dam.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 24. <em>Blasdel </em>did not present a claim of nuisance or trespass. <em>Blasdel, 196 </em>Mont. at 419, 640 P.2d at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"AZW\">\u00b631 Our continuing nuisance and trespass cases have consistently considered reasonable abatement to be a determinative factor. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 71. Our consideration of migration, on the other hand, has been inconsistent. <em>Compare Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 243, <em>and Knight, </em>252 Mont. at 245, 827 P.2d at 1278, <em>with Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513-14, 665 P.2d at 1135. Nevertheless, even in those cases where migration was present, we maintained our focus on the question of whether the injury could be abated. <em>E.g., Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375; <em>see also Arcade, </em>940 F.2d at 1268; <em>Starrh, </em>153 Cal. App. 4th at 596. In <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 51, we also rejected the notion that stabilization of the contamination should provide a bright-line rule on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>whether to classify a nuisance or trespass as continuing. While \u201cstabilization\u201d in <em>Burley </em>referred to the fact that the tortfeasor was no longer adding to the nuisance or trespass, our discussion of stabilization relied on the same cases as our discussion of migration, and our analysis overlapped in many respects. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 41 (discussing stabilization of migrating waters in <em>Blasdel </em>and <em>Haugen Trust). </em>Just as \u201c[a]lleged \u2018stabilization\u2019 of the nuisance, on its own, rarely determines permanency of the injury,\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41, neither will migration, on its own, determine permanency of the injury. Again, \u201c[w]e discern one consistent theme in reviewing the historic decisions of this Court that evaluate whether a nuisance should be classified as temporary or permanent: whether the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b632 Finally, our decision in <em>Burley </em>to focus on the nature of the injury and whether it is reasonably abatable is consistent with the principle that statutes of limitations ought to promote basic fairness and allow the parties a degree of certainty and predictability by which their actions may be guided. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 16. If we were to regard continued migration as determinative of the limitations period, liability for contamination would not depend on the actions of the tortfeasor or the diligence of the property owner. Rather, continued liability would be determined by factors not within the control of the parties, such as soil characteristics or the flow of groundwater. We decline to leave the operation of the law to chance. While migration remains an \u201cimportant factor,\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73, it is not determinative or required. It is instead among the factors, such as the type of property affected and the severity of the contamination, to be considered when determining the nature of the injury and whether a trespass or nuisance can reasonably be abated. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b633  Although we have considered other factors, such as migration, in defining a continuing trespass or nuisance, we have consistently evaluated those factors in light of the reasonable abatability of the condition. In <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73, while concluding that migration \u201cconstitutes an important factor,\u201d we observed that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s <em>failure </em>to stop the continuing migration of a nuisance onto a plaintiffs property, where it reasonably can be stopped, constitutes a continuing property invasion.\u201d Further, in our discussion of abatability, we did not question whether a nuisance or trespass must be abatable to be regarded as continuing. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 74-98. Indeed, the requirement of abatability permeated every aspect of our analysis. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-41,51,60,70-71,73. Our discussion of abatability was focused only on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the standard by which abatability should be measured. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 89. We recognized that establishing reasonable abatability as the defining characteristic of a continuing tort would \u201cfurther accomplishO the companion goal of bringing finality to a dispute for purposes of the statute of limitations.\u2019\u2019 <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 88. If the condition can be abated, the reasonable abatability standard encourages the tortfeasor to perform the abatement in order to avoid successive actions. When the condition cannot be abated, the ipjured party may instead recover all of their damages in a single action, promoting finality. <em>Starrh, </em>153 Cal. App. 4th at 598. Thus, we reaffirm the conclusion reached in <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 98: \u201cWhen no further abatement is reasonable, the injury is complete, and the injury is permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b634 <em>2. Whether genuine questions of material fact exist regarding the reasonableness of abating the contamination on Appellants\u2019 properties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZD\">\u00b635 We turn now to the third factor identified in <em>Burley: </em>reasonable abatabilify. We observed that consideration of the ease with which a nuisance could be abated \u201cpermeates this Court\u2019s historical nuisance cases.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 74.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We rejected the arguments that a nuisance or trespass that is not \u201creadily or easily abatable\u201d must be classified as permanent. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 82. Recognizing that we had previously declined to cap restoration damages at the market value of the property, we noted that limiting the continuing tort doctrine to readily or easily abatable conditions would similarly provide potential tortfeasors with \u201c \u2018an incentive to disregard or discount risks of contamination or pollution to neighboring property owners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 87 (quoting <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 46, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079). Instead, we adopted the rule that a nuisance or trespass may be continuing if it is \u201creasonably abatable.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 89. We described the reasonable abatability standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">Courts should evaluate whether it would be reasonable for the tortfeasor to abate the harm taking into account all factors, including the ease with which the harm could be abated. Other factors include the cost of abatement, the type of property affected, the severity of contamination, and the length of time necessary to remediate such pollution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\"><em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 89. We now add that whether the contamination continues to migrate is relevant to the ease of abatement, the cost of abatement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the severity of the contamination, and the length of time necessary for abatement, and are therefore among the factors to be considered when determining whether a nuisance or trespass is reasonably abatable. Further, potential abatement must \u201cbe an actual possibility within reasonable capabilities of the parties.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 90 (quoting <em>Burk Ranches v. State, </em>242 Mont. 300, 306-07,790 P.2d 443, 447 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"An-\">\u00b636 We then stated that the \u201creasonableness question must be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 91. Our discussion in <em>Burley </em>regarding the necessity of making factual determinations prior to a ruling on the statute of limitations bears repeating here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">We recognize the potential inconvenience to a district court of having the jury resolve factual disputes that implicate a potentially dispositive statute of limitations affirmative defense. A district court may be required to hold in abeyance any ruling on the statute of limitations affirmative defense until the jury first determines whether the nuisance reasonably can be abated and thereby the nuisance qualifies as a continuing tort. The court would address whether the limitations period had run only if the plaintiff fails to establish the elements of a continuing tort, as determined by the jury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 92. We later noted that although reasonable abatability is a jury question, \u201c[t]he district court retains the ability to grant summary judgment where the plaintiff fails to establish a genuine issue of fact.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 95. We acknowledged that this threshold would likely be cleared in most cases, but pointed to <em>Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp., </em>912 P.2d 1220, 1226 (Cal. 1996) <em>(\u201cMangini IF), </em>as an example of a case in which the plaintiff failed to establish sufficient evidence of the reasonability of a proposed abatement. In <em>Mangini II, </em>\u201cthe evidence clearly showed that no one knows how bad the contamination is or how to remedy it \u2014 indicating an absence of substantial evidence of abatability.\u201d 912 P.2d at 1226. The plaintiffs conceded there was not enough known about the site to assess possible remedied measures, and the California Supreme Court concluded they \u201cdid not come anywhere close to showing even an estimate of the cost of abatement.\u201d <em>Mangini II, </em>912 P.2d at 1226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b637 Finally, we rejected the argument that the plaintiff must demonstrate the possibility of complete abatement. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 96. We held instead that a nuisance is abatable if it can be reduced. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 97 (citing <em>Beatty v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), </em>860 F.2d 1117, 1124 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">A tortfeasor should not avoid liability for his contamination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>simply because his misdeeds cannot be undone completely. The degree of abatement determines instead whether permanent damages can be ascertained. When no further abatement is reasonable, the injury is complete, and the injury is permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AED\"><em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b638 The remediation plan proposed by Appellants\u2019 expert, Kane, requires excavating the top two feet of soil from Appellants\u2019 properties \u2014 approximately 650,000 tons, to be disposed of at a waste management facility in Spokane, Washington \u2014 and replacing it with clean fill. Kane\u2019s proposed remediation of shallow groundwater involves installation of an underground passive reactive barrier (PRB) approximately 8,000 feet long. Estimates of the cost of the proposed abatement range from $38 million to $101 million, depending largely on where the contaminated soil is disposed, and the project would take nearly two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b639 The rebuttal report prepared by David Folkes, a geotechnical and environmental consultant, one of ARCO\u2019s retained experts, argues that remediation could be limited only to those properties where arsenic concentrations in the soil exceed the EPA-approved residential threshold of 250 ppm. Folkes also states that ARCO has already offered to remediate those portions of Appellants\u2019 residential properties exceeding 250 ppm, and that the cost of the remediation is estimated at $82,500. Pasture land exceeding250 ppm could be remediated at an estimated cost of $1,026,000. Folkes states that although the EPA threshold for pasture land is 1,000 ppm, ARCO has also already offered to remediate pasture land exceeding 250 ppm. Finally, Folkes claims that if remediation of shallow groundwater is necessary, a gravity drain could be installed at lower cost than the PRB proposed by Kane. In Folkes\u2019s opinion, however, neither a PRB nor a gravity drain would be effective in reducing arsenic concentrations in the shallow groundwater below Appellants\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b640  ARCO argues that Appellants\u2019 proposed remediation is excessive because there is no evidence that the level of contamination on the properties is \u201csevere\u201d or that the condition of the properties would actually be improved by the proposed abatement. ARCO claims that not only the cost of remediation, but also the disruption to neighboring properties in Opportunity and surrounding communities would be unreasonable. Despite this argument, ARCO has offered to conduct its own remediation efforts. This is similar to the circumstances addressed by the D.C. Circuit in <em>Beatty. </em>In that case, Defendant WMATA moved for summary judgment claiming vibrations from a subway tunnel near Beatty\u2019s property constituted a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>nuisance. <em>Beatty, </em>860 F.2d at 1119. In response, Beatty referred to a report generated by WMATA\u2019s own acoustical consultant stating that the vibrations could be reduced. <em>Beatty, </em>860 F.2d at 1119. Because the report was clearly known to WMATA, the court concluded that \u201cWMATA could not properly have asserted there were no genuine issues for trial.\u201d <em>Beatty, </em>860 F.2d at 1121-22. In this case, Appellants have proposed one plan with a maximum cost of $101 million; ARCO has proposed alternatives that would partially abate the contamination on some of Appellants\u2019 properties at a minimum cost of $82,500. ARCO has not met its summary judgment burden of demonstrating the complete absence of any genuine issue of material fact regarding the reasonableness of abatement. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b641 We have stated that whether contamination continues to migrate may be relevant to a jury\u2019s determination of whether the contamination can reasonably be abated. In its order granting summary judgment in favor of ARCO, the District Court concluded that Appellants had failed to identify any evidence establishing a material factual dispute regarding whether the contamination continues to migrate, potentially foreclosing further consideration of the issue by a trier of fact. While migration is not the dispositive factor in determining whether a tort is continuing, migration may be material for a jury to consider in determining whether abatement is reasonable under the particular circumstances of the contamination. On appeal, ARCO continues to assert that Appellants have offered no evidence of migration, and that the evidence undisputedly shows the contamination has not continued to migrate into or through the soil or groundwater. Appellants, on the other hand, assert that leaching and lateral flow of the arsenic contamination on their properties is continuing. Migration includes any vertical or horizontal movement of contaminants, including leaching, seepage, or percolation. <em>See United States v. CDMG Realty Co., </em>96 F.3d 706, 715 (3d Cir. <em>1996); Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b642 The primary evidence offered by Appellants is the expert report prepared by geologist and hydrologist John Kane. Kane developed a remediation plan for Appellants\u2019 properties that includes installation of an underground PRB. The PRB would be installed up-gradient from Appellants\u2019 properties. Implicit in Kane\u2019s plan to install a PRB is the assertion that a PRB is necessary because contaminated groundwater is moving down-gradient. Kane cites a report prepared for ARCO in 1996, which identified two sources of dissolved arsenic in the groundwater, one of which was \u201ccontaminated soil due to widespread deposition of smelter emissions.\u201d Kane also refers to potential \u201cloading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>sources for metals to the aquifer\u201d including \u201cleaching of metals from wastes in railroad grade material, from contaminated soils, and from contaminated sediment of the Blue Lagoon.\u201d Kane also refers to a monitoring well \u201cdowngradient of Yellow Ditch\u201d containing \u201csignificantly higher arsenic\u201d than groundwater elsewhere in the area. Kane states that the elevated arsenic concentration in the area of the monitoring well may come from contaminated sediments in Yellow Ditch, contaminated water flowing into Yellow Ditch, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b643 ARCO offers the rebuttal report from Folkes. Folkes refers to studies concluding \u201cthat seepage from creeks and ditches in the site area as well as flood irrigation has caused arsenic to migrate to the groundwater table in the area... known as South Opportunity.\u201d Folkes argues that installation of a PRB would not be an effective means of remediation because \u201carsenic in shallow groundwater is the result of a variety of factors, including background and interaction with shallow soils and seepage from irrigation ditches and streams, which would occur on both sides of any wall installed in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b644 The record presented here does not persuade us that ARCO, as the party moving for summary judgment, met its burden of \u201cmaking a \u2018clear showing as to what the truth is\u2019 \u201d regarding a complete absence of migration. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37 (quoting <em>Toombs, </em>256 Mont. at 284, 846 P.2d at 266). The competing expert reports offered by the parties are sufficient to demonstrate that the issue of whether contamination continues to migrate is appropriate for resolution by a trier of fact. Further, removing this evidence from the jury's consideration would necessarily present them with incomplete information about the characteristics and nature of the contamination. The jury may consider evidence of migration as part of its determination of whether the contamination is reasonably abatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b645  Further, ARCO argues that abatement is unreasonable because Appellants cannot perform the proposed remediation of their properties due to EPA oversight. This argument is also the subject of two affirmative defenses raised by ARCO, contending that Appellants\u2019 claims are in conflict with the remediation plan selected by the EPA and are barred by CERCLA; ARCO\u2019s two motions for summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 claim for restoration damages, under both CERCLA and Montana law; and Appellants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment on ARCO\u2019s affirmative defenses. These matters have not yet been addressed by the District Court, and we will not address them here. Our discussion is limited to the statute of limitations issue. With respect to the statute of limitations, we must determine only if there is a genuine question of material fact regarding whether the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the contamination is such that it can reasonably be abated by some means. The argument raised by ARCO does not address whether the contamination itself is of a type that can reasonably be abated, but raises the separate question of who may perform that abatement. This argument goes to the appropriateness of restoration damages, and is properly decided in the context of the several pending motions on that issue. It would be premature and inappropriate for us to decide at this stage whether Appellants would be able to use a hypothetical award of restoration damages to actually conduct their proposed abatement. We conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the contamination on Appellants\u2019 properties can reasonably be abated. The question of reasonable abatability must be decided by the trier of fact. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b646 As one final note on damages, we recall that application of the continuing tort doctrine allows recovery of damages incurred during the statutory period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint. <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 23, 782 P.2d at 373. For nuisance and trespass, this period is two years. Section 27-2-207, MCA; <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 16. ARCO claims Appellants have produced no evidence of damages sustained during this period. Appellants have claimed, among other things, \u201creasonable compensation for loss of use and enjoyment of real property,\u201d and \u201creasonable compensation for annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort... .\u201d As we have observed, \u201c[wjhere there has been trespass to land, damages for the discomfort and annoyance to the occupant, in addition to damages to the land or for the loss of use of the land itself, have long been recognized.\u201d <em>French v. Ralph E. Moore, Inc., </em>203 Mont. 327, 333, 661 P.2d 844, 847 (1983). Appellants submitted evidence, in the form of their affidavits regarding their use of their properties, sufficient to defeat summaxy judgment on the question of their subjective annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort as a result of the contaxxxination on their properties. Given that the issue before us is linxited to the statute of limitations, we need not Anther address the question of available damages should Appellants succeed on their claims. We therefore reverse the order of summary judgment to the extent it requires evidence of continued migration of contaminants, concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to continued migration, and concludes that Appellants have failed to identify facts showing that their proposed abatement was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"A4K\">\u00b647 <em>3. Whether the continuing tort doctrine can he applied to claims other than nuisance and trespass.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b648 In addition to alleging continuing nuisance and trespass, Appellants have filed claims for strict liability, negligence, unjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>enrichment, and wrongful occupation of real property. They argue that the continuing tort doctrine should apply to each of these causes of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants argue that \u201c[wjhen a party causes an object to enter the property of another, through negligent conduct or through abnormally dangerous activity giving rise to strict liability, the party is liable for trespass.\u201d Further, they argue that the principle of \u201cholding a responsible party continuously liable for the failure to remove abatable pollution from the property of another,\u201d which underlies their nuisance and trespass claims, \u201capplies equally to [Appellants\u2019] wrongful occupation and unjust enrichment claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b649  We begin with Appellants\u2019 claim of strict liability. In alleging strict liability for the conduct of an abnormally dangerous activity, Appellants claim \u201c[t]he manner in which [ARCO] mined, milled, smelted, used, disposed, and released such materials at their facilities is and was inappropriate ... .\u201d Undisputedly, such \u201cmining, milling, smelting, use, disposal, and release\u201d of materials ceased decades ago. A claim based upon strict liability for the conduct of an abnormally dangerous activity, however, does not mean that the defendant is liable simply for the conduct of the activity; it means that the defendant is liable for harm resulting from the activity, even if the defendant acted with reasonable care. <em>Matkovic v. Shell Oil Co., </em>218 Mont. 156, 159, 707 P.2d 2, 3-4 (1985). Strict liability is not an injury, but a theory by which a plaintiff may attempt to establish a defendant\u2019s liability for an injury. <em>Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 218 (\u201cLiability for nuisance may rest upon any one of three types of conduct: an intentional invasion of a person\u2019s interest; a negligent invasion of a person\u2019s interest; or, conduct so dangerous to Ufe or property and so abnormal or out-of-place in its surroundings as to fall within the principles of strict UabiUty.\u201d). If the alleged injury is one which may be considered continuing, such as nuisance or trespass, the plaintiff may aUege an appropriate theory of UabiUty associated with that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b650  The same is true of AppeUants\u2019 claim of negUgence. Appellants allege that ARCO was negUgent in that it failed to control and contain toxic substances generated by its operations; failed to prevent toxic materials from migrating to neighboring properties; failed to exercise reasonable care to contain toxins once it knew or should have known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>it polluted a large area; failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the escape of toxins; failed to remove the toxic substances from Appellants\u2019 properties; and failed to warn Appellants of the scope of and dangers posed by the contamination. Negligence, like strict liability, is not an injury but a theory of establishing liability for an irqury. <em>Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, </em>1999 MT 77, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 294 Mont. 76, 979 P.2d 1275 (discussing types of nuisance, including nuisance caused by negligence); <em>see also Hoery, </em>64 P.3d at 218. As with strict liability, if the injury is of a nature that may be considered continuing, the plaintiff may allege an appropriate theory of the defendant\u2019s liability for that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b651 We next address Appellants\u2019 claim of unjust enrichment. Appellants claim that ARCO\u2019s unauthorized use of their property to \u201cdispose of, deposit, and store toxic substances\u201d has benefitted ARCO monetarily, to the detriment of Appellants. Unjust enrichment is traditionally conceived of as an implied contract theory requiring payment for a benefit conferred. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 29, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450. More broadly speaking, \u201c \u2018[a] person is enriched if he has received a benefit, and he is unjustly enriched if retention of the benefit would be uqjust. Unjust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawrence v. Clepper, </em>263 Mont. 45, 53, 865 P.2d 1150, 1156 (1993) (quoting 66 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Restitution and Implied Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-4 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b652 The Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment further provides that one who \u201cobtains a benefit by an act of trespass or conversion, by comparable interference with other protected interests in tangible properly, or in consequence of such an act by another, is liable in restitution to the victim of the wrong.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 40 (2011). Unjust enrichment may arise from interference with real property when the defendant has made valuable use of the plaintiff\u2019s property without paying for it. Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 40 cmt. c. This is exactly the circumstance alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"A3c\">\u00b653 Ordinarily, the period of limitations for an unjust enrichment claim begins when all elements of the claim exist or have occurred. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 41 (citing \u00a7 27-2-102(2), MCA). We have not previously considered application of the continuing tort doctrine to claims of unjust enrichment. Other courts have reached varying results, depending upon the circumstances of each case. For example, in <em>Stratton v. Royal Bank of Canada, </em>712 S.E.2d 221, 229 (N.C. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>App. 2011), the Court of Appeals of North Carolina declined to apply the continuing tort doctrine to the plaintiffs claim that the bank, after a series of mergers and exchanges, failed to recognize stock certificates issued to her mother some 80 years earlier. Although the plaintiff alleged that failure to recognize the stock certificates had continually deprived her of shareholder rights, the court concluded that these were not continuing violations, but the continuing effects of a single occurrence. <em>Stratton, </em>712 S.E.2d at 230. In another case, the same court applied the continuing tort doctrine to a claim of unjust enrichment where the plaintiff alleged a recurring failure to make monthly salary payments. <em>Marzec v. Nye, </em>690 S.E.2d 537, 542 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010). In that case, refusal to pay the salary month after month constituted a series of continual unlawful acts. <em>Marzec, </em>690 S.E.2d at 542. Noting the divergent outcomes of these cases, the North Carolina court observed that application of the continuing tort doctrine requires consideration of the \u201cparticular policies of the statute of limitations in question, as well as the nature of the wrongful conduct and harm alleged.\u201d <em>Stratton, </em>712 S.E.2d at 229. We agree that case-specific considerations should play a role in our analysis, while keeping in mind the overarching policy goals of both statutes of limitations and the continuing tort exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b654 The distinguishing characteristic of a continuing tort is that it can be reasonably abated. In this case, even assuming, as Appellants claim, that the alleged nuisance and trespass can be reasonably abated by removal of the contamination on their properties, such removal would not abate or remedy the alleged unjust enrichment of ARCO. The only abatement possible for unjust enrichment under the circumstances of this case is to pay monetary restitution for the value of ARCO\u2019s use of the property over the preceding years. If the continuing tort doctrine were applied in cases where abatement is only possible through the payment of money for past wrongs, any suit seeking damages would arguably qualify as a continuing tort. This is not consistent with the policies underlying the doctrine as an exception to statutes of limitation. We decline to apply the continuing tort doctrine to Appellants\u2019 claim of unjust enrichment under the circumstances ofthis case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b655 Appellants\u2019 final cause of action is for wrongful occupation. The District Court applied the two-year statute of limitations applicable to commencement of an action upon a liability created by statute. Section 27-2-211, MCA. The District Court presumably reached this conclusion based on \u00a7 27-1-318, MCA, which provides the measure of damages to be applied in a case of wrongful occupation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property in cases not otherwise provided for in this code is deemed to be the value of the use of the property for the time of such occupation, not exceeding 5 years next preceding the commencement of the action or proceeding to enforce the right to damages, and the costs, if any, of recovering the possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b656 The application of a two-year statute of limitations, as set forth in \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA, would, in most cases, conflict with a provision allowing recovery of damages for the preceding five years as set forth in \u00a7 27-1-318, MCA. Further, a statute that establishes the measure of damages does not establish the underlying liability. <em>See </em>37 C.J. <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 123 (1925) (The phrase \u2018liability created by statute\u2019 means a liability which would not exist but for the statute ....\u201d). For example, Title 27 includes a number of statutes providing the measure of deunages for various causes of action based on contractual obligations. Sections 27-1-311 (breach of contract), -312 (breach of obligation to pay money), -314 (breach of agreement to convey real property), -315 (breach of agreement to buy real property), MCA. In such cases, it is the contract, not the statute establishing the measure of damages, which creates liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b657 Claims of wrongful occupation have traditionally arisen in response to a claim of adverse possession, or in other circumstances where one person has occupied or possessed the land of another. <em>Weter v. Archambault, </em>2002 MT 336, \u00b6 32, 313 Mont. 284, 61 P.3d 771 (affirming district court conclusion that refusal to sign quit-claim deeds was not \u201cwrongful occupation\u201d in the sense recognized by previous cases); <em>Goodover </em>v. <em>Lindey\u2019s, Inc., </em>255 Mont. 430, 434, 843 P.2d 765, 767 (1992) (wrongful occupation in boundary dispute where defendant constructed restroom and underground storage tanks that occupied the disputed area); <em>Smithers v. Hagerman, </em>244 Mont. 182, 797 P.2d 177 (1990) (claim of adverse possession defeated and damages for wrongful occupation awarded where garage and septic system encroached on neighboring property); <em>Martin v. Randono, </em>175 Mont. 321, 329, 573 P.2d 1156, 1161 (1978) (plaintiff who maintained residence on the property from 1959 through 1971 conceded liability for wrongful occupation when claim of adverse possession failed); <em>Pritchard Petroleum Co. v. Farmers Coop. Oil &amp; Supply Co., </em>121 Mont. 1, 4, 190 P.2d 55, 57 (1948) (damages awarded for wrongful occupation where \u201crespondent entered upon the property and took possession of all of it and used and occupied the premises\u201d from 1935 until 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b658 Our cases on wrongful occupation have not directly addressed the statute of limitations issue. A review of our cases reveals, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that the claim is not considered time-barred even if it was filed many years after the occupation first began. <em>Martin, </em>175 Mont. at 323, 573 P.2d at 1158 (1978) (claim filed in 1972, where permissive use of the land ended as early as 1965); <em>Pritchard, </em>121 Mont. at 4-6, 190 P.2d at 57 (claim filed in 1941, where occupation began in 1935). The language of \u00a7 27-1-318, MCA, limiting damages to the five years immediately preceding the commencement of the cause of action, also suggests that a cause of action could be brought more than five years after a wrongful occupation of real property has begun \u2014 there would be no need, otherwise, to limit the period of recovery. The accrual of a claim of wrongful occupation is not the first date of occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b659  We have not had occasion to consider accrual of such a claim after the occupation has ended, for the practical reason that a claim of wrongful occupation is so often brought in an effort to regain the property from the party wrongfully in possession. Indeed, that is the case here, where Appellants claim ARCO continues to wrongftdly occupy their properties by allowing the ongoing presence of contamination. In addressing the statute of limitations issue, we are not asked to address whether Appellants\u2019 claim that ARCO continues to \u201coccupy\u201d their properties through the continued presence of contaminants is \u201c \u2018wrongful occupation\u2019 in the sense that our previous cases have recognized it.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 32. We conclude only that the claim may be considered continuing. The District Court erred in applying the two-year statute of limitations found in \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA, given the statutory provisions of \u00a7 27-1-318, MCA, limiting recovery to the five-year period preceding commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b660 <em>4. Whether the facts constituting Appellants\u2019claims were concealed or self-concealing, or whether ARCO took action preventing Appellants from learning those facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b661 The fact that a party does not know that he or she has a claim, whether because he or she is unaware of the facts or unaware of his or her legal rights, is usually not sufficient to delay the beginning of the limitations period. Section 27-2-102(2), MCA; <em>State ex rel. Egeland v. Cut Bank, </em>245 Mont. 484, 488, 803 P.2d 609, 611-12 (1990); <em>Bennett v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>220 Mont. 117, 120-21, 713 P.2d 992, 994 (1986). The discovery rule constitutes an exception to this general principle, stating that if the facts constituting the claim are concealed or self-concealing in nature, or if the defendant has acted to prevent the injured party from discovering those facts, the period of limitations does not begin to run until the injured party has discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, both the injury and its cause. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>27-2-102(3), <em>MCA;Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co. v. Addink, </em>2013 MT 319, \u00b6 21, 372 Mont. 334, 312 P.3d 451; <em>Bennett, </em>220 Mont. at 121, 713 P.2d at 995. Further, the statute of limitations pertaining to actions based on fraud specifically provides that such a claim does not accrue until discovery of the facts constituting the fraud. Section 27-2-203, MCA. Reading \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-102 and -203, MCA, together, we have concluded that \u201cthe statute of limitations for an action based on fraud begins when the fraud occurs unless the facts which form the basis for the allegation are, by their nature, concealed.\u201d <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance Socy., </em>276 Mont. 1, 14, 914 P.2d 976, 985 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b662 The presence of latent disease or the nondisclosure of information are classic examples of injuries that may be, by their nature, self-concealing. <em>Kaeding v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>1998 MT 160, \u00b6 17, 289 Mont. 343, 961 P.2d 1256; <em>Blackburn v. Blue Mountain Women\u2019s Clinic, </em>286 Mont. 60, 79, 951 P.2d 1, 12 (1997). An injury that is not apparent to the layperson because of its complexity, and which can ultimately only be discovered by professional analysis, may also be considered self-concealing. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Stanley L. &amp; Carolyn M. Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 42, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620. This principle is applied in professional malpractice cases, where we have held that a party is entitled to rely on professional advice without the burden of hiring a second expert to monitor the work of the first. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b663 The statute of limitations may also be tolled where the plaintiff is aware of his or her injury, but is unable to discern the cause of that injury despite the exercise of due diligence. <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 151, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 329, 50 P.3d <em>139, Hando v. PPG Indus., </em>236 Mont. 493, 502, 771 P.2d 956, 962 (1989). An example of this is where the symptoms of an illness are immediately apparent, but the illness is diagnosed as the result of chemical exposure only years later. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Hando, </em>236 Mont. at 502, 771 P.2d at 962. This is true even where plaintiffs have asserted long-standing beliefs or suspicions regarding the link between the symptoms and their ultimate cause. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Hando, </em>236 Mont. at 501, 771 P.2d at 962 (tolling statute of limitations until plaintiffs suspicions regarding cause of her injury were confirmed by medical diagnosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b664  Although the plaintiffs mere suspicions will not trigger the running of the limitations period, the plaintiff need not have actual and complete knowledge of the facts constituting the claim in order for the claim to accrue. <em>Mobley v. Hall, </em>202 Mont. 227, 233, 657 P.2d 604, 607 (1983) (construing \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA). Under the discovery rule, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>claim accrues when the plaintiff is given notice or information that would prompt a reasonable person to conduct further inquiry. <em>Mobley, </em>202 Mont. at 232, 657 P.2d at 607. If the plaintiff is given such notice and yet fails to exercise reasonable diligence, the limitations period will not be tolled. <em>Kaeding, </em>\u00b6 27. Thus, even if the facts constituting a claim are otherwise self-concealing in nature, if the plaintiff has received notice of a possible claim and failed to act diligently in pursuing that claim, the action may be time-barred. <em>Kaeding, </em>\u00b6 27. Where material factual questions exist as to whether the facts constituting the claim were concealed or self-concealing, whether the defendant acted to prevent discovery of those facts, or whether the plaintiff exercised due diligence, those questions must be resolved by the trier of fact. <em>Johnston v. Centennial Log Homes &amp; Furnishings, Inc., </em>2013 MT 179, \u00b6 36, 370 Mont. 529, 305 P.3d 781<em>;Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 92-95 (factual disputes implicating affirmative defense based on statute of limitations to be resolved by jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b665 Appellants argue the discovery rule should be applied for two reasons: first, because their claims are self-concealing in nature; and second, because ARCO represented that the community of Opportunity was \u201cclean,\u201d thereby discouraging Appellants from conducting further inquiry. In support of this first point, Appellants argue that although they were aware of smelter operations, the resulting discharge of arsenic and other materials onto area properties, and highly-publicized environmental remediation plans, they had no way of knowing the extent of contamination on each of their individual properties. Citing <em>Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 79, 951 P.2d at 12, they claim that discovery of the pollution on their properties would have required specialized testing, and therefore should be considered self-concealing. Further, Appellants\u2019 claim of constructive fraud is based on ARCO\u2019s alleged failure to fully disclose the extent of the contamination, and the nondisclosure of information may also be considered self-concealing. <em>Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 79, 951 P.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b666 The facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Blackburn, </em>in which we observed that the plaintiff \u201chad no reason to suspect\u201d that a medical provider had given her inaccurate information. <em>Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 79, 951 P.2d at 12. Here, many of the Appellants admitted that they were aware of the possibility, even likelihood, their properties had been harmed. Although it is true that \u201cmere suspicion may not constitute discovery,\u201d information sufficient to \u201clead a prudent [person] to inquiry or action\u201d is enough to trigger the running of the limitations period. <em>Mobley, </em>202 Mont. at 233, 657 P.2d at 607. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the record shows that Appellants had far more than \u201cmere suspicion\u201d that their properties were contaminated, and should reasonably have been prompted to further inquiry or action.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b667 The histoiy of arsenic contamination in Opportunity, Anaconda, and surrounding communities is well-known to residents of the area. As Appellant Robert Phillips poignantly stated about his childhood in Opportunity: \u201cWe grew up in arsenic.\u201d Ilona Schlosser described the pervasive public knowledge of contamination in the area: \u201cWhen you first start to think about contamination \u2014 I think you Uve with it. I think you\u2019re always thinking about it. I don\u2019t think that ever leaves your \u2014 I think you\u2019re in the eye of the smelter. You\u2019re in the base camp. You always know there\u2019s a potential problem.... I mean you\u2019d have to be a moron not to figure that out.\u201d Zane Spehar recalled that he had been aware of the possibility of contamination for many years, reasoning: \u201cWell, with all the contamination around in that area, I mean how can it not be in my yard?\u201d Other Appellants, who described witnessing cleanup efforts at their neighbors\u2019 properties or in their communities over the years, had similar sentiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b668 Public documents and news coverage from the last few decades bear out the assertion that the potential for arsenic contamination on residential properties was common knowledge in the area. A 1985 article in Butte\u2019s daily newspaper, The Montana Standard, announced that a team from the Centers for Disease Control was testing arsenic levels in the urine of children in the communities of Anaconda and Opportunity. At least two Appellants specifically recalled their children being subjected to this testing; one recalled that her young son was given a dollar for his urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b669 In association with the designation as a Superfund site, extensive efforts were made to keep the public informed about the contamination and cleanup efforts. A 1990 article in another local newspaper, the Anaconda Leader, notified the public that the cleanup plan was available for public inspection at the Hearst Free Library in Anaconda. The article stated, \u201cOf primary interest to most persons in Anaconda and Deer Lodge County is the former smelter site and areas in the eastern part of the county which have been identified as being contaminated during decades of smelter operation.\u201d Opportunity is located in the eastern part of Anaconda-Deer Lodge County. In 2001, an article in the Montana Standard described testing of the \u201carsenic-laden Opportunity Ponds,\u201d stating that although no significant contamination had yet been observed in the area\u2019s drinking water, \u201cofficials fear a moving \u2018plume\u2019 of contaminated groundwater may eventually reach the wells of Opportunity homeowners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00b670 A Community Protective Measures Program developed by ARCO and EPA in 2002 included five components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">* Educational information describing potential risks, recommendations to reduce exposure to residual contaminants in soils, and operation and maintenance measures to ensure the long-term viability of this remedy will be made available to the public by Atlantic Richfield at the Hearst Library, ADLC Courthouse, and Atlantic Richfield offices.

The Focus Areas in the surrounding regional area include a small portion of Opportunity [and] Crackerville.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-v\">Full-page newspaper ads were placed in the Montana Standard and the Anaconda Leader annually during the years 2002 through 2005. Residential soil sampling was available by request of property owners from 2002 through 2008. The soil testing program was described in articles in the Montana Standard and Anaconda Leader in 2002,2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and 2004, each of which specifically stated that the \u201cfocus area\u201d included not just Anaconda, but parts of Opportunity and other outlying areas. One article encouraged homeowners to \u201cclear up any nagging doubts about what\u2019s in their dirt.\u201d Many Appellants requested and received sampling at ARCO\u2019s expense through this program.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b671 Although environmental contamination that is invisible to the senses and requires specialized testing to detect may be considered a self-concealing injury, an injury is no longer self-concealing for purposes of the discovery rule where a potential plaintiff has notice of the injury sufficient to prompt a reasonable person to further inquiry. <em>Kaeding, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Mobley, </em>202 Mont. at 233, 657 P.2d at 607. The benefit of the discovery rule is available only where the injury cannot be discovered despite the exercise of due diligence. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 14. In response to the almost overwhelming evidence of public knowledge produced by ARCO, several Appellants claim that although they were aware their properties were within a Superfund site, they did not know what \u201cSuperfund\u201d meant. One, in particular, recalled seeing two properties on his street where a new driveway or a new lawn was installed because \u201cthey found arsenic or something.\u201d Despite this, he \u201cnever went over and [said], *What are you doing?\u2019 \u201d This cannot be said to demonstrate the exercise of due diligence. Appellants cannot avail themselves of the benefit of the discovery rule under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b672 Appellants also argue that testing provided by ARCO did not offer a comparison to naturally-occurring background levels of arsenic, and therefore did not fully inform them as to whether their properties were contaminated at a level below the EPA-approved threshold of250 ppm. The fact that Appellants were not given actual notice of all of the facts underlying their claim does not establish that those facts could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. (Indeed, Appellants were able to discover the naturally-occiuring arsenic levels in Opportunity by retaining an expert in the course of this litigation; they offer no reason why this effort could not have been made years earlier.) To the extent that this alleged non-disclosure supports Appellants\u2019 allegations of constructive fraud, Appellants had sufficient notice of the facts to prompt them to inquire whether ARCO had frilly and accurately represented the state of their properties. Where Appellants were aware, despite ARCO\u2019s alleged representations to the contrary, of the likelihood that their properties were contaminated, the alleged non-disclosure was not self-concealing. On the record before us, there is no material factual dispute regarding whether the facts constituting the claims were concealed or self-concealing and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Appellants exercised due diligence in attempting to discover those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b673 Appellants also argue that ARCO discouraged them from conducting further inquiry, effectively acting to conceal the facts underlying their claims, by consistently representing that their communities were \u201cclean.\u201d The statute of limitations is tolled only where the defendant has engaged in fraudulent concealment or affirmatively prevented the injured party from discovering that he or she has been injured. <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 14-15, 914 P.2d at 985. Fraudulent concealment consists of \u201c \u2018the employment of artifice, planned to prevent inquiry or escape investigation, and mislead or hinder acquisition of information disclosing a cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 17, 914 P.2d at 986 (quoting <em>Monroe v. Harper, </em>164 Mont. 23, 28, 518 P.2d 788, 790 (1974)). Fraudulent concealment is to be distinguished from Appellants\u2019 claim of constructive fraud, which does not require intent to deceive. <em>Hartfield v. Billings, </em>246 Mont. 259, 263, 805 P.2d 1293, 1296 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b674 Appellants cite depositions and documents establishingthat based on an investigation conducted in 1996, ARCO concluded, and represented to the public, that the community was not at risk. This assessment was based on the EPA threshold of 250 ppm. The depositions referred to by Appellants include statements that ARCO made these representations under the belief that \u201cin general, with the science that we had at the time, basically [the representation that the community was not at risk] was accurate.\u201d The evidence referred to by Appellants shows that ARCO relied on EPA-approved standards and accurately represented those standards and its sampling results to the public. Appellants have not established a material factual dispute regarding whether ARCO acted to prevent inquiry or hinder the acquisition of information. The record demonstrates that after these representations were made in 1996, additional soil testing was offered and information about the contamination and cleanup was continually made publicly available.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b675 Appellants also refer to letters received in 2006 and 2007, after soil samples from their properties were tested by ARCO, concluding that arsenic levels on their properties were \u2018laelow the EPA set standard residential arsenic action level of 250 parts per million; therefore further sampling or remediation is not required in your residential yard.\u201d The letters further promised, \u201cA final report will be provided to you at the conclusion of this project.\u201d Those Appellants whose properties contained arsenic concentrations exceeding250 ppm were provided with more detailed sampling results and offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b676 Appellants do not allege that the sampling results obtained by ARCO were fraudulent or otherwise inaccurate. ARCO also notified Appellants of the EPA-mandated action level for residential properties and whether remediation of their properties was required under that standard. Appellants do not allege that ARCO misrepresented the EPA action level or the remedial actions required by EPA. Appellants further do not allege that ARCO prevented them from conducting independent testing. The evidence pointed to by Appellants shows that, instead of preventing inquiry or hindering the acquisition of information, ARCO provided Appellants with information regarding the levels of arsenic contamination on their properties. Again, ARCO relied on EPA-approved standards and accurately represented those standards and its sampling results to Appellants. Appellants clearly believe that the EPA-approved residential action level is inappropriate. This difference of opinion does not render ARCO\u2019s representations fraudulent, and does not demonstrate the existence of a material factual dispute regarding whether Appellants were affirmatively prevented from discovering the facts underlying their claims. Appellants may not avail themselves of the discovery rule in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b677  We hold that a claim of continuing nuisance or trespass based on environmental contamination does not require evidence that the contamination is migrating. Appellants\u2019 claims of continuing nuisance and trespass are not time-barred if it can be determined by a finder of fact that the contamination is reasonably abatable. The crucial consideration for the trier of fact in determining whether a tort is permanent or temporary, and thus continuing, is whether the tort can be discontinued or abated. Migration is a characteristic of the contamination that may affect the jury\u2019s determination of reasonable abatability. We reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Appellants produced no evidence of migration, and hold that a jury may consider the issue. We reverse the grant of summary judgment to ARCO on Appellants\u2019 claims of continuing nuisance and trespass, and remand for further proceedings on the issue of reasonable abatability. If the contamination is not found to be reasonably abatable, the statute of limitations will not then be tolled by application of the discovery rule. Strict liability and negligence, as theories of liability for an underlying injury, may be considered subject to the continuing tort doctrine if the alleged injury is of a continuing nature. The viability of these claims will also depend on the jury\u2019s determination regarding reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>abatability.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b678 Under the facts of this case, Appellants\u2019 claim of unjust enrichment is not subject to the continuingtort doctrine. The discovery rule will not toll the statutes of limitations applicable to Appellants\u2019 claims of unjust enrichment and constructive fraud, because Appellants had sufficient information regarding the presence of contamination to reasonably prompt them to further inquiry. These claims are time-barred, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to ARCO on Appellants\u2019 claims of uiyust enrichment and constructive fraud. The wrongful occupation alleged by Appellants may be considered continuing, and thus not time-barred. The District Court applied the incorrect statute of limitations to this claim, and we reverse. As noted, we do not address any potential impact on the case of ARCO\u2019s affirmative defenses that the District Court has not yet addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b679 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-7\">JUSTICE COTTER concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> The Anaconda Company was known by several different names throughout its corporate history, including the Anaconda Mining Company, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and the Anaconda Gold and Silver Company.

I agree that evidence of migration is not necessary to establish a continuing tort and I join the Court\u2019s Opinion with respect to Issues Three and Four. I join the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two and much of the discussion, as I also agree that the record reveals genuine issues of material fact on whether contamination continues to migrate. I do not join the Court\u2019s discussion of Issue One, and I would not situate migration as a component of abatability as the Court does in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u00b681 In <em>Burley, </em>we were tasked with explaining how three factors \u2014 stabilization, migration, and abatability \u2014 bear on continuing nuisance doctrine. We explained the importance of these factors through the prism of their relation to the \u201cone consistent theme [discerned from] the historic decisions of this Court to evaluate whether a nuisance should be classified as temporary or permanent: whether the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41. Our decision in <em>Burley </em>reflects that stabilization, migration, and abatability each bear independently on whether an \u201cinjury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>damages.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41.1 would not abandon that analysis today.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AA0\">\u00b682 Both the Court\u2019s Opinion and Justice Rice\u2019s Dissent barely mention the concept of stabilization. The neglect of this factor is understandable after <em>Burley, </em>in which we simply assumed from the certified question that the pollution had stabilized because the concentration of the pollutants was no longer increasing. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 2. We proceeded to analyze, and ultimately rejected, BNSFs argument that the stabilization <em>of contamination </em>provides a \u201cbright line rule\u201d on whether a nuisance is permanent or temporary. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b683 But our precedent, including <em>Burley, </em>reflects that stabilization is not as narrow a concept as the issue before us in <em>Burley. </em>Rather, when referring to stabilization, we often have focused on whether the injury itself is stable or changing. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 21 (\u201cThe concept of <em>an injury </em>having \u2018stabilized\u2019 first appears in <em>Blasdel\u201d) </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"AuqO\">\u00b684 For instance, in <em>Graveley I, </em>where lead batteries were not increasing but were removable, we held that the nuisance was continuing in that \u201ca new cause of action may arise each time a cow becomes ill or dies as a result of lead poisoning.\u201d In other words, the injury \u2014 the cows becoming sick or dying \u2014 had not stabilized, so the injury was not complete, and the tort was continuing. <em>Graveley </em>1, 240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375. In <em>Haugen Trust, </em>we stated that the \u201csituation\u201d had \u201cnot stabilized\u201d not only because the nuisance itself was fluctuating (through intermittent floods), but also because the extent of the damage depended on \u201cthe condition\u201d of the basement at the time of each occurrence. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513, 665 P.2d at 1135. The \u201ccondition\u201d of the basement \u201cpresumably\u201d referred to the extent to which the basement was \u201cfinished,\u201d what \u201cpersonal items\u201d were \u201cstored\u201d there, and whether the basement had \u201cdried completely since the previous flooding.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 27. In other words, in <em>Haugen Trust, </em>there was a continuing tort because the injury was still developing. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513, 665 P.2d at 1135. And in <em>Burley, </em>we discussed <em>Shors </em>in the context of stabilization, noting that in that case where the nuisance was easily abatable, \u201c[a] new cause of action arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>each day that the gate obstructed Shors\u2019s free use of his easement.\u201d In other words, the injury had not stabilized because the nuisance was continuing to inflict a new harm whenever Shors encountered it. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 244).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b685 This Court did not even use the term \u201cmigration\u201d in its continuing tort analysis before <em>Burley </em>in 2012, and did so then only at the behest of the Federal District Court\u2019s certified question. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 2. Of the Montana cases cited in <em>Burley\u2019s </em>migration analysis, <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 69-72, none in fact employ the term \u201cmigration\u201d \u2014 and most instead employ the term \u201cstabilization\u201d or a variation thereof \u2014 to describe what is at base common phenomena: uncertainty or lack of completeness in injuries. <em>See, e.g., Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 426, 640 P.2d at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b686 Based on the foregoing, I would conclude that migration and stabilization both are \u201cimportant factor[s],\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73, that bear on whether an injury is sufficiently complete or whether it is dynamic and subject to change. Justice Rice\u2019s Dissent, in my view, proffers a similar theory: that our jurisprudence requires a recurring injury \u2014 which may be demonstrated through evidence of migration or lack of stabilization \u2014 for a continuing tort to fie. I depart from Justice Rice\u2019s analysis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in interpreting the concept of stabilization, which in our jurisprudence is broader than merely the stabilization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>contamination. Whether <em>the injury </em>has stabilized is what we are after. And rightly so. Our stabilization jurisprudence recognizes the unique nature of environmental harm and the nuisance cause of action. Environmental harm has the ability to affect disparate persons long after the conduct creating it has occurred, and nuisance focuses on interference with a landowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her property. Put these two together and it means that an environmental injury may not be sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages until the nuisance is in fact abated (if it reasonably can be), and is no longer affecting the landowner\u2019s property interests. See Opinion, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b687 Where I believe the Court goes wrong is in situating migration \u2014 and, by implication, stabilization \u2014 within reasonable abatability- As we stated in <em>Burley, </em>the key question \u201cin evaluating] whether a nuisance should be classified as temporary or permanent\u201d is \u201cwhether the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 47. By putting all the eggs in the \u201creasonably abatable\u201d basket, the Court focuses exclusively on the second element of this standard, dealing with whether damages are \u201cpermanent.\u201d Stabilization and migration are independent factors because they bear directly on the first element of the standard \u2014 whether the injury is \u201ccomplete.\u201d <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 15 (noting 58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 296\u2019s description of nuisances as temporary when the \u201cinjury is not complete\u201d because the injury depends upon things like \u201cits continuance and uncertain operation of the seasons or of the forces set in motion by it.\u201d). Moreover, for the reasons stated in Justice Rice\u2019s Dissent in \u00b6\u00b6 111-12, and 116, situating stabilization and migration within reasonable abatement is not consistent with <em>Burley </em>or with our prior jurisprudence. We could have situated migration within abatability in <em>Burley, </em>but we chose not to, and for good reason. <em>See Burley, </em>\u00b6 89 (listing the factors bearing on reasonable abatability, of which migration is not one).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b688 Nonetheless, because I agree that proving migration is not required for a continuing nuisance, and that Plaintiffs in any event have a raised genuine issues of material fact both with respect to migration and reasonable abatement, I concur with the Court\u2019s decision to remand for a jury\u2019s consideration of those factors. I also agree with the Court that, if the jury does not find a continuing tort, the discovery rule does not toll the statute of limitations in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\"> Justice Rice\u2019s Dissent posits that the \u201ccomplained of injury\u201d in a continuing tort must be both \u201c(1) recurring and (2) remediable,\u201d and would analyze claims by that lodestar. Dissent, \u00b6 103. Although differently phrased, this is essentially the same standard that we employed in <em>Burley </em>and that I employ today \u2014 \u201cwhether the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages.\u201d Whether the injury is sufficiently complete speaks to whether the injury continues to occur (the Dissent\u2019s first factor) and whether damages are permanent speaks to whether the injury is remediable (the Dissent\u2019s second factor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\">I also depart from Justice Rice\u2019s Dissent regarding how the discovery rule factors into our analysis of the statute of limitations for alleged continuing nuisance and trespass claims. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102, 120. Justice Rice suggests that a continuing nuisance or trespass must meet the statutory discovery exception in order to escape the statute of limitations bar. Dissent, \u00b6 102. But the statute also prescribes the general \u201caccrual rule\u201d for commencing the period of limitation. Section 27-2-102(lXa), (2), MCA. \u201cThe discovery rule begins the statute of limitations when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the negligent act.... The statute of limitations does not begin to run under the accrual rule until all elements of the claim have occurred.\u201d <em>Ehrman v. Kaufman, </em>2010 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 358 Mont. 519, 246 P.3d 1048. We addressed application of the discovery rule in <em>Burley </em>and disposed of it unanimously: \u201ctTlhe discovery rule definitively would bar a property contamination tort action at the expiration of the limitations period only where the injury had become permanent in the sense that the injury no longer reasonably could be abated, or had abated to a point where permanent damages could be ascertained.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 47. The continuing tort doctrine relates to the accrual of the cause of action, which occurs only when the right to maintain an action on the claim is complete. Section 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA. In the context of a continuing nuisance or trespass, this occurs when the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41. <em>See Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 426, 640 P.2d at 894 (holding that a cause of action for a permanent taking did not accrue until the water table had \u201cstabilized\u201d in 1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b555-6\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"ARk\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">\u00b689 I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues 1, 2, and 3, but I dissent on Issue 4, because, under the facts of this case, the questions of concealment, misrepresentation, and reasonable diligence, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>context of the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d are questions of fact to be decided by the jury, not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b690 ARCO has been actively engaged in the forced clean-up of contamination in and around the Butte-Anaconda area, including Opportunity, for decades. Through that process ARCO has developed reams of information related to the extent and location of the contaminants. Such involvement has placed ARCO in a position to decide what information it should disseminate to the public. There is no dispute that ARCO disseminated plenty of information to the public, through various mediums, which was sometimes general in nature and sometimes specific to the Appellants in this case. The question dispositive to ARCO\u2019s defense is whether this information was sufficiently self-concealing, or presented in such a way to persuade the Appellants that they had nothing to fear or had not been injured. The answer to this question is fact intensive and should be decided by the jury. It is not the Court\u2019s job to sort through the disputed facts and interpret them one way or the other \u2014 that is the jury\u2019s responsibility. Therefore, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s decision that \u201cthe running of the statutes of limitations on the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims is not tolled by Section 27-2-102(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b691 As the Court notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">The fact that a party does not know that he or she has a claim, whether because he or she is unaware of the facts or unaware of his or her legal rights, is usually not sufficient to delay the beginning of the limitations period. The discovery rule constitutes an exception to this general principle, stating that if the facts constituting the claim are concealed or self-concealing in nature, or if the defendant has acted to prevent the injured party from discovering those facts, the period of limitations does not begin to run until the injured party has discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, both the injury and its cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Opinion, \u00b6 62 (citations omitted). Under the discovery rule, the claim accrues when the plaintiff is given notice or information that would prompt a reasonable person to conduct further inquiry. <em>Mobley v. Hall, </em>202 Mont. 227, 233, 657 P.2d 604, 607 (1983) (construing \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u00b692 Appellants argue the discovery rule should be applied for two reasons: first, because their claims are self-concealing in nature; and second, because ARCO represented that the community of Opportunity was \u201cclean,\u201d thereby discouraging Appellants from conducting further inquiry. The Opportunity Citizens filed their claims on April 17,2008. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The Court notes that the statute of limitations applicable to its analysis is three years. Opinion, \u00b6 14. Thus, to prevail on its defense, ARCO must prove the Opportunity Citizens knew, or should have known, of the facts constituting their claims before April 17, 2005. Whether any of the Opportunity Citizens should have known of the facts constituting their claims earlier is a highly factual inquiry inappropriate for summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b693 Under Montana law, knowledge of a self-concealing injury, sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations, requires knowledge of both the ipjury and its cause. <em>Hando v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>236 Mont. 493, 501, 771 P.2d 956, 961-62 (1989). ARCO inundated the District Court with thousands of pages of exhibits, to prove that most of the Opportunity Citizens were aware the Anaconda Company smelted copper in Anaconda, Montana, and were further aware the operation resulted in some environmental damage in the area. However, ARCO failed to demonstrate that the Opportunity Citizens knew, or should have known, their properties were contaminated by arsenic and other pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b694 In fact, many of the exhibits offered by ARCO were confusing and misleading to the reader. For example, the full page ads in the Anaconda Leader that Appellants claim ARCO took out to provide citizens with \u201cinformation describing potential health risks, precautions to mitigate those potential risks and answers to frequently asked questions\u201d contained somewhat ambiguous language. In at least one of these ads, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Q 8: What happens if analysis determines my property exceeds the average arsenic concentration level of250 ppm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">A: First, don\u2019t be alarmed; this is information that will help you. You will be informed that more extensive sampling is necessary for your property. If some cleanup is required, Atlantic Richfield Company and EPA, along with yourself will agree on the appropriate cleanup plan for your property. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">Q 9: What will I have to show for my cooperation and participation in these activities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">A: You will learn that your property does not pose health risks to you, your children, or future owners or renters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">\u00b695 Additionally, the Court identifies letters dated in 2006 and 2007 that ARCO sent to many of the Appellants after conducting soil testing. It claims that these letters indicate that Appellants knew their properties were contaminated with arsenic. Opinion, \u00b6 76.1 do not agree. The letters were also potentially misleadingregardingthe safety and contamination of Appellants\u2019 properties. For example, many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>them included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Although remedial action activities are still ongoing ... Atlantic Richfield Company and EPA would like to provide you the preliminary results from the sampling at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">The weighted average arsenic concentrations for soil samples collected from your property are attached to this letter. Your results are below the EPA set standard residential arsenic action level of 250 parts per million; therefore further sampling or remediation is not required in your residential yard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u00b696 The Court also points to several Appellants\u2019 deposition statements that they recalled reading news articles about Environmental Investigation and Cleanup in the area surrounding their properties before April 17, 2005. However, ARCO only identified seven such Appellants. As there are over 90 Appellants, it is unclear whether all of the Appellants were aware of any news about environmental cleanup or concern in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u00b697 In nearly all of ARCO\u2019s depositions of Appellants, ARCO asked (in slightly varying language) whether the Appellants could recall any misrepresentations that ARCO had made about the contamination. Many of the responses suggested that in some way ARCO did in fact misrepresent to the citizens of Opportunity regarding the quality of their property. In fact, in one public meeting, ARCO\u2019s Sandra Stash stated, \u201cI think the real good news out of this whole thing is that this community is not at risk,\u201d and \u201c95 percent of the community ... does not need to worry about [arsenic concentrations in residential soils].\u201d Also, in ARCO\u2019s post-testing letters to Plaintiffs dating back as far as 2000, ARCO told Plaintiffs with properties testing below 250 ppm that \u201c[y]our results are below the EPA set standard residential arsenic action level of 250 parts per million; therefore further sampling or remediation is not required in your residential yard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u00b698 The Opportunity Citizens\u2019 claims are all based on damage to their properties, caused by the spread of contaminates from ARCO\u2019s operations. Knowledge of the facts constituting the claims would necessarily include knowledge that contaminates from ARCO\u2019s operations harmed each Opportunity Citizen\u2019s individual property. With respect to the individual Opportunity Citizens, ARCO cited no evidence at all to suggest they know, or had any means of knowing, whether contamination existed on their individual properties. Most of the Opportunity Citizens also confirmed their lack of understanding of the impact to their property in their depositions. While some Opportunity Citizens testified they \u201csuspected\u201d ARCO\u2019s activity may have harmed their properties, they had no means of discovering just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>how bad things were.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b699 When evaluating the highly individual and factually intense question of when the Opportunity Citizens should have learned their property was contaminated, the court and jury should consider the complexities of environmental investigation. Ultimately, the trier of fact should decide, based on all of the evidence, when the Opportunity Citizens possessed sufficient knowledge of ARCO\u2019s invisible and toxic contamination on their properties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-5\">JUSTICE SHEA and DISTRICT JUDGE MANLEY join in the concurring and dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE WHEAT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b559-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ANO\">dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b6100 I dissent, and will address Issue 1. The Court holds that the application of the continuing tort doctrine to Appellants\u2019 claims of nuisance and trespass does not require evidence of the continued migration of contaminants. In so doing, the Court concludes that only those nuisances and trespasses that cannot reasonably be remediated are burdened by a statute of limitations. In my view, this is an impermissible infringement on the Montana Legislature\u2019s power to enact statutes of limitations and is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedent regarding the continuing tort doctrine. The Court acts as if it is feasting at a smorgasbord of common law remedies from which it is free to pick and choose the remedies it fancies. In its common law meanderings, the Court doesn\u2019t even recognize that we have a statute of limitations to be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b6101 Section 27-2-207, MCA, imposes a two year statute of limitations for injuries to property, including nuisance and trespass claims. Section27-2-102(2), MCA, provides: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by statute, the period of limitation begins when the claim or cause of action accrues.\u201d Section27-2-102(l)(a), MCA, further provides \u201ca claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b6102 The statutory scheme, of course, does not provide a textual exception for continuing nuisance and trespass claims, though it does provide an exception for the discovery rule. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA. The Court concedes the statute of limitations for Appellants\u2019 claims is not tolled by the discovery rule, but maintains that an extratextual, common-law exception, denominated as the continuing tort doctrine, tolls the statute. While the continuing tort doctrine is well established in the precedent of this Court, the doctrine cannot be applied to supplant the statutory scheme. In Montana \u201cthere is no common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d Section 1-1-108, MCA. And where the law is not declared by statute, the common law is applicable only so far as it does \u201cnot [] conflict with the statutes\u201d of this State. Section 1-1-108, MCA. Any interpretation adopted by this Court of the continuing tort doctrine must be compatible with the statutory scheme and the Legislature\u2019s intent to impose a two year statute of limitations on nuisance and trespass claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABm5\">\u00b6103 Key to the continuing tort doctrine is that the complained of injury is (1) recurring and (2) remediable. 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 6 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if the Court is correct in holding that Appellants have introduced sufficient evidence to raise a jury issue about whether the injury is remediable, the Appellants have failed to introduce evidence showing the injury is recurring. I believe this is to be fatal to their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b6104 The Court devotes a sizeable portion of its opinion to attacking a straw man who, I gather, is pressing the Court to adopt a bright-line rule that migration is in every case the dispositive factor. Opinion, \u00b6 29. In this regard, I agree with the Court that migration is not dispositive of the continuing tort doctrine in all cases. Nor is migration, for that matter, dispositive of the continuing tort doctrine in all environmental contamination cases. However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether migration is required under the facts of <em>this </em>claim. Here, migration is determinative of the Appellants\u2019 claims because the Appellants cannot demonstrate <em>a recurring injury </em>without it. The Appellants have conceded the contamination is stabilized and the only other alleged recurring injury to their property is repeated property invasions stemming from the continued migration of contamination beneath their property and potentially into their groundwater. Absent migration the Appellants have but merely a single, unbroken, decades-long injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u00b6105 The continuing tort doctrine cannot be harmonized with the statutory scheme without a recurring injury. Fundamental to the doctrine is the principle that \u201c[wjhen a court finds that a continuing nuisance has been committed, it implicitly holds that the defendant is committing a new tort\u201d and thereby has \u201ctriggered] a new statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Lyons v. Twp. of Wayne, </em>185 N.J. 426, 433 (N. J. 2005); <em>see also Burley, </em>\u00b6 14 (a new cause of action arises \u201ceach time that it repeats\u201d). In this way, by requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate a recurring tort, we preserve the intent of the Legislature to impose a statute of limitations \u2014 in effect concluding that the Legislature intended to time-bar old torts, but did not intend to bar the new torts because \u201call elements of the claim or cause\u201d have not occurred with respect to them. A necessary corollary is that we do not permit a plaintiffto recover damages for all injuries, but only those new injuries that have occurred within the statute of limitations period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint. <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 23, 782 P.2d. at 373. However, when there ceases to be new torts the statute of limitations ceases to reset and the nuisance or trespass becomes permanent. 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 6 (2009) (\u201cA nuisance is permanent when there is only one unceasing invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s interests, giving rise to only one cause of action, with damages assessed once and for all.\u201d). A plaintiff must continue to demonstrate recurring torts to his property in order to continue triggering new statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b6106 We have consistently required a recurring injury to trigger new causes of action. In <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>we concluded that \u201ca new cause of action may arise each time a cow becomes ill or dies as a result of lead poisoning.\u201d <em>Graveley </em>Ranch, 240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 375. We reasoned that the mere \u201cfact that the nuisance continues does not make the cause of action a recurring one.\u201d <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 25, 782 P.2d at 373. We explained that there must be a new injury that with \u201c[e]ach repetition\u201d will \u201cgive[] rise to a new cause of action.\u201d <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 23, 782 P.2d at 373. Thus, we were explicit the recurring injury, the death or sickness of a cow, not the continuation of the nuisance, triggered new statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">\u00b6107 In <em>Haugen Trust, </em>we concluded that the recurring trespass there, a recurring flood, gave rise to a new cause of action because <em>each time </em>it occurred it caused a <em>new injury. Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 511, 665 P.2d at 1134. We explained, because the damage occurring from the floods varied \u201cfrom occurrence to occurrence\u201d depending on \u201ceach flood,\u201d the \u201cdamage is not <em>yet </em>permanent\u201d and \u201cgives rise to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>separate cause of action <em>each time </em>it causes damages.\u201d <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513-14, 665 P.2d at 1135 (emphasis added). Again, we required a recurring injury to the plaintiffs property, another flood, to trigger a new cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b6108 In <em>Blasdel, </em>we again concluded that a flood, this time a flood stemming from a river backed up by a dam, tolled the statute of limitations until it ceased creating a recurring injury. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 425, 640 P.2d at 894. We focused on the \u201cintermittent\u201d nature of the flooding and the recurring invasions of the plaintiffs\u2019 property interest, explaining that the \u201csource of the entire claim \u2014 the overflow due to rises in the level of the river \u2014 is not a single event.\u201d <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 425, 640 P.2d at 894. Although the water continued to remain on the plaintiffs\u2019 property after 1960, this was not enough to toll the statute of limitations. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont, at 426,640 P.2d at 894. We held instead that, while plaintiffs\u2019 claims were tolled for a number of years, their claims accrued in 1960 when there ceased being new property invasions. <em>Blasdel, </em>196 Mont. at 426, 640 P.2d at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b6109 In <em>Montana Pole, </em>the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Montana law under a unique set of facts, held that contamination remaining on the plaintiffs property did not produce a recurring cause of action. <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 680. Montana Pole operated a wood treatment plan and used penta, a chemical preservative, which contaminated Montana Pole\u2019s property. Montana Pole brought suit against the manufacturers of the penta for the chemical contamination of its property, arguing the continuing tort doctrine tolled the statute of limitations because the contamination remained on the property. <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 677. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, noting that Montana recognizes a continuing tort claim only where the injury is \u201crecurring and abatable,\u201d and the theory is that each new injury \u201cgives rise to a separate cause of action.\u201d <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 679. The court explained that the \u201cargument that the injury continued into the statutory period because the penta contamination remained on the property is simply unpersuasive.\u201d <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 680. Rather, the corat, quoting <em>Graveley, </em>concluded that \u201c \u2018the fact that the nuisance continues does not make the cause of action a recurring one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 680 (quoting <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>782 P.2d at 373, 240 Mont. at 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b6110 Finally, in our seminal case, <em>Burley v. BNSF, </em>we held that contamination that \u201ccontinues to migrate, will toll the statute of limitations until the harm no longer reasonably can be abated.\u201d <em>Burley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u00b6 99.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After writing several pages of analysis to determine whether migration would be relevant to our decision, considering our precedent, and the policies behind the doctrine we concluded the \u201cfact that a nuisance continues to migrate constitutes an important factor under Montana law in evaluating whether the pollution should be treated as continuing trespass or nuisance.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73. We explained that the continuing tort doctrine applies only if there is an \u201cinjury that gives rise to a new cause of action <em>each time </em>that it <em>repeats.\u201d Burley, </em>\u00b6 14 (emphasis added). We explained that migration provides a recurring cause of action because of the recurring property injury: \u201cEach entry of pollution onto a party\u2019s property caused by its migration constitutes a new cause of action.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 68. Specifically, we reasoned that the migrating pollution at issue continued to advance onto the plaintiffs property constituting a new \u201cproperty invasion,\u201d which \u201cfits Montana\u2019s historical definition of a continuing temporary injury.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73. Therefore, we were explicit in detailing the unique injury migration provides, and once again, in accordance with precedent, required a recurring injury to trigger new causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b6111 Nonetheless, the Court today draws a completely different conclusion from <em>Burley. </em>While the Court does not dispute that migration was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d to our decision, it attributes migration\u2019s significance to the potential to affect abatement of the iqjury. Opinion, \u00b6 33. The Court\u2019s reading is impermissible for a number of reasons. First, nowhere in our lengthy analysis <em>iaBurley </em>did we state that migration was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d because it affected remediation of the contamination. However, we did explicitly state the factors necessaiy to discern whether the contamination was reasonably abatable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Courts should evaluate whether it would be reasonable for the tortfeasor to abate the harm taking into account all factors, including the ease with which the harm could be abated. Other factors include the cost of the abatement, the type of property affected, the severity of contamination, and the length of time necessary to remediate such pollution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 89. <em>Migration is not among the factors. </em>Second, in the twenty-four paragraphs we used in <em>Burley </em>to attempt to track the contours of the reasonable abatement standard there is little mention of the \u201cimportant factor\u201d of migration \u2014 using the word \u201cmigration,\u201d in all, a single time. Third, in no other case have we ever explained that migration affects abatement. In <em>Burley, </em>we relied on our decisions in <em>Walton, Blasdel, Haugen Trust, Nelson, </em>and <em>Graveley Ranch </em>to conclude that migration was an important factor to our analysis. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 71. There is nothing in these cases to suggest that migration impacts abatement, andit would likely have been inappropriate for the Court to make that conclusion, without citing expert testimony in any of those cases and lacking the technical expertise itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b6112 Lastly, the Court\u2019s reasoning is inherently self-defeating. The Court completely ignores the elephant in the room: in <em>Burley, </em>migration was an important factor serving to <em>establish </em>a continuing tort, but under the Court\u2019s abatement standard migration serves only to <em>prevent </em>a continuing tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b6113 In <em>Burley </em>we explained, in so many words and in so many different ways, that migration was a factor supporting the plaintiffs position that the contamination <em>constituted </em>a continuing tort. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 68 (\u201cconsidering] migrating property contamination to <em>constitute </em>a continuing temporary tort.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73 (\u201cThe reasoning and outcomes of these Montana cases leads us to conclude, as further explained below, that a nuisance of a continuing temporary nature <em>includes </em>migrating pollution.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73 (\u201cThe migrating pollution in the instant case, though stabilized in terms of concentration levels, <em>fits </em>Montana\u2019s historical definition of a continuing temporary injuiy.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73 (\u201cA defendant\u2019s failure to stop the continuing migration of a nuisance onto a plaintiffs property, where it reasonably can be stopped, <em>constitutes </em>a continuing property invasion.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 68 (\u201cEach entry of pollution onto a party\u2019s property caused by its migration <em>constitutes </em>a new cause of action.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 73 (\u201cTo classify as permanent a nuisance that continues to migrate could bar a plaintiff from bringing a nuisance action, even if the contamination from a defendant\u2019s tortious actions continues to affect different parts of her land each day.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b6114 However, the Court rewrites <em>Burley </em>to effectuate a complete turnabout with respect to migration. Under the reasonable abatement standard, migration\u2019s only relevance is to show that abatement will be difficult, Opinion, \u00b6 35, meaning migration is a factor wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>supporting ARCO\u2019s position that the contamination <em>does not constitute a continuing tort.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b6115 There is simply no two ways about it. Migration played an entirely different role in <em>Burley </em>than it plays in the Court\u2019s opinion. In <em>Burley </em>migration was a factor counseling in favor of tolling the statute of limitations, but now the Court places migration entirely on the other side of the ledger. The Court doesn\u2019t even bother to address its error in logic or the obvious contradiction this creates in our jurisprudence. Any sensible reading of <em>Burley </em>leads to the conclusion that migration has legal import outside of abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b6116 In sum, the Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Burley </em>lacks both merit and logic. Migration provides a recurring injury. And, in turn, a recurring cause of action. Burley, \u00b6 68 (\u201cEach entry of pollution onto a party\u2019s property caused by its migration constitutes a new cause of action.\u201d). This is why it is an \u201cimportant factor.\u201d The Court\u2019s nonsensical reasoning will ultimately come at the confusion of future parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the Court wishes to overrule <em>Burley </em>it should expressly do so. The citizens and practitioners in Montana deserve to know the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b6117 Next, the Court relies on <em>Shors, </em>which we decided two decades prior to <em>Burley </em>and a year prior to the Legislature\u2019s passage of \u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), (b), MCA. In <em>Shors, </em>a developer, Branch, subdivided property and granted the lot owners of the subdivided property access to the Middle Fork of the Flathead River via a Declaration of Restrictions contained within the parties\u2019 contracts. In 1976, Branch placed a locked gate across the road in violation of the Declaration of Restrictions. Several of the lot owners, including Shors, filed an action against Branch in 1982 for interference with their access to the river. <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 396, 720 P.2d at 243. The district court concluded that Branch had \u201cunlawfully and unreasonably restricted Plaintiffs\u2019 right of access, in derogation of the Declaration of Restrictions ... .\u201d <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 243. On appeal, we addressed whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages for interference with their access to the river was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Shors, </em>221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Mont, at 394,720 P.2d at 241. We answered in the negative. We first reasoned the plaintiffs were entitled to damages and their claim was not time-barred because it \u201csoundfed] in contract, with an 8 year statute of limitation under Section 27-2-202, MCA.\u201d <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 243. After concluding the statute of limitations did not bar their claim, we further provided an additional rationale, reasoning that the continuing tort doctrine also tolled the statute of limitations for injuries to property. In a single sentence of analysis, we concluded \u201cthat blockage of plaintiffs\u2019 access to the river by the gate was a continuing tort, [sic] because it was easily abated.\u201d <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 397, 720 P.2d at 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b6118 Even if the limited analysis in <em>Shors, </em>although questionable, is susceptible to the Court\u2019s interpretation that abatement is the sole inquiry under the continuing tort doctrine, I would not permit <em>Shors </em>to control here. First, the continuing tort analysis in <em>Shors </em>was unneeded. We had already concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not barred by the statute of limitations prior to our analysis concerning the continuing tort doctrine. Second, <em>Shors </em>is inconsistent with prior decisions, including among others <em>Burley </em>and <em>Blasdel. </em>As explained above, we have consistently required a recurring injury. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s poor attempt to mischaracterize <em>Burley, </em>we confirmed in <em>Burley </em>that a plaintiff must demonstrate a recurring <em>injury </em>\u2014 Shors stands in direct conflict with <em>Burley. </em>Likewise, the Court\u2019s approach renders <em>Blasdel </em>no longer good law. Although the Court explains that \u201c <em>Blasdel </em>was an inverse condemnation case,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30, the principles announced in <em>Blasdel </em>are engrained in this Court\u2019s case law, and it has been cited as much, if not more than, any other case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 21. Third, while we did not find it relevant to the continuing tort doctrine analysis in <em>Shors, </em>there was seemingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>a recurring iiy'ury there. We noted expressly that the \u201cgate was left open\u201d at times. <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 398, 720 P.2d at 244. Lastly, <em>Shors </em>was decided a year prior to the Legislature\u2019s passage of \u00a7 27-2-102(1), (2), MCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sec. 1, Ch. 441, L. 1987. Thus, because the accrual t\u00edme was decided entirely under common law, we did not have to contend with the will of the Legislature as we must do today.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b6119 The Court departs from previous decisions and follows <em>Shors </em>based principally on the idea of certainty. Opinion, \u00b6 32. The Court forcefully \u201cdeclinets] to leave the operation of the law to chance,\u201d reasoning that migration cannot be determinative because if so \u201ccontinued liability would be determined by factors not within the control of the parties, such as <em>soil characteristics </em>or the <em>flow of groundwater.\u201d </em>Opinion, \u00b6 32 (emphasis added). Rather, the Court concludes the sole inquiry must be abatement because, as the Court explains, then continued liability will depend instead on factors within the control of the parties, such as \u201csoil\u201d characteristics and the flow of \u201cshallow groundwater.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. The Court\u2019s reasoning is unfortunately no better with regard to policy than it is with the law. Because we decided in <em>Burley </em>to focus on the injury rather than conduct to establish new causes of action, continued liability will always depend on factors not within the control of the parties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">\u00b6120 However, the continuing tort doctrine is not without a polity justification. The continuing tort doctrine attempts to act as counterweight against the defendant\u2019s interest in certainty provided for in a statute of limitations by protecting the plaintiffs interest in remedying his injury when damages are largely uncertain. <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>(\u201cWe discern one consistent theme in reviewing the historic decisions of this Court that evaluate whether a nuisance should he classified as temporary or permanent: whether the injury is sufficiently complete to ascertain permanent damages.\u201d). In fact, we have often differentiated between permanent torts and temporary torts based upon whether the damages were ascertainable, with the tort becoming permanent when the damages became certain. <em>Burk Ranches v. State, </em>242 Mont. 300, 306, 790 P.2d 443, 447 n.2 (1990) (\u201c \u2018permanent injury\u2019 refers to whether the injury has stabilized enough that the extent of the damage has become reasonably certain.\u201d); <em>Graveley Ranch, </em>240 Mont. at 24-25,782 P.2d at 371 (\u201ca permanent nuisance is one where the situation has \u2018stabilized\u2019 and the permanent damage is \u2018reasonably certain.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Haugen Trust, </em>204 Mont. at 513, 665 P.2d at 1135 (\u201cA permanent injury is one where the situation has \u2018stabilized\u2019 and the permanent damage is \u2018reasonably certain.\u2019 \u201d). Because new injuries give rise to additional damages \u2014 whether it be another flood <em>(Haugen Trust, Walton, </em>and <em>Blasdel), </em>additional glue waste <em>(Nelson), </em>increased traffic, noise, and dust <em>(Knight), </em>or migrating pollution <em>(Burley) </em>\u2014 a plaintiff\u2019s damages are necessarily more difficult to ascertain when there is a recurring injury. Recurring injuries produce new and uncertain damages. But when there is no recurring injury, there is no uncertainty. As illustrated here, the Appellants\u2019 damages were just as ascertainable on April 17,2006 as they were in the years preceding. The rationale underpinning the continuing tort doctrine provides no justification for continuing to toll the statute of limitations where, as here, the damages were ascertainable long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b6121 In contrast, the policy underpinning the other side of the scale supports the accrual of the cause of action prior to April 17, 2006. \u201cStatutes of limitation serve an important purpose.\u201d <em>E.W. v. D.C.H., </em>231 Mont. 481, 486, 754 P.2d 817, 820. They exist to suppress stale and untimely claims even if otherwise viable and sympathetic. <em>E.W., </em>231 Mont. at 486, 754 P.2d at 820. By penalizing delay, they compel litigants to bring their claims \u201cwithin a reasonable time to enable the opposing party to mount an effective defense.\u201d <em>Mont. Pole, </em>993 F.2d at 678. And they are of no less importance in the context of environmental contamination where the earlier pollution is remediated the better it is for the parties and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b6122 Although the Court acknowledges these purposes, it does not elaborate on how they will be promoted by its decision, offering only that the abatement standard will \u201cpromot[e] finality*\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 33. Of course, the Court\u2019s decision will not advance the purposes of statutes of limitations any more than the abatement standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>promotes finality. Creating perpetual tort liability does compel litigants to bring their claims in a reasonable time, it does not safeguard an opposing party\u2019s ability to mount an effective defense, and it does not encourage early remediation of environmental contamination. What it does is to ensure that a claim will be brought when it is expedient for the litigant pursuing damages, in disregard to the interests of the opposing party and the public. For those who are alleged to have pounded a post in the wrong pasture, poured a driveway past the property line, or dug a ditch for a gas line outside an easement, the Court\u2019s decision guarantees they must be prepared to mount a legal defense for all time. As for finality? and the cleanup of environmental contamination, that will come at a time of the claimants own choosing, possibly decades after damages have become ascertainable, provided he can overcome the sole impediment that is the Court\u2019s flimsy reasonable abatement standard: (1) \u201ccan be reduced\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37; (2) \u201cby some means.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b6123 In short, I cannot agree that the Legislature, by providing \u201c[wjithin 2 years is the period prescribed for the commencement of an action for injury to or waste or trespass on real or personal property\u201d intended to impose a 2 <em>year </em>statute of limitations on only those injuries that are incapable of abatement. Nor can I agree that the Legislature by writing \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by statute, the period of limitation begins\u201d when \u201call elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred\u201d intended the statute of limitations for nuisance and trespass claims to be tolled for as long as the claimant sees fit. The Court did not create the continuing tort doctrine today. But, in a decision that is wanting on text, precedent, policy, and much too often sound reasoning, the Court did expand the doctrine at the expense of power that is properly reserved for the Montana Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b6124 Given that my primary dispute with the Court is its holding Tinder Issue 1, and the lengthy discussion necessitated thereby, I will not address the remaining issues. I believe that the record does not support the existence of migration necessary to establish a recurring injury. I agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning under the discovery rule, and thus concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue 4.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\"> There is authority for the proposition that the common law doctrine of continuing tort and the statutory rule of accrual are incompatible. <em>See Jensen v. General Elec. </em>Co., 82 N.Y.2d 77, 84, 623 N.E.2d 547, 549 (N.Y. 1993) (concluding that the legislature intended no continuing tort exception to the statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> Justice Baker\u2019s concurrence adopts this standard and offers a similar line of reasoning, with which I largely agree. Concurrence, \u00b6 80. However, while I agree that the recurring prong is based principally on the idea of ascertainment of damages, I disagree with the concurrence\u2019s characterization of the injury in terms of stabilization (as it uses the term) and its implicit conclusion that the recurring prong is necessarily a jury question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> It should come as no surprise that the plaintiffs in <em>Burley, </em>well aware of our case law, argued that the contamination produced a recurring injury. The plaintiffs reasoned \u201cthe new contamination will continuously arrive and cause new injury to plaintiffs property,\u201d and \u201ckey to answering the certified question rests on the fact BNSPs contamination is still migrating.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 1, 14, <em>Burley v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa FeRy.

If migration\u2019s importance lies with abatement, the parties are arguing against their own interests: ARCO should be arguing that there is migration, and the Appellants should be arguing that there is not migration. Yet, by upholding <em>Burley, </em>which stands for the proposition that migrating pollution makes it <em>easier </em>for a plaintiff to demonstrate a continuing tort, the Court complicates matters beyond comprehension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\"> We have favorably cited <em>Blasdel </em>in our decisions in <em>Haugen Trust, Graveley, Burley, and E.W. v.

The point the Court is attempting to make with this statement is beyond my comprehension. In <em>Blasdel, </em>the water remaining on the property was not enough to toll the statute of limitations \u2014 new causes of action ended with the cessation of new injuries. Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, contamination remaining on the property may forever toll the statute of limitations. This is inconsistent with the holding in <em>Blasdel. </em>Consequently, <em>Blasdel </em>is no longer good law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> Section 27-2-102, MCA, went through extensive revisions in 1987, including providing a start date for statutes of limitations and the codification of the discovery doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b567-6\"> There are several states that utilize a conduct-based approach.
