Bannan appeals an order issued by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, denying his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">We dismiss Barman\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b62 Bannan raises one issue on appeal, which we restate as follows: <em>Did the Lewis and Clark County District Court have subject matter jurisdiction over the COPP enforcement action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b63 Terry E. Bannan is a resident of Gallatin County who ran unsuccessfully for House District 68 during the primary election in June 2010. Jonathan Motl is the current Commissioner of Political Practices (COPP).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b64 On January 22, 2014, the COPP issued a decision in <em>Clark v. Bannan, </em>COPP-2010-CFP-0023, in which it concluded that there was sufficient evidence demonstrating that Bannan had violated various campaign practices and finance laws warranting civil adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"Ach\">\u00b65 On February 11, 2014, the COPP forwarded its decision to the Lewis and Clark County Attorney for consideration of pursuing an action against Bannan. On Februaiy 18, 2014, Bannan filed a declaratory action in the Gallatin County District Court, <em>Bannan v. Motl, </em>DV-14-143B (Mont. 18th Jud. Dist. 2014), in which he alleged that the COPP acted unlawfully by referring its sufficiency findings to the Lewis and Clark County Attorney rather than the Gallatin County-Attorney. On March 2, 2014, the Lewis and Clark County Attorney waived his right to participate in the action, citing \u00a7 13-37-124(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b66 On March 5,2014, the COPP filed an enforcement action against Bannan in the Lewis and Clark County District Court. On May 16, 2014, Bannan filed a motion to dismiss contending that the COPP was obligated to assert its claims in the Gallatin County declaratory judgment action. Bannan maintained that the Lewis and Clark County District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter because the COPP was obligated to consult with the Gallatin County Attorney. The Lewis and Clark County District Court denied Bannan\u2019s motion to dismiss on September 30,2014. Bannan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination regarding its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>BNSF Railway Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. A district court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>grant or deny a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Pickett v. Cortese, </em>2014 MT 166, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 320, 328 P.3d 660. \u201cThe inquiry is whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would grant the district court subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Pickett, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6 9, 340 Mont. 56, 172 P.3d 1232). Our review is restricted to whether the district court correctly decided the limited question of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Balias, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b68 Bannan argues that the COPP was obligated under \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to refer its sufficiency findings to the county where all of the alleged campaign violations occurred \u2014 Gallatin County. He contends that the COPP\u2019s failure to confer with Gallatin County in regards to the alleged violations precludes the Lewis and Clark County District Court from exercising jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b69 Article VII, Section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution grants district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction in... all civil matters and cases at law and equity.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 3-5-302(1). \u201cSubject-matter jurisdiction is a court\u2019s fundamental authority to hear and adjudicate a particular class of cases or proceedings.\u201d <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 57, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186; <em>see also Balias, </em>\u00b6 12 (\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction refers simply to a court\u2019s power to hear and adjudicate a case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b610 The crux of Barman\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction argument is his challenge of the Lewis and Clark County District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA. The District Court is not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction when asked to address issues of statutoiy interpretation and construction. Bannan cites no authority to the contrary and concedes that \u00a7 13-37-113, MCA, confers subject matter jurisdiction upon the district courts to hear civil causes of this kind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>See </em>\u00a7 13-37-113, MCA (\u201cAM prosecutions must be brought in the state district court for the county in which a violation has occurred or in the district court for Lewis and Clark County.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b611 The District Court, as a court of general jurisdiction, has the fundamental authority to hear cases involving aMeged violations of Montana campaign practice and finance laws. We conclude that the issue before the Court is one of statutory interpretation and not one of subject matter jurisdiction. We therefore agree with the District Court\u2019s decision denying Bannan\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Balias, \u00b6 17 (\u201cwe will not aMow a party\u2019s characterization of an issue to eclipse its substance, nor will we aMow parties to relitigate a district court\u2019s ruling merely because the appealing parly has stylized the issue on appeal as one of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b612  We recognize that on December 30,2014, this Court issued an order aMowing Bannan to appeal the question of whether the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c). However, as determined above, the issue at bar is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, Bannan\u2019s appeal does not fall within the ambit of Rule 6(3)(c). Rather, his appeal must be characterized as one seeking relief from the denial of a motion to dismiss. Because orders denying motions to dismiss are not appealable (M. R. App. P. 6(5)(b)), we wUl not address the merits of Bannan\u2019s argument until after a final judgment has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b613 For the foregoing reasons, we therefore dismiss Bannan\u2019s appeal as premature.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> Section 13-37-124, MCA, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">[Wlhenever the commissioner determines that there appears to be sufficient evidence to justify a civil or criminal prosecution under chapter 35 of this title or this chapter, the commissioner shall notify the county attorney of the county hi which the alleged violation occurred and shall arrange to transmit to the county attorney all information relevant to the alleged violation. If the county attorney fails to initiate the appropriate civil or criminal action within 30 days after receiving notification of the alleged violation, the commissioner may then initiate the appropriate legal action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
