Hein appeals the Thirteenth Judicial District Court\u2019s July 8,2013 Order partially granting Sott\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and its September 26,2014 Order granting Sott\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from the 2001 construction of his home and the subsequent inspections and repairs were barred by the statute of repose, \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Hein\u2019s </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\n<em>Consumer ProtectionAct claims arising fromthe2001 construction of his home and the subsequent inspections and repairs were barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment because Hein did not provide expert testimony on causation for his Consumer Protection Act claim arising from Sott\u2019s alleged breach of contract and deceptive billing practices.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b62 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for farther proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b63 Sott is a general contractor based in Billings, Montana, and the sole owner of Krude Kustoms, LLC, a metal fabricating and trucking firm. In 2001, Hein hired Sott to construct a log home for him. Sott completed the home that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b64 Each winter following construction of the home, Hein noticed water damage appearing in different areas of the home\u2019s tongue and groove ceiling. Each time, Hein asked Sott to do an inspection and, each time, Sott informed Hein that he had repaired the problem. In</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">2012, after once again noticing water damage, Hein consulted a roofing contractor, Steve Ausen. According to Hein, Ausen discovered that the water damage was caused by improper ventilation in the roof, an issue that Sott never identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b65 In 2011, Hein hired Sott to build an addition to the home (hereinafter, \u201c2011 addition\u201d). In 2013, Sott ceased work on the project before completion. The parties dispute the reason behind Sott\u2019s decision not to complete the project: Hein alleges that Sott overbilled for services for which Hein already paid, and Sott claims that he stopped working on the addition because Hein was no longer paying him.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b66 On April 19, 2013, Hein filed a complaint alleging three counts against Sott: negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Montana Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7 30-14-103, MCA Sott moved under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss all of Hein\u2019s claims. On July 8, 2013, the District Court issued an order partially granting Sott\u2019s motion and dismissing Hein\u2019s claims related to the 2001 construction of the home as time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, and statute of repose, \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA. The parties completed discovery and Sott moved for summary judgment on Hein\u2019s remaining claims, all arising from the construction of the 2011 addition, on the ground that Hein had not provided expert evidence that Sott\u2019s work was either defective or caused Hein damage. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>September 26,2014, the District Court issued an order granting Sott\u2019s motion and dismissing Hein\u2019s remaining claims. Hein appeals both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a M. R. Civ. P. 12(bX6) motion to dismiss. <em>Plouffe v. </em>State, 2003 MT 62, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 413, 66 P.3d 316. We construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and take all allegations of fact as true. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving parly is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>City of Missoula v. </em>Iosefo, 2014 MT 209, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 161, 330 P.3d 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from the 2001 construction of his home and the subsequent inspections and, repairs were barred by the statute of repose, \u00a727-2-208, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b69 The statute of limitations for general tort actions, including negligence and negligent misrepresentation, is three years. Section 27-2-204, MCA. The statute of repose for actions for damages arising out of work on improvements to real property, \u00a7 27-2-208(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">[A]n action to recover damages... resulting from or arising out of the design, planning, supervision, inspection, construction, or observation of construction of any improvement to real property ... may not be commenced more than 10 years after completion of the improvement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Accordingly, even if the statute of limitations is tolled, a tort action related to construction damages may not be brought more them ten years after construction is completed. <em>See Ass\u2019n of Unit Owners of Deer Lodge Condo. v. Big Sky , </em>245 Mont. 64, 80-81, 798 P.2d 1018, 1028 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b610  The District Court determined that Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from water damage to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>home are barred by the statutes of limitations and repose because they relate to Sott\u2019s construction of Hein\u2019s home in 2001. Hein, however, suggests that each of Sott\u2019s acts of inspecting, identifying, and failing to repair the alleged problem constitutes either negligence or negligent misrepresentation. Thus, Hein argues, Sott\u2019s later acts are not barred by the statute of limitations or statute of repose. Upon reviewing Hein\u2019s complaint, however, it is clear that the only injury it alleges with respect to the home\u2019s roof is water damage due to Sott\u2019s alleged failure to properly vent the roof. The complaint does not allege that any of Sott\u2019s subsequent inspections or repairs created a new or separate injury. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in determining that Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims derive from his 2001 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b611  The District Court further determined that, even if the statute of limitations was tolled, Hein\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of repose because they relate to an injury that occurred more than ten years before Hein filed his complaint. The statute of repose is an absolute bar to bringing a claim for construction-related damages more than ten years after construction is completed. <em>See Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028 (stating that, under \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, \u201cany other applicable statute]] of limitation[s] still remains applicable but <em>in no event </em>shall any cause be commenced more than ten years after the completion of the improvement\u201d) (emphasis added). The statute of repose will not be extended even if a party is late in discovering facts. <em>Big </em>Sky, 245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028. <em>See also Snyder v. Love, </em>2006 MT 317, \u00b6 15, 335 Mont. 49, 153 P.3d 571 (stating that \u201cnot even fraudulent concealment\u201d can toll the ten-year statute of repose under \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA) (citations omitted). Hein\u2019s complaint, filed on April 19,2013, states, \u201cThe home was completed in 2001.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court correctly determined that Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from water damage to his home are barred by the statute of repose, \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b612 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims arising from the 2001 construction of his home and subsequent inspections and repairs were barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b613 Under Montana\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.\u201d Section 30-14-103, MCA. The statute of limitations for liabilities created by statute is two years. Section 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA. However, if a defendant \u201chas taken action which prevents the injured party from discovering [an] injury or its cause,\u201d the limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>does not begin \u201cuntil the facts constituting the claim have been discovered or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have been discovered by the injured party.\u201d Section 27-2-102(3Xb), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b614  Hein argues that the District Court erred in determining that Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims regarding his allegedly faulty roof were time-barred because Sott\u2019s deceptive inspections and repairs prevented Hein from discovering the cause of his injury. In his complaint, Hein alleges that he noticed water seeping into his home each winter between 2001 and 2012. Each spring, Hein asked Sott to inspect and repair the damage, and each winter the problem recurred. Hein waited until 2012 \u2014 eleven years after construction was completed \u2014 to ask for a second opinion from a different contractor. Accordingly, Hein did not exercise due diligence to discover the cause of his injury, and the two-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 27-2-211(lXc), MCA, was not tolled by \u00a7 27-2-102(3)(b), MCA. The District Court did not err in determining that Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims for damages arising before April 19,2011, two years before Hein filed his complaint, were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b615  The District Court also concluded that Hein\u2019s claims for damages based on inspections and repairs occurring after April 19, 2011, were barred by the statute of limitations, determining that the limitations period began to run in 2001 when construction was completed. Hein argues that a new Consumer Protection Act claim arose from each of Sott\u2019s inspections and repairs because each of Sott\u2019s inspections and repairs was deceptive. To the extent his complaint alleges separate acts of deception on separate occasions, Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims were not limited to the 2001 construction of his home, but alleged that Sott deceptively represented that he had performed successful repairs. The limitations period for those claims began to run two years before Hein filed his complaint on April 19, 2013. The District Court erred in determining that Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims based on alleged deceptive acts or practices in the performance of repairs that occurred after April 19, 2011, were barred by the two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b616 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment because Hein did not provide expert testimony on causation for his Consumer Protection Act claim arising from Sott\u2019s alleged breach of contract and deceptive billing practices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b617 A plaintiff must provide expert testimony \u201cwhen the issue presented is sufficiently beyond the common experience of the trier of fact and the expert testimony will assist the trier of fact in determining the issue or understanding the evidence.\u201d <em>Tin Cup Cnty. Water v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2008 MT 434, \u00b6 44,347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60 (citation omitted). The District Court determined that Hein was required to produce expert testimony because his Consumer Protection Act claim arising from the 2011 addition was based on his negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, which assert that Sott did not adhere to a professional standard of care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hein appeals only the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order as it applies to his Consumer Protection Act claim arising from the 2011 addition. He does not appeal the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Sott on Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from the 2011 addition. Hein argues that the District Court improperly dismissed his Consumer Protection Act claim because that claim is based on Hein\u2019s allegation that Sott did not complete work on the 2011 addition for which he was paid and does not require evidence of a professional standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b618 In his complaint, Hein alleged that Sott \u201cceased work on the project in early 2013 and, despite repeated promises to Plaintiff to resume work for which [he has] already been paid and to remedy deficient work on the current project, ha[s] never returned,\u201d and that Sott \u201cbreached [his] agreement with Plaintiff.\u201d Hein\u2019s complaint also alleges, \u201cSince the beginning of the project, [Sott] has repeatedly billed for \u2018extras\u2019 and work [Sott] claim[s] were not included in the original bid. Plaintiff felt he had no choice but to pay these charges rather than risk [Sott] walking off the job.\u201d Irrespective of the District Court\u2019s ruling that expert testimony is necessary to prove professional negligence, whether Sott billed for work not included in the bid or received payment for work he did not complete is not \u201cbeyond the common experience of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b619  In his opposition to Sott\u2019s summary judgment motion, Hein stated, \u201c[T]he heart of [the Consumer Protection Act] claim is that [Sott] accepted deposits and payments for work [he] did not complete.\u201d Discussed above, the Consumer Protection Act makes unlawful \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Section 30-14-103, MCA. The Act defines \u201ctrade\u201d and \u201ccommerce\u201d as \u201cthe advertising, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any services, any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal, or mixed, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>other article, commodity, or thing of value, wherever located.\u201d Section 30-14-102(8), MCA. We have defined \u201cunfair act or practice\u201d as \u201cone which offends established public policy and which is either immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d <em>Rohrer v. Knudson, </em>2009 MT 35, \u00b6 31, 349 Mont. 197, 203 P.3d 759. Hein\u2019s allegation that Sott caused him to suffer \u201cactual damages\u201d by billing for work not included in the bid and by failing to perform a service for which Hein paid states a claim for a Consumer Protection Act violation. This claim is separate from Hein\u2019s claim that Sott\u2019s work was defective. The District Court erred in determining that Hein was required to produce expert evidence for his Consumer Protection Act claim arising from Sott\u2019s billing for work on the 2011 addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b620 We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Hein\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims arising from water damage to his home and its dismissal of Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims arising from Sott\u2019s inspections and repairs that occurred before April 19,2011. We reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims arising from Sott\u2019s inspections and repairs that occurred after April 19, 2011. We also reverse its grant of summary judgment to Sott on Hein\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claim arising from Sott\u2019s billing on the 2011 addition.
