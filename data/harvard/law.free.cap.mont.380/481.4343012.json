We affirm, addressing the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-24\">\n<em>Did the District Court err hy holding that Dakota Fire properly </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\n<em>cancelled an insurance policy for nonpayment of a renewal premium?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b62 Dakota Fire Insurance Company issued an insurance policy to David Finn, covering his 2007 Silverado pickup truck, effective from May 1,2011, to May 1,2012. On March 16,2012, Finn received a letter from EMC Insurance Companies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> advising him he would soon be receiving an invoice for the premium necessaiy to renew the policy. The letter further explained that a failure to pay the premium prior to the due date would result in a cancellation of his policy. On March 28, 2012, Film requested that his new GMC Sierra 1500 truck be substituted on the policy, replacing the Silverado. EMC made the change to his policy as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b63 On April 11,2012, EMC sent Finn the renewal premium invoice, which instructed him to pay the minimum amount of $131.65 by May 1,2012, to renew his policy. Finn did not pay by the due date. Six days later, EMC sent a notice of expiration and cancellation summary to Finn, but offered to reinstate Finn\u2019s coverage without interruption if he would pay the premium by May 18. EMC explained that if he failed to make this payment the policy would \u201cremain expired.\u201d Finn wrote a check to EMC dated May 8, but it was not received in the mail by the company until May 24. Finn states that he failed to place a stamp on the envelope, resulting in it being returned to him by the postal service, and requiring him to resend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b64 On May 14 \u2014 after EMC had sent the notice of expiration and before Finn\u2019s payment had arrived \u2014 Finn was involved in an automobile accident resulting in the total loss of his truck. Two days later, Finn reported the loss to EMC. On May 24, EMC sent a letter to Fixm denying coverage for the accident, citing his failure to pay the renewal premium by the deadline. On the same day, Finn\u2019s check arrived at EMC\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u00b65 On May 24, 2013, Finn filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and requesting declaratory relief. Following cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting Dakota Fire\u2019s cross motion. The District Court determined that, had Dakota Fire received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>payment of $131.65 from Finn by May 1, 2012, Finn would have successfully renewed the policy, and that, had Dakota Fire received a payment of $232.81 by May 18, 2012, Finn would have successfully reinstated his policy. Because Finn failed to accomplish either of these, \u201cthere was no automobile insurance policy in effect at the time of Finn\u2019s May 14, 2013, accident\u201d and Dakota Fire \u201chad no contractual duty to indemnify\u201d Finn for his losses. Finn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b66 We review orders granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co., </em>2008 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 335, 181 P.3d 601. The interpretation of an insurance contract\u2019s terms presents a question of law, and we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Cusenbary v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>2001 MT 261, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 238, 37 P.3d 67. The interpretation and application of a statute to a particular set of circumstances are questions of law subject to de novo review for correctness. <em>Ramsey v. Yellowstone Neurosurgical Assocs., </em>2005 MT 317, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 489, 125 P.3d 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by holding that Dakota Fire properly cancelled an insurance policy for nonpayment of a renewal premium </em>? \u00b68 Section 33-23-214(1), MCA, provides that an insurer \u201cshall renew a motor vehicle liability policy unless it mails or delivers to the named insured ... at least 45 days\u2019 advance notice of its intention not to renew.\u201d Section 33-23-214(3), MCA, adds that the section does not apply \u201cwhere the named insured has failed to discharge when due any of the insured\u2019s obligations in connection with the payment of premiums for the policy or the renewal of the policy....\u201d The District Court concluded that Finn\u2019s policy had expired by its express terms on May 1, 2012, and that Dakota Fire had clearly informed Finn what course of action was timely required to renew his policy and, later, to reinstate coverage. Because Finn failed to accomplish these, Finn\u2019s coverage expired and \u201cMontana\u2019s midterm cancellation statutes do not apply to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b69 On appeal, Finn offers several arguments. First, Finn asserts the policy\u2019s automatic termination provision, which provides that a failure to accept an offer of renewal by payment of the premium terminates the coverage, violates \u00a7 33-23-214(1), MCA, because it conditions renewal on receiving payment prior to the expiration date. Finn argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that the statute \u201crequires auto insurers to make their decision to renew an auto policy at least 45 days before the policy expires\u201d and thus \u201cprohibits auto insurers from waiting until the day before the existing policy expires to decide whether to renew that polity.\u201d Accordingly, Finn offers that Dakota Fire was required to renew his polity because he was not given 45 days\u2019 advance notice of its decision not to renew, and as such the policy was not effectively cancelled until May 18, 2012 \u2014 after the date his truck was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b610 Second, Finn argues Dakota Fire\u2019s actions gave the impression the policy had been renewed, which Dakota Fire did not disavow until he reported the accident. He notes that Dakota Fire had sent him a written renewal policy, issued proof of insurance cards, and notified Finn\u2019s loss payees that the policy had been renewed, leading him, his loss payees, and law enforcement to believe a renewal polity was in effect. Finn argues that Dakota Fire invoked its automatic termination provision to \u201ctransform\u201d the renewal of his policy into a mere offer of renewal to evade the statutory notice requirements for nonrenewal and terminate his coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b611 Alternatively, Finn argues that even if he was required to timely renew the policy to obtain coverage, he did so. Finn argues that Dakota Fire\u2019s offer to renew was made by use of the billing account notice, which did \u201cnot prescribe an exclusive mode of acceptance.\u201d Finn reasons that, because no provision stated that acceptance of the renewal offer could <em>only </em>be made by a timely payment, he had the option of accepting the offer by any means within a reasonable time. In support, Finn cites <em>Olsen v. Johnston, </em>2013 MT 25, \u00b6 15, 368 Mont. 347, 301 P.3d 791, where we stated an offeree may accept an offer in any reasonable manner where an offeror has failed to prescribe an exclusive mode of acceptance. Thus, Finn asserts he successfully accepted Dakota Fire\u2019s offer by paying the premium within seven days of its due date, which is a reasonable amount of time. Because an exclusive manner of renewal was not required, Finn argues that \u00a7 33-23-214(3), MCA, does not apply, as he violated no \u201cobligation\u201d in connection with renewing the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b612 Lastly, Finn argues the District Court erred by accepting Dakota Fire\u2019s position that May 1 was the renewal premium payment deadline. Finn reasons that because the renewal policy itself did not state a deadline for acceptance of premiums, the May 1 deadline set forth by the invoice was not binding. Finn interprets the lack of a specific premium due date to mean that coverage was not conditioned on prepayment, and thus, he could make payment beyond that date without losing coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00b613 Dakota Fire responds that \u00a7 33-23-214(3), MCA, specifically contemplates and applies to the situation here. It argues that the statute explicitly obviates notice requirements in situations where an insured fails to pay a premium to renew his policy, stating that \u201can insurer cannot be in violation of this statute if it has offered to renew, and the insured himself fails to avail himself of that offer by failing to pay the renewal premium.\u201d Even so, Dakota Fire points out that Finn was given notice ofEMC\u2019s intent to renew on March 16,2012 \u2014 45 days preceding the date of renewal \u2014 and undisputedly failed to pay on time. Thus, alternatively, even if Dakota Fire had been bound by the 45-day statutory notice requirement for nonrenewal, it argues that its actions satisfied the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b614 As to Finn\u2019s argument that EMC did not prescribe an \u201cexclusive mode of acceptance\u201d of the renewal offer, Dakota Fire first notes that the argument is raised for the first time on appeal, but further answers that EMC made very clear that renewal of Finn\u2019s policy was contingent on payment by May 1 and that Finn was given prior notice twice of this due date. Another notice was given to Finn offering to reinstate the policy so long as payment was received by May 18. Again, Finn failed to make timely payment. Regarding Finn\u2019s argument that he was not required to prepay the premium to secure coverage, Dakota Fire cites the language of its automatic termination provision, which states that a failure to pay a renewal premium when due results in a rejection of the offer to renew. Because the invoice clearly stated payment was required by May 1, Dakota Fire contends coverage expired at that time and, because Finn failed to pay the premium to reinstate without a lapse in coverage, there was no policy in effect at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b615 We conclude that Finn\u2019s arguments are defeated by the plain language of the notice documents and the statute. Finn\u2019s attempt to splice the wording of \u00a7 33-23-214(3), MCA, so that his obligation to pay the noticed premium here is not included within an \u201cinsured\u2019s obligations in connection with the payment of premiums for the policy or the renewal of the policy,\u201d is unavailing. Clearly, it is included, which ehminates the 45-day notice requirement for nonrenewal that is applicable in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b616  On March 16, EMC notified Finn of its intent to renew by sending him a renewal policy and notifying him that he would be receiving an invoice. He received the promised invoice on April 11, which again advised him to pay \u201cat least the minimum due to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>cancellation of coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finn did not pay. Dakota Fire was then entitled to cancel coverage under the terms of \u00a7 33-23-214(3), MCA, because Finn had \u201cfailed to discharge\u201d his obligation in \u201cconnection with the payment of premiums for ... the renewal of the policy.\u201d Six days later, notice of the cancellation of coverage was conveyed to Finn in a notice of expiration, wherein Dakota Fire unequivocally stated that the policy had expired on May 1, but that coverage would be continued without interruption if the premium due was received by \u201c12:01 A.M. standard time on 5/18/12.\u201d Again, Finn failed to comply \u2014 payment was not received by that time and date. This was not an issue of nonrenewal, because by then the policy had already been cancelled. No link in this chain of events violated Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b617 While it is true that Dakota Fire proceeded through this process on the assumption that Finn would renew or reinstate the policy, and therefore sent a renewed policy and notices to Finn and his loss payees, this was done as a service to Finn. Otherwise, Dakota Fire could not have effectuated renewal of the policy and provided the new policy and proof of renewal for Finn\u2019s use by the date of renewal. However, Dakota Fire included the necessary notices of nonrenewal and cancellation to effectuate termination of coverage in the event the payment was ultimately not timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\"> BMC Insurance Companies is the parent company of Dakota Fire.
