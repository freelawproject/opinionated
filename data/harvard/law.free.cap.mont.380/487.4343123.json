We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court should have granted Emerson\u2019s motion to suppress because Emerson\u2019s consent to a search of her purse was the fruit of an illegal seizure. Emerson raises a second issue regarding sentencing which we do not address because the first issue is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">\u00b63 Emerson was charged with, and pled guilty to, one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and one count of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Under the plea agreement, Emerson reserved her right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress. At the suppression hearing, the State called one witness, Deputy Robins of the Toole County Sheriffs Office. Deputy Robins\u2019 testimony at the hearing and the parties\u2019 exhibits revealed the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">\u00b64 On November 28, 2012, Deputy Robins stopped a vehicle near Shelby, Montana, because he recognized the driver, Joseph Bentley, and knew that Bentley had a felony warrant out for his arrest. Emerson was a passenger in the car when Deputy Robins stopped it. Bentley was arrested, and the car was released to Emerson after Deputy Robins spoke with the car\u2019s registered owner on Emerson\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u00b65 Approximately an hour later, Emerson entered the Toole County Sheriffs Office to request a gas card. The Sheriffs Office sometimes keeps gas cards on hand for people who need assistance to travel somewhere, but did not have any at that time. After being told the Sheriffs Office did not have any gas cards, Emerson left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"AEs\">\u00b66 A few minutes after Emerson left, the Sheriffs Office received a teletype from the Great Falls Police Department with an attempt to locate (ATL) on the car Emerson was driving. The ATL identified the vehicle and stated, \u201cAttempt to locate vehicle loaned to Joseph Bentley on Friday [11/23/2012] to drive from Great Falls to Shelby and back. Owner has talked to him several times but he will not return the vehicle. If located please stop and contact this agency re CR12-40542.\u201d Deputy Robins could see from inside the Sheriffs Office that the car was still parked out front with Emerson inside. Deputy Robins went out and advised Emerson about the ATL and asked her to get out of the car, lock the car, give him the keys, and wait while he sorted out the ATL. According to Deputy Robins, before exiting the vehicle, Emerson \u201cmade a movement to close the top of [her] purse,\u201d but it remained partially open and Deputy Robins saw what he thought was an automatic pistol in the purse. Emerson left the purse on the center console in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b67 Inside the Sheriffs Office, Deputy Robins asked Emerson to take a seat in the conference room while he called the Great Falls Police Department. According to Deputy Robins, he asked Emerson to wait because he wanted to find out if the Great Falls Police wanted Emerson arrested in connection with the ATL, even though the ATL did not say the car was stolen. Deputy Robins learned from the Great Falls Police that the owner wanted the car held until she could travel to Shelby to retrieve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b68 While Deputy Robins was on the phone, Emerson went to the front desk and asked the dispatcher if she could retrieve her purse from the car. After Deputy Robins got off the phone, the dispatcher informed him that Emerson had requested her purse. Deputy Robins went to the car and retrieved the purse. Looking in the top of the open purse, Deputy Robins saw that what he initially believed may be an automatic pistol was in fact a makeup case. According to Deputy Robins, he did not search the purse; he merely looked into the open top.</p>\n<p id=\"Al36\">\u00b69 Deputy Robins returned to the conference room and placed the purse between himself and Emerson on the table where Emerson was sitting across from him. Deputy Robins then turned on his digital voice recorder and stated, \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of ironing out an issue of a car [Emerson] was driving .... We\u2019re just returning her purse to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>....\u201d The following conversation, in pertinent part, occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Robins: \u201cI gotta ask ... if there\u2019s anything in this purse that shouldn\u2019t be in here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Emerson: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Robins: \u201cAnything illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">Emerson: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Robins: \u201cAnything at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">Emerson: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">Robins: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe so. Okay. Can I look?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">Emerson: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">Robins: \u201cIf there\u2019s something in it that shouldn\u2019t be, you need to tell us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">Emerson: [crying] \u201cI just wanna get home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">Robins: \u201cThe registered owner, okay, can give us permission to search the whole car. That would include your property inside the car. Out of the kindness of my heart, I brought your purse in here, okay, because I know this is your property, right? We\u2019re a hundred percent sure of that ... . If there\u2019s anything in the purse that shouldn\u2019t be in there, you need to tell me. If there\u2019s not, you got nothing to worry about, okay. That\u2019s pretty clear, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">Emerson eventually admitted that Bentley had given her \u201csomething\u201d to hold for him. Deputy Robins testified that, based on this conversation, he believed that the purse contained a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">\u00b610 Deputy Robins had Emerson read and sign a Miranda rights waiver and a consent to search form. Deputy Robins informed Emerson, \u201cRight now you are not in custody. You need to understand that. You\u2019re not in custody.\u201d When he gave the consent forms to Emerson, he stated, \u201cThis is totally voluntary.\u201d Deputy Robins again asked Emerson what he would find during the search of her purse, and she admitted that there were needles in the purse that had been used for drugs. After Emerson signed the forms, Deputy Robins searched her purse and found a small amount of cocaine and needles.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">\u00b611 The District Court denied Emerson\u2019s motion to suppress. Emerson appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">\u00b612 \u201cWe review a denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the lower court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether it correctly applied the law to those findings.\u201d <em>State v. Strom, </em>2014 MT 234, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 277, 333 P.3d 218 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b613 Emerson argues that she was illegally seized when she admitted she had contraband in her purse and consented to a search and, thus, that her admission and consent must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal seizure. In reviewing Emerson\u2019s allegation of an illegal seizure, we must first determine whether a seizure of Emerson has occurred. Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. However, we have recognized that \u201cnot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons.\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>2009 MT 99, \u00b6 8, 350 Mont. 96, 205 P.3d 795 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-20 n.16, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1879 n.16 (1968\u00bb. In determining whether a seizure has occurred, we apply the same test under both the federal and Montana constitutions. <em>State v. Case, </em>2007 MT 161, \u00b6 24, 338 Mont. 87, 162 P.3d 849. \u201cA person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that [she] was not free to leave.\u201d <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974 (quoting <em>United States v. Mendenhall, 446 </em>U.S. 544, 554, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 1877 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b614 In <em>Mendenhall, </em>the Supreme Court provided examples of circumstances that may indicate a person was seized, including \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S. Ct. at 1877. We have repeatedly relied on these factors, often referred to as the <em>Mendenhall </em>factors, in seizure cases but we have also explained that the test is an objective one and \u201cis necessarily imprecise and will vary depending on the setting in which the conduct occurs.\u201d <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 309 Mont. 215, 45 P.3d 30 (citation omitted). The <em>Mendenhall </em>factors may be helpful in certain cases, but we have recognized that they are not exhaustive. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b615 If there has been a seizure, the State must prove it was reasonable by showing circumstances that create \u201ca particularized suspicion that the person is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity.\u201d <em>Case, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u00b616 Our review of the circumstances convinces us that Emerson was seized. Deputy Robins asked Emerson to get out of the car, lock the car doors, give him the keys, and come inside the Sheriffs Office. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>midnight in November, Emerson had no transportation; her purse \u2014 which contained her phone and wallet \u2014 was locked inside the car, and the deputy had the keys to the car. Deputy Robins instructed Emerson to have a seat in the conference room while he called the Great Falls Police. When asked at the hearing if a person is expected to do something when a police officer tells her to, Deputy Robins responded, \u201cYes.\u201d When asked if Emerson was free to leave, Deputy Robins responded, \u201cShe was advised that she was not in custody.\u201d However, Deputy Robins did not tell Emerson that she was not in custody until after he had commenced a recorded interrogation of her, during which she admitted to having drug paraphernalia in her purse, and he had obtained her verbal consent to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b617 Both the State and the District Court treated the fact that Emerson left the conference room to ask the dispatcher for her purse as evidence that she was free to leave. However, the question is not whether Emerson felt free to leave a particular room, the question is whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave the presence of the law enforcement officers entirely. If anything, her departure from the conference room to ask the dispatcher for her purse is evidence that she wished to leave but was unable to because only Deputy Robins had access to her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b618 Moreover, Deputy Robins stated at the hearing that he had particularized suspicion to detain Emerson because the ATL did not specify whether the car was stolen or not, so he needed to check with the Great Falls Police to determine if there was an arrest warrant associated with it. It should be apparent that no reasonable person would feel free to leave after an officer tells her to take a seat while he \u201cclears up\u201d a matter that might result in the person\u2019s arrest, and the officer has the keys to the locked car where the person\u2019s wallet and phone are stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b619  Deputy Robins testified that the basis for the seizure was the ATL, specifically its instruction to stop the car and contact the Great Falls Police Department. It is well established that an officer can make an investigative stop in reliance on a report or bulletin from another law enforcement agency. <em>United States v. </em>Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S. Ct. 675, 682 (1985); <em>State v. Hall, </em>2004 MT 106, \u00b6 11, 321 Mont. 78, 88 P.3d 1273. However, when a seizure is made on the basis of a flyer or bulletin, the admissibility of any evidence uncovered as a result of the seizure turns on whether the officers who issued the bulletin possessed the requisite suspicion. <em>Hensley, </em>469 U.S. at 231, 105 S. Ct. at 681-82; <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u00b620 The State did not present any evidence at the suppression hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>showing that the Great Falls Police Department possessed any facts that would justify seizing Emerson. The only evidence presented indicated that the Great Falls Police Department told Deputy Robins over the phone that the owner wanted the vehicle held until she could retrieve it. Those facts justify seizing the vehicle, but they do not show a particularized suspicion that Emerson was engaged in wrongdoing or was witness to criminal activity. Thus, Emerson\u2019s initial seizure was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b621 The State contends that, once Deputy Robins brought the purse inside and placed it on the conference room table, Emerson was free to pick up the purse and leave. On the other hand, the State argues that Deputy Robins had information that Bentley had his female companions carry a gun for him, and therefore Deputy Robins had to investigate the possibility that Emerson was bringing a gun into the Sheriffs Office to give to Bentley, who was locked in a cell in the same building. Thus, the State simultaneously argues that \u201cDeputy Robins testified that Emerson could have picked up the purse and walked out of the building,\u201d and that, \u201c[i]f there was anything dangerous or illegal in the purse, it was understandable that Deputy Robins was concerned about handing the purse back to Emerson in the Sheriffs Office building.\u201d Aside from contradicting each other, the record does not support either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b622  Once Deputy Robins spoke with the Great Falls Police Department and learned there was no allegation that the vehicle was stolen and there was no basis to arrest Emerson, he did not inform Emerson that the matter was finished or otherwise advise her that she was free to leave. Instead, he retrieved her purse, set it down on the table between them, turned on a tape recorder, and stated on the recording that he was questioning Emerson in connection with the ATL and the vehicle. No reasonable person would interpret an officer placing her purse on a table between them, turning on a tape recorder, and commencing an interrogation about the contents of her purse as a sign that she was now free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b623 The State\u2019s second assertion, that Deputy Robins had to investigate whether the purse contained a gun intended for Bentley, is also not supported by the record. Deputy Robins testified that, at the point that he returned with Emerson\u2019s purse and began the recorded interrogation of her, he had already ascertained that what he initially believed was a gun in Emerson\u2019s purse was in fact a makeup case. Furthermore, as the State acknowledges, Emerson was in a public area. Bentley was locked in a cell in a secure area of the building. Emerson expressed no desire to see Bentley. Rather, she came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Sheriffs Office to request a gas card.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b624 We similarly cannot reconcile Deputy Robins\u2019 testimony that Emerson was free to pick up her purse and leave the conference room after he placed it on the conference table with his testimony that he had to question Emerson because of concerns that the purse might contain a gun. Moreover, Deputy Robins\u2019 professed concerns about a gun in Emerson\u2019s purse are belied by the fact that he never questioned her as to whether she had a gun in her purse. Rather, he asked her if there was \u201canything illegal\u201d in the purse, \u201canything at all.\u201d He made no mention to Emerson of any concern about her carrying a gun for Bentley.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b625  At the time that Deputy Robins began his recorded interrogation of Emerson, the only facts known to him were that Emerson had done nothing illegal, was not in possession of anything illegal, was wanted for nothing, and had no access to Bentley. Because Emerson\u2019s seizure was not justified by objective facts showing a particularized suspicion of criminal wrongdoing, the seizure violated the prohibition on unreasonable seizures in the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b626  Emerson\u2019s confession that there was contraband in her purse and consent to search were obtained as the result of an illegal seizure. They are thus fruits of the poisonous tree and are inadmissible. <em>See State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 57, 302 Mont. 189, 14 P.3d 444 (\u201cThe \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine forbids the use of evidence which comes to light as a result of the exploitation of an initial illegal act of the police.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b627 The District Court erred when it determined that Emerson was not seized. The record demonstrates that Emerson was seized. No objective facts justified the seizure, hence, it was illegal and all evidence obtained as a result of it must be suppressed. We reverse and remand with instructions to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the seizure.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
