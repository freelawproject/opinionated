This case has a lengthy history. In 2002, Marble was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent. The victim, then thirteen-year-old Robert Thomas, testified at Marble\u2019s trial that Marble forcibly engaged in anal sexual intercourse with him in the shower at the Missoula County Detention Center where both boys were temporary inmates for juvenile offenses. In 2010, Thomas recanted his accusations in writing. Based upon those recantations, Marble petitioned for postconviction relief seeking, among other things, a new trial. The District Court denied the petition. Marble appeals. We reverse the order of the District Court and remand for proceedings in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues before the Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in predicating its decision upon the concurring opinion in State <em>v. </em>Beach, 2013 MT 130, 370 Mont. 163, 302 P.3d 47 <em>(Beach II</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b64 If reliance on the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence was error, what test must a district court employ in reviewing a petition for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence and filed within one year of discovery of such evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u00b65 In 2002, seventeen-year-old Cody Marble spent several weeks in Pod C of the Missoula County Detention Center (MCDC) with seven other boys, aged 13 to 18. According to MCDC taped footage and eyewitness testimony, on the evening of March 10,2002, between 9:00 p.m. and 9:45 p.m., while at least four other pod mates were gathered in the common area just outside the showers, Thomas and Marble voluntarily entered a shower stall together. Approximately ten minutes later, they left the shower area and Thomas went to his cell just prior to the 10:00 p.m. lights out deadline. Thomas later claimed that during the ten minutes he was in the shower stall with Marble, Marble told him to remove his pants and grab his ankles. Thomas claimed that after being threatened if he refused, Thomas complied at which time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Marble had anal sexual intercourse without consent with Thomas. Thomas asserts that as they left the shower area, Marble threatened him with bodily harm again and then instructed him to tell the others that it was just a joke and that Marble had not sodomized him. Thomas did not report the alleged assault to the MCDC staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b66 OnMarch 13,bothboyswerereleasedfromMCDCandwenthome to their respective families. On March 21,2002, Marble was charged with felony sexual intercourse without consent after other Pod C inmates reported to the Detention Center authorities that Marble had raped Thomas in the showers on March 10. Later, those same inmates and Thomas testified against Marble at trial. Marble asserted the rape never occurred and that he was the victim of a malicious set-up by other boys in the pod, including Thomas. On November 22,2002, a jury found Marble guilty. In January2004, Marble was sentenced to twenty years, with fifteen suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b67 Marble has consistently maintained his innocence since he was accused, and his case has been before this Court on multiple occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, 328 Mont. 223, 119 P.3d 88, <em>Marble v. State, </em>2007 MT 98, 337 Mont. 99, 169 P.3d 1148, and <em>State v. Marble, </em>2010 MT 210N.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b68 In the late fall of2009, Marble contacted the Montana Innocence Project. Marble had heard rumors that Thomas, who was serving time for statutory rape, was telling other inmates that Marble did not rape him. Marble asked the Innocence Project to contact Thomas and investigate. The Innocence Project interviewed Thomas approximately four times between December 23, 2009, and July 2010. Thomas verbally recanted his rape claim on each occasion but initially refused to provide a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b69 In July 2010, Thomas handwrote the following recantation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">8 or so years ago when I was 13 at Missoula County Juvenile Detention Facility I was sitting at a table in the dayroom. There were three other people at the table. They told me to say that Cody Marble raped me. But this did not happen. And now today I want to come out and let it be known. I\u2019m coming forward now because I\u2019m in prison on a sex crime and know what it is like. So I don\u2019t want him to be charged with one when innocent. When I was in jail, I was the youngest &amp; smallest and I was pressured into going along with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Thomas provided this letter to attorneys with the Montana Innocence Project. A few days later, an Innocence Project lawyer returned with a typed letter of recantation for Thomas\u2019s signature. This letter was more detailed than Thomas\u2019s earlier handwritten note. It unequivocally stated that the rape did not occur and that Thomas had participated in a conspiracy against Marble. Thomas made a handwritten correction to one of the statements and initialed and dated the correction. He then signed and dated the typed letter and returned it to the Innocence Project lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b610 Based upon these letters, on December 14, 2010, Marble filed a petition for postconviction relief, the denial of which is currently on review before us. The District Court ordered that Thomas be deposed. At both his deposition in January 2012 and later at the October 24, 2012 PCR hearing, Thomas testified that the rape did occur as he claimed in 2002 and that because the Innocence Project lawyers called him a liar, he recanted and told them what they wanted to hear. He also testified that he thought the Innocence Project might help him with his legal problems if he cooperated with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b611 In November 2013, the District Court denied Marble\u2019s petition. The court predicated its decision upon the concurring opinion <em>inBeach II </em>and decided that Thomas\u2019s recantation did not \u201caffirmatively and unquestionably establish\u201d that Marble was innocent and therefore his petition for PCR failed. Marble filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b612 On April 7,2014, while on parole, Thomas had an encounter with the Havre police that resulted in a 21-hour standoff ending with Thomas\u2019s suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b613 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Beach v. State, </em>2009 MT 398, \u00b6 14, 353 Mont. 411, 220 P.3d 667 <em>{citing Heath v. State, </em>2009 MT 7, \u00b6 13, 348 Mont. 361, 202 P.3d 118). \u201cWe review discretionary rulings in post-conviction relief proceedings, including rulings related to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>2010 MT 25, \u00b6 7, 355 Mont. 133, 226 P.3d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in predicating its decision upon the concurring opinion in State v. Beach, 2013 MT 130, 370 Mont. 163, 302 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>P.3d 47 (Beach II)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b615 Marble\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was brought under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA. In its entirety \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a petition for the relief referred to in 46-21-101 may be filed at any time within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final. A conviction becomes final for purposes of this chapter when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(a) the time for appeal to the Montana supreme court expires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">(b) if an appeal is taken to the Montana supreme court, the time for petitioning the United States supreme court for review expires; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">(c) if review is sought in the United States supreme court, on the date that that court issues its final order in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">(2) A claim that alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence that, if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted, may be raised in a petition filed within 1 year of the date on which the conviction becomes final or the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u00b616 The State does not argue that Marble\u2019s petition was untimely, nor does it assert that Marble\u2019s awareness of inmate rumors triggered the one-year clock to begin running. Marble\u2019s representative \u2014 the Innocence Project \u2014 heard from Thomas for the first time on December 23,2009, that the rape had not occurred. Marble filed his petition for PCR on December 14,2010. Consequently, Marble\u2019s petition was not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">\u00b617 Marble asserted in the District Court that the newly discovered evidence consisting of Thomas\u2019s repeated recantations entitled him to a new trial. He maintained that his PCR petition should be analyzed under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099. The State argued that his claim for PCR relief should be treated as a substantive claim of actual innocence in accordance with the analysis set forth in the concurring opinion in <em>Beach II, </em>and should not be premised on <em>Clark.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">\u00b618 The District Court adopted the State\u2019s argument and conducted a lengthy analysis of Marble\u2019s claim of innocence under the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. The court concluded that in making a substantive claim of innocence under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, Marble must not only raise doubt about his guilt, but must affirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence. Consistent with its reading of the <em>Beach II </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>concurrence, the District Court rejected the contention that the five-part test articulated by this Court in <em>Clark </em>should figure in the court\u2019s analysis. Marble argues on appeal that the District Court erred in applying the test set forth in the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence to his PCR petition and rejecting the application of the <em>Clark </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b619 In Beach\u2019s 2008 petition for PCR, Beach claimed that newly discovered evidence established his \u201cactual innocence.\u201d The district court reviewed the new evidence and determined that it was sufficient to warrant a new trial. The State appealed and this Court reversed the district court, holding that, as part of its analysis the district court was required to consider the evidence presented at Beach\u2019s original trial <em>together with </em>Beach\u2019s new evidence. We concluded that the district court erroneously reviewed the new evidence only. <em>Beach II, </em>\u00b6 79. After considering both old and new evidence on appeal, we concluded that Beach\u2019s newly discovered evidence did not displace the original trial evidence and that the new evidence was unreliable and failed to establish Beach\u2019s actual innocence. <em>Beach II, </em>\u00b6 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b620 The <em>Beach II </em>concurrence revisited the test for determining postconviction claims of \u201cactual innocence\u201d as set forth in <em>Beach I </em>and applied in <em>Beach II. Beach II, </em>\u00b6 81 (McKinnon, J., concurring). Concluding that the <em>Beach I </em>test confused the applicable law, the concurrence reviewed the standards for both substantive and procedural innocence claims and set forth revised standards for each. The concurrence also addressed application of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, to postconviction cases and suggested that the statute was a codification of the requirements for a substantive claim of actual innocence, requiring a petitioner to \u201caffirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence, based upon reliable new evidence discovered within the twelve months preceding the filing of his petition and in light of the proof of his guilt at tried.\u201d <em>Beach II, </em>\u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b621 As indicated, Marble argues that the District Court should have analyzed his petition under the five-prong <em>Clark </em>test rather than the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. In <em>Clark, </em>we reviewed a district court\u2019s denial of Clark\u2019s motion for a new trial (as opposed to a PCR petition). In 2003, Clark was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. Shortly after the trial, the stepdaughter recanted much of her damning testimony. Clark moved for a new trial asserting that the recantation constituted new evidence. The district court denied his motion and several months later sentenced him and entered a written judgment. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b622 On appeal, we announced that the following test would be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to motions for new trial predicated on newly discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">To prevail on a motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence, the defendant must satisfy a five-part test:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">(1) The evidence must have been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">(2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">(3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">(4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">(5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34. We then remanded Clark\u2019s motion to the district court for reconsideration in accordance with the five-part test. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b623 Several months after <em>Clark </em>was decided, <em>Crosby v. State, </em>2006 MT 155, 332 Mont. 460, 139 P.3d 832, came before the Court. In 1996, Crosby was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent. The victim, Crosby\u2019s then ten-year-old daughter, recanted her testimony in 2003. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 5. Crosby filed a petition for postconviction relief alleging that his daughter\u2019s recantation constituted new evidence. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 6. Following a PCR hearing, the district court denied Crosby\u2019s motion. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. On appeal, we concluded that the <em>Clark </em>test, originally developed to address a motion for a new trial, should apply to a petition for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 20. We reversed and remanded Crosby\u2019s case to the district court with instructions to apply the <em>Clark </em>test to determine whether Crosby was entitled to postconviction relief and a new trial. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 25. Since we decided <em>Crosby, </em>we have applied the <em>Clark </em>test in analyzing claims for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence in two cases: <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753 and <em>State v. Tyler, </em>2009 MT 75, 349 Mont. 461, 204 P.3d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">\u00b624 Because we held in <em>Crosby </em>that the <em>Clark </em>test should apply in PCR cases, Marble argues the <em>Clark </em>test should likewise apply to his postconviction relief claim. The State counters, however, that applying <em>Clark </em>to claims for postconviction relief is incompatible with the exacting language of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, which allows a postconviction claim based upon newly discovered evidence, provided that the claim, \u201cif proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted.\u201d Section 46-21-102(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>MCA. The State points out that, by contrast, the fifth <em>Clark </em>factor requires only a finding that \u201ca new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b625 At oral argument, the State maintained that the disparity between the proof required under the PCR statute and that required by the fifth factor of the <em>Clark </em>test is justified in light of the fact that a PCR petitioner is saddled with a presumption of guilt, whereas a judgment of conviction has not yet been entered against the petitioner who files a motion for new trial following a verdict or finding of guilty but before the entry of a judgment of conviction. Thus, it argues, the test to be applied to PCR claims premised upon newly discovered evidence should require a more strenuous level of proof than that applied to a petitioner against whom a judgment of conviction has not yet been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b626 A defendant who has been convicted by a court or juiy of a crime but against whom a final judgment of conviction and sentence has not yet been entered has a brief window of time within which to file a motion for new trial. Section 46-16-702(2), MCA, requires a defendant seeking a new trial to do so within 30 days following the verdict or finding of guilty. This window of time invariably closes before the imposition of a judgment of conviction, given the statutory requirements of a presentence investigation, preparation of a report, and the scheduling and conduct of the sentencing hearing. Thus, as the State posits, a defendant seeking a new trial will do so before a final judgment of conviction and sentencing has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b627 Section 46-16-701, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if there had been no trial.\u201d This can occur because there is at that point no judgment of conviction to overturn. By contrast, a postconviction relief petitioner seeks relief well after his conviction has become final. Section 46-21-102(l)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b628  We agree with the State\u2019s argument. Although there is a paucity of case law on the topic, it stands to reason that a PCR petitioner is presumed guilty following the date upon which his conviction has become final, while a defendant who has timely requested a new trial and has not yet had a judgment of conviction and sentence entered against him does not yet carry with him the presumption of guilt and the associated burdens that accompany a final judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b629  Because the PCR petitioner is presumed guilty following the entry of a judgment of conviction, his burden when seeking postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>greater than that imposed upon a petitioner seeking a new trial under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. Our conclusion here is underscored by the precision of the language of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, quoted above. Moreover, we conclude we have erred in equating a motion for new trial with a postconviction relief claim based upon newly discovered evidence because, while a motion for new trial does \u2014 by definition \u2014 contemplate a new trial, postconviction proceedings are in no way tethered to such relief. An examination of the postconviction relief statutes illustrates this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b630 Section 46-21-201, MCA, describes the proceedings to be undertaken upon the filing of a PCR petition. Unless the petition and the case records conclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief, the court shall cause notice of the petition to be sent to the county attorney and the attorney general, who can then determine whether to respond to the petition. \u201cFollowing its review of the responsive pleading, the court may dismiss the petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief or it may proceed to determine the issue.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA. If the court determines that a hearing is required, or if the interests of justice require, it can order the office of the state public defender to assign counsel for a qualifying petitioner. Section 46-21-201(2), MCA. Thereafter, the court may for good cause grant either party leave to use discovery procedures; it may also receive proof of affidavits, depositions, oral testimony, or other evidence, and may order the petitioner brought before the court for hearing. Section 46-21-201(4) and (5), MCA. Finally, if the court finds in favor of the petitioner, \u201cit shall enter an appropriate order with respect to the judgment or sentence in the former proceedings and any supplementary orders as to reassignment, retrial, custody, bail, or discharge that may be necessary and proper. If the court finds for the prosecution, the petition must be dismissed.\u201d Section 46-21-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b631  The foregoing statutory provisions illustrate that a court entertaining a petition for postconviction relief has multiple arrows in its quiver. While a court may order a new trial, it clearly has the statutory right to dismiss the petition before or after briefing or proceed to \u201cdetermine the issue\u201d with or without a hearing. A request for a new trial in a petition for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence, while permissible, does not recast a PCR proceeding as a petition for a new trial, nor does it change or limit the options available to the district court. We therefore erred in tying a PCR court to the <em>Clark </em>test, and in particular to factor five of the <em>Clark </em>test, which permits a defendant \u201c[t]o prevail on a motion for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>grounded on newly discovered evidence\u201d where the evidence indicates \u201cthat a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 19. This test is inconsistent with the standard set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and undercuts the wide discretion available to a district court considering a PCR petition under \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA. Accordingly, we hereby overrule <em>Crosby, DuBray, </em>and <em>Tyler </em>to the extent that they apply the fifth factor of the new trial <em>Clark </em>test to a petition for postconviction relief that is based upon newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b632 We must next determine whether the District Court erred in predicating its decision on the <em>Beach II </em>concurring opinion, and if so, what test should be applied to petitions for postconviction relief premised upon newly discovered evidence. We start with the proposition that newly discovered evidence can take varying forms. The <em>Beach II </em>concurrence concludes at \u00b6 131 that a petitioner seeking relief under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, must \u201caffirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence, based on reliable new evidence....\u201d While this test may be well-suited to exonerating evidence that is scientific and absolute in nature, such as DNA, it is not workable in situations in which the newly discovered evidence is of a different type, such as perjured or new alibi evidence, a confession by a third-party, or \u2014 as here \u2014 recantation evidence. Powerful new evidence of this type could certainly establish that the defendant did not commit the crime of which he was convicted, but it will not, standing alone, \u201cunquestionably establish his innocence.\u201d Rather, as \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, commands, the new evidence must be \u201cproved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole.\u201d As Marble argues, if a petitioner is able to unquestionably establish his innocence through new evidence, there would be no reason to compare the new evidence to the proof of guilt at trial. Moreover, such a rigid test fails to take account of the above-noted provisions of the PCR statutes, which allow a district court to order briefing, further discovery, and/or a new trial. These statutory options allow a court to explore <em>whether </em>the petitioner can establish his innocence, and are inconsistent with the extraordinarily high standard set by the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. We accordingly conclude that the test announced in the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence, insofar as it requires a petitioner to \u201caffirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence, based upon reliable new evidence,\u201d is not suited to the quantum of proof required of a postconviction relief petitioner seeking relief under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and we repudiate \u00b6 131 of the concurrence. We hold therefore that the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law applying the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence to the denial of Marble\u2019s postconviction petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b633 The Dissent maintains that we err in refusing to apply the principles articulated in <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S. Ct. 851 (1995), as explained in Justice McKinnon\u2019s <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. We disagree. The <em>Beach II </em>concurrence instructs that a <em>Schlup </em>petitioner must allege the occurrence of a constitutional violation at his first trial coupled with the presentation of new evidence of innocence. <em>Beach II, </em>\u00b6 96. As illustrated in \u00b6 54 and the accompanying footnote of Justice McKinnon\u2019s Concurrence and Dissent, in each of our cases in which <em>Schlup </em>was invoked, the defendant alleged the occurrence of a constitutional error during his first trial, such as improper instructions to the jury or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Marble does not allege that a constitutional violation occurred at his first trial; therefore, <em>Schlup </em>is not applicable. We proceed to determine what test should be applied to Marble\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b634 <em>What test must a district court employ in reviewing a petition for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence and filed within one year of discovery of such evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b635 Section46-21-102(2), MCA, provides that an allegation that newly discovered evidence, \u201cif proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted\u201d may be raised in a postconviction petition. The statute merely allows the filing of the petition; it does not in any way define or circumscribe whether the proof must be made to the district court, whether the petitioner must meet a certain threshold before the court can consider expanding the proceedings to include a hearing or a new trial, or whether such proof must be made on retrial. As noted, the implementing provisions set forth at \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, likewise do not delineate how and to whom the proof must be made, and instead accord the court multiple options for how it may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b636 In construing a statute, it is incumbent upon the court to \u201cdeclare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted ... .\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The wide range of alternative proceedings set forth in \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, reflect a legislative intent to place the method of resolving a petition for postconviction relief in the hands of the district court. We therefore conclude that a district court presented with a postconviction petition based upon newly discovered evidence shall utilize the very test set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. It shall determine whether the \u201cnewly discovered evidence..., if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>criminal conduct\u201d for which he or she was convicted. In making this determination, a district court may seek guidance from our case law addressing various forms of newly discovered evidence, such as our precedent with respect to recantations, whether set forth in a case involving a motion for new trial or one addressing a PCR petition. <em>See, e.g., Clark </em>and <em>Crosby. </em>While we conclude herein that we erred in applying the fifth factor of the <em>Clark </em>new trial test to a PCR petition predicated upon newly discovered evidence, the first four factors of the <em>Clark </em>test <em>(see </em>\u00b6 21) also remain a viable resource when determining whether the newly discovered evidence should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b637 It will be up to the district court to determine within the options provided in \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, whether the proof and evidence will be weighed by the court itself, whether discovery and a hearing should be conducted, whether the matter should be remanded for a new trial, and even whether the defendant should be released on bail or discharged. And if the court finds for the prosecution, the petition may be dismissed. Section 46-21-201(4) through (6), MCA. On appeal, we will review the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law for correctness, and will review discretionary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 7. It will be incumbent upon the court \u2014 however it elects to conduct the postconviction proceedings \u2014 to issue an order setting forth the facts and legal rationale supporting its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b638  The statutory test we announce today does not run afoul of our postconviction relief precedent. This Court has reviewed on appeal literally hundreds of district court dispositions of petitions for postconviction relief, many by way of memorandum opinion. While we have on occasion reversed the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief and remanded for an evidentiary hearing <em>(see Heath, </em>\u00b6 27, in which we remanded for a hearing in view of the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d occasioned by an IAC claim involving trial counsel who had since died), we have by and large declined to dictate to the district court which of the many statutory alternatives it should utilize when considering the merits of a postconviction petition. The constant in our decisions is the requirement that a postconviction petition must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d Section46-21-104(lXc), MCA. We have held that \u201c[m]ere conclusory allegations are insufficient to support the petition.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 10. We have also reaffirmed the statutory right of the district court to dismiss a PCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>petition without ordering a response if the petition and records \u201cconclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief\u201d as stated in \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, and the court\u2019s right to dismiss a petition without holding a hearing if the petition fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Otherwise, a court is free to invoke any or all of the procedural tools at its disposal by virtue of the language of \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, when determining the disposition of a petition for postconviction relief predicated upon newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b639 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court erred in grounding its rejection of Marble\u2019s PCR petition upon the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. We conclude that a district court shall apply the statutory test set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, in determining the disposition of a timely filed petition for postconviction relief based upon newly discovered evidence, and shall do so in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-102(2) and -201, MCA, and this Opinion. Because the District Court erred in narrowly circumscribing the relief available to Marble premised upon the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence, we reverse and remand for reconsideration of Marble\u2019s petition under the standards announced herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b640 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, WHEAT and DISTRICT JUDGE HAYWORTH, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-11\"> As we have previously designated <em>Beach v.

However, because findings of fact have already been entered by the District Court, I would proceed to conduct the legal analysis and apply the new standard to those facts. Indeed, in his opening brief, Marble requests that this Court apply the legal standard to the facts, and reverse his conviction. Alternatively, Marble asks that we remand for application of the <em>Clark </em>test, as we did in <em>Clark. </em>However, as we explained there, remand was necessary for application of the new legal test only because of \u201cour inability to glean from the record the District Court\u2019s reasons for denying the motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 42. Here, we have no such deficit, as the District Court entered extensive findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of fact. As the State\u2019s counsel noted during oral argument, \u201cthe facts are the facts,\u201d and they will not change under application of a different legal standard. Since the facts are already determined in this case and we would ultimately review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness in any subsequent appeal, there is no legal reason requiring a remand for the District Court to apply the new standard in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b642 The following factual statements are all taken from the District Court\u2019s detailed findings. Thomas was a \u201ccredible and believable witness,\u201d both in the original trial and the post-conviction hearing. Thomas\u2019 sworn testimony in this matter, given over a period of 10 years from the original trial, to his deposition and through the postconviction proceeding, was consistent: Marble raped him in the shower as alleged in the Information. Thomas never varied from this account in his multiple statements given under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b643 Thomas was contacted by the Montana Innocence Project (MIP), who was representing Marble. When meeting with Thomas, MIP did not initially discuss Marble\u2019s case \u201cand it was not until later meetings that [MIP lawyer] Mansch even mentioned Marble.\u201d Thomas was willing to continue meeting with Mansch because Thomas believed MIP was going to help him with his own legal problems and that Mansch would help him get into the military. Mansch \u201cpressed hard\u201d for Thomas to recant his testimony against Marble. Thomas refused to sign an affidavit recanting his testimony that MDP prepared for his signature and refused to recant under oath during the entire time.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj1\">\u00b644 Mansch told Thomas that if he signed a recantation statement, then, in Thomas\u2019 words, \u201cit [would] probably be over with\u201d and \u201c[t]hey shouldn\u2019t need to hear from me again.\u201d Thomas was not advised of his rights to silence or to counsel. Thomas wrote out a short recantation and signed an unsworn recantation statement that had been prepared for him by MIP because he believed that by \u201cgiving Mansch what Mansch wanted,\u201d Thomas would obtain help for his own case and with getting into the military. He also signed it \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t believe me, kept calling back talking to me, calling me a liar when I told them the truth. So I just told them what they wanted to hear.... Badgered into it.\u201d Thomas had also been transferred to the same facility as Marble and been approached by a friend of Marble\u2019s about his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b645 Subsequently, under oath, both in his deposition and in the post-conviction hearing, Thomas acknowledged that his recantation statements given to MIP were false and were lies. Thomas believed he \u201cwould not get into any trouble\u201d for making a false statement if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>statement was not given under oath. Mansch\u2019s \u201cfocus on helping Marble\u201d kept Mansch from seeing that Thomas\u2019 recantation \u201cwas false and given as part of [Thomas\u2019] attempt to obtain the help of Mansch.\u201d \u00b646 \u201c[Significant evidence\u201d was introduced at Marble\u2019s trial to support the jury\u2019s decision that Marble was guilty. Marble was \u201cvery, very interested\u201d in taking the plea offer made by the prosecution before Marble\u2019s trial but he did not do so because of his father\u2019s strong feelings against Marble pleading guilty to an offense involving alleged homosexual behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b647 The only new evidence is Thomas\u2019 unsworn recantation. Although the recantation could be used in a new trial for Marble, the District Court concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence leading up to the signed recantation by [Thomas] is devastating\u201d to its value, including the \u201ccircumstances of persistence under which it was obtained, the narrow manner (not sworn) in which it was finally consented to be given and [Thomas\u2019] motive for making the recantation.\u201d The District Court determined that the recantation \u201cis not reliable evidence and does not raise a doubt about the guilt of Marble, either on its own or in light of the proof of Marble\u2019s guilt adduced at the time of Marble\u2019s trial.\u201d [Further, as Marble\u2019s counsel acknowledged during oral argument, the law requires that recantations are to be \u201cviewed with great suspicion.\u201d Clark, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b648 Applying the new legal standard, I would conclude that the factual record clearly demonstrates that the new evidence, that being Thomas\u2019 unsworn recantation, fails to \u201cestablish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 35; \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b401-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AhM\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"ABK\">\u00b649 It is difficult for me to know where to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b650 First, by \u201cannounc[ing]\u201d the \u201cstatutory test\u201d as the new test to be utilized by district courts presented with post-judgment claims of newly discovered evidence, Opinion, \u00b6 38, the Court has said nothing to assist the trial courts with their interpretation of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and has discarded valuable, well-established precedent that was properly understood and applied by the District Court. Second, although we specifically overrule <em>State v. Tyler, </em>2009 MT 75, 349 Mont. 461, 204 P.3d 685, <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753, and <em>Crosby v. State, </em>2006 MT 155, 332 Mont. 460, 139 P.3d 832, because those decisions applied the test articulated in <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099, to postconviction claims, Opinion, \u00b6 31, we then reinject <em>Clark </em>factors into the postconviction scenario by suggesting that a district court \u201cmay seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>guidance\u201d from <em>Clark </em>and <em>Crosby, </em>Opinion, \u00b6 36. Third, our analysis fails to adequately grasp significant considerations underlying claims of actual innocence, which the legislature sought to protect through its enactment of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and misconstrues the concurring opinion in <em>State v. Beach, </em>2013 MT 130, \u00b6\u00b6 81-139,370 Mont. 163, 302 P.3d 47 (McKinnon, J., with Baker, Rice, and Simonton, JJ., concurring) <em>{\u201cBeach II </em>concurrence\u201d). Fourth, our decision ignores our own clear precedent interpreting \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, established prior to this Court\u2019s misguided decisions of <em>Beach v. State, </em>2009 MT 398, 353 Mont. 411, 220 P.3d 667 <em>{\u201cBeach F), Tyler, DuBray, Crosby, </em>and <em>State v. Abe, </em>2001 MT 260, 307 Mont. 233, 37 P.3d 77. Fifth, by announcing a new, lesser burden for obtaining relief, we implicate serious concerns of fairness and equity regarding our resolution of prior claims, particularly those of Barry Beach. Sixth, we violate the well-established rule, indispensable to the administration of justice, that a question once deliberately examined and decided should be considered closed and settled as to further argument, and not subject to a different construction based upon a different composition of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b651 Perhaps the starting point for any discussion should be the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence. I wrote the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence to clarify the confusion in our law resulting from <em>Beach I, Tyler, DuBray, Crosby, </em>andA&amp;e. Nothing in the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence \u201crevised\u201d the standards for evaluating substantive and procedural innocence claims. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 20. Rather, the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence reaffirmed our prior clear and unmistakable adoption of <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S. Ct. 851 (1995), <em>Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 113 S. Ct. 853 (1993), and the corresponding analysis for evaluating post-judgment claims of newly discovered evidence. <em>Beach II </em>concurrence, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, 105, 119, 123; <em>see State v. Pope, </em>2003 MT 330, 318 Mont. 383, 80 P.3d 1232; <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, 294 Mont. 252, 980 P.2d 622. Moreover, in adopting <em>Schlup </em>and <em>Herrera </em>to guide our consideration of claims filed pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, we specifically expanded our reliance on federal jurisprudence and rejected the argument that our existing postconviction jurisprudence was sufficient for evaluation of actual innocence claims. <em>See Pope, </em>\u00b6 88 (Rice, J., dissenting). The Court now rejects a test that has been applied since 1999, finding it to be \u201crigid\u201d and \u201cnot suited to the quantum of proof required of a postconviction relief petitioner seeking relief under \u00a7 46-21-102(2).\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. Aside from the Court\u2019s failure to state what that \u201cquantum of proof\u201d is, it is my opinion that a higher burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>proof and a clear standard for evaluating post-judgment claims, whether characterized as \u201crigid\u201d or not, are necessary to protect the finality of judgments and to ensure consistent and fair evaluation of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b652 The distinctions articulated in Montana\u2019s case law between procedural and substantive claims of actual innocence, and the corresponding burdens of proof, are well-reasoned and should be maintained. Preliminarily, while a majority of this Court did indeed agree that \u201cthe petitioner must affirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence\u201d in order to prevail on a substantive claim of actual innocence, <em>Beach II </em>concurrence, \u00b6 131, we clearly stated that \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, also allowed for a procedural claim of actual innocence, pursuant to <em>Schlup, </em>which imposed a lesser burden on the petitioner for obtaining relief. We observed that the language in \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, requiring newly discovered evidence that \u201cwould establish\u201d that the petitioner did \u201cnot engage in the criminal conduct\u201d for which the petitioner was convicted, appeared to be a codification by the legislature, although \u201cperhaps not intentionally,\u201d of the substantive claim of actual innocence in <em>Herrera. Beach II </em>concurrence, \u00b6 131. However, nothing in the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence extinguished the ability to raise, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, a procedural claim of actual innocence under <em>Schlup. </em>Thus, the Court\u2019s conclusion that requiring the petitioner to \u201caffirmatively and unquestionably establish his innocence\u201d is an intolerably \u201crigid test\u201d misconstrues the analysis required by the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence, as it only considers the \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d standard applicable to a substantive claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b653 When first charged with a crime, a person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and may insist that his guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 398, 113 S. Ct. at 859. Once a defendant has been convicted of the offense with which he has been charged, he is no longer entitled to the presumption of innocence. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 399, 113 S. Ct. at 860. A presumption of guilt now attaches as a result of his conviction and strips him of many of the constitutional safeguards attendant to the presumption of innocence. Although convicted of a crime, a defendant may nevertheless mount a multitude of challenges to his conviction. One such challenge is a claim of newly discovered evidence filed pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA. Because the petitioner is no longer cloaked with the presumption of innocence, however, the existence of newly discovered evidence must be evaluated in light of the principles guiding our analysis of an alleged constitutional error. The distinctions drawn by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Supreme Court between substantive claims of actual innocence under <em>Herrera </em>and procedural claims of actual innocence under <em>Schlup </em>are logical and consistent with fundamental principles of criminal law. If a petitioner has received an error-free trial, his conviction should rightfully stand, unless he produces conclusive evidence of his actual innocence. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 417, 113 S. Ct. at 869. With developments in criminal investigation and forensic evidence, we have recognized that a petitioner could conceivably offer evidence definitively proving his actual innocence, irrespective of any constitutional error at his trial or sentencing. Such a substantive or \u201cfreestanding\u201d claim of actual innocence was recognized in <em>Herrera, Pope, </em>and <em>Redcrow, </em>although the showing necessary to establish such a claim was never defined. The Court stated only that it would be \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and that the showing would have to be \u201ctruly persuasive,\u201d because when a petitioner makes a substantive, freestanding claim of actual innocence, he is claiming that he is entitled to relief despite a constitutionally valid conviction. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 417, 113 S. Ct. at 869; <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 48; <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 33. Accordingly, a <em>Herrera </em>petitioner is entitled to complete exoneration of the charges because he has conclusively established his actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b654 A petitioner unable to conclusively establish a substantive, freestanding claim of actual innocence may nevertheless obtain postconviction review of an alleged constitutional error, if his newly discovered evidence is such that the court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial given the allegation of constitutional error. The constitutional error may be any that could normally be raised in a petition for postconviction relief, since successfully raising a \u201cgateway\u201d claim under <em>Schlup </em>entitles the petitioner to review of his constitutional error in a postconviction proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 49, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>adopted the <em>Schlup </em>analysis and confirmed that the threshold for a procedural claim of innocence is lower than <em>Herrera </em>and does not itself provide an independent basis for relief. Most importantly, <em>a Schlup </em>petitioner faces a lower threshold because he asserts constitutional error at trial, and his conviction is accordingly not entitled to the same degree of respect as one concededly free of the taint of constitutional error. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 315-16, 115 S. Ct. at 861. Therefore, a petitioner asserting both actual innocence and constitutional error has less of a burden than a petitioner who claims only actual innocence. While a petitioner making a <em>Herrera </em>claim must present evidence of actual innocence so strong that his sentence would be \u201c \u2018constitutionally intolerable\u2019 <em>even if </em>his conviction was a product of a fair trial,\u201d a petitioner making a procedural claim need only present evidence of innocence strong enough \u201cthat a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error....\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 316, 115 S. Ct. at 861 (emphasis in original). The <em>Schlup </em>actual innocence inquiry does not concern itself with the merits of the constitutional error, but is conducted from the perspective of whether, in light of the newly discovered evidence and if the constitutional error had not occurred, it is more likely than not that no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327-29, 115 S. Ct. at 867-68; <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 58; <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b655 The Court states, without proper analysis, that \u201cthere would be no reason to compare the new evidence to the proof of guilt at trial\u201d if a petitioner can \u201cunquestionably establish his innocence. \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. However, as the statute correctly recognizes, under either a substantive, freestanding claim or a procedural claim, the new evidence must always be compared to the evidence adduced at trial. More to the point, in <em>Herrera, </em>the Court evaluated Herrera\u2019s substantive, freestanding claim of actual innocence by considering the affidavits relied upon by Herrera in light of the evidence presented at trial by the prosecution. The <em>Herrera </em>court remarked that the affidavits were inconsistent with one another, the affiants were not subject to cross-examination, the individual identified as the guilty party was deceased, and, for the most part, the affidavits consisted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>hearsay. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 417-18, 113 S. Ct. at 869-70. The <em>Herrera </em>court further noted that at trial, the prosecution had produced two eyewitness statements and a written statement by Herrerahimself, all of which indicated he was the guilty party. After considering the newly discovered evidence in light of the evidence produced at trial, the court concluded that Herrera\u2019s showing of evidence fell far short of that required of a defendant convicted of a crime following a trial free of constitutional error. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 418-19, 113 S. Ct. at 870. Similarly, in <em>Pope, </em>pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, this Court considered Pope\u2019s newly discovered evidence in light of all the evidence produced at trial and concluded that Pope had established his procedural claim and was entitled to a postconviction proceeding to evaluate the alleged constitutional error. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The complete DNA report tends to deflate the State\u2019s evidence that Pope had intercourse with M. J. While it does not exclude the possibility that he had intercourse with M.J., he cannot be included as a sperm donor based upon the DNA results. The DNA results indicate the presence of a third unknown party. Streeter testified that the unknown party, whose presence is indicated by the DNA test, could have been the type A blood source that Long attributed to Pope. Moreover, in light of the DNA evidence, Long\u2019s testimony and blood type testing is inconclusive. The DNA evidence topples the State\u2019s theory presented to the jury: \u201cIf you find that there was a substance in the vaginal fluid and in the panties, that had drained into the panties, you are going to find that that - - of the blood testing was done, the only possible contributor for that is the defendant, Vance Pope.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 60. Thus, this Court is simply wrong when we state that \u201cthere would be no reason to compare the new evidence to the proof of guilt at trial.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. Certainly, newly discovered evidence for both a substantive, freestanding claim of actual innocence or a procedural claim of actual innocence must always be evaluated in the context of the evidence adduced at trial. This is the only way of determining the significance and relevance of the new evidence. When the Montana Legislature enacted \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, in 1997, <em>Schlup and Herrera </em>had already been decided. The statutory requirement that the newly discovered evidence be \u201cviewed in light of the evidence as a whole\u201d is a codification of <em>Schlup </em>and <em>Herrera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b656 In my opinion, the principles articulated in <em>Schlup, Herrera, Pope, </em>and <em>Redcrow </em>are sound and in harmony with the important public policy of ensuring finality of state court judgments, which serves both the State\u2019s goal of rehabilitating criminal defendants and the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>legitimate punitive interests. To upset these principles and to remove an analytical framework allowing consistent evaluation of newly discovered evidence \u2014 not only consistent among the various trial courts, but consistent with rules and presumptions inherent in our criminal law \u2014 is to unsettle the expectations of consistency and finality held by victims, petitioners, and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b657 We state we are announcing a new \u201cstatutory test\u201d and take comfort in the fact that we are only stating the rule as it has been written by the legislature. However, we have provided no guidance to the district courts and have again changed the rules in a complicated area of jurisprudence, despite attempts made by the <em>Beach II </em>concurrence to clarify those rules. We have failed to recognize consistent and well-reasoned Montana case law recognizing distinctions in claims, burdens of proof, and constitutional error regarding post-judgment claims of newly discovered evidence. We arguably have created issues concerning fairness and equity between those claims previously decided under the more \u201crigid\u201d test and those now to be decided under a test \u201csuited to the quantum of proof required of a postconviction relief petitioner\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. Finally, <em>Clark </em>considerations are inappropriate to a post-judgment claim of newly discovered evidence. While I agree <em>Tyler, DuBray, </em>and <em>Crosby </em>should be overruled to the extent that they applied <em>Clark </em>to post-judgment claims of newly discovered evidence, and concur in that portion of the Opinion, I would not simultaneously reinject <em>Clark </em>as \u201cguidance\u201d for the district courts in considering these claims. At the risk of being too brazen, this appears slightly inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b658 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> In <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 55, the constitutional error alleged was that the jury had been improperly instructed that Pope could be found guilty of sexual intercourse without consent with either A. J. or M. J., thus placing into question Pope\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict. Pope also alleged that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel denied him the right to a fair trial. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 55. These allegations of constitutional error were reviewed in a subsequent postconviction proceeding following this Court\u2019s decision that Pope presented sufficient evidence of his actual innocence to place in doubt the reliability of his conviction. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 70. <em>InRedcrow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-36, the constitutional error alleged was ineffective assistance of trial counsel and that her co-defendant was the real killer. This Court found that Redcrow had not demonstrated her actual innocence in light of her confession to law enforcement. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37. In <em>Schlup, </em>the constitutional claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>was that the ineffective assistance of counsel and the withholding of evidence by the prosecution denied him the full \u201cpanoply of protections afforded to criminal defendants by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 314, 115 S.
