We restate and address the issue on appeal as whether the District Court erred in denying Strong\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its determination that Strong\u2019s conduct could give rise to multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b63 In August 2012, Strong was charged with four counts of partner or family member assault against his wife, Jessica, and their minor child. Strong pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of partner or family member assault and one felony charge of partner or family member assault. He was incarcerated at the Dawson County Detention Center pending sentencing. On August 10, Jessica obtained an order of protection from the Glendive City Court, prohibiting all contact between Strong and Jessica, effective until August 10,2013. Strong did not oppose the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b64 On November 6, 2012, Strong called Jessica four times from the Dawson County Detention Center \u2014 at4:05 p.m., 7:01 p.m., 10:48 p.m., and 10:52 p.m. The Detention Center recorded the telephone calls, and Strong does not dispute that he made them. On November 8, Jessica requested that the order of protection be dismissed so that she could communicate with Strong about child support and their pending divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b65 On November 14, the State of Montana charged Strong with four counts of violating an order of protection in violation of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA The first two counts were charged as misdemeanors, and the third and fourth counts were charged as felonies. On February 25, 2013, Strong filed a motion to dismiss all four charges against him or, in the alternative, to dismiss three of the four charges as part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b66 On April 17, the District Court conducted a hearing on Strong\u2019s motion. During the hearing, Strong testified that he understood the order of protection to mean that he \u201ccould have no contact with [Jessica] in anyway, shape, or form, third party, anything.\u201d Strong also testified that he called Jessica after hearing from a mutual friend that Jessica was \u201cgoing to drop the protection order.\u201d Strong admitted that he did not receive a court order indicating that the order of protection was terminated before contacting Jessica. According to Strong, he called Jessica multiple times because they never completed their conversation, and each telephone call was a continuation of the same conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b67 On April 25, the District Court issued an order denying Strong\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court rejected Strong\u2019s \u201csame transaction\u201d argument, determining that Strong\u2019s four telephone calls did not meet one of the five exceptions to multiple charges for offenses that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>part of the same transaction. In reaching this conclusion, the court determined that, under \u00a7 45-5-626(1), MCA, \u201cthe offense of violating an order of protection is complete when the defendant, with knowledge of the order, violates any of its provisions,\u201d and it was within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to charge Strong with multiple offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b68 After the District Court denied his motion to dismiss, Strong entered into a plea agreement with the State, reserving his right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his motion. The State dropped the fourth count against Strong, and Strong pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts and one felony count of violating the August 10,2012 order of protection. Strong now appeals the District Court\u2019s ruling on his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b69 We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss. <em>State v. Zink, </em>2014 MT 48, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 102, 319 P.3d 596 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b610 Under \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, the State may charge multiple offenses \u201cif the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Section46-11-404(3), MCA, provides that the State \u201cis not required to elect between the different offenses set forth in the charging document, and the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged,\u201d unless the offenses charged meet one of five exceptions set forth in \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA. Relevant to Strong\u2019s argument, pursuant to \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(e), MCA, a defendant may not be convicted of more than one offense for conduct that is part of the same transaction if \u201cthe offense is defined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct and the defendant\u2019s course of conduct was interrupted, unless the law provides that the specific periods of the conduct constitute separate offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b611 The District Court determined that the four telephone calls constituted conduct that was part of the same transaction, but that the exception set forth under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(e), MCA, did not apply because the underlying statute was not defined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct. On appeal, the parties dispute whether Strong\u2019s telephone calls constitute conduct that is part of the same transaction and, assuming that they do, whether the calls meet the exception under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(e), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b612 \u201cSame transaction\u201d means \u201cconduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by... a common purpose or plan that results in the repeated commission of the same offense or effect upon the same person... .\"Section46-1-202(23), MCA. The State argues that Strong\u2019s conduct does not meet the definition of \u201csame transaction,\u201d relying on our decisions in <em>State v. Geren, </em>2012 MT 307, 367 Mont. 437, 291 P.3d 1144; <em>State v. Williams, </em>2010 MT 58, 355 Mont. 354, 228 P.2d 1127; and <em>State v. Goodenough, </em>2010 MT 247, 358 Mont. 219, 245 P.3d 14. Strong argues that he committed only one offense or, in the alternative, that the offenses were part of the same transaction and he could be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b613 Strong suggests that \u00a7 45-5-626(1), MCA, is ambiguous \u201cas to what exactly constitutes a complete offense,\u201d and analogizes to the offense of stalking, set forth in \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. He contends that, like stalking, the offense of violating an order of protection is of a continuous nature, particularly where the alleged conduct occurred over the course of the same day. In interpreting a statute, this Court must construe statutory language according to its plain meaning, if possible. <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, 14 P.3d 487. We do not \u201cinsert what has been omitted,\u201d or \u201comit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA Section 45-5-220(1), MCA, expressly uses the term \u201crepeatedly.\u201d By contrast, \u00a7 45-5-626(1), MCA, states that an order of protection is violated when a person violates <em>a </em>provision, which is a discrete \u2014 as opposed to continuous \u2014 act. Each telephone call was a violation of the order\u2019s no-contact provision and, therefore, each telephone call constituted a separate offense in violation of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA. Further, because the plain language of the statute dictates when an offense is complete, we need not consider Strong\u2019s argument regarding application of the rule of lenity. <em>See Dodson, </em>\u00b6 46 (\u201c[IJfthe [statutory] language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b614 Even if his calls were separate offenses, Strong argues that they were part of the same transaction, as defined in \u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b615 In <em>State v. Parks, </em>2013 MT 280, \u00b6 25, 372 Mont. 88, 310 P.3d 1088, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>a Montana Securities Act case, we held that a defendant\u2019s omissions of material fact during two separate telephone conversations that together gave rise to a victim\u2019s investment in the defendant\u2019s company constituted the same transaction. In <em>Parks, </em>as in this case, the State attempted to rely on <em>Goodenough, </em>which we distinguished because the charges in <em>Goodenough </em>established \u201cdistinct criminal events\u201d of sexual assault and \u201cinvolved multiple incidents occurring on different days over the alleged t\u00edme period.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Goodenough, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18). In <em>Goodenough, </em>we held that the Information\u2019s description of the offenses \u201cas a continuing course of conduct\u201d did not \u201ctransform those offenses\u201d into a single transaction. <em>Goodenough, </em>\u00b6 19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A24\">\u00b616 <em>Geren </em>likewise involved distinct instances of sexual abuse. We held there that different sexual acts with the same victim, even though they occurred on the same day, were separate transactions, and Geren could be convicted of both incest and attempted incest notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA. <em>Geren, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 50. By contrast, in <em>Williams, </em>we held that the defendant could not be convicted of sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault \u2014 a lesser included offense \u2014 where both charges resulted from a single attack on the victim. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 30. We noted that the outcome may have been different had the State charged an additional offense based on a second attempted attack of the victim during the same encounter. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b617 The definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d compels examination of the facts underlying the charged offenses, including the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotivat[ion] by... a common purpose or plant.]\u201d Section 46-1-202(23), MCA. In this case, Strong\u2019s conduct consisted of a series of calls to Jessica motivated by a common purpose of discussing their divorce and custody, resulting in his repeated commission of the offense of violation of an order of protection. Strong\u2019s conduct meets the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d This conclusion, however, does not mean that Strong could not be convicted of multiple offenses arising from this single transaction. \u201cSection 46-11-410, MCA, clearly provides that a defendant may be prosecuted for more than one offense arising from the \u2018same transaction,\u2019 tinless the charges are among those described in subsection (2) of that section.\u201d <em>Goodenough, </em>\u00b6 16. Because \u201csame transaction\u201d is defined as conduct \u201cresult[ing] in the repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>commission of the <em>same offense,\u201d </em>\u00a7 46-l-202(23)(b), MCA (emphasis added), the statutes clearly contemplate that a defendant may be convicted for each repeated commission of the same charged offense. \u00b618 Strong contends that he meets the exception set forth in \u00a7 46-11-410(2Xe), MCA, because his telephone calls each were \u201cpart of a single conversation that was an ongoing violation of the same no contact order,\u201d and that this \u201ccontinuing course of conduct was interrupted, and the underlying law does not expressly provide that specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b619 Though Strong argues that the calls \u201cwere part of the same ongoing conversation,\u201d the plain language of \u00a7 46-ll-410(2Xe), MCA, requires that the offense be \u201cdefined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct.\u201d Section 46-ll-410(2)(e), MCA. Under \u00a7 45-5-626(1), MCA, a person violates an order of protection when he or she, \u201cwith knowledge of the order, purposely or knowingly violates a provision\u201d of the order. Section 45-5-626, MCA, is not \u201cdefined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct\u201d under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(e), MCA. The order of protection required Strong to have no contact with Jessica. Strong testified that he had knowledge of the order and knew that it prohibited any and all contact with Jessica. Strong also said that he believed Jessica was going to ask the court to rescind the order, but he admitted to receiving no indication from the court that the order was rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b620 The Dissent argues that Strong may not be convicted of more than one count of violating his order of protection because \u201cone offense is included in the other,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 27 (citing \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA). Strong does not raise this argument on appeal and we decline to address it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b621 The Dissent also suggests that the penalties in \u00a7 45-5-626(3), MCA, are to be imposed upon successive, rather than simultaneous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>convictions. Dissent, \u00b6 28. But our precedent suggests otherwise. In <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, \u00b6 31, 313 Mont. 95, 60 P.3d 454, we held that a prosecutor did not err in charging a defendant simultaneously with two stacking offenses of stalking, the first a misdemeanor and the second a felony. We stated, \u201cWhether a person has committed a prior offense of stalking is a sentencing factor, not an element of the offense of stalking.\u201d <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 31. We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the second stalking charge should have been dismissed because there was no \u201cprior conviction\u201d upon which to base the felony charge. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 31. We noted that \u201c\u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, does not require that there be a prior \u2018conviction\u2019 before the offender receives a felony sentence. Rather, the statute refers to a \u2018second or subsequent offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 33 (emphasis in original). Section 45-5-626(3), MCA, uses similar language.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b622 Similarly, in <em>Blakely v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2008 Mont. Lexis 743, at *4 (Nov. 26, 2008), we declined to exercise supervisory control where a defendant was charged with two misdemeanor and five felony counts of indecent exposure in violation of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA, where the felony counts were predicated upon the misdemeanors charged simultaneously. We stated that a stacking provision, making the third or subsequent conviction a felony, \u201csets out the framework that a sentencing court must use when determining the proper sentence for a [defendant] who has been found guilty of one or more counts of indecent exposure,\u201d and \u201cdoes not preclude a prosecutor from charging the misdemeanor counts as a predicate for the felony counts in the same information.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>2008 Mont. LEXIS 743, at *4. We did not draw significance from the indecent exposure statute\u2019s language calling for enhanced penalties on \u201ca third or subsequent conviction.\u201d Rather, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Although Blakely contends that the use of the word \u2018conviction\u2019 in \u00a7 45-5-504(2)(c), MCA, distinguishes his case from our holdings in <em>Tichenor </em>and <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Dasen </em>[2007 MT 87, 337 Mont. 74, 155 P.3d 1282], we find no limiting language in the statute that precludes the state from charging Blakely with felony indecent exposure. In the event Blakely is convicted of more than two indecent exposure charges, then the District [c]ourt can properly sentence Blakely for the felony chargest.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Blakely, </em>2008 Mont. LEXIS 743, at *5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b623  Strong cites dicta in <em>State v. Lindseth, </em>203 Mont. 115, 117, 659 P.2d 844, 846 (1983), warning of potential double-jeopardy issues with charging multiple counts. He argues that, as a matter of public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>he should not be charged with multiple, stacking offenses due solely to his use of a telephone rather than in-person contact. Strong placed four separate calls. Although he attempts to analogize his conduct to being \u201cin the physical presence of the alleged victim for the entire day\u201d and continuously speaking with her, a better analogy would be Strong knocking on Jessica\u2019s door, talking to her, leaving, and repeating the same action three more times. Ultimately, \u201c[c]harging decisions are generally within the prosecutor\u2019s exclusive domain, and the separation of powers [doctrine] mandates judicial respect for the prosecutor\u2019s independence.\u201d <em>State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, \u00b6 46, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229 (quoting <em>United States v. Carrasco, </em>786 F.2d 1452, 1455 (9th Cir. 1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (changes in original). Accordingly, we afford prosecutors \u201cbroad discretion to determine whether to prosecute an offender and what offense to charge.\u201d <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted). In this case, the prosecutor acted within her discretion in charging Strong with four counts of violating the August 10,2012 order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b624 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Strong\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> Although, in his opening brief, Strong appears to raise a constitutional argument regarding double jeopardy, his reply brief clarifies that his \u201cargument is statutory and concerns only the fact that he was wrongfully charged with multiple instances of conduct arising out of the same transaction\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 46-1-202(23) and 46-11-410, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-5\"> We also concluded that, even if his conduct was all part of the same transaction, Goodenough could be convicted of multiple offenses under the express language of \u00a7 46-11-410(1), MCA. <em>Goodenough, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> In bis opening brief, Strong states that, because bis \u201calleged conduct meets the definition of \u2018same transaction,\u2019 the prosecution could not charge him with multiple offenses.\u201d That argument is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 46-11-404 and 46-11-410, MCA, which specifically allow multiple charges for conduct that is part of the same transaction, unless the offense meets one of five exceptions. In his reply brief, Strong clarifies that he actually is arguing that he falls under one of the exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"><em> </em>We note, however, that the definition of \u201cincluded offense\u201d is not the same as the definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA. The District Court analyzed the telephone calls under the elements of \u201cincluded offense\u201d and determined that Strong could have been found guilty or not guilty on any or all of the charged offenses, as each involved a separate act. <em>See Goodenough, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b498-8\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b625 I dissent. I would conclude that Strong\u2019s conviction of two misdemeanors and a felony for the repeated commission of one offense violates the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction,\u201d as well as the spirit and intent of \u00a7 45-5-626(3), MCA. I would remand with instructions to vacate all but one misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b626 The Court concludes at \u00b6 17 that \u201cStrong\u2019s conduct meets the statutory definition of \u2018same transaction.\u2019 \u201d Section 46-l-202(23)(b), MCA, defines \u201csame transaction\u201d as \u201cconduct consisting of <em>a series of acts or omissions </em>that are motivated by... a common purpose or plan <em>that results in the repeated commission of the same offense </em>... .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by definition, the singular term \u201csame transaction\u201d encompasses the repeated commission of one offense. Strong repeated the commission of one offense when he made four telephone calls within minutes of each other during the same evening.</p>\n<p id=\"AkJ\">\u00b627 The Court concludes at \u00b6 19 that because \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, \u201cis not \u2018defined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct\u2019 under \u00a7 46-11-410(2Xe), MCA,\u201d Strong was properly charged. However, this conclusion cannot be squared with the Court\u2019s explicit finding that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>conduct constitutes \u201cthe same transaction,\u201d which by definition incorporates the repeated commission of the same offense. Under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2Xe), MCA, a defendant may not be convicted of more than one offense if \u201cthe offense is defined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct\u201d which a \u201csame transaction\u201d offense plainly does. Moreover, a defendant may not be convicted of more than one offense if \u201cone offense is included in the other\u201d (\u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA), which is the case here \u2014 again, because of the definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d The various statutes here in play cannot be reconciled as neatly as the Court professes to do. \u201c[A]mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S. Ct. 1056, 1059 (1971) (internal citation omitted). \u201c[W]here there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Goodwin, </em>249 Mont. 1, 23-24, 813 P.2d 953, 967 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b628 Second, in upholding Strong\u2019s conviction of two misdemeanors and a felony, we ignore the spirit and intent of \u00a7 45-5-626(3), MCA. This provision of the statute outlines the penalties associated with conviction of an order of protection for a \u201cfirst offense,\u201d and then proceeds to describe the increased punishment for \u201cconviction for a second offense,\u201d and \u201cconviction for a third or subsequent offense.\u201d The manner in which the statute is constructed \u2014 separating one conviction from another \u2014 clearly suggests that the penalties are to be imposed upon successive convictions for second offenses and not simultaneous convictions arising out of \u201cthe same transaction\u201d as here. We err in ignoring the evident intent of this statutory language. Respectfully, <em>Tichenor </em>is of no assistance to the Court because, while the two stalking offenses in that case were charged simultaneously, the conduct supporting the two offenses occurred over two wholly separate time frames. One count of stalking was charged for 69 phone calls over five days, and the second felony count arose from 50 phone calls that took place over a five-day period a week later and after the defendant had been arrested. These offenses plainly did not arise out of \u201cthe same transaction.\u201d As the Court observed, Tichenor\u2019s conduct \u201cwas broken not merely by... arrest... but also by time... and by the intensity of the conduct\u201d that occurred after the defendant\u2019s intervening arrest. <em>Tichenor, </em>\u00b6 49. Thus, the second stalking charge in <em>Tichenor </em>genuinely arose out of a \u201csecond offense\u201d and second transaction, which is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b629 Finally, though the Court is correct that prosecutors have broad discretion to determine whether and to what extent to prosecute an offender (Opinion, \u00b6 22), this prosecution and Strong\u2019s conviction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>felony was overzealous. The facts here are undisputed: The phone calls occurred on November 6, 2012, after Strong was told by a mutual friend that Jessica intended to drop the order of protection, and indeed she did so two days later because she sought communication with Strong concerning child support and their pending divorce, the very subject of their telephone discussions of November 6. Unlike the situation in <em>Tichenor, </em>the victim here did not seek Strong\u2019s prosecution; rather, the charges were brought because the calls had been recorded at the detention center. Unlike the situation in <em>Tichenor, </em>this victim was neither harmed nor offended by Strong\u2019s phone calls. A conviction of multiple misdemeanors and a felony under these circumstances is in my judgment wholly unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-5\">JUSTICE McIQNNON joins the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
