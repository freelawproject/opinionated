The Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, dismissed Harrington\u2019s suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Harrington appeals. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly considered evidence outside the pleadings in disposing of Energy West's M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court correctly dismissed Harrington's suit.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcC\">\u00b62 We affirm the District Court\u2019s resolution of facts and its determination that Ohio law applies to Harrington\u2019s contract claims, but we vacate its dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b63 Energy West is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Montana. It is a corporate subsidiary of Gas Natural, Inc. Gas Natural is an Ohio corporation with corporate offices in Ohio and Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b64 In February 2011, either Energy West or Gas Natural \u2014 the parties dispute which \u2014 hired Harrington as a corporate controller. While he held this position, Harrington resided and worked primarily in Ohio. Harrington provided services to Gas Natural\u2019s several corporate subsidiaries, including Energy West, and he made four business trips to Montana over the course of eighteen months. Energy West\u2019s human resources department manages payroll and benefits for employees of Gas Natural and some of its subsidiaries. Energy West issued Harrington\u2019s paychecks and Energy West paid Harrington\u2019s payroll taxes, withholdings, and insurance premiums to the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b65 Harrington\u2019s employment at Gas Natural\u2019s Ohio office was terminated in October 2012. Harrington applied for and received unemployment benefits through the State of Ohio. In February 2013, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Harrington filed suit against Energy West in Montana\u2019s Eighth Judicial District Court, alleging wrongful discharge under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), \u00a7 39-2-904(lXb), MCA; negligent infliction of emotional distress; and defamation. Energy West moved under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Harrington opposed the motion, requested a hearing, and requested limited discovery on issues related to Energy West\u2019s motion. The District Court permitted limited discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b66 On July 1, 2014, the District Court held a non-evidentiary, oral argument hearing on the motion. The court ruled from the bench, granting Energy West\u2019s motion and dismissing the action. The court relied primarily on <em>Burchett v. Mastec N. Am., </em>Inc., 2004 MT 177, 322 Mont. 93, 93 P.3d 1247, in analyzing subject-matter jurisdiction under Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 187 and 188 (1971). The court determined that Ohio law governs Harrington\u2019s claims. The court then dismissed Harrington\u2019s action, holding that, because Ohio law governs, it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, that the exercise of jurisdiction was not appropriate in Montana. The District Court entered a written order that same day dismissing the action \u201cdue to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and/or that the State of Ohio is the appropriate forum for exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction in this case.\u201d Harrington appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b67 We review a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>In re Marriage of Sampley, </em>2015 MT 121, \u00b6 6, 379 Mont. 131, 347 P.3d 1281. We also review de novo a district court\u2019s conflict-of-laws determination of the law that will govern a case. <em>Masters Grp. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Comerica Bank, </em>2015 MT 192, \u00b6 33, 380 Mont. 1, 352 P.3d 1101. We affirm a district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>Stewart v. Rice, </em>2013 MT 55, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 203, 296 P.3d 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly considered evidence outside the pleadings in disposing of Energy West\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b69 When presented with a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, if the plaintiffs complaint fails to \u201cstate[] facts that, if true, would vest the cotut with subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d a court may dismiss based on the complaint alone. <em>Gen. Constructors, Inc. v. Chewculator, </em>Inc., 2001 MT 54, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 39, 304 Mont. 319, 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>P.3d 604, <em>overruled on other grounds by Big Spring v. </em>Conway, 2011 MT 109, \u00b6 45, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121. A court also has discretion to receive evidence of facts bearing on the M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion and determine that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction based on that evidence. <em>See Sampley, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b610 Harrington appears to argue that, in resolving Energy West\u2019s motion, the District Court improperly determined factual issues. To the extent that Harrington is arguing that the District Court could not rely on the affidavits and documents submitted by the parties to resolve the M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion, he is mistaken. <em>See Sampley, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>TC Fuel Components, LLC v. Mont. Eleventh Judicial </em>Dist. <em>Court, </em>S. Ct. No. OP 13-0798, 374 Mont. 540, 346 P.3d 363 (Table) (Jan. 21,2014) (\u201cM. R. Civ. P. 12(d) makes clear that matters outside the pleadings can be considered on a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>c.f. Knoepke v. Sw. Ry. Co., </em>190 Mont. 238, 244, 620 P.2d 1185, 1188 (1980) (concluding that a court may rely on affidavits to resolve a personal jurisdiction issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b611 Harrington also argues that the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing before ruling on Energy West\u2019s motion. Harrington fails to cite any authority in support of his argument. Although it is \u201cnot this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal,\u201d <em>Cutler v. Jim Gilman Excavating, Inc., </em>2003 MT 314, \u00b6 22, 318 Mont. 255, 80 P.3d 1203 (citation omitted), we will address Harrington\u2019s argument briefly. Whether to hold a hearing \u201cis a matter left to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Sampley, </em>\u00b6 9. We accordingly review a district court\u2019s decision not to hold a hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sampley, </em>\u00b6 9. Two factors that counsel in favor of an evidentiary hearing are whether the court must resolve a dispute of material fact or weigh the credibility of witnesses. <em>Sampley, </em>\u00b6 12. Here, the parties vigorously dispute whether Harrington\u2019s employer was Energy West or Gas Natural. This dispute is not material to determinations bearing on the resolution of Energy West\u2019s motion. Rather, as explained in \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, the material facts concern the place where Harrington entered into his employment agreement and performed his employment. There is no dispute about these material facts. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b612 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly dismissed Harrington\u2019s suit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b613 Subject-matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>adjudicate a particular type of controversy. <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch Co., </em>2004 MT 132, \u00b6 31, 321 Mont. 338, 92 P.3d 1160. Montana courts derive subject-matter jurisdiction from constitutional and statutory authority. <em>LaPlante v. Town Pump, Inc., </em>2012 MT 63, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 323, 274 P.3d 724. The Montana Constitution provides that a Montana district court has, without limitation, subject-matter jurisdiction in \u201call civil matters.\u201d Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 4; <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 56, 172 P.3d 1232. The Montana Constitution also provides that the United States Congress and the Montana Legislature may delegate additional subject-matter jurisdiction to Montana district courts. Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b614 As mentioned, the District Court based its dismissal on <em>Burchett. </em>In <em>Burchett, </em>a district court dismissed the plaintiffs WDEA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 1. On appeal, this Court addressed two questions: whether the district court erred by determining that Montana law did not apply to Burchett\u2019s claim, and whether the district court erred when it dismissed Burchett\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-4. To resolve the first issue, the Court conducted a conflict-of-laws analysis under Montana law and Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 187 and 188, and determined that Montana law should apply to Burchett\u2019s suit. <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 31. The Court then addressed the second issue and held that the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction because \u201cit naturally follows that Montana courts have subject matter jurisdiction in a case involving a Montana resident when Montana law applies.\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b615 The dissent in <em>Burchett </em>argued that the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Burchett could avail himself of an Indiana law that would have provided him a remedy for wrongful discharge. <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 38 (Gray, C. J., dissenting). The WDEA provides a cause of action as long as a discharge is not \u201csubject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute.\u201d Section 39-2-912(1), MCA. Thus, according to the dissent, a district court \u201cdoes not have subject matter jurisdiction over a wrongful discharge claim where other state or federal legislation provides a procedure for resolving the claim.\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 37 (Gray, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b616 Here, the District Court concluded from the dissenting and majority opinions in <em>Burchett </em>that, if it \u201cnaturally follows that Montana courts have subject matter jurisdiction in a case involving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Montana resident when Montana law applies,\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 33, then a Montana court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction in a case involving a non-resident when Montana law does not govern. Pursuant to the <em>Burchett </em>dissent, the District Court first examined whether Ohio offers a statutory procedure and remedy for Harrington to contest his dismissal. After concluding that Ohio does not, the District Court, pursuant to the <em>Burchett </em>majority, engaged in a conflict-of-laws analysis and determined that Ohio law should apply. The District Court then dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>Conflict of Laws</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b617 Harrington\u2019s complaint alleges that his termination violated the WDEA because it was without good cause. Although Harrington did not have a written employment agreement, the relationship between employer and employee is a contractual one. \u201cThere cannot be any serious dispute that there is a bargain of some kind; otherwise, the employee would not be working.\u201d 1 Henry H. Perritt, Jr., <em>Employee Dismissal Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4.32, 326 (3d ed. 1992) (emphasis removed). The WDEA effectively implies an employment contract requiring good cause to terminate where there is no express contract. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-2-904(l)(b), -912(2), MCA. Because Harrington\u2019s WDEA cause of action is contractual in nature, contract conflict-of-laws rules apply. <em>See Burchett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b618 We apply \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, to determine the law that will govern a contract claim if the parties to the contract did not previously choose the law that will govern their affairs. <em>Tidyman\u2019s Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Davis, </em>2014 MT 205, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 376 Mont. 80, 330 P.3d 1139; <em>see also Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703. Section 28-3-102, MCA, states, \u201cA contract is to be interpreted according to the law and the usage of the place where it is to be performed or, if it does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and the usage of the place where it is made.\u201d If the parties have effectively chosen the law that will govern their affairs, we apply the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187. <em>Tidyman\u2019s, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19; <em>see also Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b619 The parties have not submitted into the record a contract that purports to regulate their affairs. Accordingly, no basis exists for determining that the parties chose the lawto govern their relationship. Energy West argues that the parties implicitly chose Ohio law to regulate their affairs by paying taxes and premiums in that state. We discussed similar evidence when analyzing choice of law under \u00a7 187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>in <em>Burchett. See Burchett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17. However, we conducted a \u00a7 188 analysis as well to determine that, under either \u00a7\u00a7 187 or 188, Montana law governed. <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b620 Notwithstanding the discussion of \u00a7 187 in <em>Burchett, </em>\u00a7 187 does not lend support for inferring an effective choice of law simply through the conduct of the parties. The section instead contemplates inferring a choice of law through provisions of a contract that imply that a certain state\u2019s laws will apply. Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 cmt. a. But \u00a7 187 \u201cis inapplicable unless it can be established that the parties have chosen the state of applicable law,\u201d and \u201cit does not suffice to demonstrate that the parties, if they had thought about the matter, would have wished to have the law of a particular state applied.\u201d Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 cmt. a. Without a contract to examine, or even an alleged verbal agreement on choice of law, \u00a7 187 does not apply to determine the law that governs Harrington\u2019s contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b621  We accordingly turn to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, to determine the law that governs. The District Court found that Harrington\u2019s office was in Ohio, his supervisor was in Ohio, and though he traveled to the locations of Gas Natural\u2019s subsidiaries, and held frequent phone meetings with Energy West\u2019s Montana staff, Harrington performed the majority of his duties in his Ohio office. As noted, however, there is no written contract designating the place of Harrington\u2019s performance. Thus, under \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, we also examine where the contract was made. As the District Court determined, the record shows that Harrington\u2019s employment agreement was made in Ohio between Harrington and Gas Natural employees. This conclusion comes despite Harrington\u2019s communications withEnergyWest human resources staff in Montana <em>after </em>his hiring. Although the District Court conducted its analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 187 and 188 instead of \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, it correctly determined that Ohio law governs Harrington\u2019s contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b622 Because Ohio law governs the alleged parties\u2019 employer-employee relationship, it is beside the point whether Harrington could state a WDEA claim because Ohio lacks a statute providing Harrington a wrongful termination remedy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-2-912, MCA. If Ohio law governs Harrington\u2019s wrongful termination claims, then Harrington cannot rely on a Montana statute for those claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\n<em>Subject-Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b623 After correctly concluding that Ohio law governs Harrington\u2019s employment claims, the District Court dismissed Harrington\u2019s suit because, under its reading of <em>Burchett, </em>the law that governs a case bears \u201cdirectly on the exercise or appropriate exercise of... general subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Burchett, </em>the Court separately addressed whether Montana law applied and whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court stated in simple terms that the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over a case \u201cinvolving a Montana resident when Montana law applies.\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 33. As Montana district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction \u201cin all civil matters,\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4, the Court was surely correct in making this determination. But the District Court, though expressing skepticism about Burchett's reasoning, interpreted it to mean that, if a Montana district court has subject-matter jurisdiction because Montana law governs a dispute, <em>see Burchett, </em>\u00b6 33, then the converse also is true, and a Montana district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction where Montana law does not govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b624  That Montana law does not govern does not mean that a Montana district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Contra Burchett, </em>\u00b6 37 (Gray, C. J., dissenting). Article VH, section 4 of the Montana Constitution provides district courts with subject-matter jurisdiction in all civil matters, without limitation. This Court was once \u201cprofligate\u201d in its use of the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d <em>DeShields v. State, </em>2006 MT 58, \u00b6 10,331 Mont. 329, 132 P.3d 540, but in recent years we have recognized the misuse of the term and attempted to correct our jurisprudence. <em>See Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (distinguishing the power to consider certain evidence from subject-matter jurisdiction); <em>Balias, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-16 (distinguishing standing from subject-matter jurisdiction); <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 43-46, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121 (distinguishing \u201ccategorical time prescriptions\u201d from subject-matter jurisdiction); <em>DeShields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (distinguishing a district court\u2019s \u201cstatutory error in imposing a sentence\u201d from subject-matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b625  We likewise take this opportunity to distinguish conflict-of-laws analysis from subject-matter jurisdiction. Conflict-of-laws analysis determines which jurisdiction\u2019s laws apply in a particular case, not whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 1 cmt. c. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, \u201ca State may not decline to entertain a suit in its courts for the sole reason that the suit is based on a sister State cause of action.\u201d Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 84 cmt. i (citing <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United Air Lines, Inc,, </em>342 U.S. 396, 397-98, 72 S. Ct. 421, <em>422 (1952); Hughes v. Fetter, </em>341 U.S. 609, 613, 71 S. Ct. 980, 983 (1951)). <em>Burchett </em>does not stand for the contrary. The District Court was incorrect to conclude that the application of Ohio law requires dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>Alternative ground</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b626 In its written order dismissing Harrington\u2019s case, the District Court stated that the case was dismissed \u201cdue to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and/or that the State of Ohio is the appropriate forum for exercise of subject matter-jurisdiction in this case.\u201d The District Court appears to refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens as the alternative ground for dismissal. Forum non conveniens permits a court to dismiss a case \"when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere,\u201d including another state, <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Ninth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2014 MT 191, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24, 376 Mont. 517, 329 P.3d 1264 (quoting <em>Haug v. Burlington N. R.R., </em>236 Mont. 368, 374, 770 P.2d 517, 521 (1989)), taking into account \u201cthe convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice,\u201d <em>San Diego, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting \u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b627 We have interpreted the Montana Constitution as expressing an \u201copen court policy\u201d in its instruction that \u201c[c]ourts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury to person, property, or character.\u201d <em>Labella v. Burlington N., Inc., </em>182 Mont. 202, 207, 595 P.3d 1184, 1187 (1979) (quoting Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 16). This policy comports with the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws instruction that the two most important factors in a forum non conveniens analysis are \u201c(1) that since it is for the plaintiff to choose the place of suit, his choice of a forum should not be disturbed except for weighty reasons, and (2) that the action will not be dismissed unless a suitable alternative forum is available to the plaintiff.\u201d Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 84 cmt. c. We recently dismissed a case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens when the prospect of a \u201cmirror image trialD\u201d in another state with personal jurisdiction over the parties raised the \u201cpossibility of conflicting results, multiple actions, and duplicate trials.\u201d <em>San Diego, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25. \u00b628 Based on the record on appeal, we cannot determine whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>alternative forum is available for Harrington\u2019s claims. Ohio seems the natural location for this litigation, but for an Ohio court to hear this case it would have to have personal jurisdiction over Energy West. The parties have not argued whether there are obstacles to jurisdiction in Ohio, but Energy West is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Montana, and Energy West has not stated whether it would consent to personal jurisdiction in Ohio.
