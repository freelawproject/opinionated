Whether Timothy can allege violations of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct in this appeal.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">\u00b63 A.M.M. was bom in 1922 and is the mother of eight adult children: William, Thomas, Paul Jr., Miriam, Genet, Timothy, Kathleen, and Sheila. A.M.M.\u2019s husband and the father of her children, Paul Sr., passed away in June 2013. Paid Sr.\u2019s estate includes considerable assets and ownership interests in several corporations. The estate is currently being probated in Lake County.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">\u00b64 On January 13,2014, Timothy filed a petition for temporary and permanent guardianship and conservatorship of A.M.M. His petition explained that he had cared for both A.M.M. and his late father starting in 2007 when his parents moved to Poison. Timothy\u2019s petition requested that he be appointed A.M.M.\u2019s sole guardian and conservator. Timothy filed an affidavit from A.M.M., dated January 14, 2014, which stated that A.M.M. wished for Timothy \u201cto take care of me &amp; manage my affairs and my finances.\u201d On January 13, 2014, Paid Jr., Sheila, and William also filed a petition for determination of incapacity and request for appointment of temporary guardians and conservators. The second petition specifically noted that A.M.M. suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s type dementia. The petition included a psychological evaluation dated December 13,2013, which concluded that \u201cif left alone, [A.M.M.] would not be able to function independently,\u201d and that she \u201cshould be closely monitored and supervised.\u201d The evaluating psychologist also concluded that A.M.M. did not have the capacity to understand the process of probating her late husband\u2019s estate \u201cto the extent necessary for making decisions in her best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">\u00b65 The District Court consolidated the two petitions and on January 15, 2014, issued a temporary order, and appointed the Office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>State Public Defender (OPD) to represent A.M.M. \u201cunless she hires private counsel of her own choice.\u201d Ronn Larsen, an Adult Protection Specialist with the Department of Public Health and Human Services, was appointed temporary guardian and conservator of A.M.M. for six months or until further court order. On February 6,2014, the District Court appointed attorney Casey Emerson as visitor or Mend of A.M.M., and attorney Steven Eschenbacher of OPD to serve as AM.M.\u2019s attorney until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b66 A hearing to determine the need for guardians and conservators of A.M.M. was initially scheduled for February 19,2014. On February 13,2014, Paul Jr., Sheila, and William filed for a continuance, stating that A.M.M.\u2019s children and relatives needed additional time to travel to Poison for the hearing. The District Court reset the hearing for March 5,2014. On March 3,2014, Timothy filed a notice of removal of his two attorneys with the District Court. On March 5,2014, Paul Jr., Sheila, and William filed an objection to any possible continuance that Timothy may seek due to his removal of his attorneys. Trial on the issue of A.M.M.\u2019s incapacity was held, as scheduled, on March 5-6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b67 On March 14,2014, the District Court issued detailed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment which found that AM.M. is an incapacitated person as defined by \u00a7 72-5-101(1), MCA. The District Court found that A.M.M. had been incapacitated since at least December 2013, when the psychological evaluation was performed, and found that AM.M. \u201clacked capacity to enter into legally-enforceable contracts since at least December 13, 2013.\u201d The court appointed Poison attorney Casey Emerson as guardian and appointed Paul Jr., Timothy, and Poison attorney Douglas J. Wold as joint conservators. The court ordered that any actions taken as conservators required a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b68 On April 11,2014, Timothy, acting pro se, filed a motion to vacate the court\u2019s March 14,2014 order and grant a new trial, arguing among other claims that A.M.M.\u2019s due-process rights were violated, that various temporary and permanent appointments were void, and that the District Court failed to follow the statutory procedures for guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. After being granted an extension, Wold answered Timothy\u2019s motion on May 2,2014, on behalf of himself, joint conservator Paul Jr., and guardian Emerson. Timothy filed a reply brief with the District Court on May 19,2014. Timothy did not serve his reply brief until May 21,2014, however, and the District Court issued an order striking Timothy\u2019s reply for untimely service. On June 9,2014, the District Court denied Timothy\u2019s motion to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>March 14,2014 order on A.M.M.\u2019s incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b69 On June 12, 2014, Wold petitioned the District Court for a declaratory judgment on the joint conservator\u2019s authority to act on behalf of A.M.M. in her roles as a director and signatory of several corporations. The District Court ordered that the joint conservators of A.M.M.\u2019s estate \u201care not legally entitled to act in her place as a director of any corporation in which\u201d A.M.M served as an elected and acting member of the board of directors, and \u201care not legally entitled to act in her place as a signatory for any corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b610 On June 12,2014, Wold filed a petition for attorney fees with the District Court, stating that Timothy refused to pay Wold\u2019s bills. The March 14,2014 order stated that \u201cCasey Emerson and Douglas J. Wold shall be compensated at their usual hourly rates, as [A.M.M.]\u2019s assets are sufficient therefor.\u201d Wold filed a second petition for attorney fees on June 20,2014, and a third petition for attorney fees on July 8,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">\u00b611 On July 9 and 11, 2014, the District Court held a hearing on Wold\u2019s first petition for attorney fees. The District Court granted Wold\u2019s petition for attorney fees to be paid by the conservators, and granted Wold\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Timothy. The order required Timothy to personally pay Wold\u2019s attorney fees incurred for the hearing preparation. The order found that Timothy breached his fiduciary duty as A.M.M.\u2019s conservator by bringing an \u201cunnecessary proceeding\u201d challenging Wold\u2019s fees, and required Timothy to personally pay guardian Emerson\u2019s attorney fees for her work preparing for the July hearing. The court also modified the March 14, 2014 order to allow one conservator, either Paul Jr. or Timothy, to approve any future bill from Wold. Emerson filed a statement for charges incurred, and the District Court awarded attorney fees to Emerson for her work preparing for the July 9 and 11,2014 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">\u00b612 The District Court held a second hearing on attorney fees on August29,2014, on Wold\u2019s second and third petitions for fees. Timothy did not appear at the hearing. Instead, he merely filed a \u201cNotice of Objection to the Hearing\u201d with the District Court shortly before the hearing and then left the courthouse. The District Court granted Wold\u2019s second and third petitions, to be paid by the conservators. The District Court again ordered Timothy to personally pay both Wold and Emerson the reasonable costs for their preparation for the August 29, 2014 hearing as a Rule 11 sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b613 Timothy appeals the March 14,2014 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment declaring A.M.M. incapacitated, the June 9, 2014 denial of his motion to vacate, and other District Court orders discussed in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b614 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re J.R., </em>2011 MT 62, \u00b6 17, 360 Mont. 30, 252 P.3d 163. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if substantial evidence does not support it, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or, if after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a firm conviction that a mistake has been <em>made.\u201dRedies v. </em>Cosner, 2002 MT 86, \u00b6 11, 309 Mont. 315, 48 P.3d 697. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether that court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>In re J.R., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial made pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59 on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326. The decision to grant or deny a new trial will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 16. The abuse of discretion must be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b616 Subject to statutory restrictions, the selection of the person to be appointed guardian is committed largely to the discretion of the trial court, and this Court will only interfere with such an appointment in the case of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re Guardianship of Nelson, </em>204 Mont. 90, 94, 663 P.2d 316, 318 (1983). The choice of a conservator is also subject to statutory restrictions, and reviewed by this Court for an abuse of discretion. <em>See In re J.A.L., </em>2014 MT 196, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 18, 329 P.3d 1273 (reviewing the district court\u2019s choice of a guardian/conservator for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b617 Under our conservatorship statutes, \u201ctrial courts and conservators are granted broad discretionary powers\u201d in estate administration. <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cThe standard of review for discretionary trial court rulings is abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Johnson, </em>2011 MT 255, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 236, 262 P.3d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re J.R., </em>\u00b6 77. \u201cA district court has abused its discretion if its award of attorney fees is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Harkin, </em>2000 MT 105, \u00b6 70, 299 Mont. 298, 999 P.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">\u00b619 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Timothy\u2019s motion to vacate the Court\u2019s March 14, 2014 Findings of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b620 Timothy argues that the District Court erred by denying his motion to vacate the court\u2019s March 14, 2014 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment. In the context of this motion, Timothy requested a new trial pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59, \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and M. R. Civ. P. 60. \u201cThe court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all or some of the issues ... after a noryury trial, for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in Montana state court.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 59(1). In cases tried without a jury, \u00a7 25-11-103, MCA, provides: \u201cNo new trial may be granted in cases tried by the court without a jury, except on the grounds mentioned in subsections (1), (3), and (4) of 25-11-102.\u201d The grounds for relief from a final judgment in M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) overlap with M. R. Civ. P. 59 and \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA. Timothy\u2019s requested relief was a new trial; therefore, the analysis is limited to whether Timothy could establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court... or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(3) accident or surprise that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">(4) newly discovered evidence material for the party making the application that the party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Section 25-11-102(1), (3), (4), MCA; <em>Adams v. Dep\u2019t of Highways, </em>230 Mont. 393, 398, 753 P.2d 846, 849 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u00b621 On appeal, Timothy alleges irregularities of the trial court proceedings and multiple abuses of discretion by the District Court; each is discussed in turn below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">\n<em>a. Timothy\u2019s challenge to temporary appointments made by the District Court.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">\u00b622 Timothy\u2019s motion to vacate included challenges to the temporary appointments made by the District Court on January 15, 2014, and February 6, 2014, including the appointment of Ronn Larsen as temporary guardian and conservator. On appeal, Timothy also challenges the temporary appointment of Emerson as visitor. Timothy\u2019s challenges to the temporary appointments are untimely. We have held that the rule on appealable civil orders, M. R. App. P. 6(4)(a), \u201cdoes not differentiate between a permanent guardianship and a temporary guardianship. Thus, a district court order granting either a permanent or a temporary guardianship is appealable.\u201d <em>In re Klos, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>284 Mont. 197, 201, 943 P.2d 1277, 1279 (1997). The orders making the temporary appointments were entered on January 15, 2014, and February 6,2014. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(aXi) requires that Timothy file a notice of appeal of these orders within 30 days for consideration by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b623 Because Timothy\u2019s appeal as to this issue is untimely, we decline to address it. We note, however, that the temporary appointments were superseded by the permanent order of guardianship and conservatorship made on March 14,2014.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\n<em>b. Timothy\u2019s allegations thatAMM. was denied due process in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b624 Timothy argues that A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional and statutory due-process rights were violated. He alleges that A.M.M. had a right to private counsel, challenges the appointment of OPD, alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by the OPD attorney, and Timothy alleges various violations of the guardianship and conservatorship statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AE-\">\u00b625 The District Court held that Timothy does not have standing to assert the rights of his mother, and Timothy is not an attorney who can represent her in court. The District Court further noted that A.M.M. was represented by counsel at all phases of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b626 On appeal, Timothy argues that he has standing to raise due-process claims on behalf of A.M.M. and that he suffered injury to his reputation as \u201cthe loyal and faithful son of A.M.M.\u201d Timothy further asserts that, as a child of A.M.M., he is an interested person pursuant to \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, and is entitled to participate in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b627 \u201cThe question of standing is whether a litigant is entitled to have the court determine the merits of a particular dispute.\u201d <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Beaverhead Water Co., </em>2011 MT 151, \u00b6 27, 361 Mont. 77, 255 P.3d 179. \u201cStanding resolves the issue of whether the litigant is a proper party to seek adjudication of a particular issue, not whether the issue is justiciable.\u201d <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited, </em>\u00b6 27. To establish standing, the complaining party must clearly allege past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and the alleged injury must be distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, but it need not be exclusive to the complaining party. <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited, </em>\u00b627.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u00b628  The District Court ruled that Timothy does not have standing to allege violations of A.M.M.\u2019s due-process rights. We agree. Timothy\u2019s assertion that his reputation was damaged is an allegation of personal injury to himself, and this unsupported assertion does not give him standing to assert the personal rights of his mother, A.M.M. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Timothy is correct that he is an interested person under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, this position does not allow him to assert A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional due-process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b629 The District Court noted that A.M.M. was represented by counsel throughout the proceeding. The District Court was within its discretion to appoint OPD \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to represent an allegedly incapacitated person in a guardianship proceeding. Section 72-5-315(2), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">c. <em>Whether the District erred by not enforcing the notice requirements of\u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, and Unif. Dist. Court R. 10 because Timothy removed his counsel two days before trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b630 Timothy\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cNotice of Removal of Attorneys\u201d on March 3,2014, two days before trial, in which his attorneys stated that they \u201chave been removed from this case.\u201d Timothy argued below and on appeal that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because his right to a fundamentally fair trial was violated when opposing counsel failed to follow the notice procedures for removal of counsel under Unif. Dist. Court R. 10 and \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA. The District Court held that the notice requirements of Unif. Dist. Court R. 10 and \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, were inapplicable because Timothy removed his counsel himself. The District Court also noted that Timothy was not entitled to a third continuance of the trial because Timothy removed his own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b631 When an attorney in an action \u201cis removed, withdraws or ceases to act,\u201d the opposing party must notify the unrepresented party of the following: (1) he/she must appoint another attorney or appear in person, (2) the date of the next trial or hearing in the case, and (3) a statement that failure to act within 21 days may result in a judgment being entered against him/her. Unif. Dist. Court R. 10(a)-(b). This notice fulfills the requirements of \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, which applies if an attorney dies, is removed, is suspended, or ceases to act. Unif. Dist. Court R. 10(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b632 Timothy argues that, upon removal of his attorneys, opposing counsel was required to give him notice under Unif. Dist. Court R. 10(b), and he was entitled to 21 days to find another attorney before trial. Timothy cites <em>Quantum Elec. v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, 314 Mont. 193, 64 P.3d 1026 in support of his assertion. In <em>Quantum, </em>the attorney asked the District Court for leave to withdraw because \u201che had been unable to secure the cooperation of his clients in proceeding with the case.\u201d <em>Quantum, </em>\u00b6 4. The District Court granted the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw and mailed a copy of the order to the attorney\u2019s former client. <em>Quantum, </em>\u00b6 5. We held that the court\u2019s order was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>notice to the unrepresented party under Unif. Dist. Court R. 10 and \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA. <em>Quantum, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b633 Here, the District Court held that <em>In re Marriage of Hardin, </em>2008 MT 154, 343 Mont. 254, 184 P.3d 1012, controls. <em>In Hardin, </em>the petitioner discharged his attorney two weeks before trial, and the District Court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to delay the trial. <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 5. We distinguished <em>Quantum, </em>first noting that the notice of the next proceeding was irrelevant when Hardin \u201cwas literally standing in the middle of it.\u201d <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 17. We further noted that Hardin intentionally removed his counsel, and \u201callowing [Hardin] to delay the proceedings ... would essentially place control over the progress of the proceeding into the hands of [Hardin], rather than the District Court.\u201d <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 18. In fact, the <em>Quantum </em>court acknowledged a common dynamic where an \u201cunrepresented party is characterized as obstructionist and seeking to defeat the judicial process by virtue of simply ignoring its existence.\u201d <em>Quantum, </em>\u00b6 24. We noted in <em>Hardin </em>that \u201c[t]he policy behind the notice requirement of \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, is clearly to ensure that a party, abandoned by counsel in the midst of litigation, is not left hanging \u2018out to dry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 18. We agree with the District Court that Timothy was not left \u201cout to dry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b634 Here, like in <em>Hardin, </em>Timothy removed his counsel himself just before trial. The District Court did not err when it held that the opposing party was not bound to the notice requirements of Unif. Dist. Court R. 10 and \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA. The District Court also did not abuse its discretion by denying Timothy\u2019s request for a third continuance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>d. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by appointing Emerson as visitor and then permanent guardian of A.M.M.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u00b635 Timothy argues that the District Court erred by appointing Emerson as visitor and that it was error to appoint her as permanent guardian of A.M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b636 A district court shall appoint a visitor in a guardianship proceeding, \u00a7 72-3-315, MCA, and it must be a person who is trained either in law, or another profession identified in the statute, and the person must have no personal interest in the proceedings under \u00a7 72-5-313, MCA. A visitor shall interview the petitioners in a guardianship proceeding, interview any person nominated to be guardian, and \u201cvisit the present place of abode of the person alleged to be incapacitated and the place it is proposed that the person will be detained or reside,\u201d and submit a report to the court. Section 72-5-315(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b637 Emerson, a Poison attorney who is unrelated to A.M.M., was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>appointed visitor on February 6, 2014. Emerson filed a detailed and thoughtful report of her home visit to A.M.M. Emerson talked to the petitioners in A.M.M.\u2019s incapacity proceedings, including Timothy and Paul Jr., and she inquired into A.M.M.\u2019s family, health, current living situation, and ability to care for herself, fully meetingthe requirements of \u00a7 72-5-315, MCA. Emerson concluded that A.M.M. does not have the capacity to manage her own medical and financial affairs and that the court should appoint both a guardian and a conservator of A.M.M. \u00b638 Timothy fails to cite any facts to prove that Emerson is unqualified to be a visitor. Furthermore, the time to make any challenge to Emerson\u2019s appointment as visitor under \u00a7 72-5-313, MCA, has passed. This temporary and limited appointment was made on February 6, 2014, meaning Timothy had 30 days to appeal this order under M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(i). <em>See In re Klos, </em>284 Mont. at 201, 943 P.2d at 1279 (holding that temporary appointments in guardianship proceedings are immediately appealable).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b639 Timothy notes that a visitor must interview any person nominated to be guardian under \u00a7 72-5-315, MCA, and therefore he argues that it was error for the District Court to appoint Emerson guardian because Emerson did not interview herself. This argument has no merit. The District Court was well within its discretion to appoint Emerson visitor and later appoint her permanent guardian of A.M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b640 Timothy also claims that the District Court failed to find that guardianship was \u201cnecessaiy,\u201d citing \u00a7 72-5-316(1), MCA (a guardian can be appointed if it \u201cis necessary to meet essential requirements for the person\u2019s physical health or safety\u201d). The District Court conducted a thorough review of this matter, after which it issued a thorough and thoughtfid order, clearly substantiating its decisions. We will not exalt form over substance in such a circumstance by reversing that order because of the absence of the word \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b641 Although an adult child is specifically named as having priority to be named guardian of an incapacitated person under \u00a7 72-5-312(2Xc), MCA, these priorities \u201care not binding, and the court shall select the person ... that is best qualified and willing to serve,\u201d \u00a7 72-5-312(3), MCA. The District Court found that Emerson is qualified, and it was in the best interest of A.M.M. for Emerson to serve as her guardian. \u00b642 Finally, under \u00a7 72-5-312(2)(a), MCA, a person has priority to be appointed guardian \u201cif the court specifically finds that at the time of the nomination the incapacitated person had the capacity to make a reasonably intelligent choice.\u201d The District Court determined that A.M.M. was incapacitated as of December 13, 2013, the date of her psychological evaluation. Therefore, the January 14,2014 affidavit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>A.M.M., expressing a desire to have Timothy control her assets and medical care, was correctly rejected by the District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">e. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by appointing three joint conservators, including a conservator without statutory priority.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b643 Timothy argues that the District Court abused its discretion by appointing three joint conservators, Timothy, Paul Jr., and Wold.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b644 Section 72-5-409(2)(b), MCA, requires that a conservator must be appointed for an incapacitated person if there is \u201ca showing that the \u2018person has property which will be wasted or dissipated\u2019 unless \u2018proper management\u2019 is provided.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Swandal, </em>210 Mont. 167, 171-72, 681 P.2d 701,703 (1984). Here, the District Court specifically found that A.M.M. \u201cis unable to manage her property and affairs effectively for reasons of cognitive impairment and advanced age, and that she has properly that may be wasted or dissipated\u201d without the appointment of a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b645 An adult child of an incapacitated person has statutory priority to be appointed conservator under \u00a7 72-5-410(l)(d),MCA. Therefore, both Timothy and Paul Jr. had equal priority to be appointed conservators of their mother\u2019s estate. Timothy argues that he has higher priority than Paul Jr. because he had support of five of the eight siblings; however, the statute does not contemplate such a ranking system based on support from other potential conservators. The statute contemplates those \u201chaving equal priority\u201d and also states that \u201c[t]he court, for good cause, may pass over a person having priority and appoint a person having less priority or no priority.\u201d Section 72-5-410(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b646 Timothy asserted below and again on appeal that he was personally nominated by A.M.M. For a court to consider a person nominated as a conservator by the protected person, the protected person must have \u201csufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.\u201d Section 72-5-410(l)(b), MCA. The District Court considered A.M.M. to be incapacitated as of at least December 13,2013, the date of the psychological evaluation. The documents on which Timothy relies to demonstrate his nomination by A.M.M. include a durable power of attorney dated December 31,2013, and an affidavit of A.M.M. dated January 14, 2014. We note again that the District Court correctly rejected these documents as evidence of A.M.M.\u2019s wishes because A.M.M. lacked the capacity to contract and nominate her own conservator by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\u00b647 In this case, the District Court appointed two individuals with equal statutory priority \u2014 Timothy and Paul Jr. \u2014 and demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ample good cause to include attorney Wold as a joint conservator. The District Court cited several examples of distrust between the siblings, which included divided support for potential conservators. Because of the distrust, the District Court determined that it was in the best interest of A.M.M. to divide the duties of guardian and conservatorship. The District Court considered Timothy\u2019s current familiarity with A.M.M.\u2019s financial situation, Paul Jr.\u2019s business experience, and that they both live close to A.M.M. All the petitioners agreed that Wold was capable and had the ability to serve as a conservator. The District Court concluded that it was in A.M.M.\u2019s best interest to appoint three joint conservators, and that any financial decisions required a majority vote of the joint conservators.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b648  The distrust among the siblings, and the complexity of the estate at issue, provided good cause to appoint three joint conservators, including a joint conservator without statutory priority under \u00a7 72-5-410(3), MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by appointing three joint conservators to oversee the estate of A.M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"Az0\">\u00b649 After reviewing the issues presented above, we conclude that Timothy fails to demonstrate any procedural irregularities or abuses of discretion which justify the granting of a new trial. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Timothy\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b650 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by striking Timothy\u2019s reply brief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b651 Timothy filed his motion to vacate on April 11, 2014. After requesting an extension of time, Wold filed an answer on May 2,2014. Timothy had 14 days to file and serve his reply brief under Mont. Unif. Dist. Court R. 2(a), plus three additional days under M. R. Civ. P. 6(d) because he mailed his reply brief to complete service. Therefore, Timothy\u2019s reply brief had to be filed and served by May 19,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b652 Timothy filed his reply brief on May 19,2014, and the Certificate of Service attached to the reply brief as per M. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(1) stated that Timothy served his reply brief on Wold on May 19, 2014. Wold moved to strike the reply brief because the postmark on the reply brief was dated May 21,2014, two days after the May 19,2014 deadline for service. The District Court determined Timothy did not timely serve his reply brief as required by Mont. Unif. Dist. Court R. 2(a) and M. R. Civ. P. 6(d) because the reply brief was not served on or before the May 19,2014 deadline. There was certainly a basis for this decision, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion by striking the reply brief for untimely service.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b653 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by limiting the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>powers of the joint conservators and not allowing them to act in AM.M.\u2019s elected corporate roles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b654 At the time that A.M.M. was declared incapacitated, A.M.M., Paul Sr. (her late husband), and Timothy were the only members of the boards of directors for three Montana corporations: DDI, TSI, and Consulting Associates, Inc. A.M.M. and Paul Sr. were the only signatories on the corporate checking accounts for DDI, TSI, and Consulting Associates, Inc. The family has ownership interests in several other corporations, and other siblings hold positions on the boards of directors. The three joint conservators, Timothy, Paul Jr., and Wold could not agree on the extent of their authority as conservators regarding A.M.M.\u2019s position as director of various corporations or her signatory designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b655 On June 12, 2014, Wold petitioned the District Court for a declaratory judgment on the joint conservators\u2019 authority to act on behalf of A.M.M. in her role as a director in several of the corporations. Wold specifically petitioned for a finding that the joint conservators cannot act on behalf of A.M.M. in her elected positions, explaining that neither he nor Paul Jr. were ever elected by the corporations\u2019 shareholders to act on the boards of directors of any of the corporations, nor were they designated as signatories by the boards of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b656 Timothy opposed Wold\u2019s petition for a declaratory judgment regarding the joint conservators\u2019 authority to act on behalf of A.M.M. in her roles as a director and signatory of the corporations. Timothy argued that the conservators\u2019 inability to pay corporate expenses would result in waste of corporate assets. In particular, Timothy noted that the corporations had been unable to pay employees\u2019 wages in a timely manner, resulting in complaints to the Montana Department of Labor and penalties levied against the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b657 Wold responded that conservators can sign checks to spend the personal fiinds of the protected person, but that power does not extend to spending the money of others \u2014 in this case, corporate fimds. Wold suggested as a solution that A.M.M. make a loan to the corporations from her personal accounts to continue business operations, including paying wages, but Timothy did not agree to this course of action. In late March 2014, Timothy held himself out as a signatory for the corporations. Timothy presented checks from the corporations and stated that they needed to be signed. When Wold discovered that Timothy was not a signatory, Wold suggested that the boards of directors of each corporation meet to designate new signatories. However, Wold\u2019s suggestions were met with continual opposition from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Timothy. Timothy refused to hold corporate meetings to designate new signatories for those corporations for which he was now the only competent director. Timothy also challenged the existence of other corporations, and he has challenged A.M.M.\u2019s ownership interest in several corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b658 On August 11, 2014, the District Court granted Wold\u2019s petition and ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">1. The Co-conservators of [A.M.M.], an incapacitated person, are not legally entitled to act in her place as a director of any corporation in which [A.M.M.] was an elected and acting member of the corporation\u2019s board of directors from and after December 13, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">2. The Co-conservators of [A.M.M.], an incapacitated person, are not legally entitled to act in her place as a signatory for any corporation for which [A.M.M.] was a designated signatory on the respective corporation\u2019s bank account or accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b659 On appeal, Timothy argues that the District Court erred by not allowing the joint conservators to act in A.M.M.\u2019s elected corporate roles. Timothy relies upon \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(c), MCA, which states in pertinent part: \u201cA conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the conservator was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation to ... continue or participate in the operation of any business or other enterprise.\u201d Timothy notes that a conservator has many powers in estate administration, including the ability to execute instruments for the fulfillment of a conservator\u2019s duties under \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(y), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b660 Timothy further noted that the District Court is vested with \u201call the powers over [A.M.M.\u2019s] estate and affairs that [she] could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will,\u201d citing \u00a7 72-5-421(3), MCA. We note that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>confer on a conservator at the t\u00edme of appointment or later... any power that the court itself could exercise under 72-5-421(2) and (3).\u201d Section 72-5-430(1), MCA (emphasis added). Timothy makes other arguments to support his position, but they were not properly preserved for appeal. We generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u00b661 Timothy acknowledges that a district court may limit the powers of a conservator. Once a petition for conservatorship is made, the district court has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine how the estate of the protected person that is subject to the laws of this state is managed, expended, or distributed to or for the use of the protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>person or any of the person\u2019s dependents.\u201d Section 72-5-405(2), MCA. \u201cThe court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator conferred by the court.... If the court limits any power conferred on the conservator by 72-5-427, 72-5-428, or 72-5-429, the limitation must be endorsed upon the conservator\u2019s letters of appointment.\u201d Section 72-5-430(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b662  \u201cDistrict courts are vested with broad management powers over a conservatorship, possessing \u2018all the powers over [the person\u2019s] estate and affairs which he could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will.\u2019 Section 72-5-421(3), MCA.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Anderson, </em>2009 MT 344, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 139, 218 P.3d 1220. The plain language of \u00a7 72-5-430(2), MCA, allowed the District Court to limit the power of the conservators. It was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to declare that the conservators could not act in A.M.M.\u2019s elected corporate role as director of any corporation or in her designated role as a signatory for any corporation. If Timothy intended to \u201ccontinue or participate in the operation of any business or other enterprise,\u201d \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(c), MCA, the logical, if not required, step was to follow Wold\u2019s advice for appointment of new signatories for the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b663 <em>4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to Wold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b664 Timothy sirgues that Wold\u2019s attorney fees were not warranted because Wold was not hired as an attorney, but rather was appointed as a joint conservator. However, when a court appoints a conservator with special skills, the court intends for the conservator to use those special skills in administration of the estate. <em>See In re J.R., </em>2011 MT 62, \u00b6 23, 360 Mont. 30, 252 P.3d 163 (\u201cClearly the court believed that [the conservator, an experienced CPA,] had special skills that the court expected him to use in his fiduciary capacity as conservator of J.R.\u2019s estate.\u201d). In this case, the District Court specifically stated that \u201cDouglas J. Wold, Poison attorney, has the integrity and ability to serve as Conservator. The Court takes judicial notice that Mr. Wold is one of the few people in this area that has the ability to timely comprehend and act in such a complex case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b665 Our statutes expressly allow conservators to hire attorneys to assist them in estate administration, including defense or prosecution of actions to protect the estate. Section 72-5-427(3)(w), (x), MCA. Conservatorship proceedings contain specific statutory provisions governing the award of attorney fees and costs. <em>In re J.R., </em>\u00b6 77. \u201cIf not otherwise compensated for services rendered, any visitor, lawyer, physician, conservator, or special conservator appointed in a protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>proceeding is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate.\u201d Section 72-5-432, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b666 It logically follows that an attorney specifically appointed as a conservator, rather than one hired by a conservator, is entitled to reasonable fees for legal work done in administration and/or protection of the estate. The District Court\u2019s March 14, 2014 order stated that \u201cCasey Emerson and Douglas J. Wold shall be compensated at their usual hourly rates, as [A.M.M.]\u2019s assets are sufficient therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b667 In the District Court and on appeal, Timothy makes unsupported contentions that Wold\u2019s fees are inaccurate, unnecessary, and excessive. The District Court conducted a hearing to determine the reasonableness of Wold\u2019s attorney fees, at which Wold presented detailed testimony of his work on the estate. In the July24,2014 order, the Court considered the factors to determine the reasonableness of attorney fees articulated in <em>Swenson v. Janke, </em>274 Mont. 354, 361, 908 P.2d 678, 682-83 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(1) [T]he amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the result secured by the services of the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b668 Applying the factors above, the District Court determined that Wold\u2019s fees were reasonable given Wold\u2019s experience, the complexity of the estate, and the \u201cneed to overcome obstruction and criticism every step of the way\u201d from Timothy. The only exception to the reasonableness of Wold\u2019s fees noted by the District Court was a $1.25 package of Turns charged to Wold\u2019s hotel room while on an estate-related trip to Billings. Notwithstanding that Wold did not object to the disallowance of the Turns purchase, the District Court noted, \u201cBased on the testimony about the difficulty in dealing with Timothy McCann, even the Turns charge may have been case-related.\u201d The District Court\u2019s hearing on August 29,2014, on the second and third petitions for attorney fees came to the same conclusion as the first, and the court awarded Wold his attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b669  The District Court was within its discretion to order payment of Wold\u2019s reasonable attorney fees for the administration and protection of this complex, multi-million-dollar estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b670 <em>5. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by ordering Timothy to personally pay attorney fees to Emerson as part of a Rule 11 sanction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00b671 Timothy argues that Emerson\u2019s attorney fees were not warranted for her work as A.M.M.\u2019s guardian. The District Court ordered Timothy to personally pay Emerson her fees for her preparation for the hearings on Wold\u2019s attorney fees on July 9 and 11,2014, and August 29,2014. Among other unsupported challenges to the District Court\u2019s order, Timothy asserts that it would be a waste for the estate to pay such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b672 Timothy fails to acknowledge that he was ordered to personally pay Emerson\u2019s reasonable fees for hearing preparation because of his breach of his fiduciary duty as a conservator of a protected person, and as part of a sanction under M. R. Civ. P. 11(b). The District Court held that all of Timothy\u2019s filings contesting Wold\u2019s petitions for fees were without merit and \u201cto harass, cause unnecessary delay, and needlessly increase the cost of litigation,\u201d citing M. R. Civ. P. 11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b673 Under Rule 11, when an attorney \u2014 or a pro se litigant \u2014 signs a pleading and submits it to the court, the person certifies that he or she has made an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances that the claims are supported by existing law (or contain a good-faith argument to change existing law), the facts have evidentiary support, and the pleading is not filed for an improper purpose. M. R. Civ. P. ll(a)-(b). We review a district court\u2019s determination that the pleading, motion or other paper violates Rule 11 de novo. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying that conclusion to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. If the district court determines that Rule 11 was violated, then we review the district court\u2019s choice of sanction for abuse of discretion. <em>Davenport v. Odlin, </em>2014 MT 109, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 503, 327 P.3d 478. \u201cA district court retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately with violations of Rule 11 and has discretion to tailor sanctions to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>Davenport, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b674 The District Court noted that Timothy continued to file motions with the cotut pro se even after he retained counsel. On June 26,2014, attorney Wendell B. Dunn filed a notice of appearance as Timothy\u2019s counsel. Timothy, through Dunn, answered Wold\u2019s first petition for fees on June 26, 2014, stating \u201cthere exist issues with these allegations which should be fully addressed in a hearing on this matter.\u201d On July 3,2014, the District Court set a hearing date of July 9,2014 to address Wold\u2019s petition for fees. Timothy also filed a pro se answer to the first petition for fees on July 7,2014. Also on July 7,2014, Timothy, acting through Dunn, objected to the hearing date set by the District Court. Dunn withdrew as Timothy\u2019s counsel on July 14, 2014. None of Timothy\u2019s answers to the fee petitions stated with any specificity why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Wold\u2019s fees were unreasonable or unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b675  The District Court correctly determined that Timothy\u2019s multiple objections to Wold\u2019s petitions for fees violated M. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Not only were these objections without substance in violation of M. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3), they were filed for an improper purpose in violation of M. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1). The District Court did not abuse its discretion by requiring Timothy to personally pay Emerson or Wold for their work preparing for the July and August hearings on the issue of Wold\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b676 <em>6. Whether Timothy can allege violations of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct in this appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b677 Timothy also raises allegations of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct by Wold. Assuming Timothy\u2019s allegations had merit, they are not properly before us. First, Timothy did not raise these issues in the District Court for a determination as to whether the alleged violations resulted in prejudice or adverse impact to him. <em>See Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 35, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002 (\u201c[A] trial court may consider attorney violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct if that misconduct results in prejudice or adversely impacts the rights of the parties in the case pending before it.\u201d). Second, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel is the appropriate forum to raise violations of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct under Rule 1 of the Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. Because Timothy\u2019s allegations of attorney misconduct are not properly before us, we will not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b678 The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Timothy\u2019s motion to vacate, nor did it err in its ruling on any of the issues therein, including Timothy\u2019s lack of standing to assert A.M.M.\u2019s due-process rights or Timothy\u2019s lack of evidence to challenge any of the appointments made by the District Court. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by striking Timothy\u2019s reply brief for untimely service. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it limited the powers of the conservators to act on behalf of A.M.M. in her role as a corporate director or signatory. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by ordering payment of attorney fees to either Wold or Emerson. Finally, this Court is not the proper place to allege violations of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\u00b679 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AXU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b680 I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of all of the issues, including that Timothy is without standing to raise a due process argument on behalf of his mother, wherein he has argued that A.M.M. had a right to private counsel. However, the involvement of the state public defender in a case involving millions of dollars in assets bears mention.</p>\n<p id=\"ATk\">\u00b681 As the District Court correctly noted, appointment of the public defender\u2019s office in a guardianship case is authorized by the Probate Code. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-5-408(2), MCA (\u201cUnless the person to be protected has counsel of the person\u2019s own choice, the court shall order the office of state public defender... to assign counsel to represent the person....\u201d). Correspondingly, the Montana Public Defender Act provides that a court may order the public defender to assign counsel \u201cin cases in which a person is entitled by law to the assistance of counsel at public expense regardless of the person\u2019s financial ability to retain private counsel,\u201d including \u201ca person who is the subject of a petition for the appointment of a guardian or conservator in a proceeding under the provisions of the Uniform Probate Code...\u201d Section 47-l-104(4)(bXvii), MCA. Thus, while it seems unusual for the public defender to be involved in a case like this, the Court correctly concludes that the District Court was authorized to appoint the public defender to represent A.M.M. and had appropriate reason to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b682 It should also be highlighted that one of the stated purposes of the Public Defender Act is to \u201censure that clients of the statewide public defender system pay reasonable costs for services provided by the system based on the clients\u2019 financial ability to pay.\u201d Section 47-1-102(6), MCA. A public defender account has been statutorily created to receive \u201cpayments for the cost of a public defender in proceedings under the provisions of the Uniform Probate Code in Title 72, chapter 5... when the respondent is determined to have the financial ability to pay for a public defender and a judge orders payment....\u201d Section 47-1-110(2)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b683 It is a challenge for the public defender system to perform all of its duties within its allotted resources. In guardianship cases where significant private assets are involved, and the client has the \u201cfinancial ability to pay,\u201d \u00a7 47-l-110(2)(d), MCA, the public defender and the courts should be diligent to ensure that appropriate reimbursement is ordered to the defender system for services provided.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
