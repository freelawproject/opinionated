Decker is a married woman, having a separate estate and transacting business in her own name; that in May, 1871, Jesse Wilson executed and delivered to her his bond for the payment to her of $2000, and that on April 28th, 1874, she and her husband, James, by writing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>their seals, in consideration of $1005.46 to them in hand paid by the plaintiff, assigned said bond to the plaintiff, covenanted with him that said sum of $1005.46 was owing upon it, and guaranteed the payment thereof with interest to him. The suit is against husband and wife for breach of this guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendants demur to the declaration, and insist that it does not set forth the facts necessary to maintain a suit under the <em>\u201c </em>Act to prevent the fraudulent transfer of property, and to facilitate the collection of just claims,\u201d approved March 24th, 1862, <em>(Nix. Dig., p. </em>548,) on which the plaintiff depends, and that that statute refers only to contracts made by a married women alone, and does not embrace contracts of suretyship, to which class, the defendants claim, the present covenant belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The first exposition of this statute was in <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Reuter, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>266, to the effect that it furnished a remedy at law for all such debts or claims as before would have been enforced in equity against the separate estate of a married woman, whether they arose from the purchase of property or the trans\u00e1ction of any other act of business by her. After-wards, it being suggested that such a claim was enforceable in equity, even though it grew out of a contract of naked suretyship on the part of the married woman, without any benefit-resulting therefrom to her estate, it was decided that, if that proposition be true, then the language in Eckert <em>v. </em>Reuter must be limited so as to exclude such a contract,, and to apply only to cases where the wife is beneficially interested, the consideration moving to her. <em>Van Kirk </em>v. <em>Skillman, </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>109.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">But in the subsequent case of <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>8 <em>C. E. Green </em>526, the Court of Appeals determined that, in this state, equity would not enforce a contract of mere suretyship against the separate estate of a married woman, and this, I suppose, vindicated the accuracy of the doctrine of Eckert <em>v. </em>Reuter, by holding that what in Van Kirk <em>v. </em>Skillman had been assumed to be an exception to it, was not one in truth. Perkins <em>v. </em>Elliott also declared that the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>is, of necessity, universal, that in all cases where the act of the <em>feme eovei't </em>inures directly to her own benefit, and she, expressly or by implication, binds her estate, a court of equity will enforce such obligation; and it decided that, even in a contract of suretyship, made by her, though in conjunction with her husband, and mainly for his sake, her separate estate will be bound in equity, provided a valuable consideration moved to her for the benefit of her property, and that without regard to the adequacy of the interest which induced her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">These two cases establish the sufficiency of the present declaration. The wife had and has a separate estate, she sold the bond, which was a part thereof, and, as a term in the contract of sale, she made the covenant sued on with regard to the sure payment of that bond; the object and effect of this covenant were to enhance the market value of her property, and the consideration therefor passed directly to herself, in conjunction with her husband. Such a covenant is enforceable in equity against her, according to Perkins <em>v. </em>Elliott, and, according to Eckert <em>v. </em>Reuter, is therefore also enforceable at law under the statute above cited. .</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
