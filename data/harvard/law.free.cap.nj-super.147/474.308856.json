J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AMT\">The State appeals from a final judgment dismissing the third count of an indictment returned against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In a three-count indictment defendant was charged with (1) bribery, (2) unlawful taking of a fee and (3) misconduct in office. The basis of the indictment was that defendant, as clerk of the Criminal Division of the Hudson County District Court, accepted $100 to reduce a charge pending in that court against one Cairns for operating an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:A-50(a)) to one of operating the vehicle while impaired <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50(b)), and that he unlawfully altered the original summons issued to Cairns to allege a violation of the lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Following a 17-day trial the jury acquitted defendant on the first and second counts of the indictment. However, it was unable to reach a verdict on the third count and a mistrial was declared as to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Thereafter, defendant moved for a dismissal of the third count. Following a hearing the trial judge, in a written opinion, dismissed that count on the grounds of collateral estoppel and an appropriate judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">We reverse. It is our opinion that collateral estoppel does not preclude defendant\u2019s retrial on the third count of the indictment. <em>State v. Roller, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>339 (1959). Here the State was not engaging in unfair <em>plural </em>attempts to convict defendant for a single offense. Rather, following the discharge of the jury by reason of the fact that it could not agree upon a verdict as to one count of a multiple-count indictment, the State was merely seeking to obtain a determination in the <em>same trial </em>on the charge preferred under that count. Thus, the acquittal under the first two counts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>nowise bars the continuance of the trial on the third count of the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 349-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Defendant\u2019s contention that <em>State v. Roller </em>is not applicable because the dismissal of the pertinent indictment therein was by the trial judge and not by jury resolution, is without merit. The court in <em>Roller </em>notes and adopts the trial judge\u2019s view that the dismissal was \u201cequivalent to a judgment of acquittal\u201d (at 343).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>State v. </em>Cormier, 46 <em>N. J. </em>494 (1966), upon which defendant relies, is inapposite. That case involved a subsequent trial upon a second indictment charging a substantive offense following a trial resulting in an acquittal upon a separate indictment which solely charged a conspiracy to commit the same offense. Thus, therein there were two separate trials upon two distinct indictments. Here, as above noted, there was but one trial upon a multiple-count indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Finally, defendant cites <em>Cosgrove v. United </em>States, 224 <em>F. </em>2d 146 (9th Cir. 1955); <em>United States v. </em>Flowers, 255 <em>F. Supp. </em>485 (E. D. N. C. 1966), and <em>Oliver v. Superior </em>Court, 92 <em>Cal. App. </em>94, 267 <em>P. </em>764 (Dist. Ct. App. 1938), which hold contrary to our determination herein. We do not consider these cases binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Accordingly, the dismissal of the third count of the indictment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for a plenary trial thereon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
