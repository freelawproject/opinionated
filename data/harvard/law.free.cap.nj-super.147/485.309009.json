In December 1974, in conformance with existing regulations, appellant\u2019s son who resided at home was declared ineligible for benefits because he had reached his majority and was not at school. See Division of Public Welfare, Manual of Administration, \u00a7 2370-2372 (March 1974), codified as <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10:81-28.1 (a). Those regulations, promulgated in response to the decision in <em>Hausman v. Dept. of Inst. and Agencies, </em>124 <em>N. J. Super. </em>139 (App. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d 64 <em>N. J. </em>202 (1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 417 <em>U. S. </em>955, 94 S. Ct. 3083, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 674 (1974), established a rebuttable presumption that a noneligible person such as the 18-year-old Walker son was contributing his share to household expenses and reduced financial assistance to the remaining eligible unit accordingly. The burden was placed upon the welfare receipient disputing the reduction to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that the noneligible household member \u201cdoes not and cannot contribute his share of the household expenses.\u201d In April 1975, in accordance with Hausman, supra, the above regulations were again revised to place upon the recipient the sole burden of proving that the noneligible member was not contributing to household expenses, regardless of financial capacity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Public Assistance Manual (PAM) \u00a7\u00a7 3290-3293,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> codified as <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10:81-3.15. Section 3291 of those regulations provided a mechanism for informing welfare recipients of the reason for intended reductions and of their burden of proof were the matter to be contested, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">An explanation of the method for determining the non-eligible person\u2019s share of household expenses (as described below) will be provided to the client. Should the client contend that the non-eligible person (other than a stepparent) does not contribute his/her share of household expenses, the client shall be given the opportunity of providing evidence to substantiate such claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">These regulations remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In October 1975 appellant was notified that her welfare benefits would be reduced to compensate for certain over payments. Appellant promptly requested a fair hearing to determine whether her household size had been correctly computed during the period between December 1974 and October 1975 and to determine the status of her former benefits. That hearing was held on December 3, 1975. At the hearing appellant argued in part that the county welfare board erred in failing to recognize that appellant\u2019s noneligible son was a noncontributing household member from December 1974 to August 1975 and that the error had resulted in compensable underpayment. See PAM \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>3290-3293, Assistance Standards Handbook (ASH) \u00a7 241. The error was caused, appellant argued, by the failure of the welfare board to explain provisions of the welfare manual to her regarding the procedures by which a noneligible household member is judged to be contributing or noncontributing. As a result she \u201cdid not have the opportunity or the information required to insure that she was receiving the amount of assistance to which she was entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The hearing officer rejected this contention, finding that appellant was bound by the 1974 regulations in force when her payments were cut. Consequently, she had the burden of proving that her son was a noncontributing household member and the agency had no obligation to inform appellant of relevant regulations imposing this burden. These findings were adopted in a decision denying reimbursement issued on February 25, 1976. We find this decision to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"> There is no longer any question but that a court decides an appeal with reference to the state of the law at the time of resolution of the appeal. <em>S &amp; L Associates, Inc. v. Washington Tp., </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>224 (1961); <em>Cranberry Lake Quarry Co. v. Johnson, </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>495, 516 (App. Div. 1967), certif. den. 50 <em>N. J. </em>300 (1967). No sufficient reason has been advanced to absolve administrative bodies, exercising qwctsi-judicial functions, from similarly deciding appeals in the context of the law as it exists at the time the administrative appeal is decided. At any rate, this court is bound to apply such law. Appellant\u2019s fair hearing was conducted seven months after the promulgation of PAM \u00a7 3291. Therefore, we conclude that the Division of Public Welfare was in error in declining to apply that regulation to appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Accordingly, the matter is remanded to the Division of Public Welfare in order to afford appellant an opportunity to prove that her noneligible son was a noneontributing household member during the months in question and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>after if proof is given, to proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in ASH \u00a7 241. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Whether tbe regulations as amended now meet tbe <em>Hausmam. </em>command that only actually contributing noneligibles be included in tbe household count is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Effective April 15, 1975 the Manual of Administration was replaced by the Public Assistance Manual. See 7 <em>N. J. R. </em>105 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
