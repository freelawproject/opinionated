A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AHy\">Plaintiff, owner of the nine-family apartment building at 433 William Street in East Orange, appeals from the dismissal of its complaint which sought possession of an apartment occupied by defendant in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The facts may be briefly summarized. In November 1973 the parties entered into an oral month-to-month tenancy and defendant-tenant paid to plaintiff-landlord a security deposit of $220. Plaintiff failed to comply with the 1973 amendment to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, in aceord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>anee with the provisions of that statute, defendant notified plaintiff that the security-money was to be applied on account of the January 1975 rent for the apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, plaintiff served defendant with a notice that on March 1, 1975 she (defendant) was to quit and vacate the apartment which she occupied, but that if she remained in possession after that date, she would be required to pay to plaintiff a security deposit in the amount of $367.50. Defendant was thereafter served with another notice, this one dated April 14, 1975, that she was to quit and vacate the premises on June 1, 1975 and that her \u201cpresent tenancy\u201d was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">* * * terminated because you have failed to pay to landlord, security deposit in the amount of $367.50 after you were served with a valid notice to quit, with a reasonable change in the terms of your tenancy \u2014 that being the payment of security deposit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The trial judge held that the landlord\u2019s demand for the further security deposit was unreasonable and unwarranted. We agree. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-61.1, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As pointed out by this court in <em>Saracino v. Capital Properties Associates, Inc., </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>81 (App. Div. 1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">Although the authorities are in- disagreement over the nature of a month-to-month tenancy, see 51 <em>C. J. S. Landlord and Tenant </em>\u00a7 145, <em>pp. </em>746-747; 2 <em>Harper and James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 27.16, <em>p. </em>1507, <em>n. </em>6; 1 <em>American Law of Real Property </em>(1952), \u00a7 3.23, <em>p. </em>221 <em>et seq., </em>New Jersey follows the view that such a tenancy is a continuing one and not a new relationship for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>month. <em>Barwick v. Gendel Realty Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 9 (App. Div. 1950); cf. <em>Jador Service Co. v. Werbel, </em>140 N. <em>J. Eq. </em>188 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947). * * * [at 87]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">See also, <em>Stamboulos v. McKee, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>567, 570 (App. Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Plaintiff urges that we east aside this judicial approach to a month-to-month tenancy in this case in favor of a \u201crule\u201d which would provide \u201cthat a month-to-month tenancy expires at the end of each month and is renewed on the first day of the succeeding month.\u201d We discern no compelling reason for doing so. The above quoted view, expressed in <em>Saracino </em>and reiterated in <em>Stamboulos, </em>is eminently sound. Furthermore, the 1973 amendment to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> specifically provides in circumstances such as are here present that after notifying the landlord that the \u201csecurity money be applied on account of rent payment * * * due or to become due from the tenant, * * * thereafter the tenant shall be without obligation to make any further security deposit during the term of his lease and the person receiving the money so deposited [the landlord] shall not be entitled to make further demand for a security deposit.\u201d We are satisfied that the term \u201clease\u201d as used in the statute is intended to cover both written and parol leases, in short, \u201c[a]ny agreement which gives rise to [a] relationship of landlord and tenant.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(rev. 4 ed. 1968), at 1035, 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> Beyond this, \u201cgood cause\u201d for eviction under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-61.1 has not been shown. See also <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.10(a) and (d). The dissent questions the \u201cfairness\u201d of our reference to this latter statute, stating, in part: \u201cThis is the \u2018Reprisal\u2019 Act, and the question of whether this action was taken by the landlord as a form of reprisal was never even suggested in the county district court, by the court or by defendant, who was represented by counsel.\u201d Our col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>league overlooks several things. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.10 <em>et </em>seq., <em>L. </em>1970, c. 210, clearly affects the rights and duties of the landlord and tenant in this case. That Act by its terms applies \u201cto all rental premises or units used for dwelling purposes except owner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.13. We note specifically the following pertinent provisions of the 1970 legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">1. No landlord of premises or units to which this act is applicable shall serve a notice to quit upon any tenant or institute any action against a tenant to recover possession of premises, whether by summary dispossess proceedings, civil action for the possession of land, or otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">a. As a reprisal for the tenant\u2019s efforts to secure or enforce any rights under the lease or contract, or under the laws of the State of New Jersey or its governmental subdivisons, or of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">* sh</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">d. On account of the tenant\u2019s failure or refusal to comply with the terms of the tenancy as altered by the landlord, if the landlord shall have altered substantially the terms of the tenancy as a reprisal for any actions of the tenant set forth in subsection a, b, and c of section 1 of this act. Substantial alteration shall include the refusal to renew a lease or to continue a tenancy of the tenant without cause. [N. <em>J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.10 (a) and (d)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">* =r *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">3.

J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.12]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Appellant landlord clearly understands the basis for the decision of the trial judge. In the brief submitted on its behalf on this appeal, counsel points out, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">The Court below recognized that a month-to-month residential tenancy can be terminated provided that good cause exists and can be proven (T 10. 7-14). However, it held that in view of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ticular factual situation and the security deposit law, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19, plaintiff-landlord\u2019s demand for a security deposit was unreasonable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (T. 7.11-22). Consequently, it ruled that the tenancy was not terminated (T 9.22-25).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Whether the trial judge used the word \u201creprisal\u201d or not is of no consequence. He was not functioning in a vacuum. He knew, as did both parties, that the landlord\u2019s demand for the further security deposit followed swiftly at the heels of the tenant\u2019s notice to the landlord to apply her $220 security deposit on account of the January 1975 rent for the apartment. Counsel for the landlord, reciting to the trial judge \u201cthe facts which we stipulate,\u201d included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Mil. COHN: The tenant paid a security deposit of $220.00 when she \u2014 In November of 1973. The tenant sent a notice to the landlord subsequent to that time, saying that the landlord had not complied with the security deposit law, and this security deposit was applied to rent for January, 1975, and that pursuant to the statute in accordance with the allegation of the tenant, and in addition, the tenant paid $25.00 to the landlord in January of 1975, thus paying her rent at that time. There were no further actions by the landlord or the tenant with respect to the tenancy until the service of the two (2) notices which have been marked in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The landlord here was prohibited from serving upon the tenant the notices to quit, and from instituting this action for possession, by reason of the tenant\u2019s failure (or refusal) to comply with the terms of the tenancy, altered by the landlord as a reprisal for the tenant\u2019s efforts to enforce her rights under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-2-10.10 (a) and (d). The rebuttable presumption that such notices to quit and alteration of the terms of the tenancy without cause constituted a reprisal, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.12 (d), was clearly not overcome by the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Beyond this, if the landlord were permitted to immediately make a new demand for a security deposit after the tenant had pursued her remedy under the 1973 amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19 with respect to the old security deposit, the sanction provided by that statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would be meaningless. In the circumstances, the trial judge properly concluded that \u201c[i]n the face of\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19, the requirement that the tenant pay a security deposit of $367.50 if she were to remain in possession of the apartment, was \u201cunconscionable and unreasonable.\u201d The complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-12\"><em>L. </em>1973, c. 195, \u00a7 1, the amendment reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">In the event the person receiving a security deposit fails to notify the tenant of the name and address of the hanking institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tion or savings and loan association in which the deposit of such security is made, and the amount thereof, within 30 days after receipt of same from the tenant, the tenant may give written notice to the person receiving the same that such security money be applied on account of rent payment or payments due or to become due from the tenant, and thereafter the tenant shall be without obligation to make any further security deposit during the term of his lease and the person receiving the money so deposited shall not be entitled to make further demand for a security deposit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-13\">Defendant also paid an additional $25 to supplement the deposit, since the monthly rent at the time was $245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">See n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Tke trial judge found that the landlord\u2019s demand for the security deposit was \u201cunconscionable and unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * thereafter the tenant shall be without obligation to make any further security deposit during the term of his lease <em>and the person receiving the money so deposited shall not he entitled to make further demand for a security deposit.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b324-5\">Antell, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AbF\">(dissenting). The statute under which the tenant was permitted to apply the security deposit against rent, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-19, relieves the tenant thereafter from making any further deposit \u201cduring the term of his lease.\u201d Its clear implication is that at the expiration of \u201cthe term\u201d the landlord may demand and receive the \u201cfurther security deposit\u201d as part of a new letting.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">I agree that by using the word \u201clease\u201d the Legislature did not intend that tenants\u2019 rights should be determined by whether they held under a written or parol lease, or to distinguish between those who held for a fixed term and others who held for an indefinite term. But neither did it intend to discriminate between landlords on this basis either. My disagreement with the majority stems from its treatment of a month-to-month tenancy as one which cannot be terminated and therefore one under which a landlord is permanently foreclosed from taking a further deposit. As I have said, there is no reason for the Legislature to have placed such landlords in a different position that those are in who rent for a fixed term.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">While a month-to-month tenancy is continued merely by the tenant remaining in possession and paying rent, <em>Barwick </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>v. Gendel Realty </em>Co., 11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 9 (App. Div. 1950), <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-10, the relationship may be terminated at any time by either party giving one month\u2019s notice, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-53; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-56, subject, of course, to <em>N. J. S. A. 2A</em>:18-61.1. This is fundamental, and is even recognized in the decisions cited by the majority to support the proposition that a month-to-month tenancy is a \u201ccontinuing one.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Thus, where the landlord gave a proper notice to quit and demand for possession at the end of the month, unless the tenant paid an increased rental commencing the beginning of the following month, the holding over of the tenant created a new tenancy at the increased rental. <em>[Stamboulos v. McKee, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>567, 571 (App. Div. 1971).]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The cases relied upon by the majority are inapplicable to the issue before us in any event. Except for <em>Jador Service Co. v. </em>Werbel, 140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>188 (E. &amp; A. 1947), they deal only with the question of whether obligations of repair and maintenance expressly assumed by a landlord during an earlier rental period of a month-to-month tenancy are viable in a later period when the tenant sustains a personal injury attributed to the landlord\u2019s negligence. It was in this context that the relationship was said to be a \u201ccontinuing one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">I discern no sound reason why plaintiff is not entitled to receive its further security deposit. The purpose of this provision is to compel landlords to comply with the law, and it would appear that this has been accomplished. The tenant has had the use of the security money during this interval, and the landlord has been deprived of its availability. In my view, \u201cgood cause\u201d for eviction has been shown within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-61.1. Surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the requirement that security moneys be deposited is a \u201creasonable change [s] of substance\u201d under subsection (i) thereof: the amount demanded is nothing more than what is specifically allowed to the landlord under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:8-21.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Unfortunately, it is only by this eviction action that this landlord can end \u201cthe term\u201d of the lease and thereby put itself in the same position as a landlord at the expiration of a fixed term under the statute. Obviously, it is not interested in recovering possession of the apartment, but only in obtaining performance by the tenant of this new condition of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The purpose of the majority\u2019s reference to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42-10.10 (a) and (d) is unclear. This is the \u201cReprisal\u201d Act, and the question' of whether this action was taken' by the landlord as a form of reprisal was never even suggested in the county district court, by the court or by defendant, who was represented by counsel. The finding of the trial judge that the demand for security was \u201cunconscionable and unreasonable\u201d was made in a completely unrelated setting. The judge had expressed the opinion that \u201ca landlord does not need to have a security deposit.\u201d Counsel replied that unless it was found that the landlord\u2019s proposed change in terms and condition was unreasonable under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:18-61.1(i), the landlord was entitled to terminate the tenancy and invite a new one upon the changed conditions. It was then that the court, in deference to counsel\u2019s argument, made its finding that the demand for security was \u201cunconscionable and unreasonable.\u201d It never intimated that the demand was made or the suit was brought as a reprisal. In fact, the court expressly noted, \u201cWell, I sfippose there\u2019s no other way you can do it except to sue for holdover for not paying the security deposit, or for not complying with the rules.\u201d The reference clearly was to the fact that this was the only way open to plaintiff to establish its legal right and reflected the court\u2019s understanding that the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was not brought to retaliate against the tenant for exercising her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">I think it inconsistent with acceptable standards of fairness to rationalize this result in terms of the \u201cReprisal\u201d Act in a case such as this where the action of the landlord is so clearly not a reprisal and where, in any event, it has had no opportunity to create a record on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">I am not unmindful that on the previous page <em>McKee </em>held that the tenancy is not \u201cterminated merely by the giving of the notice.\u201d However, the court was addressing itself to the crucial issue there presented which was whether the tenancy terminated upon the <em>giving </em>of the notice or upon its effective date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
