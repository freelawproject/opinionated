The judge of compensation found appellant to he an independent contractor and denied compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The facts are undisputed. Appellant has been a New Jersey licensed basketball official for about 20 years. He is regularly employed as a fireman in the Irvington, New Jersey, Eire Department. He normally officiates at 25 to 30 basketball games a year for various schools. In 1975, he had been engaged to officiate at two games for respondent at the rate of $15 a game. Admittedly, respondent exercised no control over appellant while the game was in progress. On February 15, 1975, while officiating a game being played at respondent\u2019s school, he was accidentally struck in the mouth and sustained an injury to his teeth. His worker\u2019s compensation claim was for his dental injury only \u2014 he made no claim for temporary or permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Eegardless of whether we use the \u201cright to control\u201d test or the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test, we are in accord with the views of the judge of compensation that appellant was an independent contractor and not entitled to worker\u2019s compensation. We consider appellant\u2019s basketball officiating as a separate calling or enterprise which should be shouldered with carrying its own accident burden. His separate calling is not an integral part of respondent\u2019s regular function as a school board. At best, it is insignificantly collateral to one of its functions, and its hiring of appellant was for the completion of a particular game. In short, appellant furnishes a professional service for various schools which, in our view, removes him from the category of an employee as envisioned under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See 1A Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>(1973), \u00a7\u00a743.00-45.32(d) at 8-1 to 8-127, for a full discussion of various phases of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
