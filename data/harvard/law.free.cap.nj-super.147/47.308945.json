BRADFORD MOORE, DEFENDANT-RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b71-6\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b71-7\">Argued January 11, 1977</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AX\">Decided January 31, 1977.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b73-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Before Judges Lora, Crane and Michels.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-8\"><em>Mr. Joseph P.

J. S. </em>A. 2A:94-1. He was also charged with the larceny of goods of the value of less than $200, in violation of <em>N. J. S. </em>A. 2A:170-30.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">After the trial before a jury began, the prosecutor learned for the first time that a conversation had taken place between the owner of the business and defendant at police headquarters. The prosecutor represented that in the conversation the owner asked defendant, an employee of the business, \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d to which defendant replied, \u201cI was stupid.\u201d Hpon learning of the conversation, the prosecutor immediately informed defense counsel and the judge of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>contents. Before calling the owner, Samnel Cohen, to the stand, the prosecutor made an offer of proof of the conversation. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement on the ground that it was not furnished in discovery. The judge sustained the objection and stated that the statement would not be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">No mention of the inculpatory statement was elicited from Cohen during his direct examination or cross-examination. However, during recross examination the following exchange took. place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Q. Mr. Cohen, you didn\u2019t observe Mr. Moore there at any time on the occasion of the break, did you? I mean while it was in progress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">A. I came there after the place had been broken into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Q. Right, okay. You don\u2019t know if Mr. Moore was there or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">A. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">Q. You don\u2019t know if Mr. Moore was there illegally or not do you? You\u2019re not telling us that he was there illegally \u2018eause you don\u2019t know? Do you understand the question, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">A. Well I can volunteer something that occurred afterwards but I don\u2019t think I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">THE COURT: The jury will completely disregard that statement by Mr. Cohen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">Mr. Cohen, if you don\u2019t understand the question just say so. If you can\u2019t answer it say you can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question please \u2014 I did not observe Mr. Moore during the time of the break-in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">The jury was then excused and after hearing the argument of counsel the judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. He further ordered that the State would be. precluded from having Mr. Cohen testify to the statement allegedly made by the defendant to him. The judge then proceeded to excoriate Cohen for what he characterized as the equivalent of a contempt of court. - A formal order was subsequently entered excluding the oral statement of the defendant upon a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">Our review of the transcript of testimony persuades .us that there was no dereliction on the part- of the prosecutor. \u2022 The revelation of the prosecutor to defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>counsel and the judge of the newly learned admission of defendant was an appropriate exercise of the prosecutor\u2019s continuing responsibility of disclosure under <em>R. </em>3:13-3(f). Since no issue was raised as to whether appropriate warnings had been given and no contention was raised as to its voluntary nature, the utterance of defendant, \u201cI was stupid,\u201d was admissible as a statement inconsistent with innocence and indicating a consciousness of guilt. <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>395, 413 (1976); <em>Evid. R. </em>63(7). Generally speaking, trials should be conducted in a manner which seeks to ascertain the truth, not as an exercise in gamesmanship. <em>State v. Laganella, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268, 281 (App. Div. 1976). See <em>Evid. R. </em>5. All relevant evidence should generally be admitted. <em>Evid. R. </em>7(f). Exclusion of the testimony on the ground that the discovery rights of defendant were violated was not warranted. Mindful of the general policy of admissibility, the judge should have availed himself of other means of protecting defendant from surprise. Ample protection of defendant\u2019s interest could have been achieved by according defense counsel an opportunity to interview the complaining witness, by granting a brief continuance, or by some other procedure which would have permitted defense counsel to prepare to meet the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"> However, even if we were to assume that the judge\u2019s ruling foreclosing admission of defendant\u2019s declaration was an appropriate exercise of discretion under <em>B. </em>3:13-3(f), we are not persuaded that the granting of defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was proper. Such an extraordinary remedy should not be exercised except to prevent an obvious failure of justice. <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>345, 351 (App. Div. 1973), certif. den. 63 <em>N. J. </em>325 (1953); <em>State v. Provoid, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>547, 558 (App. Div. 1970); <em>State v. Neff, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>213, 226 (App. Div. 1961). The statement of the witness that he could volunteer something that occurred afterwards, but didn\u2019t think that he could, was provoked by defense counsel\u2019s continuing probing xecross examination which transgressed the hounds of necessity. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>v. Metalski, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>543, 546 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A. 1936); <em>Power-Matics, Inc. v. </em>Ligotti, 79 <em>N. J. Super. </em>294, 301 (App. Div. 1963). We do not regard the statement of the witness as being contemptuous in any sense. Uor do we think that it was appropriate for the court to have censured the witness. See <em>State v. Zwillman, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 21 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>603 (1971); <em>State v. Guido, </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>191 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Nevertheless, having granted a mistrial, the judge should not have prohibited the introduction of defendant\u2019s admission at a later trial. The ruling of the trial judge on the admissibility of the admission did not become the \u201claw of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>407 (App. Div. 1974). There is no reason to suppose that at a second trial defense counsel would not have had an adequate opportunity to learn all he needed to know about defendant\u2019s purported admission. The exclusionary order was an unwarranted involvement on the part of the judge in matters primarily relating to the trial strategy of counsel. <em>Cf. State v. Pratts, </em>71 <em>N. J. </em>399 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The order excluding the oral statement of defendant is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
